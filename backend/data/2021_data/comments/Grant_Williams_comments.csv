"I didn't enjoy them lol. They had the wrong impression about Grant Williams for a bit, talking about whether you play him at 3 or the 4 and just not understanding his physical profile at all. This also might be too high a bar, but at no point did either of them say anything incisive or original or particularly funny.   Obviously all that adds up to something better than some, but still not enjoyable."
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
Grant Williams is Jared Sullinger but good
Shout out to Grant Williams!
It's hard to see Bos as a legit contender when they have to play Grant Williams and Theis this much
Damn did grant williams get attacked by a freaking lion? What the hell is that scratch from?
Grant Williams was apparently mauled by a Tiger.
Grant Williams gets no respect man
Grant Williams in shambles lol
grant williams is a really good basketball player
look at grant Williams go
we got grant williams hitting stepback 3s now
Grant Williams out of nowhere tonight.
I can say I have never seen Grant Williams do that.
curry driving and scoring on grant williams is charlotte on charlotte crime
"As a Celtics fan, Tatum spends too much time with his hands up asking for a call. With that being said, it doesn't tend to affect his body language / energy throughout the game and he's not an advanced foul baiter like some. Grant Williams and Daniel Theis are frequent ref-talkers as well, but that's less because they're whiners and more because they're recipients of some of the worst whistles in the league."
"Jeff Teague, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson"
Grant Williams will probably be better at 30 than Tisse.
"Last year in my team sub, people were trying to justify Celts swapping him to a conf rival for Grant Williams and 5’10” dude"
"They got Romeo Langford who has a significantly higher upside than Brandon Clarke. And trading out of pick 20 got them Williams and Edwards; so far Clarke is better, but he's 24, has taken a step back this year and we'll see how Grant+Edwards develop. Too early to get overly excited about anyone in the second round last year.  We're still looking at 500-1000 minutes of their entire career across two really bizarre seasons so far for most of these guys."
Grant Williams and the Celtics pick this year. Can we dump TT as well?
Celtics fans has Grant Williams fallen out of the rotation? I remember he played well in the playoffs
"there are some draymond esque young guys in the league tho, grant williams in boston rly reminds me of him but lacks the passing awareness"
"Grant Williams : ""The Geek Freak"""
When Grant Williams missed both free throws after we intentionally fouled him at the end of game 7...and then the Celtics rebounded the miss.
"Porter fits into the TPE, we just need to send out enough salary to get under the apron. Our TPE is for 28.5M and Porter Jr. makes $28.4M. For all we need to do is send out a little more that $6M to make a trade work.   Thad does fit a hole. He's one of the best Giannis defenders in the entire league and is a capable 4/small ball 5. He's a good high post passer which is something we were missing against Miami's zone last season, and a good switchable defender. He's not a great floor spacer, but he can knock down shots. He's a smart cutter, positional defender, and probably has better touch around the basket than anyone on the team. Essentially he's a fully developed Grant Williams.   He's not the biggest upgrade, but in terms of lower cost moves compensation wise he'd be one of the better ones. People love Aaron Gordon for us, but Thad is cheaper and is relatively comparable for the role we'd have for both."
To be fair Grant Williams is an absolute bum. That dude is one of the worst starters I've ever soon on a good team
It was Grant Williams
"And this is probably our biggest improvement over last season.   Brown used to need other guys on the floor to at least create some space. Tatum was our only guy who could carry the bench. Otherwise, he'd get trapped and turn the ball over.  Now he's scoring +25 a night while sharing the court with Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and two centers on the floor.  I didn't really agree with Boston focusing purely on shooters in the draft, but watching what the Jays are doing without any spacing makes it clear.   These two with a Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Buddy Hield, JJ Redick, etc would be absolutely unreal."
Grant Williams is cheeks as hell no way this dude makes a playoff rotation
Is Grant Williams an idiot? Why was he trying to post up like he's Embiid when it clearly wasn't working?
Is that like 3 fouls for Grant Williams in 3 minutes
"&gt;No worries, its an awesome nickname and i love the fact that some people call Grant Williams ”Spacelord” (his mom works for NASA I believe and Grant is super smart too)  Which reminds me, why didn't they just name him Starlord?"
I’d argue the Grant Williams pick last year fit that description as well
"No worries, its an awesome nickname and i love the fact that some people call Grant Williams ”Spacelord” (his mom works for NASA I believe and Grant is super smart too)"
"Fuck Grayson Allen, haven’t liked that guy since he was at Duke. What really pushed it over the edge is what he pulled at Summer League attacking Grant Williams for setting a clean back screen. Trying to injure a guy for playing basketball. Scum."
"I think that Grant Williams was actually a massive success of a pick. He's playing very well and has a positive plus minus with the team having a higher Net rating whenever he hits the court. On the topic of Nesmith, Semi Ojeleye said that Nesmith was ""a straight shooter, you guys will see soon."" on his stream yesterday so clearly he's showing something in practice that we haven't yet seen in game. I'm still super hopeful on him."
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
But what assets is Orlando getting back? Pritchard? Grant Williams? Idk if the assets are there for Boston
Yeah Celtics could absorb him into their TPE and would only have to send like a filler player (Grant Williams maybe?) and some picks. The problem is how many picks would it take and how may are the Celtics would be willing to part? He has 2 more years after this year at a declining salary and is playing like a top 20-25 guy the past 3 years so it might cost more picks than Jrue netted.
"Yeah, he lead Butler out of nowhere to back-to-back NCAA championship appearances. Just an off day. And we started Grant Williams at the 4, he just didn’t do all that well."
"He had flashes, and he always got his boards, but I think you're overrating his effectiveness with us otherwise. He got DNP's in over a quarter of our playoff games. Would have been even more if he didn't need to play spot minutes for Theis when he got in foul trouble. We were at the point where Kanter was perfectly healthy, and he was still losing his spot in the rotation to Grant Williams, all so we could play small ball with an undersized rookie. That wouldn't have happened if Kanter hadn't been borderline unplayable."
"our teams were the #2 and #4 defenses in the league, so any player that was exploitable as a weak defender was *gonna* be targeted.   something I still remember about that series was that I think we were getting absolutely massacred in the few minutes Nurse put OG at the 5, because Tatum couldn't matchup hunt ***anyone*** against that lineup.   also, the (in?)famous FVV missed stepback 3 final possession was a pretty regular call to make on a final possession, letting a player ISO on a mismatch instead of running any convoluted action so you have a 0% chance at a turnover, but Brad put Grant Williams out there at the 5 because he fares better switched onto Lowry/FVV, lo and behold Nurse just calls them to screen the center onto the 1-guard and Grant's able to contest Fred without getting blown by.  very grating series because the defenses were really having their way with the offenses by the end of it"
"If anything they're a little too deep (never a problem that lasts). Thompson, Theis, and Rob Williams all deserve minutes, which results in more two big lineups than would be ideal. And it means Grant Williams gets very little time as a small ball five, where he excelled last year."
Kemba+Langford+grant Williams and rob Williams+ picks? Idk I’m pulling this out of my ass
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"Robert Williams is playing 16 minutes a game on a team with Thompson and Theis and when he is on the court the team has its second highest net rating. Wanna know who’s number one? Semi Ojeleye with a +28.3 net rating, who by the way just scored 18 about 2 hours ago on efficient shooting. Grant Williams literally started and played his role well. Nesmith is a developing young player who is still figuring out defensive rotations. These guys are all playing very important roles on the #1 seed in the east. Why do you try so hard to discredit players who worked hard to get where they are? These guys put blood sweat and tears into improving on their games year in and year out yet their success is a joke to you. I don’t understand how you can be so arrogant while blatantly disregarding the known truth. I’ll say it again.   *Delete this nephew*"
"oh look it's Ainge's burner account...Robert Williams 'per 36'......he can't stay on the court, so who cares?  Semi is 'incredible'......Grant Williams can play dominant defense.....why has Nesmith only played 15 minutes....."
side note grant Williams walking looks like me when I need to take a shit
"he looks pretty agile for a big moving around honestly, i don't see why he can't be a real rotation piece   idk about for the celtics when they're healthy.. cause theis, tristan, timelord, grant williams.. it's a lot.. but i could easily see him being a 18 mpg type player for a team"
"People underestimate Grant Williams because he comes to lane weak, like yeah he’s not gonna beat Darius if you leave him on an island up there, but the health scaling on all his abilities and especially the cooldown on the stun just makes it so easy to outscale your lane and turn enemy carries’ midgame positioning mistakes into a win."
Grant Williams and Tillman really worth mentioning?
"Why?    Nuggets were more talented and a terrible matchup for the Clippers.    Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Grant&gt;&gt;Kawhi/PG/Nobody     The lesson of that series isn't that talent doesn't matter, it's that a lot of people were stupid for thinking Trez/Lou Williams/Bev were elite playoffs caliber players."
"They really do, but I'll be the first to admit that I've never been impressed with Romeo at all and I watched him at IU.  He's been banged up ever since he's been in the NBA and he has a broken shot form. Boston fans will tell you he's a plus defender but Boston's entire bench is 1-way defensive players (Langford, Grant Williams, Ojelye) and their offense tanks when either Tatum or Brown aren't in the rotation.  Hindsight's 20/20, but if they have their star wings already drafted they should've went for some high-floor, low-ceiling complimentary options in the draft like Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane."
"The last four first-rounders you guys selected with those ""valuable"" draft picks are Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard. Come on, dude."
"There are two separate pools of players on our team. Grant Williams and Tristan Thompson went into protocol earlier so those are the two that will likely be able to play tomorrow. Barring other positive test results, The others should be back this weekend."
**Shaquille O’Neal** played with:  - Penny Hardaway - Horace Grant - Eddie Jones - Nick Van Exel - Glen Rice - Kobe Bryant - Dennis Rodman - Gary Payton - Karl Malone - Dwyane Wade - Alonzo Mourning - Steve Nash - Grant Hill - Amar'e Stoudemire - LeBron James - Mo Williams - Ray Allen - Kevin Garnett - Paul Pierce - Rajon Rondo - Jermaine O’Neal  In terms of playing with the most talent it’s probably someone like Horry or Mccaw who went to multiple championship teams but among stars it’s Shaq
"Teague, smart, Pritchard, Edwards, waters, Nesmith, tacko, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson"
"Tbf ainge probably countered with grant williams, semi , and a top 49 protected 2nd rounder in 2028"
"Eh I dunno, Rob and Grant Williams have both been pretty good for us, and both are still quite young. They're not gonna be all-stars, but I think they'll develop into solid rotation players and potentially starters. Semi's been disappointing for most of his time here, but this year he's actually been pretty good.   Edwards is not a good basketball player lol"
"Didn’t you guys draft Bennet #1? Wasn’t Markelle taken #1 Tatum’s year? Idk but it seems to me like hitting on high picks isn’t a given. Also, Semi is having an incredible season and most think he should be starting at PF. Robert Williams is currently averaging 15 ppg, 3.3 blocks, 2 steals, 1.4 assists, and 15 rebounds per 36 minutes. He’s playing 16 a night. Grant Williams is a solid bench player who can spread the floor and play dominant on the defensive end. Romeo Langford hasn’t played enough to have opinions on however when he does play he’s a defensive menace with great interior offense. Making an opinion on Nesmith after he’s only played 15 minutes in the NBA is absolutely stupid. Especially for a guy like Nesmith who got injured in college and hasn’t played basketball in over a year. I feel like you’re pulling takes out of nowhere. It just sound immature.  Delete this nephew."
"Would love PJ but he would definitely feel a bit redundant with Grant Williams on our roster. Still, would be excited to add him!"
"Tatum/Brown/Smart picks - two overall #3 picks and a #6 pick - those are easy.  Semi - is a borderline NBA player.  Grant and Robert Williams are borderline NBA players.  Pritchard is in fact off to a good start.  What about Yabu, Langford, Carson Edwards, Nesmith, Zizic, RJ Hunter...."
"Okay but the missed picks that he has had doesn't outweigh that he drafted Tatum, Brown, Smart, Semi, Pritchard, and Grant and Robert Williams. That is a better core of drafted players than most teams"
Grant Williams can DM
"Honestly it's hard to not be optimistic with the way everyone has been playing lately. Brown and Tatum have each taken a big leap this year, Kemba almost healthy, Smart still taking stupid shots but I'd still let him blow a load in my face if he wanted. Grant Williams and Robert Williams have really stepped in to be critical role players, and Pritchard has been lights out when we've needed him to and I don't think any of us expected that."
You guys get a grant williams and Thompson back for friday pretty sure so probably wont get any
"For the Celtics, maybe Theis+Langford+Kemba and a lottery protected first round pick in 2022 or something. Maybe we could take Baynes off your hands for us as well, since we really liked him in Boston lol.   Idk if you guys want Kemba though tbh, so I guess we could move him to a third team in need of a starting point guard with cap space, like the Knicks, and they could throw in filler for you guys. Theis is redundant for us, but given you guys don't have like any centers you could probably start him.   Langford is a solid defender but we haven't seen much from him offensively because we have better options for that. We also have Pritchard/Grant Williams/Rob Williams who are decent young players but idk if any of them are good enough to include in a trade."
"BOS  Covid - tatum, green, ojeleye, brown, time lord, thompson, grant williams,    Injured - kemba, langford  8 players available:  edwards, tacko, nesmith, pritchard, smart, teague, theis, waters,      MIA   *covid - Bradley,   *questionable - butler, dragic, Leonard, Olynyk   *probable - Vincent  11 players available: Achiuwa. Adebayo, Harkless, Haslem, Herro, Iguodala, Nunn, Okpala, Robinson, Silva, Strus(2 way)  Source: https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-01-10_08PM.pdf"
So basically 2 probably guaranteed losses until grant williams and Thompson come back
If jaylen brown gets cleared and can play they can win games. If th aren't they are fucked until the next game where thompson and grant williams come back
"Uh... Rob Williams tested positive, Grant williams is out with contact tracing, as is Thompson. It's the whole reason Tacko got so many minutes last game"
I think in 4 days they are getting Thompson and grant williams back and then the rest who aren't tatum in 6-7 days
"All I'm saying is that the NBA's definition for close contact comes from the CDC, which it seemed a lot of people didn't know. To your point, they've decided that: 1. Games don't meet that standard, which probably means that practices don't either. 2. Mask-wearing is also relevant (Carsen Edwards was in a car with Rob Williams along with Grant and TT, but since he was the only one with a mask, he doesn't have the same quarantine).  Given those parameters, yeah maybe no one else will have to quarantine. You can totally disagree with those decisions, I probably do too. All I was pointing out is that the NBA's been consistent with their close contact definition because a lot of people seemed confused at how gameplay didn't qualify."
"Players out due to Covid-19 protocols for BOS: Tatum, Grant Williams, Robert Williams, Tristan Thompson  Players out due to injury for BOS: Kemba, Romeo Langford  This is gonna be so great....."
"Thompson, Grant Williams, and Rob Williams are all under quarantine. It’s Theis and Tacko only for the next 7 days."
He was one of our only 2 bigs since Robert Williams got the virus and Tristan Thompson and Grant Williams got quarantined because they sit next to him on the bench.
"You’re risking those guys walking. We don’t have a great track record recently of people staying. Grant is way more valuable than Fournier and Otto for his two way play. Oladipo is the one I’d be most nervous about walking and I don’t love his fit with our guys, we’ve had hierarchy issues in the past.  I like our other guys but Grant is a massive upgrade over Grant Williams or Semi or Theis. Danny will still be able to make moves and find good pieces because we’d be a lot closer to contending now without sacrificing hardly anything for the future."
"Flexibility is the name of the game. Adding 3 years of Grant is a committal move. For 2021-22 the Celtics already have over 100 million in guys that will for sure be on the team (Kemba, Jaylen, Jayson, Smart) and then adding the probables (Thompson, this year’s rookies, both Williams) you’re already at over 120 million on the roster. Luxury tax is projected at 136 and a Grant guaranteed salary already has them over.   Not saying Grant at 3/60 is the worst move they could make but it locks the Cs into paying a middling 3/D guy when they may want to use that money for other options (Theis, Semi, MLE player). They’ll pay the luxury tax like they did in the past, but I think they’d at least like the opportunity to choose their path after the year instead of being locked into Grant.  My preference is to trade for an expiring contract along the lines of an Evan Fournier, Otto Porter or Oladipo. Then the Celtics can decide whether they want to re-sign with Bird Rights or move on afterwards. With Grant, the decision is already made."
"People get so caught up in counting stats with guys especially on bad teams, I mean bad teams have to score too. It’s like the hinkie 76ers, they had guys just racking up points but michael carter williams wasn’t actually any good. I wouldn’t get too excited about Grant he was still a pretty alright player for the nuggets but not like a superstar."
But he just played less than 48 hours ago?? I imagine the entire team as been around each other during that time so why is it limited to just Grant Williams and Thompson? Shouldn’t the Heat have players out due to contact tracing too? This is getting confusing.
That’s my question too. Rob has been around the entire team. How did they arrive at just Grant Williams and TT? And surely some players on the Heat should quarantine
in 17 playoff games Grant Williams has a 58% FG on 1.5 attempts and 59% 3 point on 1 attempt a game  very sustainable!
"Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, Pritchard, Nesmith, Grant Williams, Timelord"
"I didn't know who this dude was until the Celtics Big 3 of PP, Grant Williams, and Robert Williams stomped us."
"I think people claimed he focused too much on books and not playing. Such a dumb and stereotypical ""chad"" mentality, but thank god these are the types of players ainge likes to go for (Tacko, grant williams are other examples for this)"
"The bench is not good, if Pritchard was a nobody we would be lucky to have 3 or 4 wins right now.  The big rotation is mediocre, the wing depth is non existent. And now without Teague even Carson Edwards has to play. Don't sugar coat it just because they are home town guys.  I hope they prove me wrong and we are about to get prime semi and carson or waters get hot and robert or grant williams evovle into borderline starters.  But right now you got a bunch of rookie/sophnores and Semi"
Grant Williams!
Pritchard has to be like 4’10 if Grant Williams is taller than him
For the Celtics I think I would protect:  Tatum Brown Smart Rob Williams PP Grant Williams  Langford  Nesmith unless they’ve already lost faith in him at which point Thompson  My thoughts are theis is a free agent after this season and is unlikely to be back and Kemba I don’t think they take with his contract. If they do we can get a max spot open I think and I’m fine with that.
He also was high on the Jays when everyone else thought Danny was reaching on those picks. And Grant Williams is already a solid bench contributor in his 2nd season so not totally off there.
Is KOC good at the whole draft scouting thing?   In the past 3 drafts he’s had:  **Hayes** *#1*  **Tyrell Terry** *#8* (Really not impressed by what he’s shown so far in Dallas)   **Culver** *#3*  **Grant Williams** *#8*  **Mo Bamba** *#3*
"We have 9  solid rotational pieces really; Tatum, Brown, Kemba, Smart, Theis, Thompson, Pritchard, Robert Williams, Grant Williams  Best player available is either Theis or Thompson - whoever we decide to let go."
"Tatum, Brown, Kemba, Smart, Semi, PP, Grant Williams, Thompson/Theis idk"
"Man, that would totally give opportunities to a lot of young players.   1 and 2. The Jays   3. Marcus Smart   4. Peyton Pritchard    5. Kemba Walker   6. Grant Williams   7. Robert Williams"

"I feel like that's only really true of Grant Williams and now Payton Pritchard. Stock isn't really high at all for anyone else (other than Tacko but nobody really pretends to want to keep Tacko for his game). If we could package Ojeleye, Langford, Waters, and Edwards for and even halfway decent proven 3&amp;D guy I'd do it in an instant."
Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Marcus Smart  Tristan Thompson  Grant Williams  Peyton Pritchard  Kemba Walker
"Tatum, Brown, Smart, Grant Williams, Payton Prichard, Timelord, Langford  I love Kemba, but his knee makes me nervous."
"Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, Pritchard, Rob Williams, Grant Williams/Romeo Langford."
You checked my post history because you’re mad I’m giving you the harsh truth about your poverty franchise LOL.  Grant Williams literally ended your season and theoretically ruined your franchise considering what’s about to happen to y’all
"The Celtics sub has preferred Barnes for months. I’m personally comfortable giving up 2 FRPs, one of Langford/Nesmith, and Grant Williams, but idk if the Kings do that. Also I really love Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith"
Greatest Laker: Adam Morrison   Greatest Celtic: Grant Williams
"I feel like the Celtics cannot offer anything that would be remotely interesting for both Detroit and the Magic. As a Cs fan I would love to get Grant or Vucevic but I don't really see how can the Celtics get those two without sending Pritchard, Rob Williams or even Smart and JB. It's not happening"
"When I lived in Tualatin, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Darius Miles, Travis Outlaw, and Raef LaFrentz were all neighbors at one point. Used to see Steve Blake, Joel Pzrybilla, Brian Grant, and Mo Williams out at stores. Fairly common to bump into a Blazer back then. My youngest daughter has a picture with LaMarcus Aldridge in the local Fred Meyer. She was wearing a red LMA jersey and he asked if she wanted a photo, we didn’t ask him."
"I didn't address them because I was specifically talking about rob williams, as out of all of your takes I felt that was the most wrong. I agree some of our picks haven't worked out but a large percentage of them have been at what one would expect at this moment, the drafting is not our issue.   Stevens has openly stated that they are specifically managing rob williams so that he can play more minutes/more situations in the second half of the season and in playoffs. It's not a difficult read to suggest the coach would play him more otherwise. Additionally, several Celtics media and members of the org have shown significant excitement over Rob Williams, its not just fans. His length, general athleticism, and energy have been big positives when he's on the floor, and his defensive effort has led to several forced turnovers into points and have stopped opposing teams runs at several occasions. He's been great, there's not a Cs fan who would argue otherwise.  Robs injury issues are also not debilitating issues nor is he constantly getting injured, the minutes restrictions are more precautionary measures for him, I fully expect his minute load to increase. And I'm not going to blame Rob for getting COVID in the NBA bubble, especially since he didn't get it by being irresponsible.   Rob has come a long way from the guy who was late for his first training camp meeting, he's gotten more responsibility and the org definitely looks at him as a potential center of the future for the Cs, I don't know how much Cs ball you watch but there's no way you can say he hasn't been a good player when he has played. He has yet to fully realize his potential and is still only 23. For context, he was the 27th pick of the 2018 draft.  Pritchard isn't a bad pick at late first round, and he definitely played very well during the first half of the season, hes shot well and brings playmaking and movement to our offense, with good hustle of D (which his ceiling is probably going to be significantly lower than his offensive abilities). I think that not having Smart and Teagues slump has caused Pritchard to be thrust into a more primary ball handling role when he is on the court which is a bit much to ask, but he's got good potential and I think his ceiling will be a 6th man/4th option on a team which is fine for someone drafted late first round. He also hit the game winner against the heat, and his minutes during crunch time or he's shown under pressure to be reliable for us.   Grant hasn't had a good year agreed, but he's shot well from open threes this year, and I'd like to see him in the second half of the season before making any judgments.   Romeo I don't have expectations on until he plays, we'll see, but he dropped to 14 because of his injury woes and was considered for top 6-8 if it weren't for it, so taking a flyer at 14 is not unreasonable, if it doesn't work it doesn't work out.   Semi has been hot and cold, he's has had some great shooting and decent d, but he's only gotten starts because of injuries really. Semi is a 2nd round pick and has been fine for what you'd expect, if he develops even further I'd see it as a bargain.  Nesmith is still unknown agreed but he's shown good defense, energy, and often draws players to him during offense which is encouraging for a player who hasn't fully shown knockdown shooting yet to still have that kind of gravity. He wasn't as NBA ready as Pritchard and it shows, but I'm confident he'll show more over the season.    At a certain point drafting becomes a gamble and realistically it's still too early to tell with guys like grant williams or Nesmith; the excitement over Rob Williams is legit however, and he has shown encouraging signs for the next step up."
"File this under rose colored glasses lol.    First it’s not just referring to this years draft.  Prichard will be an ok backup, grant and rob williams are not good nba players. Too early on neismith small sample.  You also missed the picks of  Bane, Langford, zizic, yabusle, ojeyle etc"
Remember when Grant Williams actually got real NBA minutes last year lmaooo
"It's just shitty roster construction. If UCF didn't play Duke in March Madness 2019 (refs screwed over UCF) would the average basketball fan know who Tacko Fall is? Same for Peyton Pritchard, Grant Williams, and Carsen Edwards"
"I've been saying that the issue is Ainge.  His overall drafting and acquisitions have been atrocious.   I look at the teams that are contenders.  They have their superstar(s) but the also have good/great supporting cast and depth.  What I see is their players are athletic, have length,  good ball handle handlers and great-good rebounders and their players have a combination of these things. I look as our roster and dont see anyone with the above mentioned except maybe Robert Williams. Ainge got rid of Kanter and even Poirie(sp) so now we get bullied under the boards.   He wanted more versatile 5s then decided to get Thompson who is average at best.  He put on too much weight and lost his leaping ability.    We could have gotten Christian Wood for cheap!!!! Imagine getting close to 20 points from him and 10 rebounds? Also,  he can spread the floor.   I think Montrezl Harrell was a affordable contract.  He's a bad man, a Marcus Smart type with more size.  I think I'd rather have him than Thies(sp) or Thompson.  We could have gotten Dwight Howard,  Javale McGee cheap and Whiteside for nothing!! Rondo would have been better than Teague and if Ainge had the foresight,  he would have gotten D. Rose from Detroit.  How come Ainge cant find the Browns(Nets), Caruso(Lakers) and other so called no-name players who are playing lights-out????  Speaking of foresight, he drafts Grant William's and Carson Edward's but the are sitting or not being the kind of contributors we need.  We let Max Straus go he he's playing well.  What about drafting Neismith but haven't been giving him time to develop? We could have gotten Bey and we also gave Memphis Bane who has the best 3 point percentage of the rookies.   Tatum and Brown are good-great players at times but they are too young.  Kobe needed Shaq he got really good, where the y just needed to surround him with the right roll players.  I think we miss Hayward more than we think.  His years of experience plus the ability to give us 20 points at any night is a plus.  Kemba is going down hill and doesn't have the explosiveness quickness like J. Morant or Fox.  He's a defensive liability and that's bad for a team known for defense.  We miss Horford and also Crowders tough ess.  We have 2 choices.  Either chalk this year and play the young guys so they have experience and also to see who they should keep. Second,  they can make some moves like sending picks and players to get someone who can contribute more than what we have.  Would it be possible to get Rose and Knox for Kemba, Thompson or Thies and our trade exception?   What about 2-1st rounders,  Kemba and Thompson for Turner and Warren?     Steven's can do better but he's dealing with the hand Ainge gave and continues to give him.  Gros said sometime ago that he would go over the luxury tax to be competitive.....well, let's see if he's serious"
"I'm sure nephews will say he is overrated, and maybe he is...But that dude has a crazy ceiling if he can be healthy. I believe that and his defense were the only reasons why he got drafted so low. I dunno, I hoped the Celtics would roll the dice and trade up for him. He'd be that perfect second scorer to Tatum imo. Jaylen is amazing too, but them 3 boys would be fun to watch grow together. Add a Pritchard and a Marcus Smart, Robert/Grant Williams, maybe a bench Boogie, Anyone left over on the roster ... baby you got yourself a stew to compete w the Nets.  Who am I kidding, that shit will never happen :(  But Siakim is Jaylen 3.0 so y'all should get Harris and a 1st imo at the minimum on top of MPJ. Not bad value, maybe will need to add another asset to make it work, but I want y'all stupid teams to work together to bring down the Lakers. (Go LBJ/AD, but fuck the market power of L.A)"
"The Trae thing is whatever, but Grayson has played a bunch of minutes and games for the Grizzlies the last two seasons and nothing has happened (outside of an incident with Grant Williams at Summer League). Hes probably lucky he's in Memphis because nobody watches us or cares."
"This is Tatum's fourth year in the league.  This is Brown's fifth.  I'm old enough to remember when Paul Pierce was young. And everyone took it easy, until one day, Pierce was 2/3rds of the way through his prime, and *then* Ainge got off his ass, and went out and got KG and Ray.  Tatum and Brown are capable of being the best two players on a title-winning team *right now*. And these guys aren't going to be young very long. If we're still hoping the Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters ""develop"" into anyting even *remotely* title-worthy five years from now, then we may as well not even bother.  The Celtics are very much *not* in a good position."
"I'll give you my side. This is going to be long, so buckle the fuckle up.  Brown and Tatum can be the best players on a championship-winning team.  However, they can't be the *only* players on a championship-winning team.  Smart is a good player, who is actually a bad player, because he thinks he's *a lot* better than he is. He takes shots away from Tatum and Brown in big playoff moments, and it costs us dearly each time. Smart thinks he's Steph, meanwhile when the game is hanging on a thread in the last few minutes/seconds, Smart will lay brick after clanging brick, thinking just *maybe* they'll start going in after the *next* one.   *Narrator voice:*  They don't.  Kemba was, in theory, a fantastic signing! But his knee turned into shredded fucking wheat, the *moment* he landed at Logan. It's unbelievable.  Ainge doesn't like centers. He either drafts, or finds in the bargain bin, bench-quality 6' 8"" guys, and throws them out there against the fucking Embiids and ADs of the world, and goes all Surprised Pikachu when they get utterly destroyed. And then they leave, and he trolls the bargain bin for two more 6' 8"" guys the next year.  And the bench? It's a college team. Go on r/bostonceltics. and they'll try to convince you that Carsen Edwards just needs three years to develop, and Robert Williams is really *such a great center, really!*, and Grant Williams is such a great... center, I guess. They tried to convince me the same about James Young. You're a Miami fan, tell me -- have *you* ever heard of James Young?  Can Ainge construct a roster? I mean, *yes.* He put together one of the most insanely stacked teams in '08. And during the Doc Rivers era, he kept it pretty legit the entire time.  But since then? Ainge has absolutely *wanked away* all his draft picks, choosing to take those picks, rather than package them for real players.  There's a very vocal segment of Celtics fandom that reminds me of the cartoon with the dog in the burning house. ""This is fine!"".  No, no it's not. Don't keep telling me how much time we have to develop new draftees each year, because Tatum and Brown are still so young. Guess what? Paul Pierce was young too. Right up until he wasn't, and you look back and realize his prime was wasted on shitty Celtics teams for *years*, until Ainge put his nuts on the table, and traded Al Jefferson, and several others for KG.  This is where we are. Ainge needs to put his nuts back on the table, and fucking *clear* this roster of everyone not named Jaylen or Jayson. Or maybe even one of them, if it can get you the right return. Sometimes you need to give up someone you like, to get someone better. You should have heard the Celtics fandom bitching and moaning when we traded for KG. Everyone liked Al Jefferson. He was a really good player! But trading him allowed us to make *real* moves to get better. But damn, in the moment, you'd think Ainge had run afoul of the Geneva Convention.  Switching from one really-good point guard to the next every two years, and signing cheap 6' 8"" ""centers"", and relying on college kids as a bench you expect to contend for titles... all of that shit is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  If you couldn't tell, it pisses me off."
The tristan thompson thing was so dumb and their whole fanbase was behind it. Same with Semi Ojeleye🤔. Grant williams might be a bit of an exaggeration tho
"To offer a somewhat serious reply - it's difficult to judge the recent picks too much. For one, 2nd round picks rarely ever pan out, and so there's no surprise guys like Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters aren't anything noteworthy (shoutout to Semi Ojeleye though, who's actually a contributor). And even first-rounders don't carry a high guarantee of success.  As for his first-round picks, Romeo Langford has been injured more than not, and that's never a good sign for any player's potential. But when he did play, it did look like he belonged in the league. Time will tell what becomes of him once he returns.  Speaking of time, Rob Williams is a pretty underrated prospect. Yeah he's already in his 3rd year and is 23, but he was always a project to begin with, and this year he's definitely shown a lot of improvement with his defense. His minutes aren't very high, but that's supposedly so his hip problem doesn't flare up too soon into the season. If he can put everything he has together, he'd definitely be outplaying his #27 draft selection.  Grant Williams is okay, it's hard to see him getting a 2nd contract at this point, but he looked better last year, so there's hope he can revert (his 3P% is up at least).  It's way too early to tell with Nesmith, but he's definitely not a James Young kind of player. His career will rely on being able to knock down 3s consistently.  As for Ainge getting better results from these draft picks - one could certainly argue for that. What was once a treasure trove of picks has now resulted in a lot of uncertainty. It didn't help that both the Kings and Grizzlies played above expectations (they were seen as surefire top 7 picks prior). But in order for him to sell those picks, there had to be buyers - and not a lot of buyers want late lottery/mid-20s picks and nothing else. Ainge was definitely targeting someone like Jrue Holiday, but the Bucks' offer was simply too much for him to match.  I do think it's unfortunate so many players left the C's without compensation, such as Horford, Irving, and Morris. Rozier and Hayward as well, sort of, though we'll see how that TPE and Kemba's knee turn out. I just think his draft assets - combined with the success of Tatum/Brown -  got way overhyped."
Let’s not pretend that Celtics fans thought their supporting cast was actually decent in the beginning of the season lmao.   “Grant Williams next Draymond green”  “Semi Ojeleye has reinvented himself into a top tier sniper role player”   “Tristan Thompson is better than Myles Turner and his championship experience will help the Celtics”
what about grant williams? I had a good impression of him but is he not that great?
"Sadly in this case it is. Grant Williams, Javonte Green, and Tremont Waters are not NBA players. Semi Ojeleye and Carsen Edwards are maybe 12th men. There's 5 guys, an entire lineup, that doesn't belong on a contending team. The only real case is Ojeleye would be a fine 12th man on a contender.  There's plenty of current free agents that would be better. The Nets just released like 3 guys who would be upgrades didn't they?"
I’m talking about Grant Williams....

"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
Exactly. Also carson edward lead his team deep into the tourny and grant williams is a great locker room guy. Instant upgrade.
Grant Williams is an ugly version of jaylen Brunson
"""The League is too soft, dudes like Trae can't even be touched!""  ""Who do Trae think he is, disrespecting people like Ariza and Grant Williams! Instead of playing defense, they should swing at his head going full speed and give him a concussion. That's what dae Bad Boys would do!"""
"What are you talking about, this is every player they've drafted in the last 3 years:  1.14 Nesmith  1.26 Pritchard  2.47 Madar  1.14 Langford  1.22 Grant Williams  2.51 Tremont Waters  1.27 Robert Williams  Which of those picks are 'horrendous?'"
"It’s a smart play, and the only disrespect here is grant Williams disrespecting his middle school Basketball coach who taught him to not turn his back to the baseline during an inbounds."
"Haha wtf. You wanna know what was “bush league”?? How Grant Williams was just standing there like an idiot, while Trae made your entire team confused as he scored on them"
"-Marcus Smart is the spiritual leader, defensive tone-setter, and best playmaker on the Celtics, losing him has been absolutely massive as you said.  -We’re trying to work Kemba back into playing shape but he’s been very inconsistent and our depth at guard is not good. Pritchard was a nice find but every other guard we have is undersized and shouldn’t be on an NBA roster. we all complained about Wanamaker last year but Teague makes him look like Magic Johnson  -Behind Brown and Tatum we have no depth at wing at all. Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye are like carbon copies of each other: undersized, dense, not very athletic, inconsistent shooters. I’ve actually liked Nesmith’s effort the last few games but he’s not ready to play significant minutes, and our lottery pick Langford from last year hasn’t even touched court this year due to injury, and really so far his whole career has just been marred by injury  -Our big rotation is actually pretty decent between Theis, Williams and Thompson. I’d say Thompson hasn’t been great though, and the double big lineup we keep running is..very meh.  -Tatum and Brown have gotten flack for ball hogging but they create lots of open looks, team just isn’t converting. Which eventually leads them to force the issue and just make SOMETHING happen  Overall it’s a lot of problems and it’s mainly roster construction. There are only 6 players (Brown, Tatum, Smart, Pritchard, Theis, Rob Williams) that are definitely worth keeping around long-term. It’s crazy how fast we went from having one of the leagues most stacked rosters two years ago to this"
I guess Grant Williams is with the funnies
"It’s not about total games played. Having a couple extra days off in early January cuz of COVID does not make playing so many games in Febuary any easier. And looking at Boston’s top 5 of Tatum, Brown, Smart, Kemba, and Theis, every single one of them has had injury problems and have had to miss games. No team has had to consistently play without 2+ of their top 5 players (but different guys missing each time) all season. You also just ignore Boston’s lack of depth in general makes a more condensed schedule much harder on them than other teams. Boston has had guys like Javonte Green, Jeff Teague, Carsten Edwards, Semi, and Grant Williams start games this season. The Pacers haven’t had to stoop that low this season."
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"

"oh boy, another Celtic denier....Nesmith - zero contribution thus far - Pritchard - seems like a capable NBA backup PG, Bane - could have helped them a ton this year, but they traded him - langford - garbage, Thybulle - again, could have helped them, but traded for Carson Edwards - who has contributed nothing  Grant Williams - has played out of necessity, but is a very average bench player, Rob Williams - could be useful, not sure why he doesn't play more - Yabusele - zero NBA contributions - Zicic - same - RJ Hunter - same.  Ojeleye - good 2nd round pick.  James Young, 17th overall pick from the Marcus Smart draft - zero NBA contributions.  Happy now?  Yes, he drafted Tatum and Brown, and Rozier and Smart were good picks as well.  Would you rather have Thybulle and Bane, or Edwards and whatever they got for Bane?  Langford hasn't shown anything."
"Yeah im pretty high on Robert Williams in particular. Its the Edwards, Langford, Waters, Grant, Ojeleye crowd that is disappointing. I wont overreact to Nesmith but I have not been that excited about him. I think PP has alot of potential.  My big concern is once the Tatum/Brown contracts kick in and you need to pay Smart its going to become increasingly difficult to put a team around them particularly if only 1 or 2 of the 7 guys they have on rookie deals pan out."
"4 first round picks, 4 pick swaps, liquidate Kemba's value into picks, Nesmith, Pritchard (recent 1st round picks), absorb a bad contract with the 27m trade exception and get back picks, try to flip Grant &amp; Robert Williams into picks, etc  Danny had a lot to work with, I think he should have at least tried."
"Since they blew it up in 2013 they've picked Olynyk(13), Smart(6), Young(17), Rozier(16?), Hunter(28), Brown(3), Tatum(3), Yabu(17), Zizic(23), Williams(27), Langford(14), Williams(22), Nesmith(14), Pritchard(27), Ojeleye(35)  Brown, Tatum, Smart, Williams, Pritchard, Rozier, and Olynyk are all good picks. Langford and Nesmith are too early to tell. Same with Grant Williams. Young Hunter Zizic and Yabu are busts but 4 busts all after pick 17 out of 14 firsts isn't bad at all."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
"Two first, Grant Williams, and another young guy (Romeo, Nesmith, just someone of value)"
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
"Grant Williams isn't really bad, either. At least I wouldn't throw him in the garbage bin, yet.  Course I'm still hoping on Semi, so I probably fall on the irrational side."
"Plus picks: JT, Jaylen, Rob Williams, Pritchard (so far, anyway)  Minus picks: Romeo, Yabu  TBD: Grant Williams (though I might argue for a late first he's fine)  I just don't see it."
"You're neglecting a few of those:  2016 Dallas 1st: Yabusele. That was an intentional draft and stash for Horford but my God that pick essentially went to waste. I imagine he could've gotten some better future assets for a first that was right outside of the lottery. A lot of great players went late in the first round of that draft.  2019: I've watched Langford since IU and I'm not convinced he'll amount to anything. He can't shoot for shit and he's injury prone. They drafted Thybulle and gave him away to Philly for some seconds. Grant Williams is meh.  2020: I'm willing to give Nesmith a benefit of the doubt and Payton has been a big relief, but giving away Desmond Bane sucks.   Ainge had what, 6 FRPs within the last 3 drafts? Especially with those being later picks, I think he should've gone all-in on older players ready to contribute. Brandon Clarke was absolutely worth a lottery selection in 2019. Letting some experienced players in Thybulle and Bane walk were dumb decisions.   And it goes without saying that both the Sac and Memphis firsts had much more speculative value than actual value. I got eviscerated in the Celtics sub for suggesting that the Memphis pick should've been traded.   Should the Celtics have gone all-in for a superstar? Probably not - they got their MJ and Pippen duo with the Jay's and that's worth keeping. But, Ainge has squandered the rest of the assets in trying to surround his stars with proper players."

"Everyone keeps saying trade Vucevic then having their pretend offer be Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and a couple second round picks. We’ve made the playoffs twice in a row, we did tank before that. Just wait to see what happens at the deadline and go from there"
"I like the other parts of the analysis so I'll offer insight on some Cs stuff. I'll offer some insight on Tatum and then my overall analysis from what I see.  Tatum has been coming along better as a playmaker. He just has to do so much right now. Kemba hopefully is going to improve and help with playmaker, but right now he hasn't been there.  Jaylen is able to be a usually efficient player, this game not withstanding, due to Tatum eating a lot of the defenses attention. Jaylen relies on explosiveness and doing that every possession is a lot to ask too. He also is improving with his playmaker, but Tatum is better from what I have seen.  The other part is, when Tatum plays with the second unit, who is Tatum going to kick to in order to further put pressure on defenses? Semi started the season off well, but has cooled off. Nesmith is not there yet and seems to still be building confidence. Pritchard has been pretty good, but can't be relied on all the time. Grant Williams is getting better, but he is kind of match-up dependent.  Tatum and Brown developed into great players, but they still miss someone like Hayward. Hayward is someone you can drive and kick to and he can further continue putting pressure doing the same thing. He is a good passer too and is someone who can also defend some of the better wings at least to give Tatum some breathing room on defense. Also, I think confidence wise, it was good for him to move to Charlotte where it looks like he has been great for Lamelo, Bridges, Washington and ironically Rozier! (The Celts used to have a 'too many guys problem' and rozier was kinda the odd man out).  Hayward is probably a perfect 3rd guy for this team, however, he obviously was too expensive for the Cs in addition to the fact he felt (and did obviously) he could get paid.  So this off-season, Turner would have been great, but still doesn't solve the 'drive and kick' flow of Stevens offense. He would have been a better 5 than TT, but is also more expensive. The celts will get better with Smart coming back filling in that Hayward role again as he did last season when Hayward was hurt.  Looking at TT, he sorta helps with rebounding, but then creates more traffic in the paint. He can't sit at the 3 point line unless he is doing some kind of dribble hand off. Same with Rob Williams. Theis can do his imitation Horford pick and pop 3 or elbow jumper, but not the whole game.  So the Cs have less space for Jaylen, Tatum, Kemba, Pritchard to operate. Not to mention Teague who is now getting DNPs.  This is all to say too, that when I see the Cs having these 3-4 minute scoring droughts in general, it feels it is role guys not hitting 3s (Doris mentioned the Celts have a terrible record when they don't hit 12 3s a game). It is guys clogging the paint a bit too much. Lastly, bench/foundation inconsistency in general, Grant Williams now getting DNPs, Teague, guys who got like 20 minutes a game at times before."
"Nah if you've been watching this season they definitely are. I wouldnt say they were in the past, but the success of tatum and brown in addition to better passing skills have clearly helped guys like ojeleye, grant williams, and theis find better shots."
"Anytime I hear Celtics fans talk about who to acquire through trade a lot of them say: “He won’t be able to stop Embiid or Giannis” mf nobody can stop those guys! And if those guys are available no team is giving him up at the deadline for Grant Williams, Robert Williams and a 1st lol"
He should talk with Grant Williams
"Dame  Marcus Smart  Jerami Grant  RoCo  Bam   Bench: Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Royce O Neale, Richaun Holmes"
Jarrett Allen and Grant Williams would be best friends
"Romeo was absolute trash even when he was healthy, even when he was in the G League.  Grant Williams was a decent at best pick, nothing more.  And notice how you left out passing on Myles Turner and McDermott, that's the real inexcusable move. Literally chose a trade exception over an elite rim protector that can shoot 3s and a high level bench shooter/scorer."
"&gt; Romeo looks like a bust  Romeo looks like a redshirt. We drafted him as an injured player.   &gt;Grant Williams is a mediocre role player at best  Drafted #22, which is a pretty good outcome.   Can also list Pritchard (#26) and Rob Williams (#27) in this same category."
"Romeo looks like a bust, Grant Williams is a mediocre role player at best, Aaron Nesmith looks terrible right now but hopefully turns it around, passing on Myles Turner and McDermott was absolutely inexcusable."
"I dunno, I think Kemba is a pretty good player. Seems to me Boston’s depth is their major problem. There are way to many Semi, Grant Williams and Jeff Teague minutes happening."
"Kukoc that year: 10/4/3 on 43/27/74 Started 8 games.  Kerr: 9 points on 50/40/90 Started 0 games. Took 7 shots a game  Longley: played 27 games total that year.  Less than 20 minutes a game. Gave you 8/5/2 on 52% true shooting as a center.   The reason why getting gasol is a bad comparison is because gasol is worth more than the sum of these players' parts that first season.   They lost Horace Grant, Paxson, Scott Williams, and BJ Armstrong that year.  You might make fun of Scott Williams, but in 93-94 he and Luc Longley had nearly identical numbers, and you called Luc Longley a key piece in replacing michael jordan earlier, so hopefully you grant me Scott Williams  In regards to the mvp argument, if Paul george carried on his dpoy level team and individual defense on 1-4 while averaging his numbers on his insane efficiency that year, then we would call him Kawhi Leonard. The only reason he doesn't have an argument similar to kawhi leonard for a top 3 spot is because he couldn't keep it going. That's not the fault of the mvp award, that's the fault of Paul george. If he had the exact same season for ten seasons straight he'd be consensus 3rd.  The reason why Scottie Pippen's mvp voting fell off is bc the team was gutted and they couldn't win in the mid 50s. If he had just kept Horace Grant the team would've won much more.  No one will read this far in my comment so I can give the super hot take that if Zach lavine was a good on ball defender this year he'd be no different than michael jordan   When Michael came back he had a worse PER than Scottie while taking a million shots on 43% efg.  27 points on 43% efg is like Monte Ellis numbers. It was worse true shooting than the Luc Longley I made fun of earlier, with worse offensive win shares than either of his years on the wizards, and worse defensive win shares than either year on the wizards. **you could literally put Jordan from the 2000s after retiring twice on this team and they still probably go 13-4.  If not, the stats would suggest they would do better.  This is not a testament to michael jordan, it is a testament to how depleted the team was, that even a slightly above average scorer could break the ceiling.** You can follow the logic here and blame HORACE GRANT for scottie only ranking 7th in mvp voting that year.   Either way, you can't defend Michael by saying ""he saved the team that had neRly a .500 record and made them a strong playoff team!"" But also hide behind ""of course he'd get knocked out first round! He was rusty!!! It's not a fair comparison!!!!""  Either he was washed that year or he carried a sinking ship, but you can't have both."
"&gt;suns  Barkley, Majerle and Johnson were all good, but not even close to the Bulls, who had a significantly better #1, #2 and #3 options.  Jordan &gt; Barkley, Pippen &gt;&gt;&gt; Majerle and Grant &gt; Johnson.    &gt;blazers  Drexler, Porter, Kersey and Williams is not a lineup that is ""absolutely stacked"" with talent."
Pritchard and Theis actually are productive Players. You would had point if you said Semi and Grant Williams.
Grant williams getting playing time should tell you everything about this team
Grant Williams is an idiot
"Massively different scenarios though.  Bulls were actually trying to make the playoffs after MJ left, they still had Phil, Scottie, Grant and Armstrong. They had 7 players that played 70+ games and they just got Kukoc and Kerr so they knew they had a chance.  The main reason the cavs dropped off so hard after Lebron left was that they were actively tanking to get Kyrie. Mo Williams was traded after 36 games, Antawn Jamison played 56 games. 4 players played 70+ games for them. Those players were Anthony Parker, JJ Hickson, Ramon Sessions, and Ryan Hollins."
Get grant williams the fuck out of there. Guy is fuckikg trash
"Jordan has Phil Jackson, Pippen, Horace Grant. Lebron has Mo Williams, Anderson Varejao, 37 years old Shaq"
"There are very few players who pull this after 3 or 4 years.   KD left OKC after **NINE** YEARS.  LBJ left the Cavs **SEVEN** YEARS.   Harden was with the Rockets for **SEVEN** YEARS.  AD was with NO for **EIGHT** YEARS!!  So who exactly are these players who are jumping ship after 3 or 4 years?   And LeBron left because his front office failed to put a winner around him. His best teammate was Mo Williams. Do you think he would have left if he had guys as good as Pippen, Rodman, and Kukoc?   KD left OKC as they dumped Harden because they didn't want to pay to keep a contender together. Does anybody think he would have left if, like Bird, he had McHale, Parish, DJ, and Ainge playing alongside him?   AD... who did he have as a teammate? Do you think he'd leave if, like Kareem, he had Magic, Worthy, Byron Scott, and AC Green playing alongside him?  &amp;#x200B;  Barkley and old school dudes compare LeBron leaving Mo Williams to Jordan playing alongside Pippen and Grant.  It is an insincere argument at best.   And coming from Barkley, who demanded a trade to a contender when his team sucked, well... it's just hypocritical."
"&gt; 2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)   Keldon Johnson's really the guy I regret missing out on at the end of the 2019 first round. Clarke had a great rookie season, but if his jumper is broken that could be a problem and Thybulle's got a long way to go too. I'm not willing to give up on Langford yet either; he's just been star-crossed by injuries."
"A lot of what you are saying is fair but ultimately boils down to my core point: Ainge is fine at drafting in the mid first round but under Stevens guys taken in that range have not developed. To go full in depth in the last decade you can also add the following players to the list of Ainge misses:    Zizic (23rd pick, not really clear if this was just the guy Cleveland wanted)  RJ Hunter (28)  James Young (17)  Lucas Nogueira (16)  Jared Sullinger (21)  Fab Melo (22)   MarShon Brooks	(25 and he was ehh)   J. R. Giddens (30)  And thats not to mention that Ainge basically has not hit on a SINGLE second rounder or undrafted player. Also I would say Pritchard is far from a sure thing (he has looked nice). Romeo Langford, not sure what planet you are living on there. Grant Williams I like but will he ever be a guy that plays more than 15 mins a game? The bottom line is that if you want to be a great NBA franchise then you gotta hit more than any of these guys-- just take a look at the Spurs or the Lakers late first round picks."
I remember he messed grant Williams up during an early game against the Celtics
"NBA teams don't scout based on sports-reference.com. He can shoot. Its not uncommon for rookies to take time to settle in.   Buddy Hield shot about 25% on his first 100 attempts. Grant Williams missed his first 28 threes or something. Some guys rush their shot until they get comfortable.   Nesmith sat out injured for most of last year, then didn't get a proper training camp, and he hardly gets minutes and hes 10/33.    I wouldn't be running victory laps on the idea that he can't shoot."
But our picks might turn out to be just that. Pritchard is solid. Rob Williams and Grant Williams have potential. Romeo and Nesmith are too early to tell.
"A lot of comments in this thread about how Bill is a casual, how the Celtics are short handed and that the problem comes down to not having the guys. While all this may be true (it is for the most part IMO), it is all ignoring a larger point-- Stevens has not developed any young talent other than Tatum/Brown. Here are their picks:   2020: Pritchard (26) and Nesmith (14)   2019: Langford (14) and Grant Williams (22)  2018: Timelord (27)   2017: Tatum (3)  2016: Jaylen (3), Yabusele (16)   I think that more than a fair share of the blame needs to be put on Ainge because his track record drafting outside the lottery is bad. That said, Stevens certainly plays a role in selecting and developing the talent. The irony is that the Celtics problems are the as the Pats-- shitty drafting in the late first round."
"Timelord was in the 20s?  Edwards and Semi were 2nd rounders (and Semi isn’t even that bad). Waters was one of the last picks of the draft... sorry that was a miss.  Nesmith is a rookie and he’s been screwed over by Covid more than most cuz of his injury in college.  Grant Williams is in his 2nd year and looks very promising. He played really good defense last season, it’s slipped a bit this year but he’s become a knock down shooter. If he can put it together he could be a good 6 man.  Romeo is also in his 2nd year but has essentially had to redshirt. When not injured he’s actually looked really good to and will probably be added to the rotation as soon as he gets healthy."
Grant Williams isn’t nearly as good as Celtics fan hype him up to be honestly. a lot of Boston fans will probably disagree with me though.
do you reckon grant williams is basically unavailable?
"Boston makes 3 ECF out of 4, and people proclaim Stevens is a choke artist lol.  Dynasties/great teams don't just develop out of thin air. People point out 2007-2008 Celtics, but that team itself was an anomaly, imo. It's very rare to collectively bring that much talent all together on one team and expect them to make the timely sacrifices to win the ring in the same year.  The Jays/Smart core going forward should be the main ones we retain, obviously we're all holding out on the hope that two of the following at least pans out: Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Nesmith, and Langford."
"Lol grant williams, langford, ojeleye are end of bench guys. Smart, langford and RW were lottery picks. You also forgot about edwards, waters, neismith, yabouselle being useless as well."
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren’t NBA players I guess"
"Those picks were supposed to be used to make a move for useful pieces. No contender thinks 6 rookies are anything other then end of rotation pieces in their first year, but Ainge didn't want to hurt grant williams feelings so he sat on his ass."
Grant Williams is useless
Grant Williams and a protected first
"In the past four drafts, the Celtics have had 10 first round picks. Two were Jaylen and Jason, great picks in the top 5.  The remaining 8 picks turned into Yabu, Romeo Langford, Ante Zizic, Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. And some future picks.   You're saying they couldn't have done any better with EIGHT first round picks than that collection of bench players I listed above??"
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

"They're not even as bad as their roster. Its kinda fun watching boston fans freak out. But forreal how hard is it to see those Thomson, Theis lineups don't work. They haven't even tried Nesmith yet. The Brown, Tatum, Ojeleye lineups are +27. Grant williams is a fine backup 4. If you got through my history, like I hate the celtics but I respect the fuck out of Ainge and especially stevens. I can't for the life of me figure out why they're using these shitty rotations.   The only thing I can think of is stevens wants to get these theis, thompson lineups reps for the playoffs but forreal if they literally just put Ojeleye in the starting lineup over theis or thompson and gave backup forward mins exclusively to williams and Nesmith, they'd be fine. It hasn't even been tried and celtics fans are freaking out. Lol"
"But theres zero chance that wins you a title and then you are left with literally nothing when he leaves. You're left with Langford, Grant/Rob Williams, Theis, Semi, Wanamaker"
"I don't know if I call Nader a hit, but otherwise I agree.  At least going by the wiz game grant Williams and Aaron Nesmith are not good basketball players."
"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
"&gt; has made Luwaru-Cabarot and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan valuable contributors on Day 1.  Lol... Go ask Nets fans about DJ. He's about as useful as he was last season, that is say, the entire Nets fanbase wants a new center.   Also, TLC's production hasn't really changed from last year besides a dip in efficiency.   &gt; Still, right after he left Houston after 2018 he dropped off in every facet just months after  Yeah.   He went from guarding Curry and Durant every second he was on the court to no longer being a plus defender.  That wasn't losing Harden, that was losing his athleticism.   &gt;He's waaay worse now after all that mileage and his value is low enough to where you coulda snagged him and made him a decent enough contributor on limited minutes  Except in your plan he's playing major minutes as a core rotation piece.  &gt;Harden woulda made all your promising youngins with all this untapped potential you Cs fans have been raving about into valuable role players.  No, because we're struggling with consistency from those guys on both ends.   Grant Williams, for example, has the potential to be a good player but he's a foul magnet and Harden doesn't fix that issue at all.    &gt; I've been dumbfounded by how much this sub (and the NBA fandom in general) undervalues Harden and other stars in trades.  No, it's more that you're overvaluing him.   He's an incredible MVP level player, but Harden + 1 guy doesn't win you a championship. You need to have a proper roster constructed around them.   * DeAndre Jordan is a defensive liability against key matchups - With or without Harden * Ariza slowed down too much to be a positive 3&amp;D player - With or without Harden * PJ Tucker's defence has declined with his age - With or without Harden * Grant Williams + Semi Ojeleye + Aaron Nesmith have **potential** but won't magically become consistent defenders overnight - With or without Harden * Romeo Langford has been a fantastic defender but he can't stay healthy - With or without Harden  Also, Harden isn't making guys elite on the defensive end. Which, without you realising, a lot of your argument seems to stem from.  You need to be elite on both ends to win a title. That Houston team you're referencing was the only Houston team that was a serious title contender and they were the only Houston team that was good defensively (6th in the league).  Harden doesn't win with the 15th rated defence (who would be even lower after the trade)."
"For sure that’s part of it. I just mean having Brown/Tatum/Hayward all being facilitating wings made it crowded. You’re seeing Brown take on more ball handling this year because it’s not split between him and Hayward. None of those 3 guys are effective as just spot up shooters, even if they’re capable of hitting the shots, which is basically the role Brown had last year. I remember recalling he needed the ball in his hands more but there were plenty of games where he just didn’t touch it in the 4th. I don’t blame the injury on coaching or the year after where Hayward was legitimately a liability on defense. Rushing him back for the Miami series last year was also just not him being 100%. They just never got a real shot at full strength with him and Kyrie.  I think the real problem, especially this year, is missing a key piece whether it’s Tatum, Smart or Kemba (them + Brown have been on the floor together for 21 minutes I think was the stat) is having that extra playmaker spaces the floor better. Right now their drives are getting stifled by collapsing defenses and their other guys aren’t getting open enough looks or just aren’t knocking them down because they don’t have that extra guy to account for so they can crowd the paint and guys like Semi Ojeleye or Grant Williams aren’t good enough without being wide open. Hayward also helped in this regard which is why he would be useful right now, because Boston’s half court offense looks totally inept. It’s the exact same problem they had against Miami’s zone and they really need the extra guy.  Yeah the coach needs to make adjustments to the personnel but when you don’t have the depth I think there’s only so much you can do because you’re not going to see guys like Aaron Nesmith or Javonte Green drive and distribute the same way that Tatum, Brown, Smart and Kemba can."
"No. The only decent role player on the bench is that kid you're talking about (Peyton Pritchard). And he's a rookie.   The rest of the bench is below average players (Ojeleye, Grant, Williams, Thompson), rookies (Nesmith, basically Langford), or absolute bums (Green, Waters, Edwards, Teague)."
"DA has had a bunch of misses but this is a total shitpost. No details, names, or recognition of DA having been there for a lot longer than 4 years.   This idea has been covered fuckload of times. You can make cases that DA as OP has tried to do, or you can say he has a better success rate than most GMs given how often players fall out of the league.   DA in recent memory drafted Smart, Terry Roizer, Tatum, Brown, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Rondo, Grant Williams..."
"Yeah saying ""the clock is ticking"" on a 24 and 22 year old that are both locked up on longterm contracts is a bit much. But what the Celtics have done with the collection of first rounders they've had outside of picking those two has been pretty damn underwhelming. Pritchard is off to a solid start and I like Grant Williams but I have a hard time seeing the rest of these guys (Nesmith, Williams, Romeo, etc.) being high end rotation players anytime soon. It's good to have those cost controlled assets but I feel like Ainge could've done a lot better flipping some of those picks for immediate contributors once it became clear that Tatum and Brown were both legit."
"Yeah, I like PP, but that’s basically it. I also like the Williamses. I hope Grant Williams can morph into a poor man’s Draymond."
"Tatum Brown Smart Theis Pritchard Nesmith (Grant)Williams and a really tough decision.  Either we protect one of Thompson/R.Williams/Langford, or we protect Kemba.  I haven’t seen the math but losing Kemba might open up a max or near max slot for us, and depending on his knee issues (which the team would know better than me) they might want to get out of his contract.  I’d assume the expansion team would take him, if not because he’s probably the best player available, then because he’ll fill seats and sell tickets when he plays"
Can a Celtics fan educate me as to what the point of Grant Williams is? What is this guy meant to do well at?
"Something like Robert Williams, Langford, Grant, and 2 firsts but I can easily see other teams outbidding that."
"He is the best perimeter defender.  That said, the impact Rudy Gobert makes is insane. He doesn’t even have to block it, or have a hand in the face to affect the shot. Grant Williams literally air balled a two footer because Rudy was standing their.   A three contested by Trae Young will be missed more then a layup contested by Enes Kanter. I think interior defense is just more important.  Gobert is a lock in my books for DPOY unless he gets injured or something. This isn’t to disrespect Ben tho, his defense is still incredible."
grant williams is the best player on the celtics
GRANT WILLIAMS
Tbh Grant Williams has been hitting a lot of 3s. But Semi is just as reliable on D so I'm ok with it.
Is Grant Williams the Celtic who always flops? Or at least the one who does it the most?
"The only issue I take with videos like this is fans have no idea what the coach is telling Tatum to do.  For example, Stevens could be demanding Tatum take every single ISO 3 the defender is sagging off on, yet this guy on the video slams Tatum for taking it with 11 seconds left on the shot clock.  Does Tatum need to improve his shot selection?  100%.  But when his options are taking a mid-range with the clock expiring or kick it to Grant Williams and hope he does something, it's not hard to see why Tatum takes those mid-range shots much of the time."
"[Link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html)  Orlando: Penny  Lakers: Kobe, Glen Rice, Eddie Jones, Gary Payton, Karl Malone  Miami: Wade, Mourning, Jason Williams (more entertaining than great, but still),   Suns: Nash, Amare, Grant Hill  Cavs: LeBron  Celtics: Ray Allen, Garnett, Pierce, Jermaine O’Neal, Rondo  Obviously Shaq didnt play with all these guys at their peak or nor was he at his peak when he played with them but the players he played with are pretty amazing.  Imagine playing with guards like Penny, Kobe, Wade, Nash when they were All Stars."
Oh shit he did? Grant Williams started like 0/25 so ready for him to become a knockdown shooter as well
"This is a pretty common take, but up until Fournier who have they had to make plays for? Outside of themselves, no one else on the team was reliable when the Jays made plays for them. They had Semi Ojeyle and Grant Williams and Jeff Teague spotting up off ball, so you can’t exactly blame them for trusting a contested look of their own over an open shot for them. Kemba and Smart are better options off ball, but have obviously had their own struggles this season. It looks like they both trust Rob as a lob threat now as well as some Tatum/Kornet chemistry on the pick and pop, but their supporting cast just has not been good enough for them to have any motivation to level up their playmaking, even though they have showed flashes of being able to make the right play."
"I went back through 1976 ROY voting and there has only been 10 times when the ROY didn't lead rookies in scoring:  Phil Ford, Buck Williams, Chuck Pearson, CWebb, Grant Hill, Mike Miller, Rose, Brogdon, Simmons, and Morant(because Zion didn't play enough)"
"Doesn't make for a good segment on a talk show but they just haven't had enough good players healthy.  If you look at their totals half of their minutes are being played by dudes that I'm not sure belong in a rotation, forgetting about how crappy Smart and Kemba looked as they were first returning from injury.  For example Ojeyele, Grant Williams and Tremont Waters have played more minutes than Tatum.  TT and Pritchard have played more minutes than Jaylen Brown. Jeff Teague and Aaron Nesmith have played more than Kemba.    Looking at teams who are gonna hit the over on their win totals the Jazz have 10 players who have played 100 minutes, the Knicks have 12, the Hornets have 11 and the Celtics have 17.  Tough to establish an identity with bad players and no continuity."
"Randle has worse teammates my ass. Celtics played Tacko Fall, Semi Ojeleye, and Grant Williams big minutes last night. The Celtics have the most player days missed due to COVID. Our 3rd best player has missed 26 games and our fourth best even more. That’s crazy."
In the short term yea. Eventually all these draft picks we're going to have to see minutes to play themselves into a roster spot or establish trade value. Rob has really shined and Pritchard has been solid. Romeo's been hurt and Nesmith hasn't been good enough to break into the rotation. Semi Ojeleye has established his ceiling and Grant Williams so so improvement is still TBD. Edwards and Waters are pretty much not NBA level players and Fall is super situational.
"From an outsider's perspective, letting Hayward walk hurt their depth. And then losing some bigs hurt as well. Their strategy isn't to have a traditional big, but they just are quite young still. I haven't watched many of their games, but my impression is that they're back-court heavy and if you face a team with good d on outside shooters (which sixers do), it's difficult for them.  I think they also missed Fournier tonight. Their second unit is fairly weak. If I'm facing them, I'm not too worried about Romeo Langford, Luke Kornet, Ojeleye, or Grant Williams lighting me up, and so if I have a strong second unit, it's difficult to keep pace."
I don't get it with Grant Williams
It was a wide open layup that was probably going to be an and one since Grant Williams rushes to defend and he made it a reverse just to avoid contact from Williams lol  Possible 3 point play turned into a 2 point play that’s a pretty cool highlight ig lol
Grant Williams and Nesmith both turned down Harvard for basketball and Tacko is super smart
"He's talking about the playoffs roster.   Hayward didn't play for most of it and wasn't good when he did because he was playing through injury.   Kanter only really got a lot of minutes in the Sixers series because they're like the one team that can't punish him since their PnR sucked. TT can play more playoff minutes than Kanter could anyways.   Theis is a loss, but Timelord is very good, better at a lot of things though idk who's better overall, but it's clear that having three centers was too many.   I don't think anyone would consider Grant Williams regressing a big deal. Wanamaker is honestly a bigger loss, but he sucks now anyways.   Kemba right now is pretty much as good as he was towards the end of those playoffs, if not better.   In the end, roster-wise, a lot of our losses from the playoffs were mitigated, and Evan Fournier and Jaylen's improvement are better than whatever losses haven't been offset. We're obviously not as good as last year's full strength team, but last year's team wasn't at full strength when it mattered."
&gt; double martin  Are/were great defenders? You could gladly have Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for those two
"Still Gobert. When I think of Gobert the first thought that pops into my head is when Grant Williams got the ball in the paint and had a wide open layup, then paused, looked around, saw Gobert like five feet away, and air balled the layup."
best i can do is grant williams and 50 cents
Grant Williams is so bad
"I respect that. Guy is only 20 years old, he'll get his. Shit he got Grant Williams a couple minutes later"
If Grant Williams went to your BBall runs does he serve 2 piece combo piece buckets and clamps?
Why Grant Williams guarding Olynyk like it was Curry bringing the ball up.
"hey celtics fans, is grant williams good?"
Grant Williams looks like a dude from the 90s
TT and Grant Williams
"So I do honestly think there’s a scary playoff team in here, but they’ve got to actually want it, stay in front of guys, pay attention off ball, and crash the defensive boards (and, opportunistically, the offensive.) They’ve got to find a way to light a fire, because a wholesale implosion could wreck a roster than could grow into something pretty special.  It’s a bit disconcerting the Jay’s both have too many head down drives to the basket, but they are both at career highs in assists, and are better at moving the ball than they used to be. I love Rob Williams, like Grant well enough as a deep rotation guy, don’t absolutely hate Thompson (though I wish he could have gone instead of Theis), Pritchard is promising, Smart  is more than worth it, and Kemba isn’t an absolute anchor (and can be pretty damned good.)  They have been playing like dog shit, and they could just implode. But they could also be an absolute meat grinder of a playoff matchup."
"Pat Riley was great at team building. Heat wasn’t that good until he arrived. Traded for zo, hardaway, thunder Dan. Had pj brown and mashburn. Good teams but they ran into the bulls and the knicks.   Zo got sick. So there was a down year or two. Drafted Caron butler in 2002. signed Lamar Odom, eddie Jones was already on the team, had a decent center in grant and then drafted wade. Wade turned into an all time player but took Miami to the eastern conference semi finals in rookie year while leading them in scoring losing to the number 1 seed Indiana Pacers in 6 games.   2004-2005 - traded for Shaq who was not in his prime but could still drop 22-23. Went to the conference finals but lost when wade got injured.   2006 - signed Gary Payton, brought back zo, signed Jason Williams, Antoine walker and won an improbable championship.   Signed Hassan Whiteside (he used to be good before the contract).  Found Duncan Robinson. Found Kendrick nunn. Drafted bam who is an all star.   Pat Riley has done a good job through it all.   6 finals appearances. 3 rings."
"The J's are playing well most nights, Kemba is playing better, and RW is fun to watch, but beyond that this team has nothing on offense. Smarts bricking everything, pritchard and sometimes grant williams are the only bench players giving us anything. The bench is just a line up of (so far) failed draft picks. I don't know how much more you can put on the Js"

Hes not better than LUKE KORNET and GRANT WILLIAMS
"Grant Williams, good at rebounding for my size, have quick hands, can hit the occasional 3, no business ever dribbling the ball."
they're really blaming this on Brad Stevens and Grant Williams lol
Trade harden to the Celtics for grant Williams and a second
"since the nets trade I'd say the only definite hit so far (only counting first rounders) was rozier, but rob williams III and payton pritchard look really promising. for grant williams it's probably too early to see but it looks bad so far. desmond bane and matisse thybulle look like steals but we traded them. and then james young, rj hunter, and yabu were misses. if i haven't missed any picks thats a 5-4 record of solid-to-good picks outside the lottery in round 1. as an extremely biased fan I'd say thats not too bad. would've loved if more than 2 of those 5 were actually on our team tho, thanks mr. daniel ray ainge"
Stop being salty that you got grant Williams and carsen edwards instead
"Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith and our late 1st rounders you say?"
That was then..this is now. Siakam has been inefficient for two years. He also does not draw alot of extra attention like a Luka or Trae or any #1 option (Boston didnt even worry about him in playoffs and had Grant Williams 🤣🤣on him and shut him down). He is paid max and playing like a 15 million dollar guy.
"No idea but as an emotional Celtics fan I’m willing to give him a couple of weeks before I start to get nervous, we survived the Tatum missed layup days and the Grant Williams 0-27 3 days, we can survive this"
Ingram is so awful you should trade him to the Celtics for Luke Kornet and Grant Williams thanks  He really pulled it together in the second half tho after Tatum got the better of him in the first
lmao why would you have grant williams in on offense for that last posession
Why would you not put grant williams on Zion?  He is probably the strongest player on the celtics.
"Luke Kornet is the best Center in Celtics history  Grant Williams is garbage  Thank you, goodnight!"
"They don’t really and it makes sense. Teams nowadays don’t necessarily have an exact set of values and their casts are everchanging so there’s not enough time to make rivalries.  And as a fan, honestly, I can care less about regional pride. I’m from Cleveland and my favorite teams are teams with my favorite players/style. The nuggets were my favorite team when they had Grant and Harris and before MPJ was getting big minutes. Now I’ve shifted to the Jazz (although I’ve liked the Jazz realistically since the Deron Williams days)."
"Eh Grant Williams is just an undersized big. If anything he’s too bulky/not quick enough for the 3, not undersized"
Look at grant Williams that should explain it. He’s too small
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201201300PHI.html  This. The 2011-12 76ers were the most unentertaining team in NBA history. Doug Collins literally coached basketball like a caveman and believed in hero ball. This is great when you have Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, or Old Michael Jordan. It’s not good when you have Lou Williams as your primary option.   In this game, they played the Orlando Magic and both teams sucked. The 76ers sucked less."
"But it's likely gonna be Grant because this award is based on the biggest stat increases from a player who went to irrelevancy to borderline stardom, even if Randle deserves it   It's like how you could make the argument there are flat out better players than the Lou Williams or Montrezl Harrells of the world off the bench, but they're always in contention for 6MOY because the award is typically given to the bench player with the best volume scoring stats (this year, Clarkson)"
0. Luke Kornet  1. Tatum   2. Brown  3.Kemba  4. Smart  5. Robert Williams  6. Payton Pritchard  7. Tristan Thompson  8. Semi Ojeleye  9. Grant Williams  10. Aaron Nesmith  I didn’t include Fournier or Romeo because they haven’t played for us at all this year or Mo Wagner because he has played like 10 minutes.
Al for Thompson and Grant Williams in the offseason plz
"The problem the Celtics have is consistency and guys that need to show up. Outside of Brown and Tatum, I don’t know what I’m getting out of anyone else. Kemba and Smart have been injured and have played very inconsistently. Theis and Williams usually provide value on the floor each night, but are not reliable offensively. Especially end of game.  After that, there are too many guys that may not even show up at all. Ojeleye, Teague, Pritchard, and Grant Williams get minutes but there are games they may not even score. Last night those four got 56 minutes and scored 2 points. There are just too many guys on the Celtics that give inconsistent value on the floor to build a consistent team."
Yeah we lost because we have maybe 7 NBA-caliber players on the roster so we have to play extended minutes of a lineup with both Grant Williams and Jeff Teague in the fourth quarter
"Someone please come Semi, Teague and Grant Williams away.   I beg of you."
"We could have a ok bench if we would actually play the players that play good and not Jeff Teague and Grant freaking Williams, but Brad Stevens."
Ah yes I love seeing Grant Williams out there in the 4th
"Some people do like Grant Williams. I’m not one of them. I’d say the jury on Nesmith and Langford is still out but it doesn’t look good so far.  And Teague... Makes me miss Wanamaker. Javonte, Carsen and Waters are not even close to NBA material."
"Theis and the TimeLord are a perfectly fine big man duo. TT a sieve on defense who isn’t quite athletic enough to be superswitchy or big enough to stop opposing C’s. Most fans would rather Grant Williams be our third string center at this point, maybe get a big body on a minimum contract. No interest in paying TT $10 million next year.   C’s actual need is playable wing depth. Hence interest in Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, etc. We’d rather Semi not need to play 15 minutes in a close playoff game (although his shooting is being underrated by our fans right now)"
"Theis should start, Rob Will finish. Grant Williams for weird micro ball situations at the 5 was pretty alright for us last year, Brad has tried turning him into a wing/4 this year and it hasn’t worked out at all, we need him as the third big to see any value from him so someone has to go. Theis got no minutes and a talking to from Brad tho so it might be him getting sent out since we’d have to re-sign him this summer to a much higher price"
"Yeah but TT is playable. He’s not bad honestly, I really wouldn’t mind keeping him if we didn’t have 2 guys I like more. And we have Grant Williams for micro ball 5.  Baynes is bad tho."
"Grant Williams actually did the best with Bam towards the end of the series. He’s kind of fallen out of rotation because he’s too slow to use as a wing and we don’t need anymore 5s but he actually held his ground pretty well. He looked like a major piece moving forward, but has looked really disappointing this season, although it’s a lot to do with his new role"
*Grant Williams*  Story checks out.
I think you mean Rob Williams because Grant Williams can barely jump lol and no Theis has been the starter all year
"I believe you're thinking of Robert Williams III because Grant is not any kind of ""lob threat""."
Ok haven’t they been starting Grant Williams. He’s a constant lob threat and seems like a decent Rim protector
"JJ Reddick, Josh Hart, Lonzo. Obviously not all three, but all would be more useful then carrying three true centers + grant Williams"
I don’t deny his skill set is unique but it should be noted that Grant Williams notched some very solid minutes as a small ball 5 last playoffs and that might actually be his best position.
One grant williams and a beautiful tpe
Grant Williams lordosing his way into a nut shot
Grant Williams
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
"He fixes literally all of the depth issues for the Celtics. Team defense is a different story, but right now our wing depth behind Tatum and Brown is   - Grant Williams, who is a 6'6"" Center with no athletic upside  - Semi Ojeleye, who lifts weights but is not necessarily good at basketball, per se  - Aaron Nesmith, who has as many DNP's as GP and is clearly not ready, nor do I blame him as a rookie  - Romeo Langford, who is a ghost with less than 400 minutes logged in his NBA career and who hasn't played in a calendar year.   Throwing an actual NBA level wing into the mix solves by far the biggest hole on the roster. Especially now with Robert Williams looking like he can be something at 5 for us, if we can avoid rolling Grant Williams and Ojeleye out in anything besides garbage time, we might actually be able to get some W's going  Doesn't matter though, because it doesn't seem like Detroit is interested in trading him at all, and we couldn't really offer a package good enough to get him anyways IMO."
3 firsts and grant williams for grant and sekou
Ainge wouldn’t even trade Robert williams and a pick for grant lol
"just say you don't watch our team. Jaylen and Smart can both play the 2; Kemba, Smart, and Pritchard (plus Teague recently but I'm hesitant to consider him an actual option off the bench) can play the 1; if Langford earns minutes once he's back he can play the 2 as well. We have essentially no one who can play the 4. Grant Williams doesn't deserve more than like 12 minutes per game in the right matchups, and playing Tatum at the 4 means we have to put Jaylen at the 3 since our SFs are pretty much just the Jays, Semi, and Neismith. We've been at our best when Semi is shooting well playing the 4 next to the Jays, and someone like Grant or Barnes can pretty much be the ultimate version of that role with their defense, shooting, and penetrating ability; Grant would also be able to handle the ball and score while the Jays rest which would be absolutely massive for us."
"If this is actually something the teams are talking about my guess is that it falls apart due to Danny not wanting to give up Timelord. I think Danny would be willing to give 3 firsts, Neismith, and Grant Williams or Semi but if Detroit isn't high on Neismith they likely ask for Timelord."
"Pritchard, Semi, fucking Grant Williams... You’re repaying us fine."
"Trade Bledsoe and Adams for any picks and bad contracts that end sometime soon. Only keep Hart, Zo, Zion, and BI and build everything else around that trading everyone else and completely cleaning house.  Then I trade BI and Zion to the Celtics for Tremont Waters and Grant Williams, Lonzo and Hart to the Timberwolves for a second and filler, then resign having put solid enough pieces around them to make them hover around a 12 seed and be stuck as a bad team for decades."
"Jeff Teague, Grant Williams and a Kemba lineup is rough"
"&gt;Explanations aren't excuse, my friend. **I merely stated that he's playing bad because of this**, and that shouldn't discount what he did the year prior.  That’s literally an excuse as to why he’s playing bad LOL cmon man   &gt;Also, what's so delusional about exploring trades that we give less away? I didn't once say he's off the table, the most I said was that I was conflicted on trading him, and then offered to give someone away first before doing so.  Because they aren’t realistic lmao. Being conflicted about including Grant Williams for Harrison Barnes is wild.   &gt;A lot of people on reddit come here to discuss. You act here like your opinion is fact, then start saying you merely opposed the opinion. I defended my opinion and you acted like I'm stupid (""you'd be fired"", ""what are you talking about lmao"", ""being a delusional homer""). I called you out on it and you're now calling me defensive. What did you expect me to do, roll over my opinion because you see yours as fact?  I did say I opposed your opinion, becuase that’s what I did. I called you defensive because you were getting defensive.   I didn’t expect you to do anything in particular I just voiced my opinion. I guess that’s not allowed on Reddit “where a lot of people come to discuss”    &gt;Hope you do better with commenting on other's opinions without all the added shit. Not everyone is in the perfect state of mind to deal with your bullshit.  Hope you can stop being delusional about trades."
"Yeah every player in the league didn’t have an offseason, we’re past the all star break now, it’s not really an excuse.   He was an ok contributor at best last year. I’m not butthurt I just opposed your opinion and you got defensive. You give Celtics fans a bad rep by being a delusional homer. Kings fans would be on suicide watch if they traded Barnes for Grant Williams."
"You shouldn’t be conflicted man, it’s a no brainer trade. Like you’d get fired for even considering not doing it because of Grant Williams."
Id be good with Nesmith and a first tbh. If the celtics have to give back more salary to make it work then hopefully we can get one of grant williams or langford as well
"A 1st and Precious from the Heat? Or Grant Williams, a 1st, and a 2nd from the Celtics?"
"After 2017 Draft where Tatum was drafted     2018 - Robert Williams III (A developing young player capable of being a Starting Caliber Center in the league)   2019 - Romeo Langford (We just have to wait and see but he has potential), Grant Williams (I know some of you have given up on him but I still believe he is just given the wrong role and position. He was nice in the playoffs against the Heats last year and showed flashes that he can be a poor man's PJ Tucker (The Poorman's Draymond Green)   2020 - Payton Pritchard (Impact Role Player), Aaron Neismith (Still young but is already good defensively, a good college shooter and showed flashes of that in the NBA)      Now you can't expect young player to be as good as the top picks immediately. Brown didn't become who he is today from day 1. Rozier is not that good the first few years here in Boston. Case in point, you got to have patience and not jump to conclusions immediately regarding these young players."
"Smart, rozier, brown, and Tatum went 6, 16, 3, 3. Since the Tatum draft, their first round picks have been:  2018: Robert Williams, 26th  2019: Romeo Langford, 14th. Matisse Thybulle, 20th (traded to philly). Grant Williams, 22nd.   2020: Aaron Nesmith, 14th. Payton Pritchard, 26th. Desmond Bane, 30th (traded to Memphis)  So basically your whole point was just trying to say that when you draft in the lottery, it’s easier to have good picks than when you draft in the teens and twenties lol. Hard hitting analysis buddy, thank you."
Wait I think the Kings would snap up Robert Williams if he were offered  It’s the celtics who wouldn’t offer him up  But yeah I can’t see any package involving grant williams as the best piece being interesting  But if it’s one first or Robert Williams I’d take Robert Williams
Rob williams/pritchard/langford/nesmith/grant williams/semi
"This would be huge. most TPE's don't even get used iirc but with one so large, they should at least do something. He fills a need with wing depth/shooting, and if we don't have to give much up it gives us the freedom to run any mix of lineups which I know Stevens and Ainge both love. Kemba/Smart at the 1 and the 2 for smaller lineups and allowing Tatum/Brown to rest if Barnes is on the floor helping them which will drastically help our second unit scoring, all 3 wings at the 2-4 for floor spacing and make Tatum/Brown driving more effective, double big (yuck) when it's situational like getting killed on the glass, but ultimately we can cut down on this specific lineup.  This also removes some of the load on Pritchard who has kind of been burdened as a rookie since Teague has been disappointing and Smart has been hurt. He's jumped to being our backup guard and the only reason we have to start Theis/Thompson is because Kemba and Pritchard will get killed on defense (which we have been so far). Allowing Smart/Brown as the 2 guard like intended relieves a lot of the pressure and helps keep Kemba healthy for the playoffs. The same applies to Nesmith and Langford allowing them to properly develop if we want them to be useful to us down the road.  Unfortunately, we can't just give up a bag of chips to get a solid role player like Barnes, and I'm not exactly sure what his value is but moving Ojeleye when his value is at it's highest and I'm not sure he's getting much better on an expiring (kind of like when we expected to move Rozier), or possibly Grant Williams since I'm not sure he'll ever develop into a good rotational piece plus picks would be ideal.  I wouldn't hate it if we gave Langford or Nesmith since they probably have the most upside as young players which the Kings might be looking for but I'm not sure those guys and picks get it done, even if we have the TPE to use. Sacramento fans would have to educate me on what they would want to give up Barnes."
"They've gotta sell high, I don't think his value increases significantly from here. I'd say he's worth about two young Celts prospects out of Pritchard, Langford, Edwards or Grant Williams, a protected first, and maybe a second or two. That's a pretty good haul imo"
"Our centers arent great but playing Robert Williams, Theis, and TT is a lot better than playing Ojeleye, Grant Williams, and Javonte Green."
When did Grant Williams become a decent role player?
They'd definitely want a first over an injured project in Langford a project in Nesmith and a rotation player at best in Grant Williams.
Ahh cool. I still think the Kings would probably rather a future first than a grab bag of Grant Williams a permanently minute restricted (hip issues) Time Lord Nesmith and an still recovering from injury Langford though.
"One of Langford/Nesmith, Grant Williams and a First let's go."
"he sucks, y'all should trade him for Semi and Grant Williams"
"Completely forgot about how good of a job the Celtics have done stockpiling generational talents.  Tatum and Brown would be fools not to spend their primes with Jevonte Green, Grant Williams, Carson Edwards, and Romeo Langford"
"I think Grant Williams missed 2 in the clutch in the Game 7 Celtics v Raptors last season  Granted the Celtics still won, but it was close"
saric had the same face grant williams makes whenever he shoots clutch time free throws and that's how I knew he was gonna brick at least 1
"The Hawks have had five guys play more than 60 games this season which arguably includes their three best players - Trae, Collins, and Capela plus Huerter and Solomon Hill. We’ve will end the season with only three players playing more than 60 - Tatum,  Pritchard (our rookie) and Grant Williams (a sophomore).  Also I’m kind of laughing at the idea of the Knicks’ bench sucking. They have the second best plus/minus in the league and the second best net rating, only outdone by the Suns. Their bench net rating is triple that of their starters."
"First: Dont trade Kemba, even if you wanna trade him, the return is not going to be good due to his contract and he has been pretty much looking like the charlotte Kemba for the past 10 games.  Second: Get rid of players like Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and etc.  Third: Get better depth by getting veteren players and players who actually knows how to play basketball unlike Grant, Semi, and Edwards  Fourth: Develop players like Pritchard, Nesmith, and Timelord because they are the only players who have shown potential  Fifth: Get a better center than TT and get rid of TT.  Sixth: Resign Fournier and extend Timelord."
I'd say last offseason was pretty bad too considering he drafted Romeo Langford and grant Williams in the first round and traded Rozier for Kemba.
"The Jay's have another 1-2 years before they BEGIN to enter their 'prime years.' You can't expect the Celtics to compete for anything while their centerpieces have yet to even enter their primes. Let's wait to see what this team can do in the playoffs once that happens before we make a judgement call on whether or not Brown will want out.  Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are both extremely inexperienced. If anything Grant has shown he can be a solid 3-and-D guy. There are other young players on the team that have shown a lot of promise: Williams III, Pritchard, Nesmith. 1-2 years down the line when the Jay's are playing in their primes, these player's will have gained valuable experience and will able to contribute important minutes not to mention will also be valuable trade assets if you combine them with someone like Smart.  Virtually 2 in 3 teams in the league's futures can be painted as ""bleak"" if you frame everything in terms like OP has."
"There’s no excuse for that. He coulda started Tatum at the 4, Ojaleye at the 4. Grant Williams at the 4.  Anyone at the 4. But you don’t not on any circumstance start Daniel thies and Tristan Thompson together for 30+ games"
"&gt; Tatum and Brown ALONE should be better than a 7/8 seed  Would a team of tatum, brown, and 13 redditors make the playoffs? Depth matters a lot. This is especially true when your roster is getting wrecked by covid/injuries. When guys like edwards, grant williams, and semi are playing real minutes, its gonna be very hard to be an elite team. They started tremont waters tonight ffs"
"Huh? Lol Nah this ain’t it.   Tatum and Brown ALONE should be better than a 7/8 seed. Then add in Kemba, Marcus smart, Fournier, Tristan Thompson… The GM has done his job this ain’t no G league roster they are more then equipped. They just got hit with injuries   Where Ainge deserves criticism is for not capitalizing on their crazy amount of assets and folding them into another star and making Boston a juggernaut. They’ve had like 5 mid to late round first round picks which have turned out to exactly what mid first rounders do, role players. (Grant Williams, Langford, nesmith, Pritchard) . That’s way too many guys like that on 1 team, especially one trying to win now. Also let Kyrie out the building, Hayward walked for free, didn’t go after harden, AD, etc  But not becoming a juggernaut is a far cry from ‘they have a g league roster’. They have finals caliber talent just injuries have hurt and yea coaching. I made a thread very early wondering why/how the Celtics were starting two traditional centers in 2021 I was utterly baffled. That’s 100% on the coach.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ltd2ca/waitthe_celtics_start_theis_and_tristan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"
"&gt;- The Celtics have the 6th highest payroll in the NBA next season, not including a new deal for free agent Evan Fournier    So... why does this mean a bleak future?   &gt;- Kemba Walker has one of the worst contracts in the league    There's only 1+1 left and he averaged 19, 4 &amp; 5 this year, after starting really slow from injury.   &gt;- Most of their young players like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford have disappointed    Tatum, Brown, Williams, Pritchard, Nesmith haven't disappointed   &gt;- They own no future first round picks from other teams    So... they don't owe anyone any picks. Why is it bleak to not own other teams picks?   &gt;- Marcus Smart will likely have to be traded this summer or else the Celtics tax bill will be massive. And if they don't trade him, they certainly will not be able to sign him to a big new deal next summer when his contract ends.    Why can't they pay him? Why does he have to be traded?   Also, if he's traded then it won't be for nothing. They will get value in return."
Philly was in a much worse spot last year than Boston is this year since they had that horrible horford contract too. I think Boston will be fine but they need to upgrade their bench. I am sure they could package Thompson Romeo Langford and grant Williams into someone good from a team that’s tanking and maybe trade smart for something as well
"Brad at halftime: ""Y'all are so trash, I want you to know I'm talking to you, so I'ma say your name then I'm gonna call you trash. Jayson Tatum, you trash. Tristan Thompson, trash. Grant Williams, believe me when I say this, you are trash."""
I think Pritchard and nesmith can be something for them but they are both bench guys  The other guys they drafted two years ago have been a disaster. Grant Williams Romeo Langford and Edwards have all given them nothing   And then yea the rest of the bench is absolutely atrocious. If the pistons can find guys who can shoot decently well for cheap then the Celtics should be able to as well
"definitely agree w this. Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Kemba, Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Rob and TT are all undersized for their position, they need to get a real big that can actually move his feet (sorry Tacko)"
"I mean a core of Kemba, Smart, Fournier, Brown, Tatum and Robert Williams should be good enough. Add in Pritchard and Nesmith who have shown they can be rotation guys we seem okay. Everyone else should go. But when you look at the other teams there depth is just on another planet. I mean Miami has Herro, Iggy and Dragic on the bench. That's bonkers. We need to trade in the Grant, Semi, Carsen players for proven good (not jeff Teague type) vets who can be trusted. No more youth movement. Bring me guys who know how to win and produce"
Our centers are Thompson and Grant Williams lol
"celtics center rotation is grant williams and tristan thompson, dont have to look much further why the celtics have been bad"
"TT's fine as a backup, but he definitely shouldn't be starting. Pritchard is for sure playoff ready, Langford and Nesmith aren't really but they're recent lottery picks who have shown promising stuff. Grant Williams is a weird one-- he was great for us in the playoffs last year, but he's been pretty bad this season and I don't really expect him to get a lot of minutes.   It's not a good rotation *right now*, for sure, but going forward there's the potential for it to be pretty solid."
"He wraps his legs around Bam's maybe? At least it looks like it, hard to tell if it's just a natural reaction to getting stepped over or whatever, though. It's Grant Williams, he fouls every time down the court, he isn't going to get the benefit."
Grant Williams is one ugly mother fucker
pathetic defense from Grant Williams
I personally think grant Williams is ass that dude does absolutely nothing. Tristan Thomson sucks too. Pritchards been surprisingly good but he isn’t ready to play playoff minutes right now. I don’t think Langford is good either as for nesmith I don’t think I’ve ever actually seen him on the floor. Just my opinion though
What exactly is grant williams good at?
"We have a lot of rookies and young guys on our bench who aren't very consistent. Pritchard's the only one who's a solid role player right now, but Nesmith, Langford, and Grant Williams have all shown some potential. Our deep bench is ass, but if the starting 5 is healthy, PP/Fournier/Langford/Nesmith/TT actually isn't that bad a rotation, we've just had to give minutes to guys like Tremont Waters because of injuries/COVID. This is a young-ass team."
"wait you mean Grant Williams right? I assume Robert Williams will be starting. if by chance u mean Grant, I don't really see that working out. From what I've seen, he's really not that great of a player. Y'all definitely should try to avoid playing an undersized center rotation for yet another year especially considering you play in the conference with Joel Embiid, Giannis, and Bam all playing on top eastern conference teams... I think you guys need another real big (look how dwight howard has done wonders for the Sixers this year, a backup center that is essentially a starting quality big is extremely important for a successful team IMO). I think you guys should sign someone like Dwight Howard(although, as I Sixers fan, I hope we re-sign him), Javale McGee, Richaun Holmes, or Nerlens Noel"
I knew it was bad when I saw the Celtics sub listing Romeo Langford and Peyton Pritchard as good bench guys for a team they considered a contender. Like Grant Williams started a fair amount of games for you and he is the biggest puddle of nothing I've ever seen in an NBA uniform
"Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams"
"Tatum can be Magic Fucking Johnson, it doesn't matter, if his passes are going to Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams"
"I loved the suns and jazz teams in the late 2000s when i got into basketball as a kid.  Nash, Stoudemire, Marion, Barbosa, Raja, Diaw, Grant Hill, Shaq. what a lineup.  Deron Williams, AK47, Boozer, Okurr, Kyle Korver.  Put these lineups in 2021 and teach them the modern offense both of them can make you sweat in the playoffs."
"Luke Kornet is not a bum, he has been really solid for us but go on.  Doesn’t change the fact that he plays guys like Grant who do literally nothing positive over someone like Jabari Parker who can at least score, or Langford who can at least defend.  Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Williams  Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Parker, Thompson  That’s a really solid, 4 seed type lineup.   Yes, a lot of those guys have been hurt. But they aren’t now. Jaylen is the only one out but some of those other guys still don’t see minutes, and the ones that do do not get them consistently enough.  Sure, this isn’t a championship roster, but even with the injuries a good coach would have this team easily at least 8 games above .500."
"Ik you always see your teammates naked in the locker room, so who has the biggest cock? I bet grant Williams has a millimeter defeater."
what depth does Brad have people who want to blame Brad over Danny are fucking weird he handed Brad a team with absolute no depth and we've been injured and have had covid issues non stop. picture having to play absolute bums like Grant williams or Luke Kornet but sure it's Brad fault.
"The only open shots I've been seeing are coming from Grant Williams.  But, I didn't watch the first 15 minutes or so."
"Their shooting isn’t really some massive dip.  The Celtics have the same issues that the sixers do in that they can’t put 4 shooters on the floor at the same time.   So they put out grant Williams, tatum gets doubled, kemba gets Bam to guard him, Williams probably airballs, and they continue with doubling tatum because there is nobody else that can get buckets.  Unless they get jaylen brown back at halftime they probably end the game shooting under 20% from 3."
Boston will have to do something on offense to help themselves out. Their ball movement has been god awful and has not really afforded them many open looks outside of Grant Williams performing an action resembling shooting the ball
"We're playing 9 deep, and Im fine with 8 of them (Grant Williams probably the weak link).  Eventually, your players have to make plays."
"I thought TLC was by far the worst player in the NBA, then I saw Grant Williams"
"Yo Heat we'll give you Grant Williams for Bam, deal?"
This Grant Williams dude is ass cheeks lmao
"Yeah well, we were within 8 points with like half the 4th left, and Brad went with a rotation of Kemba, Smart, Fournier, Tatum, and Grant Williams. Who is supposed to guard 7', 260 lbs Vucevic in that lineup? 210 lbs Tatum? 6'6"" Williams? Especially with Theis also in. How do you provide help defense against a team shooting 45% from 3? Just bad coaching with bad execution"
yes it does lmao cause else they rely on 6'5 Grant Williams to play 20ish mins at C
"&gt;Brad Stevens is a mediocre coach and I'm glad that everybody can see it now   &gt;   &gt;People defend his honor every time anyone criticizes him and its mind boggling. He has 2 all stars and Kemba and he's barely staying afloat trying to keep out of the play in spot? I don't see how anybody can defend him anymore. He should've taken the Indiana job where his inability to coach star players could be masked by his good guy persona leading a bunch of unathletic underdogs  We lead the league with players missing games due to COVID, and Kemba doesn't play b2b's. Not to mention, before we acquired Evan Fournier, we were giving Grant Williams and Semi-Freakin'-Haven't-Recorded-A-Single-Block Ojeleye on our team 20+ MPG before EF trade...  That's not ideal.  Also why the fuck would he want to go back to Indiana?... We re-signed him for 5+ years... Besides Smart, he's our longest tenured HC in a while....  How about you lay off the drugs, and make this post when you've come down? Cocaine is a hell of a drug."
"The problem is our starting 5 is really all we have going for us.  Kemba/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Timelord is a arguably a top 5 starting 5 in the NBA, but our supporting cast stops and ends with Tristan Thompson and Evan Fournier. It's not completely awful, especially with the addition of Fournier, but the rest of our bench players are young and not ready to carry the load off the bench. Pritchard is maybe the closest, but he's still learning.  I'm not a doomer by any means, I think we have one of, if not the, brightest future of any team in the NBA, certainly in the eastern conference, but the fact of the matter is out role-players are a lot weaker than other contenders this year, and it would take all of our best 7 guys staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs, as well as an 8th/9th guy off the bench (one of Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, and Aaron Nesmith) making a big leap *in a playoff push* for us to really and truly contend."
Looking like a Grant Williams fast break
"&gt;His 5 best games per game score this season are 3 games Trae didn't play, 1 game when trae returned from injury and shot 17%, and a game where trae was in foul trouble and had 7 TO's.    I still don't understand this argument. Bogi has stepped up when Trae was out or had a bad game, and somehow that's a bad thing? While also totally ignoring the fact that he has shot the ball well and been a valuable offensive piece that has won us games when Trae does play?    When Tatum dropped 60 against the Spurs does it count less because Brown shot 5-24 from the floor?  Are good players not supposed to step up when needed?   Who does Boston have playing 5 out thats going to give Atlanta so much trouble where they can't go with Capela? Am I really supposed to be afraid of some combination  of Ojeleye, Parker, Grant Williams, or Tristian Thompson playing the 5? Or that we can't counter with our own small ball lineup with JC at the 5?  Unless you are talking about a lineup with Kemba, Smart, Fournier, Brown, and Tatum?  Even then, the Hawks have plenty of options to counter to make the gpotential gains for the Celtics not likely worth it.  I'll give you the Heat, as I do feel like they are the scariest team come playoff time out of the 4 teams fighting for the 4/5 spots, however this years Heat team does not look nearly as good as last years iteration, and sure they've been hurt, but so have the Hawks."
"We've had by far the most games missed by Covid, which includes Tatum really struggling for a full month after returning. Both teams have had it bad.   But also, see the title of this article - the Hawks have good depth. The Celtics do not. Depth is our problem, and that becomes exasperated when we miss games. You have Solomon and Goodwin starting; we've had Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Tremont Water, Mo Wager and Javonte Green start games.  And remember, this conversation was originally about top end players, not the team in general."
"Romeo Langford has been a great defender this year but is basically a 0 on offense. He still hasn't had a healthy offseason yet and missed most of this year with injury and COVID so most fans still have a lot of hope for his ability to develop.  Grant Williams has gotten a lot better at 3 point shooting this year but his defense has slipped a bit. Fouls too much and gets blown by too easily. Drew a short straw with the rotation situation since his best position is small-ball 5 and we had 3 rotation centers ahead of him for the majority of the year. If he can get his defense up to par, he can definitely have a good career as a role player.  Carsen Edwards hasn't been as garbage as he was last year but he still doesn't belong anywhere near a rotation. When his shot isn't falling, he adds literally nothing on the court.   Tremont Waters has had some good moments when he plays with the actual rotation guys when the team is short-handed but when he is out there with the third-stringers it has been disastrous. Tough to be anything but a liability when you are 5'10.   Tacko Fall hasn't really changed at all since his first year. Very situational player. Makes too many mistakes. He is beloved by all though so it is nice having him on the roster."
"Celtic’s depth has just been bad especially at the PF position so that’s all he’s been playing his career.   PG: kemba, PP  SG: Smart, Fournier, romeo   SF: Brown, semi, neismith  PF: Tatum, grant Williams, Jabari  C: TT, rob Williams, Kornet  Before this year their best PFs have been, theis (horrible 2 big experiment that failed), Hayward (natural SF as well who had to slide to the 4 at times), Marcus Morris, semi, yabusele."
"Rob williams is aboslutley the long term answer if he can stay healthy. Only player that seems terrible is grant williams. The other players have shown promise recently especially nesmith also, do raptor fans have anything else to do besides act like salty bitches hating on the celtics?"
"Celtics have a ton of roster holes though. Kemba noticeably declining and still on that massive contract is a strangle hold on their cap space. They still need a starting caliber long-term solution at center and it’s not Robert Williams. They keep losing key free agents for close to nothing. Almost all of their recent draft picks are meh (Ex. Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Nesmith, etc.)   I’d rather be the Knicks with a ton of young rising talent, a marquee market to attract FA’s and a ton of projected cap space going forward the next few years."
"&gt;They just have too many doo doo role players around their core.  Not really, at least if they're healthy. 7 man playoff rotation is pretty solid:  Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Fournier, Time Lord, Thompson. Then they can play matchups with the 8th man being Pritchard, Nesmith, Langford, or Grant Williams."
"I posted this elsewhere here, but here are your lowest 20 per 36 Marvel Point accumulators (min 500 MP).   |Player|MHP per 36| :--|--:| |Wesley Matthews|8.5| |Rodney Hood|8.5| |Isaac Okoro|9.6| |Gary Clark|9.6| |Chasson Randle|9.7| |P.J.

"Um.. what? This is a result of him getting Covid, which he got 4 games after the Celtics traded for him.  He was perfectly healthy when they traded for him.   And yes, he was exactly what they needed at the time. Their wing depth was awful after Brown and Tatum and one of the main reasons they were losing basketball games was due to the fact they were playing Semi and Grant Williams as their bench wings, who are really bad."
"They didn't want to pay Harden in hindsight one of the biggest mistakes in NBA trade history. That aside the Front Office have made great moves. If Beverley hadn't injured Westbrook there more than likely could have had a championship. They got burned by KD and learnt from it, trading PG, Westbrook, CP3 for great returns as well as the role players Adams and Grant. Those players that you name have passed through at different stages, I think the way the Thunder handled the transition from Westbrook in particular who was a cornerstone of the franchise was really well done. Both sides were in agreement, Westbrook was keen to re-unite with Harden and the Thunder were eyeing up a rebuild. When Shai was traded for PG we had a new face for the franchise. I think the fan base is excited for our young guys with an eye to the draft. We have got Dort if course and now the euro sensations Poku and his fanny pack and Maledon. Throw in some good energy bench guys like Kenrich Williams, Ty Jerome and Isaiah Roby and the future is looking bright."
Low-key the worst Danny Ainge move was trading him for Grant Williams
"&gt; hit Grant Williams in the NBA  Actually he hit Grant Williams in FUCKING SUMMER LEAGUE  There were two flagrant fouls that entire Summer League season, and they were both commited by Grayson Allen in a 90 second span"
Dude Allen tripped like 3 different people and then he tried tripping Trae Young and hit Grant Williams in the NBA. Also if you think he’s handsome you must love birds. Dudes got a beak that he calls a nose
Grant Williams
"Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters are despised by the doomers on the Cs sub.   Won’t be long before everyone turns on Romeo after the ridiculous hype dies off."
Nah. Grant Williams.
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
"Well that’s just simply not true.  Tatum was not consensus top 3, most had him at 4 or 5.   Brown was even lower than that (usually around 7-10).   Most mock drafts have us taking Kris Dunn and Jock Jackson those years, then add on TimeLord, Pritchard, and Grant Williams (even though he sucks as of now, he was great for us last playoffs and is a big reason we made it to the conference finals).  That’s definitely top five. Personally, I think it’s 2nd behind the Nuggets, but having them at 3-5 isn’t horrible or anything.  But yeah, you need to fact check that consensus part."
Tacko Fall and Grant Williams are planning a podcast together as well
"Cause they got Grant Williams, Fournier, and Ojeleye chucking 3s"
"&gt; 7 footer who can shore up against NBA post bigs.   How dare you doubt the Green Kornet.    Yeah, another big behind timelord that can shoot would be ideal as well. Grant Williams is actually pretty sturdy in the post, he's just regressed elsewhere."
"I mean at the time it looked pretty good tbh. This post is lying to fit a narrative because the trade was the 24th pick (Grant Williams) and 33rd pick (Carsen Edwards) for 20th pick (Matisse Thybulle). So getting almost a late first to move back 4 picks late in the first round is a pretty solid move in my opinion. Obviously didn't work out though with Carsen barely playing and Grant not working out as well as expected, while Matisse is a good rotation player on a good team."
Robert Covington. TJ McConnell. Nerlens Noel. Dario Saric. Jarami Grant. Michael Carter Williams. Christian Wood.
well he did the last thing you said with Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard... so one hit and one iffy in that sense
"You’re simply wrong. Those steals he gets do not make up for his excessive misses. He was 1-10 from 3. He’s not a good shooter yet he continues to take 3s at far too high of a clip. He’s a major reason this team sucks. He’s supposed to be the heart and soul and he’s been bad. Yes, Grant Williams, Fournier and Steven’s have all been worse. But Smart gets way more minutes than those 2 guys. Stevens is the one that deserves the most blame but Smart is #2 in my book"
"Hating on the Celtics is fine, but at least hate on things that are true.  Brad Stevens sucks, Grant Williams is somehow even worse, Fournier has looked terrible, we aren’t playing as a team, but Smarts defensive impact out weighs any bad offensive performance. He literally had like 6 steals, and that’s not counting the five or so other turnovers he forced. For every shot he misses, he gets one back for our team."
"Not when he is surrounded by G league players like grant williams, langford and nesmith."
"Grant Williams the absolute King of getting scored on while in ""good defensive position"".   I have so many vivid images of Grant Williams getting scored on in the paint with his hands straight up.  F him. How you get SONNNED on B2B possessions by mf Darius Bazely?!"
"How do people still defend this dude?  Fire this clown Brad Stevens and send Grant Williams back to college with him. Send Fournier down there for a week or two also.   So awful.   Also, at the end there I think it makes so much more sense to just make the free throw with three seconds left. You have a much better chance of making a crazy three then getting that tip."
How do people still defend this dude?  Fire this clown Brad Stevens and send Grant Williams back to college with him. Send Fournier down there for a week or two also.   So awful.
"TimeLord has been missed, for me just watching them   but also the celtics force everything to the C and it's been Tristan who's not really a rim protector, and Grant Williams who's 6'5 lol"
"I hope you and Grant Williams get along. I'm a Tennessee Vol fan and we absolutely love the man. Even if ya don't reply, let him know Vol Nation says Hi."
Why is Grant Williams so trash?
"First of all, the Hornets just played the game of their lives. 39 assists is extremely rare. Second of all, the Hornets are littered with irrationally confident shotmakers. They live and die by this frantic offense, that's why they look so good when it works. When it doesn't, they look horrendous. We simply don't have those types of players, Tatum and Brown can create but once they kick it out, it's tough to just go right back to driving when the next player they kick it out to is Marcus Smart or Grant Williams. We've played games where we've tried doing that and it doesn't work.  I'd implore you to go watch our 6 game winning streak last week before you just blindly use one game against CHA for an example of us needing to change our offense. When our team is engaged our offense is one of the best in the league, but that's on our team not Brad. At all."
"Stevens was telling his guys to focus on it as well, but they had tired legs / weren't mentally in it tonight. The Celtics pace is sooo slow, which is odd considering how young and athletic their team is.  Steven's interview was unintentionally hilarious because he was talking about how the C's have to take smart shots and hustle back, and during that exact period Grant Williams air-balled an early shot clock 3 and the team kinda lolly-gagged back which led to an easy bucket for the Nets."
True. He's like a poor man's PJ Tucker for me. We literally got Jabari Parker sitting down while Grant Williams was in the floor running around.
"Grant Williams gets a lot of minutes for a guy who doesn’t seem to be really good at anything  Also shoutout to my guy Pritchard, go ducks!"
"Fournier 1st game off covid, Rob Williams out, Jaylen Brown out, Kemba Walker out, Grant Williams has played."
This might have been the worst Grant Williams game I've ever seen
LMAO GRANT WILLIAMS
grant williams a make a wish kid lmao
Anyone know what Grant Williams does?
"Grant Williams   Every time one of the young boys gets hit with a hard foul, he has their back. Grant has everyone’s back. I think the entire team loves that guy. I met him too in Boston last year and he was incredibly nice."
"Grant ""The Admiral"" Williams in the post."
"Grant ""The Dream"" Williams getting no respect from the refs."

"Scrub, should be traded to the Celtics for Grant Williams and Tremont Waters"
Dinwiddie-Clarkson-Harris-Grant-Jokic would beat Williams-Korver-Walton-Bonner-Pachulia
"I already said why in this thread.   Teams been crippled all season long, just saying we are suddenly going to be healthy for the first time all year at the right time. Last night might be the last day we see multiple starters not playing on the same night. Kembas suddenly looking prime, JT is ascending to superstar form, Smart and Williams got some rest, Fournier is coming back thursday. We are going to get Walker Smart Tatum Brown Williams Fournier all together for the first time. Romeo has been a huge suprise in his return, Pritchard is finally looking like his pre injury self again, Thompson is finally not in covid protocol, grant williams is actually contributing again, Kornet has been a hidden gem , Parker has looked like a legitimate veteran role player. For a season that looked dead in the water 3 weeks ago, this team suddenly looks like they have a serious run in them"
"I assume he was mostly just kidding, but 06 comes the closest. Rondo and Lowry were picked late in the first, not early. Redick and Gay were solid but never better than someone like Dinwiddie, e.g. Redick had a similar role to Harris.  So really it's about Aldridge and Brandon Roy vs. Jokic. The latter two combined certainly are worth more than Jokic alone (fringe hofer and perennial all-star (cut short by injury)), but with a potential MVP and the rest of his career left it's not a blowout. Jokic/Dinwiddie/Harris/Grant/Clarkson vs Bargnani/Aldridge/Morrison/Tyrus Thomas/Shelden Williams is a rough look tho! Historically bad first five outside LMA"
"Rob Williams has been our best defender and is on a minutes restriction until the playoffs. Tristan Thompson has been great defensively but hes missed more games due to covid than any player in the league. No one can stop Embiid and Giannis by themself, its a team defense. Rob matches up pretty good with Bam though. Kornet is third string , 10 minutes a night guy split between him grant williams and aparently we are going to run parker in small ball 5 lineups."

That fast break where Grant Williams just gets spooked and passes to Jaylen for a shitty angle floater....that ladies and gentlemen is Celtics Basketball.
This game had:  -Shit officiating (both ways)  -Jayson Tatum getting the worse triple double I have ever seen  -Tremont Waters as one of the best Celtics players on the floor  -Grant Williams interviewing for a Chicago Bulls job
Tremont Waters is doing better than Grant Williams ffs
Grant Williams is such a bad player
We’ll give em Grant Williams and Rob Williams for him
"Better teammates don’t matter if they don’t play. The only guys who played 60 plus games for us were Tatum, our rookie Pritchard, and Grant Williams. You had RJ and Randle playing over 70 with Bullock, Noel, Quickley, among others playing over 60.   Our four best players played fewer minutes together this whole year than they did in the bubble. In the 7 games we had our ideal starting lineup, we went 6-1 with a single loss against the sixers but a win against the bucks and a blowout against the Nuggets.  For the record I don’t disagree with Randle being picked. But that reasoning is flawed."
"I think a fair trade would be Kemba, Grant Williams, and a first for Simmons."
"Love knowing we could've just drafted Thybulle but no, we had to get fancy and now I have to watch Grant Williams"
"I want to know who is calling Grant Williams ""the General""."
Don’t forget grant “goat” williams.
"&gt;Please…3 of those rings Mitch was along for the ride.  This is demonstrably not the case.  Kupchak was fully-empowered as the General Manager in the summer of 2000.  That means Kupchak:  * made the Horace Grant trade -- who started every playoff game in 2001 -- for Glen Rice, who was terrible the previous season * signed bench guys Medvedenko, Hunter, and Rider who all played a bunch of minutes * but most importantly by-far, managed to keep O'Neal and Jackson from either killing Bryant, or quitting in frustration over his truculence, or both.  He probably deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for the latter alone.  And previous to that, he was the GM in charge of most operations from 1995 through 2000.  More to the actual point, no GM makes every decision in a vacuum with zero input from ownership or Executive Vice Presidents -- which was West's title from '95 through 2000.  The fact remains that the Lakers won 6 titles with Kupchak as their GM, and five of those occurred after West was formally retired.  If you want to discount some of those early titles, you may have to add the 2020 ring in their place.  Kupchak was gone by then, but he laid much of the groundwork -- doing things like [refusing to trade Ingram for DeMarcus Cousins](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/sam-amick/2017/02/21/why-lakers-jeanie-buss-fired-jim-buss-mitch-kupchak/98223130/) and not trading away the picks that became Ball and Hunter in a misguided attempt to win with the aged Bryant, and trading cash for Jordan Clarkson (!!), and signing Lou Williams."
"Grant “Jokic Lockdown” Williams for Giannis straight up, who says no?"
I wouldn't mind exposing Grant Williams tbh.
"Celtics should protect: Tatum, Brown, Time-Lord, Smart, Nesmith, Pritchard, Langford, Grant Williams.  If an expansion team want to do the Celtics a favor and take Kemba or Tristan Thompson, more power to 'em"
"Ainge made lots of good decisions. Also lots of bad decisions. He just never seemed to make *average* decisions.  Like... he traded away the #1 overall pick and still got the best player in that draft. I can't think of another GM who would risk that at all, let alone risk it and succeed. But he also drafted Grant Williams and Romeo Langford in the first round a couple years later, on purpose and everything.  If you look at his drafts, trades, and free agent acquisitions, the net result was basically league average. But I don't think a single individual transaction he made could be described as average, y'know? It's strange."
I mean Jokic struggled against Grant Williams for large stretches so 2-4 game sample sizes need to be taken with a grain of salt.
Jason Williams  Penny Hardaway  Grant Hill  Kevin Garnett  Dikembe Mutombo
Grant Williams is a Hawks fan?
No mention of Grant Williams?
"And Jaylen and Timelord were injured. And THJ ~ Fournier. Also Celtics were playing large minute Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, Aaron Nesmith. I have hopes for their future but compared to  DFS, KP, Kleber etc they are definitely a tier below."
"Gotta say I thought Trae Young was a clown when he got drafted, now I love the guy. Ever since he bounced the ball off Grant Williams back his my guy, was totally wrong about him. His a smart MFer."
&gt;  r/Bostonceltics would have you believe that Grant Williams and our 2 5”8 PGs along with shit picks is good enough to get Dame.  link? we're idiots but never seen this. people are throwing around JB. I hate seeing our own fans straw man our team. keep your doomer takes to yourself
&gt;Calling us a contender is a stretch   That’s downvoted lmao.   I love team subs and their delusions. r/Bostonceltics would have you believe that Grant Williams and our 2 5”8 PGs along with shit picks is good enough to get Dame.
"Jordan played with Pippen (HOF), Rodman (HOF), Horace Grant (nba all-defense 2nd team multiple times), Kerr and Paxson  Kobe played with Shaq (HOF) for one 3-peat, then Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom had to help him get two more  Stop with the nonsense as if those two won championships with the likes of Ilgauskus and Mo Williams. Every basketball championship team in history has multiple HOF players on the roster (with the possible exception of the 2004 Pistons and 2019 Raptors). Everyone needs help in a team sport."
how about a grant Williams? he's the best player on the squad
Is he talking about Grant Williams?
"We'll trade you shooters Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye plus any one choice of the young guards, except Pritchard, for that injury prone PF of yours. Anthony something?"
"I'm well aware, I don't genuinely believe we could get one of the best players in the league for Kemba and Grant Williams."
Trade him to Boston for Kemba Nesmith Grant Williams and some picks? Dude deserves a teammate as good as Tatum
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
Who needs Matisse thybulle when u can have grant Williams and Carson edwards
porzingis is so irritating to watch. the only other player who makes me have such a visceral reaction is grant williams
"Alternatively, they could just not dump Kemba and let Fournier go.  Kemba is a better play than Fournier.  And keeping either will put the Celtics above the cap but under the luxury tax, so that would have no implications on signing other free agents.  Paying 2 firsts so you can sign Fournier and lose Kemba is a very obvious shit move.   They could also pay the tax to sign Fournier to 20m.  Or they could dump Grant Williams and Carsen Edwards.  They can renounce Ojeleye, Fall, Waters and Kornet, and depending on the finalized cap, trade away their current firsts for future firsts or make another move to trade Nesmith or Langford for future picks to clear space.  They'd then have 12-15m to work with to sign Fournier below the luxury tax.  It's below what he's asking for, but there are moves to be made where Walker, Smart and Fournier are all retained and the team is under the tax.  Brown, Tatum, Thompson, Williams, one of Langford and Nesmith and Pritchard would round out the team.  The other 6 roster spots would need to be minimum guys though, and that 9 man rotation honestly probably isn't competitive enough to be a real contender barring Tatum and Brown taking another huge leap.  But it would buy them another year while Brown and Tatum develop, while still avoiding the tax.  Idk, I'm not a gm, but I'm just saying there are options available where the Celtics aren't just giving away picks to make themselves worse.  If they can't figure out the cap, I'd expect them to let Fournier go instead of dumping Kemba with picks.  As I said, they'd just be paying 2 picks to keep the worse player without it having salary or tax implications."
That Grant Williams for Matisse Thybulle trade always interests me   I genuinely don’t know who is better
Well I'm not putting much value on his opinion if he has Grant Williams higher than Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith
"You make it sound like we picked Anthony Bennett and shit. We have had very low lottery picks except for Tatum, who is the best player from that draft.  Romeo had been injured but he looked great last night, with more consistency he could become a very low end starter or great 6th/7th man. Nesmith is also looking  like a pretty good pick. We didn’t have a lottery pick 2018 but we selected Rob Williams pretty deep and he’s been pretty good for us, except for injuries. PP also a deep pick that has panned out.  We scored on Smart in 2014, we scored on Terry on 2015, we scored on Jaylen in 2016 but most of those picks around then sucked besides those three. Since then, I’d say the only pick I’ve been super disappointed in is Carsen Edwards. Semi was great for a second round pick and I think Grant Williams has a little more to show, I think we’ll change our tune about him in the future."
I think Grant Williams + Carsen Edwards instead of Thybulle is looking pretty bad but I still like Grant. He’s just not as good as Thybulle would’ve been for us
"Veteran team? 2/3 of their roster has played 4 years or less, and they have 5 guys over 25. A lot of rotational guys are 1-2 year players or rookies (Pritchard, Nesmith, Grant and Robert Williams, Langford). They’re still really young with their current team"
"If Grant Williams is any closer to the Celtics than Lithuania next year, Brad is already off to a bad start!"
Fuck...Grant Williams about to be a Celtic for life
"This is kind of a sad story. Nothing about this was really either of their faults and now everything will be changing in Boston because of it. They had a terrible free agency, true. But, other than the Kyrie fiasco—you can take it as a W if you want because Isaiah wanted a pay-day anway, it's not like he's missed the last couple years up until now. Several ECF appearances, two All-Star draft picks, Timelord is developing into a solid big, Grant Williams has shown upside..  And then Tatum gets covid. And then Jaylen goes down with a season ender. No one has been entirely healthy all season. They underachieved. Never had a proper center all year.  People just want a head to roll and unfortunately, it looks like it's going to be Danny's this season."

"There have been 5 other first rounders drafted by the Celtics in the last 7 years... Grant Williams is one of them and is a decent bench piece.   If you want to go back 10 years to name a bust, be my guest. But I don't know why we'd be talking about 30+ year olds in this context. We're talking about the picks he's earned from the trades, and they MOSTLY positive."
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
You realize the Celtics were going to pick grant Williams and found out the 76ers wanted thybulle so they picked him and forced the trade that they got to add edwards. Not a big deal but the Celtics never intended to keep thybulle
"Copy/pasting this from /u/_irongiant_'s comment in the Celtics sub, just to provide context to the negative things he's done over the past two years.  &gt; In my eyes this is a much needed move. Ainge had a great stretch as a GM until 2019 but since then it's just been blunder after blunder.  &gt; Coming away with Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Grizzlies pick for anything  &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt; So many blunders in the span of 2 years has left this team asset-less and in a bad spot. 99% of GMs would have been fired over these moves/non-moves, so Ainge would be doing us a favor by stepping down.  Granted, I don't agree with the ""we drafted this guy instead of this better player"" logic just because that's all hindsight, but all the other reasons are valid."
Bro if he wanted to stop being Boston’s coach he should just come to Milwaukee.  We’d love him. Dude would be our guy. Think about running dhos with Giannis instead of grant Williams.
"At least he had 08 championship to fall back on, but he had a roster to go to finals with Brad Stevens as the coach. It was combination of injuries, personalities, and free agency which hinder those roster to reach the finals.  They have Brown and Tatum, but rarely anything else unless Celtic fans believe Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Grant Williams will get better. Is Kemba Walker knee going to hold up to his shifty moves he will put stress on his knees?"
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
"He was great up until 2019 but has been bad since then.   - Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.   - Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing   - Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything   - Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   - Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing   - Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract   - Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson     Then there was the whole ""I haven't seen any racism in TD Garden"" thing which may or may not have alienated some of the players.    99% of GMs would have been fired for having the 2 year stretch Ainge did. Him stepping down is doing us a favor."
Agree with everything but I don't have it in me to ever defend Grant Williams playing professional basketball fur the Celtics
"&gt;the guys we picked in the 20s (Pritchard, the Williamses) look better than the guys we picked at 14 (Langford, Nesmith)  ?????????????????????   Romeo and Aaron have both been significantly more impactful players than Grant Williams. Other than Robert Williams they're also the ones with the most potential to develop into something more than just a solid role players"
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
"Positive takeaways:  -Romeo Langford playing offense (we knew his defense was great already)  -Jabari Parker deserves to be on an NBA roster  -Grant Williams is actually okay at basketball when he gets to play the 5  -a healthy Robert Williams is gonna get a triple double with blocks at some point  -Consistent Effort! For six straight games!  -Jayson Tatum was getting elbowed in the face, poked in the eye, slapped in the head, bear-hugged, and double/triple teamed for 6 play-in/playoff games and averaged 33.8-6.2-4.5-1.2-1.7  Now we let everyone get healthy and come back next season with one of the best wing duos in the league. Let’s go Bruins!"
"Crazy, I thought Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, and Tremont Waters would be able to provide offense for the second unit.  Seriously tho. How did ainge manage to fuck this up so badly?"
“This team is unfair” as they shoot over grant fucking Williams
grant williams is hilarious
"Nets are still more likely to win but Celtics would have a non-zero chance. We wouldn’t be having to play guys like Nesmith, Pritchard, Parker, Grant Williams any minutes with full health."
It’s not a Steven’s problem. We need another max slot guy. I mean seriously we have Grant Williams guarding KD. We need some better guys on both sides of the ball
Will Semi Ojeleye and Grant williams be on this roster next year?
Yes....But can the organization field a team around him that can help?  Theres guys getting minutes that wouldnt even be playing on a contender. Or at least wouldnt be get anywhere near the same time. I understand Brown is hurt so its sort of by committee but these guys and their MPG are not what you are looking for. At all.  TT - 25 MPG  Langford - 23.7 MPG  Nesmith - 15.8 MPG  Parker - 15 MPG  PP - 12 MPG  Grant Williams - 11.3 MPG  Not one of these guys is getting over 11 PPG. Kembas been awful and you're in serious trouble when Smart has to move to your 2nd best scorer. Hes stepped it up but he should easy be 4th 5th best option on a contender.
I had a dream grant Williams scored 105
Mans your team lost a game to Jayson Tatum and grant Williams 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"LOVE Chris Paul and the game of the entire sun's team.  Wanna trade, brad Stevens for Monty, we'll even throw in kemba!  And grant Williams!"
I have a Kyrie tat where my asshole is his third eye but I had it altered to Grant Williams after he left.
"Imagine being the nets, astroturfing your way an all star roster, playing a team of Jayson Tatum and literal rookies, only winning by like 15 points and still talking shit.   UnStoPaBLE man Grant FUCKING williams was guarding durant this game. lets see how they do against a team that isnt completely decimated by injury."
Damn. Grant Williams is giving KD a pep talk
Had to be uncoordinated Grant Williams
Grant Williams public enemy number 1
I can’t keep watching grant Williams get torched lmao
Keep putting jabari Parker and grant Williams on Kyrie that’s a really Good matchup that makes a lot of sense seems to be working
All the Nets gotta do is attack the mismatch on their Big 3. Either off switch or whoever Fournier/Grant Williams is guarding lol
"Brad should force Danny to suit up for this game. Let Ainge get a taste of what it feels like to play alongside Ojeley, Romeo, Grant Williams."
Bro who knew Kyrie Durant and Harden may be a better big 3 than Tatum Grant Williams and Marcus smart
grant williams should not be allowed to touch a basketball holy fuck
Lmao that grant Williams guy deadass missed an open dunk
Grant Williams literally always misses layups
how did grant williams miss that lmao
Grant Williams is ELITE
feels like i'm the only one in the grant williams fan club  it's ok i was the only member of the dillon brooks and facundo campazzo fanclubs too
Grant Williams vs All
Grant Williams minutes inbound
"“Good”. More like mostly average. Playoff teams have deph. Sorry Nets fan, but Romeo Langford and Grant Williams isn’t deph lmao. Don’t worry y’all will still win the series though"
"It’s cool, but it’s weird. You have the guys who were sharpened by iron watching Paul Pierce struggle through the 2000s and relished the 2008 triumph and then you have the J&amp;J fan club who have been spoiled with more conference finals appearances in 5 years than some teams have had in their entire history crying when ever Grant Williams looks at the ball. It’s kinda funny to watch."
"Yeah, but I think if Rob Williams is healthy we will pop off. This roster is REALLY good when healthy, especially with people more understanding their roles. Tatum, Brown, Tristan, Romeo, Grant and even Smart couldn't figure out their roles. Now they have"
Next game have Grant williams run through KD at full speed
"and Rob Williams, but TT (and even Grant) stepped up"
TT was an absolute bully this game. Smart and even Grant Williams were playing mean. Wish we had this energy weeks ago.
happy to see a good Grant Williams game
"WE GOT A BIG THREE OF SMART, THOMPSON, AND GRANT WILLIAMS. I don’t make no rhles"
LMAO GRANT WILLIAMS WITH THE DAGGER
"again that is GRAnT williams , with robert..."
Grant Williams sucks and it's funny to see him banter Durant
"""Grant Williams has words for Durant.""  Grant Williams should never have words for Durant."
Grant Williams would beat up KD imo
Grant williams fighting kd 😤
"Grant Williams can score 0pts, get 6 boards, and a few assists, and not pick up fouls, and i’m a happy man."
Grant Williams will probably never be a KD stopper
Nice to see the vet  learning from the goat grant Williams
"Grant Williams: 2 smart fouls, amazing block, big brain pick, awesome first name"
"Grant Williams is big asf, sheesh."
I will always hate Grant Williams. Fuck that dude and fuck Tennessee
Grant Williams doing something??
Grant Williams switched 2-5 on the raptors last year and dominated on D game 7.  He was also the only guy who stopped Bam last year.  He’s probably the only long term player that the Celtics have gotten in the past 2 years.  He plays terrific team defense and knows what to do. That’s rare on the current Celtics roster.
Grant Williams
No that goes to grant williams
"Why is Smart just casually thrown into trades like he's filler?   The offer would be Brown for Lillard (with Carsen Edwards or Grant Williams for salary matching). Maybe a first rounder.   Brown is a 24 year old, 6'7, two-way allstar wing averaging 25 points per game on 59%TS and he's on an amazing contract. He's not a prospect.   Lillard is better than Brown right now but you're trading the tail end of Lillard's prime for the start of Brown's.   Three years from now Brown will be paid $28M while Lillard is paid $50M and Brown will likely be better. That's a huge difference if you're trying to build a team."
Grant Williams? Sounds good to me
Stayed the same: Simmons   Got Worse: Grant Williams / Aron Baynes
Grant Williams
"I know Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard both always stressed that they just wanted to contribute to winning basketball and will perform or adapt to whatever role the coach thinks they can contribute in.   But those are 22 year old college player of the year candidates, and not 19 year old one-and-done lottery picks."
Grant Williams was a key impact player in the playoffs last year. I don’t think we make the ECF without him.
Any man that gives Grant williams and Semi anything other than an F cant be trusted
"PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Payton Pritchard  SF: Terrence Ross  C: Domantas Sabonis  PF: Jerami Grant  Bench: Mike James, Isaiah Hartenstein, Nigel Williams-Goss, Terrence Jones  Btw we counting guys like Kevin Love?"
Dejounte Murray for Grant Williams and a signed Tatum Basketball
"Yeah I think it’s much easier to build around and win with Brown and Tatum than it is with Trae and Collins. With another true star besides Trae I’ll look at them in a different light.   And I don’t really know about The Celtics but them being frauds was never really something people said. We didn’t have Jaylen in the playoffs and he’s crucial to the teams success. Assuming that Brown is back next year and him and Tatum both take another leap I see the Celtics being an extremely talented team. Replacing Kemba with Horford is a great decision as well and the Celtics have the 5th youngest roster in the league. With more development to key players like Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and hopefully the addition of last year’s draft and stash Yam Madar the team should take a big step forward."
"Yeah, the archetype is a big stretch for Theis. Having watched a lot of Celtics games for the last three years though, I assure you that this is the most common comparison (I mean he's undersized but intelligent. Every big fitting that description gets compared to Draymond Green. And when he plays in lineup with a point guard and three wings the word ""death lineup"" inevitably escapes some commentator's lips).  You disagree that Grant Williams is a really bad imitation of Draymond Green? I actually think that's the most obvious of any of these."
"You lost me at Daniel Thies, big lol at Grant Williams too"
"players who get wishfully compared a lot to Draymond Green because they are pretty skilled, they look like they are too small to play center a lot but center is still probably/aspirationally their best position, and if you squint hard they seem like maybe they could be multi-position defenders  Tier 1 - Draymond Green, ΟG Anunoby, Ben Simmons  Tier 2 - Onyeka Okongwu, Daniel Theis, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson, Robert Covington, PJ Tucker  Tier 3 - Grant Williams, DJ Wilson, JaMychal Green"
"Tony Snell, Jamal Crawford, Tacko, Grant Williams (since you said doesn't anger *opposing* fanbases)"
"No, I think 96 was better, but it's very close.  Shit, 97 might've been, with Williams/Dele adding a huge scoring punch down low that the Bulls hadn't had since Grant.  I'm still a little upset they didn't go back-to-back 70 wins, they limped over the regular season finish line."
Agreed. I wrote a long post about how he's developed as a playmaker. His assist numbers would look much better if he wasn't constantly kicking to Semi O and Grant Williams in the corners for a lot of the season.
"And probably even worse all those 1st round picks. You gotta trade those unless it’s from a bottom dwelling team. Otherwise you just end up with Gershon Yabusele, grant Williams, tremont waters, etc. Hoarding post lottery FRPs is overrated"
At least he's not Grant Williams
"I don't think Fournier is signing a deal that's ""good"" for the team.  He'll be looking for a bag, as he should, but his cap number and the level of production he provides are misaligned.  The Celtics just got done with this with Kemba, I am not in a hurry to remix that situation.  Fournier is a 6th man/rotational wing, paying $15M/year (or more) for that is too much.   Also next season the Celtics will have the Jays, Langford, Nesmith, Smart &amp; Grant Williams on the wings at least, and since they need to figure out exactly where they stand on Langford, Williams &amp; Nesmith it doesn't make a ton of sense to commit a ton of resources to a veteran at that position.  I'd much rather they try to find a PG so Smart isn't responsible for carrying that load all season and maybe a cheaper veteran wing if they think they need one."
"I was encouraged rather than disappointed by our playoff performance: A win, flashes from the bench, Smart’s 17.8 ppg on 59.1% ts, Tatum and Rob’s records of 3rd youngest to score 50 in a playoff game and tied for 4th most blocks in a playoff game with 9 (more than Shaq’s high) in under 23 minutes with turf toe etc.   I was actually pessimistic last year but I’m pretty positive this year if (not guaranteed) we’re reasonably healthy. The Jays, Smart, and Rob started 10 games together last year and won 9. Our rookie played the most games of any Celtic and the other teams in that situation were the 11th seed in the east, both 13th seeds, and both 15th seeds. All but our rookie, Tatum, and Grant Williams missed like 20% of the games minimum.   Tatum and Jaylen almost never played while both were healthy last year. I have a lot of faith in both of them and they both took leaps despite dealing with covid and/or injury issues. Smart’s a better playmaker than people seem to think and Horford is underrated as well. I’m also hopeful our sophomores and Fournier will continue to be efficient shooters off the bench. And if Rob is healthy (which is a big if), he’s a game changer. He brings rim running, defense, and playmaking and advanced stats reflect his impact. He played 52 games and of guys with over 10 this season, he had the 3rd most win shares per 48 (after Jokic/Embiid) and the 11th highest bpm (after Jokic/Embiid/Giannis/Steph/Lebron/Jimmy/KD/Harden/Luka/Kawhi) for example."
"this coming season I think will be a transition &amp; evaluation year.  It's a sink or swim year for so many of the Celtics pieces (Timelord, Langford, Grant Williams, Smart) that the team needs to see where those guys are and showcase them to try &amp; increase their trade value if nothing else.  What they can get on the court from Pritchard &amp; Nesmith in year 2 will also have a huge impact on the future, those guys need reps next season (and hopefully a summer league &amp; full training camp this offseason).  I could see the Celtics making a move around the periphery to move Tristan Thompson for some veteran PG depth to go with Smart (maybe Ricky Rubio or someone like that on an expiring), but nothing major.  I wouldn't be in a hurry to throw lots of money at Fournier, he's a fine player but I'd much rather preserve flexibility for next summer if at all possible."
"Most of everything here definitely sucks, except Grant Williams, who has a chance at being a crunch time 5."
grant williams for simmons and a first
Grant Williams
Grant Williams has Catan
"Some guys certainly get criticized more.   Players who get suck on mediocre teams often get criticized more.  Bird had McHale, Parish, DJ, and Walton. So he won.   Magic had Kareem, Nixon, Worthy, Cooper, AC Green, Scott. Of course he won.   Jordan eventually got Pippen and Grant, then Rodman and Toni.   LeBron had Mo Williams and a perpetually injured Anderson V and everybody criticized him for not winning   The reason there are super teams is because the media holds stars with who don't have the support to the same standards as those who do.   And then they criticize the super teams.  Harden gets ripped for losing to Curry, Klay, KD, and Dray.   KD gets ripped for losing to a 73-win team and the Heat.   AD, for example, got ripped for not being able to win. You put him in a winning situation, and he gets a title on his first try. Nobody is apologizing for all the unfair criticism.   Jordan did get that criticism early in his career, but guys like Barkley, Karl Malone, and John Stockton never got the criticism that that LeBron got during his first stint in Cleveland, or that Giannis has gotten. Or KD."
Grant Williams and Al Horford for John Collins. Who says no?
"""If the Clippers lose, would they take Romeo Langford, Marcus Smart, and Grant Williams for Paul George?"""
"I'm in favor of a hard cap plus a ""Superstar exception"" contract that doesn't count against the cap. However, all Superstar Exceptions are the same cash per year (maybe whatever 40% of the hard cap is) and players on Superstar Exceptions can only be included in a trade if the return includes another player on a Superstar Exception.   Teams can choose to convert a Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract, but only if they have the cap space to take the contract on (e.g., they need 35% of their cap space available to convert their Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract).   You may be wondering why a player would sign a Superstar Exception when they could take 50% of the cap. But I think a team with 50% of the money going to one player is never going to be a contender, especially against a team with one dude not counting against the cap at all, letting them spend literally twice as much to build out the roster. And so no smart team would offer that kind of money, and if they did, they wouldn't win anything.  It would be like having Lebron on 50% of the cap, AD on a Superstar Exception, and absolute scrubs vs Steph on a Superstar Exception and a good roster. Like it would be something like Grant Williams / Ben McLemore / Lebron / AD / Aaron Baynes vs Steph / CJ McCollum / OG Anunoby / Draymond / Christian Wood. Spending huge on two stars may look good, but the rest of the team will be so bad, the better constructed team with just one dude on the Superstar Exception (and no guy on 50% of the cap) gives you a better team."
"The years after AI were a miserable brand of basketball that was going nowhere. They were stuck in mediocrity. Never good enough to do anything. Never bad enough to rebuild. Just mediocre. That was the basketball that I hated to watch. The team was going nowhere.  But bringing in young guys like that had potential, but hadn’t yet shown anything yet was so exciting. I’d be rooting for a big game from young guys like TJ, Covington, Alexey Shved, Elliot Williams, Christian Wood, KJ McDaniels, Jermi Grant, or any other young guy who walked through the door. These guys wouldn’t have gotten a shot anywhere else in the league, but were playing big minutes on the Sixers and playing their absolute hearts out. I’ve never seen teams play as hard as those teams because they all knew if they weren’t giving it their all, they were going to be out of the league. So the games were more about seeing these players grow than it was watching the team win. There was so much hope. These guys growing, plus all of the assets that were being accumulated that would be able to turn into real impact players for the team was so exciting. Then the league came in and put a stop to the process with the Colangelo’s and their burner accounts and the rest is history. But those games were so much fun."
"Our wing depth was pretty shit. Like someone else said, Fournier played like more of a 2 for us. Outside of them our wings are guys like Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye, neither of which have produced much of anything."
I guess you could dump Thompson onto a bad team but I imagine they would want Langford too. I am not sure who the player is but Thompson and Langford or grant Williams I think would get Boston a good rotation piece to shore up the roster.
tell me you don't actually watch the games without telling me you don't actually watch the games  Tatum has significantly improved as a passer since the league shutdown last season. He took a huge step in the bubble and an even bigger one this season. It's not his fault he's passing to Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.
"He's untouchable from an asset standpoint even more than being a 24 year old All-Star 25 PPG scoring wing. We are not in a great cap situation even after the Kemba trade, we have SOME flexibility, but losing Jaylen at 25 Mil and replacing him with Lillard means that one of Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, or Grant Williams is now a starter, and there isn't really a ton we can do about it. If we don't re-sign Fournier  and we also trade JB, our wing depth (which is already not good) is totally fucked. I realize I'm comparing a bunch of pieces to a top 10 player, but I think losing JB would make it incredibly hard to put an actually dangerous team around Lillard and Tatum.   I doubt the Celtics are in on that if it requires Brown, and I don't think we can put together anything good enough without him. r/bostonceltics is OBSESSED with the Beal/Tatum St. Louis connection, but the same thing applies there as well. Just doesn't seem realistic."
 How our fan base manages to simultaneously shit on Grant Williams every chance they get and throw him as value in trade proposals is amazing tbh
"Smart and Thompson to make the money work, any 2 of Timelord, Pritchard, Nesmith, Langford, and Grant Williams, and then 2-3 picks."
Not to mention our bench players literally have zero value. People on our sub think Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are legit tradable pieces.
Fine you’re twisting my arm but I guess I’ll give up grant williams and a 2035 2nd round pick for him
it doesn’t have to be one of the starters watch it be grant fucking williams or something
"Yes, to the Celtics for Tristan Thompson and Marcus Smart. Twist my arm and we'll throw in Grant Williams."
Grant Williams!
Horford and Grant Williams for Mccollum sounds like fair value...
"It’s crazy how overrated some of the players are in there. You’d think Langford will be a HOF or Smart is a 10x all star player worth more than Beal. It’s crazy. Then they complain our bench sucks, but if we were to trade Grant Williams everyone in there would hate on it. So annoying they just piggyback off what the other person says"
"We get it across the board as Celtic fans.   2K won't even give us a strong Semi Ojeleye.  [At 20 years old, Grant Williams was in the 96th percentile for strength testing by P3.](https://twitter.com/Sam_Vecenie/status/1139560922647654400)   They don't have to be made into all-stars but both those dudes are stronger than Jabari Parker and Chris Boucher."
Every time I see your flair I just think about Grant Williams sending your franchise into poverty LMFAO
Grant Williams also approves
"Yeah he’s a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
He heard Grant Williams made the team and changed his mind
I saw a grant Williams and a 2021 second for Ben Simmons and their next four firsts
"Fournier sign+trade + Romeo, Grant Williams, and Tristan Thompson gets the job done."
My guess:  Williams &gt; Al &gt;&gt; Grant at the 5 with small-ball &gt;&gt;&gt; Moses.
"Yeah, forgot about a one-for-one trade for Tristian Thompson or Grant Williams 😈"
wasn't Grant Williams living with Kemba during the lockdown? The Celtics would have known exactly what he was or wasn't doing
I think the offer of ONE Grant Williams and ANOTHER Carsen Edwards guarantees he will be is Boston.
Bro grant Williams was our best player off the bench when smart was starting lmaooo
"I mean Blake is known to punch team personnel, so maybe it was the friend protecting the nice guys like Grant Williams from getting their ass whooped."
And Rob Williams and Smart won’t be a problem? Not so sure about that either. Horford is most effective at the 5 but I think Celtics should prioritize the development of Grant and let Horford come in as a sixth man.
Grant Williams even looks like a brick layer
Grant Williams has had more playoff success in his 2 year career than the Timberwolves over the past 20 seasons.  It’s that simple.
grant williams lol
And when Rob is hurt? Or just taking a breather? Grant Williams and tt ain't getting in done on a true big.
"He's just better than our backups last year, between all the injuries. He is a marked improvment over say, grant Williams when guarding/boxing a true big. And grant can play more and better 4 now."
Ay man put some respect on FastPP’s name. He’s actually decent   Put Yabusele or James Young or Grant Williams instead of him and I agree with you
yeah Robert Williams just can't stay healthy which left Tristan Thompson as our only healthy center who should be getting minutes in the playoffs. We were forced to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye way more than we would have liked.
"Thats honestly something Ive realized KD does a lot. There was a point in the Boston series where I believe Grant Williams was guarding KD. During a dead ball KD was standing close to the boston bench and just talking to grant who was seated about something. Wasnt heated, looked like legit conversation. I thought that was awesome"
"Celtics have 7+ players on their rookie deals still.  Romeo, Grant Williams, Nesmith, Timelord, Pritchard and a few more."
"Waters is a nice third string project on a team filled with vets or not contending, but we have too many projects already with Grant Williams, Nesmith, Langford.  I like Waters, just not on our current roster"
"Agree with all of this.  How much do the Wolves value Naz Reid?  I wonder if they could do something like Smart, Thompson, Langford/Grant Williams, and maybe a pick for Rubio, Reid, and salary filler?"
Moses is 21 and a big body and a tiny contract. He basically was doing everything TT was doing on 1/5th the money and with a longer contract + has time to improve while TT is a finished product.   Maybe your ready to write off a 21 year old kid who has played 40 games but I’m not. We played Grant Williams at center and Taco fall playoff minutes… I’ll take Brown happily rn.
"Yeah, but he’s young too. We should let Tristan walk and have him and TimeLord, with Grant Williams and Al Horford being able to play center too."
"I don't agree. The 16th pick is a decent asset, but it is quite literally the last thing the Celtics need. If you listed needs for the Celtics right now, probably #1 is a coach, or maybe that's actually #2 and #1 is a reliable PG who compliments the Jays. We could definitely use a solid 3&amp;D wing (so could every team tho lol). You can argue all day about the top of the list, but way down at the bottom is more mid-first picks. We have Langford, Nesmith, Payton, and Grant Williams taking up our ""development"" spots on the roster. Another rookie would either have to bump one of these guys out or get stashed abroad like Yam. Not worthless, but that is the literal last thing we need."
Made me hurt inside when Grant Williams was the first C? off of the bench in the second half last year.
"I can’t stress this enough; we put Kemba on a pitch count this season, didn’t let him play back to backs so that he could play in the playoffs, and when he got to the playoffs, he played like shit and still had to be shut down.  I don’t think Horford is moving the needle for us. But money is a real thing. We want to be able to sustain going into the luxury tax when Tatum and Brown hit their primes, and a mid first round pick when we’re still developing Pritchard, Rob Williams, Grant Williams, Nesmith, and Langford is not that valuable of an asset for us. I think OKC won this trade by getting an asset, and we won this trade by getting flexibility. Good move."
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"Depends how much Fournier signs for.  Also depends on the final cap number.  I assume the Celtics will pick up the options on guys like Romeo and Grant.  Between everything, they should have about 20-24m to work with while still retaining max cap space.  Williams hold is only 11m.  So if Fournier isn't on a multi, they could keep Williams and everyone else on a rookie contract and retain max space.  It would require renouncing Smart though.  If the free agent is good enough,,, Brown, Tatum, Williams, Pritchard, Langford, Nesmith, Williams, Brown, Max FA, non-tax MLE signing, 2022 rookie, minimum contracts to fill out roster should be a contender.  Rather than dancing around the cap, I think convincing one of the star FAs to sign in Boston would be the much harder task."
horford + grant Williams + Moses brown in garbage time isn’t a bad center rotation at all
we'll trade you Grant williams for Luka if we are going to be unrealistic.
"Grant Williams seems like a really great guy. I do think he works hard and has his moments. I just don't think he's good enough to get the minutes the Celtics give him. To me he's an end of bench guy that plays as a rotation guy, and he's really just not good enough to do it. If he was a little quicker and figured out how to stick his three consistently, maybe I'd feel different. But it's been a couple years and I just don't see it happening. Celtics just hoard these bad and mediocre guys and it's honestly kind of ridiculous, like they can't move on from their own draft picks or something."
"For everybody saying Brad got Ainge’d by Presti, keep in mind the celts have been NEEDING a consistent post presence ever since the Jays came into town. Robert Williams with his medical condition was unpredictable at times and Grant Williams just wasn’t gonna cut it.  Love Kemba. Wish the best for him but this is the way. We got that solid back court now.   Go celts."
"Having watched Grant Williams for like 100 games, I feel comfortable saying Grant Williams sucks"
Grant Williams is not that bad as a mid late 1st.
We weren’t doing shit with that 16th pick anyway. We don’t need another Grant Williams on the roster
Celtics would've just picked Grant Williams Jr so they probably won't miss it lol. Presti will pick a future all nba
I wouldn’t say the last 2 drafts were bad just a lot of injuries.  2018 Robert Williams is a stud and actually leads the draft class in ws/48 not a great stat but shows his effectiveness when he does play   2019 Romeo Langford again has dealt with injuries but looked good when he has been able to play. Grant Williams isn’t great but for 22 pick he isn’t bad. You really can’t look at second round picks they are hit or miss shot in the dark.
"We’ll trade you Kemba, Grant Williams and a 2nd"
What about Giannis for Grant Williams and a Pick Swap
We’ll give you Grant Williams and Tremont Waters for him
"You clearly don’t watch the Celtics. Al Horford hasn’t been on our team for two seasons. Romeo played in 11 games that Jaylen did, Rob Williams played low minutes until the trade deadline and then got injured not too long after.   Our defense as a whole sucked and we had 37 different starting lineups. It’s very hard to build defensive chemistry and defensive mistakes all around become more frequent when you’re starting guys like Tremont Waters, Javonte Greene, Grant Williams, Semi, Wagner, Carsen Edwards, and Kornet.  He’s been a good defender in a higher stakes setting of the playoffs. In the last two years he’s had a better dbpm than Steph, Capela, Paul George, Gobert, Middleton, and Klay. He had more defensive wins last year than Butler or Bam despite playing fewer minutes and games. Jaylen has flaws on defense but I think you’re going too far."
"I find it interesting that the Sixers, who worked SO hard to fucking LOSE every year to stock pile lottery picks, seemed to get the most disappointing picks (though they are not all 'busts' exactly).    Nerlens.   Michael Carter-Williams (and he was ROY).   Okafor.  Simmons.   In fact, the only player they drafted during their FIVE-YEAR 'process' that will be with the team moving forward (assuming a Simmons trade goes through) is Embiid.   And they got him the second year.   One of the best players they picked up Mikal Bridges, and they shipped him out straight away but has developed into a solid player.   Ty Jerome too.   They also shipped out Jerami Grant pretty early as well.   That team has just been all about moving and getting assets and throwing everything to the wall and seeing what sticks and jumping off if it doesn't work straight away (with Embiid and Simmons being the only players they have been willing to wait on).   All of that instead of taking the time to develop the talent they get."
Anyone is better than Grant Williams
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"I agree with the first part, but the 50% part in 11-30 I disagree with.  Since 2011 he drafted  MarShon Brooks at 25, Jared Sullinger at 21, Fab Melo at 22, James Young at 17, Terry Rozier at 16, RJ Hunter at 28, Yabusele at 16, Ante Zizec at 23, Rob Williams at 27, Romeo Langford at 14, Grant Williams at 22, Nesmith at 14, And Pritchard at 26  Of those 13, I think it’s fair to say only Rozier, Rob Williams and Pritchard have been great picks, with the potential for Nesmith to join them if he plays more like he did this summer league than last season.   Grant Williams and Langford have not looked good, but are still in the league, with Langford having more upside than Williams."
Man.    Don't tell that to the grant williams fan club on the celtics page
That was against Grant Williams. The commentators fucking roasted him. It was brutal.   Source: https://youtu.be/tpOeTMwIMJQ
he shoved Grant Williams in the head for the first flagrant then whacked him on the head not even pretending to go for the ball for the second flagrant
I was on Twitter recently and got PTSD when I saw a screenshot of one of our starting lineups being Kemba/Tatum/Grant Williams/Theis/Thompson
"By Tier 1.) Kyrie  2.) Steph / A.I. / Kobe / Jason Williams / Leonard  3.) Magic / Lebron / Jordan / Shaq / Howard / Zion / Grant Hill / Tracy / AD 4.) Porzingis / Both I.T.s /   The last tier are the legends that were gifted especially for their size / position. All things considered everyone here is a hall of famer in part for being gifted, complete or near complete players."
"I feel like more than half the thread doesn’t even understand the question and/or doesn’t really watch basketball. What kind of answers are Grant hill, Damon stoudamire, D rose, Danny granger, Deron Williams?  The fucking disrespect."
"Yeah, if we look at it like who would be but for the injuries it's basically Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, Derrick Rose. But I agree, we should look at it as whose skills just weren't as dominant or who couldn't develop enough. Jahlil Okafor would be a recent pick for me. And Deron Williams a decade or so ago had an absolutely baffling dropoff."
"Frank Kaminsky would also go to your college and completely destroy them. Grant Williams had 300 ways of scoring in the paint in college. Olynyk, Willie Cauley-Stein, Jahlil Okafor, Marvin Bagley…  The college frontcourt just doesn’t project well into the NBA.   It’s better for guys like Olynyk who don’t get drafted with late-playoff starter expectations (the Hornets took 22 year old Kaminsky in the high lottery, which looked pretty similar at the time to how it looks now), because a lot of the players I just named actually can compete as 8th man high-scoring centers, but just aren’t athletic enough for NBA rim protection. Garza can be something good, but it’s not because he’s an excellent college player, all the excellent 22 year old college bigs that find a role in the NBA have to change a lot and rise to the challenge of low-volume efficiency."
"Boston - Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Terry Rozier  76ers - Maxey, Thybulle, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, Milton  LOL, you're in a fucking cult"
Grant Williams. He can play small ball 5 while knocking down 3s. He's also a smart passer. Absolutely zero bias.
"As a Blazers fan,   Rod Strickland Steve Smith Stacy Augman Brian Grant Joel Pryzbilla  Bench: Steve Blake, Derek Anderson, Walt Williams, Mark Bryant, Ruben Boumje Boumje"
"I was going off of the basketball-reference position listings. In 93-94, Duckworth wasn't on the Portland roster. Buck Williams started 81 games, and Harvey Grant started 73 games. I think that they were the starting Forwards. Robinson started 64 games."
"If things break right this season, I think we could crack a top 3 seed. I'm not saying it *will* happen, but people are underrating just how beat-up we were last year, and how good we were during the brief periods where our starters were actually getting some run together. Not to mention the fact that we're going to have an *actual bench* this season for the first time since Kyrie left— Josh Richardson and Dennis Schroder may not be stars, but they're *huge* upgrades from Jeff Teague and Grant Williams."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"We added Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Dennis Schroder to a team that didn't have a bench and was *constantly* injured last year, while losing Fournier (who played sixteen games for us) and Kemba (who played 43 games for us and wasn't very good even when he *did* play). Seriously, I cannot stress how poor our bench was, and how much more our rotation was impacted by injury and COVID— Jeff Teague, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters started a combined **17** games for us."

"Celtics will be a fun team with a lot to prove. They had a disappointing season last year going .500, being forced into the play-in, and then getting gentleman’s swept in the first round.    Tatum is clearly a star, but he hasn’t broken into “top 5” players in the league territory which he believes he is. Coming off a gold medal, this is his season to prove he should be in that top 5 conversation.    Schroder passed up $84 mil to sign for $5 mil and wants to prove he’s worth a big contract after this season. Look for him to ball out.    They also have a bunch of former first round picks who have shown potential but haven’t established themselves in the league yet. Guys like Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, and Aaron Nesmith will get a chance to show what they’ve got.     They also have a new coach in Ime Udoka who’s never been a head coach before and wants to prove he belongs."
"He had Jaylen Brown, but after Jaylen and Kemba got injured he was throwing passes to Luke Kornet and Grant Williams. I would say that is a cast of misfits..."
"Scorching hot take to call people ""overzealous"" for defending a guy who went for 26/7/4 despite [his most frequent lineup by minutes played](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2021/lineups/) including a guy who was traded at the deadline (Theis) and one of the worst offensive players in the entire league (Thompson). The Celtics got Brooklyn in the first round and had no Jaylen Brown, no Kemba and no Robert Williams, but still took a game from them because Tatum dropped a 50 piece. He went for 50, 40 and 32 in those last 3 games...hard to put anything on him in terms of ""impact"". You can't hold it against him that 3 starters couldn't even suit up in the playoffs and during the regular season the Celtics had Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye playing 20 minutes a night."
I have special deal for you my friend. Grant “goat” Williams and Carson Edwards for Wood leave it or take it.
"I'm guessing the starting lineup will be Schroeder, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Williams with a bench of Pritchard, Nesmith, Richardson, Horford, Kanter? Or Grant Williams?"
"Boston gave him away to get rid of Kemba.  They gave away Desmond Bane last year to get rid of Kenter.  I think they also gave up Tybulle to get rid of Baynes.  What a mess especially when they retained guys like Carson Edwards, Grant Williams, and Langford"
"I think we’d like to have Dennis and Richardson both off the bench. Let them have their usage without hogging from the Jays.   Starters: Smart, Nesmith (for shooting), Jaylen, Jayson, Horford  Reserves: Dennis, Pritchard, Richardson, Grant Williams, Robert Williams"
Correction:   Smart/JB/JT/Horford/Williams  Schroeder/Kanter/Grant/PP/Nesmith  Dunn/Langford  No?
Grant Williams made his own mock drafts growing up. Definitely was blogging under a pseudonym
"Yeah, that’s how they got the 30th, from the Suns in trading Baynes away in order to sign Kemba. Suns got that pick for Bledsoe.   It was for sure a waste to get rid of the 30th pick, but the previous GM did not want to have too many rookies at once.   In 2019 Danny Ainge collected too many young  players (14th pick Romeo, 20 Grant Williams, 33 Carsen Edwards, 51 Waters, undrafted Tacko Fall).   In 2020 Danny had 4 picks again; 14, 26, 30, 47. He said he didn’t want three rookies, so he took Nesmith and Pritchard with the first two, dumped the 30th for 2 seconds, and used the 47th on a stash in Yam Madar.   Brad Stevens took over from Danny in 21 and it seems he is interested in doing some different things, primarily getting rid of bad contracts and aiming to get some experienced role playing vets to help the Jays.   All these moves are wasteful but at least the roster is a little more focused with a clear hierarchy which the team has missed for a while."
The OG Geek Freak  Sorry Grant Williams
"Guys a sniper. No doubt in my mind he's a rotation nba player. If ojeleye, grant williams, langford, waters, and carsen edwards can get minutes on an nba team gelo can easily find a spot"
I’m convinced If Grant Williams were 5 inches taller hed be an all-star Center. He has it all to play 5 he’s just so short for the position.
Nah Grant Williams on the Celtics
"Grant Williams is a borderline NBA player, does this put pressure on Stevens not to cut or trade him?"
"I didn’t know Grant Williams was a big Catan fan, I like him even more now"
"If you’re a college basketball fan, you’ll definitely know who Grant Williams is"
"I mean he is an isolation type scorer, and with those types of players they can be a little to fond on creating for themselves. A lot of people have compared Tatum to Kobe and Kobe had the same faults. Tatum is a shot creator and needs to work on his passing, but is a solid passer for his position and what was/is around him (he literally was kicking the ball out to Kornet and Grant Williams). So yes I do partially agree with your sentiment, but I think Tatum's lack of passing is greatly exaggerated."
Grant Williams
"He had an incident during 2019 summer league (two flagrants including a pretty bad one against Grant Williams I believe), but since then he hasn't had any on court incidents. It seems like he's matured."
He literally swung on Grant Williams over a back screen in summer league but go off I guess
"Depends, maybe Smart wants out? He's on the last year of his deal, Boston isn't going to invest heavily in Smart. You aren't contending really this year, and it gives him a chance to get a ring.   If they lock Dennis into a cheap deal for 2 years. They can go into 2022 Free Agency with pretty much J&amp;J on the books. Maybe go all out for Simmons with Shroeder, Langford, Nesmith, Grant Williams + 4 FRP and some seconds.   Then with your empty roster sign Bradley Beal and Patric Beverly.   Pat Bev - Beal - Brown - Tatum - Simmons  Now *that*'s a small ball lineup that nobody wants to ever play.   Plus, the it's not even like the Rocket's Microball:  6""1 - 6""3 - 6""6 - 6""8 - 6""11  Plus the wingspan is crazy."
Smart+Josh Richardson+Grant williams 1 frp 2 swaps 2 second rounds
Carsen Edwards and Grant Williams
"After disappointing seasons with their respective co-stars, AD, KD, and Kawhi all demand trades to the Celtics for Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Romeo Langford, respectively. After all these years, Ainge finally gets his guy(s).  ...also we still trade Horford for Beal because why not"
"Ok, once it's a done deal, we'll send you Bruno Fernando and Grant Williams."
"These comparison are always based on false parallels.   One, the players back then didn't have the freedom they do now due to stricter free agency rules. It's like adults these days saying ""We didn't eat Tide Pods when were were kids."" No shit. They didn't exist, but you were huffing glue.   Guys demanded trades back in the day all the time when their front offices performed like shit.   &amp;#x200B;  Two, LeBron was never surrounding with the same talent as these other guys. How does Drew Gooden and Mo Williams compare to Kareem, Worthy, Scott, Green, and Cooper? How do they compare to Pippen and Grant/Rodman? How do they compare to Parish, McHale, DJ, Ainge, and Walton?   They don't.    And how many dynasties did Jordan beat? Did he ever beat a team as good as the Spurs? Or Warriors?"
"Magic got paired with Kareem as a rookie.   Kobe got paired with Shaq.   Duncan pair with Robinson.   And Jordan didn't win shit until he got Pippen and Grant/Rodman.   Mean, LeBron over here trying to win with Mo Williams and Drew Gooden, AND GETTING TO THE FINALS WITH THAT and people shit on him for creating his own opportunities.  I'm sure if the Cavs got him prime Kareem, Worthy, Nixon, Cooper, Scott and Green, he would have won a few titles with."
"&gt;????? &gt;lmao what top 15 player??? Pippen?. Was  rookie in 88, he didn't even average 10ppg and wasn't the Pippin we all know and love.   When exactly do you think Jordan entered the league?    By Jordan's 8th year (92) Pippen was already an all star, all NBA and all defense player who was a critical part of them winning 2 championships, while putting up 21/7/7.  He received MVP votes that year while sharing the floor with Jordan, and was top 15 in basically every advanced metric (vorp, bpm, ws, ws/48, per, etc).    He was far and away the best #2 option in the league, and he would have been the clear #1 option for many teams in the league.   &gt;we are talkin about Jordan's first 8 years and LeBron first 8 give or take. &gt; &gt;LeBron teams were better than Jordan's, no question.  On what fucking planet are mo williams and an over the hill Antwan Jamison better than Pippen and Grant? Nobody who actually watched either of those seasons could possibly believe that.   That's like saying JR Smith is a better #2 than Kawhi, it's just ludicrous."
"To heck with taking the easy path, let’s see if I can do 50!  C - David Robinson (50)  PF - Horace Grant (54)  SF - Buck Williams (52)  SG - … Keyon… Dooling? (51)  PG - Rick Robey (53) it was down to you or Buddha to run point so here we are."
"&gt; First 3 peat was Jordan, Pippen and Grant. Really not that crazy of a supporting cast.   .......... Pippen is a Hall of Famer. LeBron had a total of 3 all-star appearances from all his teammates while in Cleveland -- 2 from Ilgauskas and one from Mo Williams. Jordan's teammates pass that without even counting Pippen.   &gt;  Just a couple of solid pieces and Jordan would make any team title contenders.  Except he didn't for 7 years. And when he retired the first time his team only got 2 games worse in the regular season. People like you who act like his resume was perfect and never watched him play just destroy his actual legacy."
Grant Williams and Carsen Edwards have looked nice at times as well. They’ve got a bunch of potential pieces.
"UT has a randomly great strength coach for the basketball team. Look at Grant Williams and Admiral Schofield, they're jacked too"
 I think he's a good comp to what Grant Williams can be in this league.  I still have faith.
Smart and Dunn maybe add Grant Williams
"Basketball reference has him tied for 6th behind Dwight/WCS/Grant Williams/Favors/Powell, wonder where the discrepancy is there."
"Hes 53rd if you don’t put a minimum minutes requirement.  If you limit it to players who played more than 500 minutes this past season he’s 14th.    The players ahead of him include Isaiah Hartenstein, Javale, Goga, Dwight, Okongwu, Boogie, Mo Wagner, Wiseman, Cauley-Stein, Damian Jones, Grant Williams, Derrick Favors, and Dwight Powell."
"Number 2 recruiting class in the country is coming in this year. Last year was a bit disappointing but produced 2 first round picks. The couple of years before that produced Grant Williams, Admiral Schofield, Jordan Bone, and a couple other drafted players. Rick Barnes has the program running as well as it really could at what is at least nominally a football school. Nows a good time to get started  I lived in Knoxville for about 20 years and went to school there. The only other time in my life that the basketball has been this good was peak Bruce Pearl, but those teams never really made NBA talent, if you care about that"
Ahhh so you want Carsen Edwards and Grant Williams. I’ll bite!
"You'd have to give up Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and a protected first."
Oof - do you all feel like you're punting this season then?  Your bench depth is going to rely pretty heavily on young guys too it seems like - the guys you mentioned and also Grant Williams
"As soon as next summer, really. They can put all their eggs in the Beal basket (which I’m still not sure is the right choice), or they can add actual quality depth all around the edges rather than having to play Grant Williams Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford big minutes"
&gt; Grant Williams and Romeo Langfords jock strap.  This almost reads as if they share a jock strap lmao.
"If you were an nba gm and had to pick a player to start a franchise and you could pick anyone in the nba, the obvious two choices are ricky rubio and grant williams. I think i would have to go with grant williams"
Meanwhile I’m out here hoping my team will sign one nba player so grant williams and semi ojeleye don’t have to play major minutes
I'm sure they'll do a whole FA pod tomorrow with KOC and he will derail the conversations about how Boston could somehow land Zion this year for Grant Williams and Romeo Langfords jock strap.
You all were stocked with talent like four years ago. Now you have three players and Grant Williams
"Fucking nailed it.   I hope this is the first thing Ime fixes: shot distribution. Theres not another team in the league that would let Marcus Smart shoot 6 threes a game, Carsen Edwards shoot from 30 feet, or let Grant Williams play minutes.   The Celtics have been mismanaged for years. Between Ainge's asset hungry FO and Steven's college basketball offense, there's a reason the Celtics have fallen short time and again."
"I disagree, I think our fans were excited about him the same way we are about all young prospects. His role as a ""victory cigar"" where fans cheered for him to get garbage time minutes became pretty cringe, but it definitely originated from a positive place. All fans tend to be super high on all their prospects, and the posts old on the Celtics sub debating whether Grant Williams will become more like Draymond or AD can be considered evidence that Boston is no different."
Grant Williams 😎
Grant williams. Take it or leave it
doesn't matter grant williams will clamp him
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now
Imagine trading down to grab Grant Williams and Carsen Edwards when this guy was right there.
"So since the 2016 draft there are a few candidates  * Raptors got: Siakam,Vanvleet,OG,Terence Davis,Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes * Heat got: Bam,Herro,Robinson,Precious and Nunn * Sixers: Simmons,Fultz,Thybulle and Maxey  But I think its the celtics: Brown,Tatum,Williams,Grant,Langford and Pritchard"
Lol fam the only other reliable scorer on the team was Brown. Everyone else was a walking brick.  A Tatum contested shot is better than whatever Grant Williams does
Moses is a fine player for the contract he is on. That is such an essential part of valuing the player - he averaged 8 &amp; 9 this season in 18 MPG while he is being paid 1.8 mil for the next 3 years. Our only Centers are now timelord who has significant injury concerns while also being on the last year of his rookie deal and 35 year old Al Horford. Grant Williams and Bruno are not 5s.
They didn’t want Grant Williams or Langford lol
"I like Ainge but he made some poor moves since the 18-19 offseason.  In the 2019 draft we drafted Langford, Thybulle, and Grant Williams with FRPs then traded Thybulle for Edwards. Edwards and Williams are both undersized at their position which was a strange decision. We then sign another undersized guard in Kemba during free agency and lost Rozier in the process. We are meant to be in title contention but suddenly we have Edwards, G Williams, Langford (among others) all taking up roster spots when we need vets. I understand some of this was done due to pressure from Kyrie/Horf walking but this draft and the Kemba deal hurt us.   The following season Hayward walks and we fumble the S&amp;T and end up with a TPE instead of meaningful players that were linked in a Pacers deal. The media reports we were asking too much from Indiana. We have 3 mid-late firsts again like last year but actually draft well but now we have drafted 7 young guys in the past two offseasons. We trade off Bane for two 2nds and sign Thompson for the MLE and sit on our hands at the deadline with an unbalanced roster with the only meaningful addition being Fournier.   If you look at our roster last season, our backup PF/SF/PG depth was poor and Ainge was struggling to make the right moves, or any for that matter. I'm happy he left mutually as overall he's been excellent apart from the past two offseasons. You could see Stevens' frustration with the Roster this year."
"From what I have read, nope just the TPE. Nice move by the Celtics.  Maybe the change of scenery will benefit him and I would say pretty confidently that replacing any minutes of Grant Williams, Edwards, Ojeyele or Waters with Kosh Richardson should make Celtics fans feel good about this move.  Curious what the Fournier situation Play out to be.  The TPE will end up being Kris Dunn, Josh Richardson, Evan Forunier (maybe just a rental?). I think whether or not Forunier re sings goes a long way I’m determining how successful the use of that TPE was"
Beth it’s either him or Grant Williams
"“Lebron just can’t be in tier 1. He’s a pantheon guy for sure, but Bird had to play with a broken back! Lebron can’t play with a bum ankle, c’mon. Hey, do you think the Celts could trade Grant Williams and some picks for Anthony Davis?”"
I’ve got Grant Williams
"Haha so you're gonna use last year as hard evidence that the Jays need Bradley Beal? Most games missed due to injuries and covid, with 50% of Kemba Walker as our starting Point Guard? Maybe if we didn't have to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for 20 MPG, and start Tristan Thompson for 43 games, things would have been different. Our best 5 barely played together last year. If you think the Celtics were a Bradley Beal away from not being a .500 team then I don't know what you were watching."
"bro come the fuck on. Jesus the Celtics are so absolutely fucked, gonna go pray that Romeo Langford and Grant Williams can be legit rotation players"
Grant Williams and three seconds for us
"Plus we have the GOAT Grant Williams, not sure I want those guys taking touches away from him."
"What??  Maybe you are right because it was far better!  - CP3 last year was even better than this year, with SGA it feel like it was more feeling than with Booker. - SGA in 3rd year had better season than Booker in 3rd year. Maybe playing for winning basketball it could be even better. In the PO then i don't know but he had more experience than Booker there too (with 13 playoff games already played, and a game 7). - Gallo is/was better than any 3 or 4 the Suns had. - Same for Grant, which was sold for mid season last year, he could have been still there with a friendly contract like the one in Detroit. - Adams is for sure better on D than Ayton, which offensive upset was not that useful in a CP3-Booker team if not for grabbing lobs. - Dort vs Bridges is a fare comparison. - 6th man Schroder is far better than Cam Payne, but really a shit ton (traded for garbag). - Diallo (traded for garbage) and Bazely could provide fresh legs from the bench and arguably been better than any 7th - 8th man in Suns rotation. - Same for Fergusson and Noel, the later in particular would be useful in a finals match up against Giannis.  Ok I'm most than sure that the OKC team was much better than this year Suns projected into this season. Maybe they just lack a scorer like D Book but have a lot of other offensive weapons (Schroder, Gallo, Grant). And also coaching was important, Monty Williams was very good this year, but they could have changed their coach for the better anyway.  I know it's hard to admit that OKC basically decided to passed on a good team that could have ultimately lead to a Finals after 10 seasons. All in the name of the rebuilding.  But core concept that fortune help the brave and while the Suns was brave enough to build a team around unproven Booker and Ayton the Thunder was not to do the same around SGA and CP3. CP3 wanted out because the team have decided not to win. Dumbest decision ever."
Grant Williams plus 3 first round picks sounds fair to me.
Unless that pick is Grant Williams
"Yea like the roster is:  Superstars:  Dame and durant  all stars/stars: booker, Bam, Khris, lavine, Tatum  good role players: Love, Johnson,  Green,   Should not be on the team: McGee, Grant,   &amp;#x200B;  on the 2012 squad you had:  Superstars:  Lebron, Bryant, Durant, Westbrook, OLYMPIC MELO  Allstars/Stars: Davis, Paul, Love  Good role players: Chandler, Williams, Iguodala, harden  Should not be on the team: none.   &amp;#x200B;  Dream team  Superstars:  Erwing, Jorden, Drexler, Barkley, Magic  Allstars/Stars: Bird, Pippin, Robinson, Malone, Stockton,   Good role players: Laettner, Mullin.   Should not be on the team: none.   &amp;#x200B;  So breaking down 2020 vs 2012 vs 1992  Superstars 2 vs 4 vs 5  All stars: 5 vs 3 vs 5  Good role players: 3 vs 4 vs 2  Should not be on the team: 2 vs 0 vs 0  &amp;#x200B;  Like its no contest that this roaster does not compare to the other 2."
"Celtics never gave yabu much of a chance. And then they bring in grant Williams and give him 20 mpg to shit it up. We miss you yabu, come back."
grant williams and a second
"No, it doesn't. The biggest issues on the team right now are that we have not one single natural playmaker on the team, and we have no depth at 4 behind Tatum. Lillard is like Kemba on steroids and I've been watching r/bostonceltics tell me for two years that a volume scoring PG is a bad fit for the Jays, so that doesn't work, and on top of that his contract would destroy the ""financial flexibility"" everyone was touching themselves over when we swapped Kemba for Horford. Even with Lillard we still don't have a single pass-first player on the roster and Grant Williams is still our best 4 behind Tatum, and we also would not have the space to give them a better supporting cast.   The scoring PG experiment is over - this is the Jays' team now, and the more time the organization spends considering other paths, the more time is wasted with two of the best two-way wings under 25 in the league locked up long term."
"The package I saw was Smart, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, grant Williams and like 4 FRP and swaps. Definitely a solid package but it pretty much guts us and doesn’t give the Wiz a real building block player."
"Grant Williams  [He'd play boardgames with them](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2020/02/19/nba-boston-celtics-grant-williams-loves-catan-why-dont-you/) and also probably [bring us a candle as a gift](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/why-grant-williams-gave-out-candles-celtics-staff-and-teammates).  That dude seems so wholesome and nice, which is a shame because if he was more of a badass then he'd be more useful to us on the court."
"I’d like to have Beal but I don’t want to give up Brown, Rob Williams or Smart. I’d give up 1sts, 2nds and Grant Williams (he’s really good I promise)"
"They'd be offering something like Smart, 2 young guys (Nesmith, Langford, Rob Williams, or Grant Williams) Thompson's expiring and 3 first rounders. Probably a bunch of 2nds as well. Not the best offer, but probably second best to what GS could offer, so it would only really work if Beal said he wouldn't re-sign with other teams."
"Thankfully Celtics got rid of most players I hated. Ojeley, Carson Edwards, Waters all gone. Thank you Brad Stevens.      People also hate Grant Williams but he still has a chance. So I guess that leaves Josh Richardson to hate but we have enough decent players that he could fall out the rotation and I won’t mind."
"It *was* Carsen Edwards, but he gone. Now it's probably Grant Williams, which is a shame cause he's honestly a pretty solid end-of-bench type guy even if he doesn't improve at all"
"I disagree. I see this lineup as a bottom 5 defensive lineup. LaVine and DeRozan are decent Shot creators but not high end ones. And both are bad at best on defense with LaVine being just merely bad and DeRozan being one of the worst in the league.  Also Boston also has Horford, Smart (who I'd take over everyone besides LaVine on the Bulls), Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Dennis Schroeder, Josh Richardson, Grant Williams. Celtics have better high end talent and better depth."
If timelord stays healthy and plays substantial minutes you will see tatums assists go up. For the last 2 seasons it seems like  90 percent of his assists were to grant Williams or semi ojele wide open in the corner just to shoot a brick or to someone cutting to the basket just to pass it again for no reason. It’s no wonder why he doesn’t pass
Grant Williams is going to be a stud role player by the time he’s 28.  I just don’t think he’s gonna get there before the celtics have to move on.
You forgetting Grant Williams?
"Here's the thing with that: Almost every great player has a super team.   Magic was drafted by a team with Kareem and Norm Nixon. Then got Cooper, Worthy, AC Green, and Bryon Scott.   That's a super team. There's at least 3 HOFers on that team.  Bird played with Parish, McHale, DJ, and Ainge, and had Walton coming off the bench.   That's a super team.  Kobe was a rookie on a team that had THREE All-Stars (Shaq, Eddie Jones, and Nick Van EXel). Then they swapped one out for Glen Rice and Horry and Fox. Then later he got Gasol, Bynum, and Odom.  That's a super team.   They were just lucky that their franchises put together a super team and they didn't have to.   Had Bird been drafted by the Cavs... that would not have been pretty.   Has Magic been drafted by the Bulls at the time... that would not have been pretty.   Had Kobe gone to Charlotte... people wouldn't be talking about Kobe the same way they do now.   And Jordan had to wait several seasons before his team put him in a place where he could contend. He finally had Pippen and Grant (and Cartwright is a grossly underrated pieced given the importance of his defense on Ewing).   Then Jordan got reloaded with Pippen, Rodman, Toni, and Harper.   &amp;#x200B;  In Cleveland, LeBron started in the basement. He NEVER had a player as good as Pippen in his first stint there. And he STILL got to the finals.   Then he took matters into his own hands.   When I look at the Heat, and where Bosh and Wade were in their careers, I'd say that I'd take Magic or Bird's supporting cast over his any day of the week.   And yet, people aren't dismissive of Magic and Bird by saying ""Yeah... but they played on super teams.""  And had the Warriors not signed KD, they'd have only had one title. The difference between the Warriors and Cleveland is that the Warriors knew what they were doing: Curry, Klay, Barnes, Draymond... trades for Bogut. Cleveland got Mo Williams and a Shaq they picked up at Play-It-Again Sports."
"Bc he would worth much more with a Jumpshot. His next contract will be predicated on it. It's the difference between 100M and 300M max.   Besides, it's not like his form is broken, he has a nice form, it's just matter of doing it and reps.   Grant Williams bricked 47 straight 3s. Until the 1st dropped. Since he was around 40%, mostly from the corners.   4 years is long time to get a jumper, and 200M is a lot of money to pass on"
"Heck, I'll go with three college players.  Shaquille O'Neal. Brad Daugherty.  Chris Webber.  Derrick Coleman.  Larry Nance.  Dan Majerle.  Mark Price.  Danny Manning.  Joe Dumars.  Reggie Williams.  Isiah Thomas.  Grant Hill."
"what are those holes?  They had no bench depth and no bench scoring; they added Schroeder, Richardson, and Horford  They were really thin on wing defense after Jaylen, Smart, and Tatum.  Getting rid of Kemba while adding Shroeder and Richardson is a big improvement over bums like TT, Semi, and Grant Williams combining for like 4k minutes  The whole team was hurt or sick last year.    Jaylen, Tatum, and RWilliams improving again.  I think people have underestimated Boston as a legitimate top 5-10 contender in the league this year."
So what would the lineup be  Schroeder/Smart  Brown Tatum  Grant  Williams   Actually that's a pretty good starting lineup if healthy.
"Sleeping on players is an important part of reheab. They say that sleeping on a zeller brother will cure what ails you, and the fluffy belly of harden will cure the worst migraine. For the Celtics grant Williams looks like a great sleeper"
"i don't know about that, MJ obviously had a lot of arrogance but he wasn't socially incapable like this. in *the jordan rules* there's a fair bit of him chopping it up with pippen and grant, being nice to that year's rookie scott williams, etc."
We have Grant at home  grant at home: grant williams
Grant Williams
"I agree that the Celtics front office needs to be aggressive while being lucky enough to have Tatum and brown on the team. That being said, over the last 3-4 years, I don’t think they’ve made any particularly terrible moves (at that time), aside from maybe not trading rozier and mook in 2019 prior to their FA departure.   Trading for kyrie was absolutely the right move even if it didn’t work out. Same with signing and then later not resigning gordon and Al. Both those guys got overpaid. The Kemba signing was a bit reactionary to kyrie, al, and rozier leaving but at the time, Kemba was coming off all nba selection and had been an Ironman for the hornets. Just shitty injury luck with him and Gordon.  Now that being said, I think the Celtics front office has done a terrible jpm with the draft since we got Tatum. Romeo has all the talent in the world but can’t stay healthy after 3 years and grant Williams is a bonafide scrub. Nesmith and Pritchard look like they’ll develop into solid role players (spot starters) and rob williams is really fucking good but like Romeo, can’t really stay healthy. They also traded away FRPs in salary dumps and for Edwards and I think those failures are primarily the reason for the “talent drain” over the last couple years.  I do like our young core though. Smart Brown Tatum Williams Pritchard Nesmith are all locked in for the long term at frankly below market deals (especially brown and Williams should he be able to stay healthy). I trust brad to make the necessary acquisitions and def think with the nets aging out soon that Boston will be the best team in the East in 3 years"
Grant Williams - the thickest
"Bunch of rookies, sophomore and 3rd year player on our bench last season. Now we have a decent bench. Semi Ojeleye, Recovering Langford, Rookie Neismith, Sophomore Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters (both under 6 feet), Jabari Parker, Washed TT, White guy from the bulls and Tacko Fall. Oh I forgot Kemba in and out Walker. Did you even know those guys? Lmfaoo"
this is me when Grant Williams was drafted.
"Barnes is more of a KG guy tho. Lanky PF that can pass and defend? Deff KG.   Stocky guy that can pass and defend is Draymond. E.g. Keldon Johnson, Grant Williams, Lu Dort."
"Starters: Smart, JRich, Brown, Tatum, Horford  Bench: Schroder, Pritchard, Nesmith, Juancho, Williams  I think there's a good chance that Nesmith and Williams replace JRich and Horford in the starting lineup as the season goes on. We've also got a bunch of not-great-but-borderline-rotation 4s in Juancho, Grant, and Jabari; I figure those three guys are fighting for that last spot in the ten-man, but I'll give the edge to the guy who can at least *theoretically* space the floor (even if he can't actually shoot very well)."
"Smart - Richardson - Brown - Tatum - Horford  Bench is Schroder, Rob Williams, Pritchard, and then after that it’s really going to depend on matchups. Some nights it could be Nesmith and Hernangomez, other nights could be Kanter and Langford. I assume Grant Williams, Jabari Parker and Bruno Fernando will be getting minutes if we have injuries or need to rest guys during the season.  I only say Rob Williams off the bench because of injury concerns and I assume he will be starting by the playoffs or at least seeing a significant increase in minutes as the year goes on, similar to last year."
"Best case: Second round exit with one or all of Nesmith, Langford, and Grant Williams stepping up and showing real promise as a future starter.   Worst case: Play in leading to first round thumping, Time Lord continues to get injured, Jaylen/Jayson get a little anxious and make some comments about team structure leading to a bad panic trade."
"Yes for this year, and probably next summer you will keep the same core of players and see who fits and who doesn't. But after 2 seasons a lot of decisions are going to be made that break up the 7 guys you're talking about, that's not really my opinion that's just how the league works. I just looked this up for another comment, here's what today's rosters look like compared to the start of the 19/20 season for teams in the east. The stars like Embiid, Tatum, and Butler clearly stay on their teams. Here are your non star players still on the team from the 19/20 rosters  Sixers have Shake, Tobias, and Thybulle. Celtics have Grant Williams and Marcus Smart. Bucks have Lopez, Connaughton, and Thanasis. Heat have Robinson, Herro, and Haslem. Iggy counts but he left so it's still roster turnover. Go 3 seasons back and it's 2 rotation players AT MOST for all these teams.  Only looking at your cap sheet you simply cannot pay all your guys. A few will definitely still be around, but you're talking about 6 players here in Cam, DeAndre, Heuter, Capela, Okongwu, and Collins. In 2-3 years you'll probably only have 2, maybe 3 still around. This is all assuming you don't go out and try to trade for a star to pair with Trae. The sixers, Bucks, Heat, and Celtics already went through this, I know it feels like you can grow naturally but when Cam, and DeAndre are up for extensions in 2 years next to Trae and John Collins making 25+ you're just going to lose some due to FA or trades. I don't think I'm being unrealistic at all, I mean you straight can't afford those 7 players in 2 years."
"It's more of a 3 year cycle than a 2 year cycle but when you're building a contender around a young player usually only a few players stick around who aren't the stars. Now they just locked up a good number of these guys but you can't pay everyone once the other extensions kick in. Just looking in the east and comparing the starting day 19/20 rosters with todays' rosters, Sixers, Celtics, Bucks, and Heat only have like 3-5 guys total still on the team and that includes the stars who obviously stick around. Sixers only have Shake, Tobias, and Thybulle still around from that team. Celtics only have Grant Williams and Marcus Smart, Bucks only have Lopez, Connaughton, and Thanasis"
"Grant's fine. Ignore this dude. With that said, we never had minutes for Carsen and at the moment he'd be 6th in the guard rotation behind:  Smart  Brown  Schroder  Pritchard  Richardson  + Dunn  + Edwards   And he's there for a reason. He can't create anything offensively in the NBA and he is outsized on defense, despite his best efforts.   Juancho will sit behind Horford (and along side Parker/Grant Williams) on the bench. We don't need him for long stretches but him soaking minutes against lesser teams to preserve horford for playoffs will be far more valuable than what edwards/Dunn bring to the roster."
"its either him or grant williams/jabari ""somehow still in the league"" parker. not a lot of options"
"Kobe was drafted with a guy who might have been the best player in NBA history at that exact peak. He then got Pau Gasol to compete with as well  Michael Jordan got Pippen who was the perfect number 2 and he was 1-9 in the first round without him. He had a great supporting cast of guys like Harper, Grant, Kerr, and Kukoc and later added Dennis Rodman  Lebron's best help was Illgauskas Larry Hughes and Mo Williams"
"Jordan won for the first time in year 7, having made the conference finals the 2 years before and with Scottie Pippen having made his first all star game the year before at age 24 and having improved drastically each year of his career. Also, 24 year old Horace Grant was following a similar trajectory to eventual all star level. Jordan's top 2 teammates were 24 and improving each year. 3 other teammates in the regular rotation were under 25.  Bron left the Cavs after year 7, having made the conference finals once in the 3 years prior (where Bron averaged 39-8-8) and there was 1 player in the Cavs rotation younger than him, Daniel Gibson (not in playoff rotation). The youngest player in the rotation was 26 year old Delonte West, averaging a whopping 7 points and 2.5 assists per game playing half the game. His best teammates were 33 year old Antawn Jamison, who they gave up their 2010 pick for, and 27 year old Mo Williams whose production stagnated at best."
"the concern is if their young core plateaus in development and they turn out to be good role players instead of a second star next to trae young. You need at least 2 stars to compete in the league. Blazers over committed to a flawed dame and cj core while overvaluing anfernee simons and zach collins, both of who now has no trade value. Celtics chest of first round picks ainge refused to trade for stars turned out to be mediocre role players like grant williams, semi, and langford."
"May I interest you in getting a reliable back up in Al Horford + two amazing young players (incredible upside) - Grant Williams and Romeo Langford, for Ben Simmons? Definitely a fair trade, just trust me on this."
"May I interest you in getting a reliable back up in Al Horford + two amazing young players (incredible upside) - Grant Williams and Romeo Langford, for Ben Simmons? Definitely a fair trade, just trust me on this."
"And got blocked by Grant Williams of all people, I'll never forget that"
"I was born in 1990 and have experienced every feeling a sports fan can experience, below is from memory, and I won’t be held to accuracy.   1990s: Inherited exceptional greatness. I won’t go into it, but, I believed this was just the way the world was supposed to be. I was terribly wrong.   1999: The bottom falls out. We are the worst team in the league. I still listened to every game on AM radio. As much as Krause wanted it, Toni couldn’t do it by himself.   99: We land the first pick with Elton brand and Ron artest (16). At least the rebuild is efficient, going from a 3 peat to #1 pick? Eh? Not bad (kill me now).  2000: Were once again the worst - I do my best to help AM radio ratings. We draft #4/#7 and pick up the all time great Marcus fizer (!) and Jamal Crawford (traded for Chris mihm, thank you lord). We miss on “free agents” whether it be Tmac, Duncan, and grant hill. No1 wants to come. The rebuild is going fine, or something.   2001: once again the worst, and we decide our former #1 pick is trash after putting up 20-10 for 3 years, trading him for the #2 pick (tyson chandler), and using #4 (eddy curry). Who needs Garnett and Tim Duncan when we can just draft em? Baby bulls baby, let’s go. Also, we sign Eddie freaking Robinson to a 4 or 5 year deal at $32m (fml)   2002: we still suck but land the #2 pick (jay Williams), and things start to turn around with our youth. Some flashes with our young guys, but there’s just too much youth and we’re terrible again.   2003: a week before the draft jay crashes his motorcycle and we are once again fucked. Luckily it happened before the draft and we get Kirk. Pretty sure we signed jalen rose here or last year and Eddie Robinson fucking sucks.   2004: draft luol Ben Gordon and duhon. Excellent draft. Team starts to click the last couple weeks and we finally win 30 games!!!!!   2005: I believe we sign Ben Wallace which was our first big free agent in a long time, I’m not counting jalen or Scottie. We have no pick.   2006: I have been drinking and this is getting exhausting. Just know we fuck up by trading for tyrus Thomas, landing Derrick rose, joakim, and jimmy butler. Everything after that was a tragedy but we’re finally on the precipice of MAYBE a nice rebuild here.   In Short, outside of 4 years from like 2006-2011, we have sucked."
Grant Williams
"I think it’s eerily similar to the Fultz situation. Really hard to establish the value of a guy with the yips. But similar to that situation, once moved, Fultz definitely showed some brilliant flashes. Just needed a change from Philly (and honestly who wouldn’t. Look what those monsters did to that hitchhiking robot).  Now, Simmons is still able to be FAR more effective than Fultz even when not shooting. So we’re not really talking apples to apples here. But having said that, if I’m Portland I’m sure not trading Dame to Philly for Ben Simmons.  It’s really a shame the trade with Houston last year didn’t work out. Would’ve made the East a lot more fun and balanced, and Simmons could’ve had a team of young guys to lead with zero expectations for success.  You have to think if he goes to Portland in a 1-1 type deal + picks, there will be a hell of a lot of pressure for him to perform near Dame’s level, which he isn’t capable of.  Sacramento is a better option for him TBH. Or I mean, I’ll throw Marcus Smart and Grant Williams plus a protected second in a deal to get him on my Celtics. I’m joking, but Darryl if you’re reading this, reach out to Brad and do that deal."
Norman Powell fouling Jayson Tatum trying to get the rebound after Grant Williams missed both Free Throws in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.
"Probably Bobby Jones. Born in Charlotte NC , went to Carolina and won a ring with Dr. J on the 76ers. 8 All Defensive teams and was a 4 time All Star. Also had the GOAT nickname in my opinion “The Secretary of Defense”.  Patrick Williams and Grant Williams are also from Charlotte. And Steph was born in Ohio but primarily raised in Charlotte."
my favorite was grant williams + carsen edwards + 2nd for harrison barnes
"I agree that EM's best position on defense is power forward right now, but really disagree with playing him there on offense. The only ""modern"" aspect of the Cavs offense last year was that we had a bunch of decent shooters at the 4, which opened up the floor so the guards could get into the paint. It is nearly impossible to have even an ok offense playing two bigs who don't have great ball skills and can't shoot.   I think Mobley will be best as a facilitator from the elbow or out of a horns set, where he can pass to guys coming off screens or cutting to the rim.   And if we are being completely honest about it, I he is probably going to get bullied by NBA forwards, too, as a rookie. Just in our division he will be playing against Giannis, Sabonis, Grant, and Patrick Williams."
Grant Williams for president The Voice of the Common Man   Lol
Grant Williams  Jeff Green  Jerami Grant
"Yea I mean this doesn’t really matter too much bc you’re right that they both need to improve. I would just disagree with the first point—teams didn’t have to worry about Tatum passing to the open man bc way too often the open man was Grant Williams/semi ojeleye/Daniel theis + Thompson at the same time, etc. Obviously brown had to deal with that as well, I’m just higher on tatum’s ability to grow into an offensive hub based on what I’ve seen him do in spurts."
"Yeah, but really, we're not counting on him to do that much. Fill minutes, provide solid defense, hopefully shoot at least a *little* better than 33% on threes next year. Ideally, with Schroder and Nesmith around, he won't even be starting for us. Nobody thinks he's a *gamechanger* or anything, but he's a pretty big upgrade on the likes of Jeff Teague, Brad Wanamaker, and Grant Williams on the bench."
"The Celtics are significantly more deep than last year, hopefully will be fully healthy, and Tatum + Brown as your two best players has proven to be a conference finals team in years past. They have Schroeder, Smart, Horford, JRich, PP, Timelord and potential in Nesmith becoming a reliable rotation player plus guys like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford who tend to make good decisions and can give you quality minutes. They also brought back Kanter who is a body for them when they have to go up against bigger centers. Idk how you can say they don’t have depth when they’re 10 deep of legitimate players.   I’d agree on the coaching change but I think the Celtics have always been a defensive and scrappy/edgy team which is all I’ve heard coming out of Ime’s mouth so I don’t think the handoff will be as hard as outlined above + Tatum got to work with him in Tokyo.   Philly does have an MVP candidate in Embiid but who’s to say Tatum doesn’t ascend to an MVP candidate this year? And who’s to say Tatum + Brown is inferior to Embiid + Simmons?   As for the hawks, they honestly remind me of the 2018 Celtics and I think they are a really good team but they don’t have any obvious answers for containing Tatum or Brown and we have a fully switchable defense that should be able to contain Trae while staying honest on their shooters. I might argue the Hawks are better than the 76ers though.    Lastly, I will believe Philly is better than Boston when they beat them in a playoff series."
"I'm just wondering - how much better is the current Sixers team than the version from the 2020 bubble?  How much worse is the current Celtics team than the version from the 2020 bubble?  Personally I feel like the Sixers are about the same (although they lost Simmons in those Bubble playoffs which hurt them), but the Celtics should be better.  Tatum/Brown have developed more, and then you would expect at least SOME of the guys like Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Pritchard, and Grant Williams to take a step forward.  Add in solid-to-great role players in Schroder, Smart, Richardson, and Horford; the addition-by-subtraction of Kemba (if he could get out of street clothes, he was good on occasion but was too regularly terrible and just took the ball out of other guy's hands), and I don't see how this Celtics team is worse.  I think this season is gonna surprise a lot of people, not just the Boston Celtics.  People are looking at the results of the 2021 season and think the landscape of the NBA have changed a ton since the 2020 season.  But I really think 2021 is a huge outlier due to all of the nonsense caused by COVID.  There is a lot of noise in that data to try to draw any real conclusions from it."
"You should have left Langford and Grant Williams off your list, they hurt your case more than help it. And Bruno Fernando is a Hawks castoff."
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
"Ya it’s a good thing we have Horford, Smart, Schroder, and Williams too then huh? Try again 😂 Also people are low on him, but I have a feeling Richardson will be really good for us. We’re 7-8 deep, which is all you need the for the playoffs. Our 2nd/3rd year players are good enough to contribute in the regular season as well (PP,Nesmith,Langford,Grant) now that they’re not the main bench guys"
"That's why analysts and reporters touting anyone with the same body type as the ""next"" Draymond should really cut that shit. None of them had Draymond's mind and feel for the game.   I'm sure Keldon Johnson, Lu Dort, Grant Williams and Eric Paschall would have good to great careers, but to compare them to Draymond just bc they have the same body type is just lazy journalism."
Jaylen/Tatum are both 38-40%   Payton shoots like 40%   Nesmith shot like 40% once he started getting mins the last 40 games   Grant Williams shot 37%   Horford is 37% the last 5 seasons
He was a solid motherfucker and a high IQ/high energy guy and I was a big fan but the only teams I can see him actually getting minutes on in today's league are maybe GSW or Miami and that's only as a third string center and because I think he's better than Looney and Spo is a genius. Nobody posts up anymore and the ones that do are too big for him to guard without getting into foul trouble. Grant Williams reminds me a lot of Chuck and Grant's probably more skillful but still can't find minutes.
Grant Williams aka ham head
"This season Marcus Smart is averaging 7 3PA a game and is making them at....(wait for it..) 23.5%  Why in gods name is Smart taking so many threes. Also if Tatum is awful the Celtics suck.   This game was a difference in depth. Tatum and Beal were both trash but the Wiz have too much depth. JB was also really bad this game.   The Celtics last guy on the rotation is a washed Jabari Parker, Grant Williams, Josh Richardson compared to the Wiz who are running the rookie Corey Kispert who actually looks really solid so far on both ends of the court, Deni Avdija who also plays solid D and can ball handle, Aaron Holiday who is looking like a steal of a pick-up for PG depth and Bertans who is still capable of being a good NBA player even though he's been pretty bad at doing what he's paid to do which is shoot the ball. Juancho needs to work his way into the rotation for Boston, he's a solid player."
"beal's built different, not many people would willingly pull grant williams over while underneath him"
To me I would say there is no way Williams gets moved for a player like Grant.
"Just as i suspected, Jayson Tatum isn't even a top 5 player on his own team. Grant Williams is the clearly better Power Forward."
"The Miami Heat never once played LeBron in the playoffs prior to the decision. The biggest competitor in the East during the 2010 season was the Bulls, the Celtics, the Hawks or the Magic, not the Heat. The Heat were #5 in fact having gone on a decline since their 2005 championship.   Additionally, Jordan had the luxury of being drafted to the same team as a top 5 small forward all time in Scottie Pippen, along with one of the league's best defensive power forwards at the time in Horace Grant. In addition to that he always had elite roleplayers on his team. Jordan didn't stack the deck because the deck was stacked for him already. LeBron had Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams as his best teammates in Cleveland, it's not at all a fair comparison   Jordan &gt; LeBron in my opinion, but you're delusional."
"Just got back into nba, do you mean grant Williams? Is he a really good defender ?"
Really good game from Grant Williams
"grant williams, welcome home"
"Okay, sure. Normalize it. White Chocolate's best per-100 PPG: 22.6  LaMelo at age-19: 26.7  Assists per 100 possessions as a rookie? Higher than Williams' career average per 100.   Last year, LaMelo's FG%+ was 94. Williams' career mark: 89. Even in an era of inefficiency, White Chocolate was inefficient. 3PT%+, same story. I will grant that White Chocolate's career TS+ is slightly higher than Lamelo's rookie-year TS+, but that doesn't really change the argument. LaMelo was better as a rookie than Jason Williams ever was."
Flagrants have been weird this year. Grant Williams full on open field tackled someone last night attempting a layup and it was ruled a common foul.
How the fuck is Grant Williams a VP and why do the Celtics get two reps?
"""you took too long to get it!""   bro you let Randle abuse Grant Williams like 5 straight possessions in the clutch before finally putting TimeLord on him"
Bruh this offseason was 90% Grant Williams fucked every nephews mom posts on Celtics subreddit
I don't think Grant Williams is relevant enough to have haters
Grant Williams haters = 🤡🤡🤡
Forsaken: Grant Williams  Awakened: KLAYMOND GREEN
"8/10 from 3, was like a young Grant Williams out there"
Good to see C's get it together after a shaky start. Looking forward to Nesmith's nerves settling. Props to Grant Williams for keeping us on track.
grant williams looks like a 10 year vet from 2008
"Hopefully. Nesmith hasn’t scored yet this season, and Langford always is injured. But I definitely think Rob Williams can be a starter if he stays healthy, and Grant Williams can be a solid role player."
"Give Ime time to adjust the proper line-ups, learning when to challenge, calling plays, etc. It is his first year coaching and you have to settle in before you get any results.   That being said, the Celtics are completely undersized in most match up. If either Timelord or Al is sitting or out, our next ""big"" is Grant Williams (I don't know why they insist on making him play like PJ Tucker, although his offense is a bit more reliable this year). They could have used Kanter during the two games since they were clearly struggling to get any rebound.   I think once they figure that out, they're more steady as a team - more defensive rebounds means more pace control."
"it's Udoka's second game ever so I'll let the lineups slide. now is the time to experiment and try to figure out who and what works. but holy hell that Grant Williams at center lineup with 4 guards/wings was fucking atrocious against the Raptor's length lol.  if your opinion is that Dennis and JRich are the only good bench players, then a lot of lineups are gonna look questionable though. you can't go 7 deep in October."
"Meh. They traded a future first round pick that ended up as Grant Williams. I promise you, the Sixers were not one Grant Williams away from winning the championship last year"
I mean at least grant Williams looks better ig
"Ime Udoka with the assist here, running a 4 guard lineup with Grant Williams down low."
"Rough night for the Celts, only defensive rebounder big man you have is Timelord.   Grant Williams is too small when the Raps overload on size.  BTW Timelord scares the crap out of me, he either is going to make a spectacular play or injure himself for 2 months."
"Yeah but 2 guards, 2 undersized wings, and grant williams at center isnt gunna cut it for 5 minutes against a tall lineup.  I know you wanna play your best guys but eventually you need to make a decision based on matchup."
I mean the spacing on that lineup wasn't bad. It's just a bunch of guards and Grant Williams who struggles against bigger dudes.
"I honestly think there’s a good chance he wouldn’t be a Celtic right now if he said this a few months ago which speaks to why it’s pretty ballsy. I think he’s on a 1 year deal too, so this could really cost him after this year.   The good thing is him doubling down makes us moving on from him more toxic, and hopefully emboldens other players to speak out. He’s clearly not going to back down like Morey did (and I don’t blame him, he did more than pretty much anyone else) and if he can avoid negative repercussions for it because the backlash of the Celtics doing that would be too great then it might embolden other players on other teams too.   I’d love to see another Celtics player step up and make a similar move now too. I wouldn’t be shocked to see Grant Williams be that guy since he’s another guy who doesn’t have all that potential endorsement money to worry about, seems smart, and seems like the type to stand with a teammate who’s out on an island."
"There are some people on the list because they played on certain teams that were champions, such as Sam Jones, Bob Cousy, Robert Parish. Even James Worthy, Kevin. McHale, Scottie Pippen are borderline to me because of who they had the fortune to play with. And although I followed Bill Walton from the day he set foot on UCLA, I feel he got an injury exemption to make the list, when he only had a couple of great seasons, then played on Larry Bird's team.   I would have Bernard King, Adrian Dantley, both of whom I borrowed from in my HS career, Grant Hill on an injury exemption if Walton gets one, a couple of ABA guys. I also have one obscure name, who is the most overlooked great guard in history, the great Gus Williams from USC by way of Mt. Vernon, NY."
NBA should put that money towards Grant Williams' therapy sessions after last night
"When Zach is hot like that I don't know that any of the guys you just mentioned would've done any better at slowing him down, but you at least have to *try*. Having Grant guard Pat Williams and his mighty 3 FGA all night was just ridiculous. Put Jackson on Williams and make the kid take advantage of the mismatch. Just do *something*."
"Exactly, i didn’t get it at all. At least have him struggle. Lavine is capable of taking games over all by himself, and that’s exactly what he did because Casey let him. So so strange. Grant, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, even Killian would’ve done better.   Instead Casey had our best perimeter defender in Grant guard Patrick Williams all game, as if he’s any sort of offensive threat. Smh."
"Tennessee has a really good basketball atmosphere in general. Memphis, (college and pro team), and Tennesssee Vols basketball have extremely loyal fan bases and great atmospheres. If Tennessee basketball simply has a good coach (like Barnes), fans, students, etc. will show up to Thompson bowling. The Admiral Schodield, and Grant Williams team is one of the most beloved sports teams in Vol history, football or basketball. Admiral is like a cult figure in Knoxville lol."
"Credit to Thibodeau for benching Kemba in 2OT and going with Rose, who aside from not looking like a double agent at the end of regulation, was much fresher and the only guy on the floor able to create.  Generally I think coaches should play the bench more in OT. For example, I don’t understand why the Celtics kept Grant Williams on the bench the whole time, even though he was hot in the 4th."
My baby boy Grant Williams was there to give the big hug after. Gonna be a big year for him
"Signing a player doesn't mean you are actually gonna play them. Lots of players get signed to deals, especially vets signing one year veteran minimums like Kanter, and don't play.  Him playing in Portland for 72 games was not good for Portland. If Portland made a mistake why would the Celtics not repeating that be surprising? And why would the Celtics repeat their mistake in playing him significant minutes two seasons prior? Especially when last season they've experimented with Grant Williams playing spot minutes at the 5 and it being mildly successful unlike Kanter minutes."
Grant Williams was killing us and our dumb asses kept leaving him wide open smh
Kanter is that bad. He is so terrible on defense while playing the most important position on defense that playing forwards such as Grant Williams at the 5 is a better bet if you want to win.
"I can't stand the fact that Tatum consistently gets babied after games like this as a C's fan. Jaylen STILL gets crucified for that poor game 7 ecf game as if he wasn't the best player in the playoffs for us leading up to that game. The ""boom"" really set an unstoppable Tatum circlejerk narrative into motion that hasn't stopped since, and I obviously love the guy but fuck man he simply isn't a positive player if his shot isn't falling. His effort tanks, his body language sinks and he tries to ""make up for it"" with hero ball antics instead of getting the fuck out of Browns way and doing the dirty work, he didn't fight through or set a single meaningful screen, box out, etc but no one cares. Grant fucking Williams thoroughly outplayed him in every regard and had 5 less points on 1/3rd the shot attempts. Idgaf that Tatums shots were more difficult, he put himself in those shitty situations"
Bro when did Grant Williams become prime Steph Curry
He is just such a poor defensive player at the most important position on defense that playing him significant minutes just drags your whole team down. Even playing a forward at centre for limited minutes like Grant Williams did last season is preferable to Kanter if you care about winning.
Yes I agree. Two key Knicks scores were against Schroder in defense too. Also fresh legs are better than gassed legs. Take out Tatum too. Put Grant Williams in.
Grant Williams scored more than Tatum
Dennis is this year's Grant Williams
Grant Williams looking like a prime Boris Diaw
GRANT WILLIAMS WTF
Jaylen Brown put on a masterclass just for everyone except Grant Williams (ironically) to sell
Grant Williams has aim bot on today
Grant Williams killing us
Randle looks good against Grant. Put him up against someone like Williams and he's meh.
Grant Williams or Steph Curry?
Grant Williams clutching up fr
Someone guard grant Williams man
I need Grant Williams to get off the floor
Grant Williams lmfaooo
"So my choice is Ben Simmons, or Dennis Schroeder/grant williams/juancho/some picks?  That’s a real tough decision here *tiny bit of sarcasm*"
"early 2000’s kings jersey (webber, williams, etc)  an old hawks jersey (wilkins, webb)  one of the old pistons jerseys with the horse (grant hill)"
"1. Enlist Robert Williams to invent a time machine.  2. Go back to the 2019 draft,  pick Okeke instead of Langford, Keep Thybulle, and pick Keldon Johnson instead of Grant Williams.  In 2020 pick Saddiq Bey instead of Nesmith.  3. Travel back to the future and trade Okeke, Thybulle, Johnson and Bey along with a future 1st or two for Ayton."
Grayson's still a dirty player. Got ejected from a summer league game a couple seasons ago for shoving and then swinging at Grant Williams
"Celtics  Starting 5: Smart, Brown, Tatum, Horford, TimeLord  Closing 5: Schroder, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Horford/TimeLord  Bench: Schroder, Richardson, one of Langford/Nesmith, one of Grant Williams/Juancho with the occasional cameo from Kanter."
Imagine Bruno Fernando and Grant Williams beating you out for a roster spot
Yeah Rob Williams might be injured and Horford probably will still be in protocols. Kanter and Bruno are the 2 Centers then but Grant Williams will get most Minutes as small ball 5 Probably
Lol ok If you think smart and AL make no difference. Also Robert Williams who is a massive difference. Plus PP who’s a decent piece.   I’m just sayin lol it was grant Williams and jabari Parker out there lol
This for the dust up with Grant Williams after practice the other day?
"Robert Williams [told reporters](https://twitter.com/byjayking/status/1446172270104391688) last week that Smart had an ""altercation"" with Grant Williams at practice.  I wonder if Smart escalated/continued that?"
DNP- Bullied Grant Williams too much
"I’ve watched Grant Williams play many times.  He’s a liability on the court every time he’s on it. He’s unathletic, to small, to slow, and can’t create his own shot.  He’ll be lucky to get a minimum contract after he’s done with the Celtics."

I love Grant Williams
Grant Williams for Boston  Edit: undeservingly so though. I love Grant Williams
"$10 mil has pretty serious cap tax implications. Plus in 2022-23, Al's contract will be over 14 mil guaranteed while Kemba initially would have been around 37 guaranteed, and is currently a 26 million a year dead cap hit for OKC after waiving him.   Based on his health and initial contract, Kemba was a negative asset. Obviously at around 8 million + a year with the Knicks, he's a steal, but he wasn't worth 8 mil a year with the C's.   Buying him out would have been horrible. Can you imagine having 26 million worth of dead cap space for 2 years as the C's try to compete. It's fine for OKC since they could take the hit and is currently in a full blown rebuild.   The 16th pick seems promising, but on the larger scale of things, for flexibility's sake, this is the right move.   They tried to recoup Kemba's value. Hell, the dude didn't even play back to backs for an ENTIRE SEASON. The knee just didn't hold up.  Plus if it wasn't for Al, their big man depth would be Robert Williams, Grant Williams, and Enes Kanter. I can't emphasize how much better Al makes the bigs rotation"
"He's a talented defender but he's a 20mpg player and he's 24 years old. Its a fine pick.   Look at the picks after...   Brandon Clarke 24mpg   Grant Williams 18mpg   Darius Bazley 31 mpg   Then a bit lower...   Jordan Poole 20 mpg    Keldon Johnson 29 mpg   Kevin Porter Jr 32 mpg   Nic Claxton 17 mpg   Its a fine pick. Definitely not bad, but not the best value pick in that draft range."
Grant Williams
I feel like he will focus on things other than basketball.   If I had to pick an under-25 Celtic it would be Grant Williams.
"This guy is so good against the Raptors. Actually every single Celtics role player is insane when playing the Raptors. I hear Celtics fans talking about how bad Grant Williams is, then he comes and drops 30 with 6 threes on us or something"
"He's not THE VP, he's A VP to put it into perspective.  Kinda like how finance companies overinflate the value of VP by having everyone be VP of something, the NBAPA has McCollum at president, Iguodala as First VP, Barnes at sec-treasurer, then six regular VPs(Kyrie, Biyombo, Brogdon, Garret Temple, Jaylen, Grant Williams)"
"And I'm sure it really was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, but I can pretty much guarantee that Smart, Grant Williams, and Udoka are all going to get questions about it."
Of course Robert and Grant are brothers but I didn’t know Marcus Smart’s last name used to be Williams!
"Ok ask him to do other stuff. He’s a bench player.   Kemba missed half the season and was pretty bad in half the games he did play  Like Tristan’s Thompson, Peyton Pritchard, and Grant Williams were top 7 in minutes played for them last year"
"For a second I thought you were offering Grant Williams and picks for Simmons. I'd do it, but Morey would probably ask for Tatum, Brown and 6 1st rounders."
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
"I agree re: the 08 Celtics and Rondo (and even a guy like Kendrick Perkins for that matter, he was a underrated young piece that the title team relied on, started every game that season). But honestly, a case can be made that the Celtics in recent years did exactly what Draymond is saying. They never committed fully to either path, and they suffered a little in terms of contention and in terms of player growth.   They had a bunch of mid first round picks that they didn’t trade to acquire more talent and depth when they had Isaiah and Horford, or later with Kyrie Hayward and Horford and the Jays.   But in keeping those picks, they also didn’t have much room for them to play. Guys like Yabusele, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, etc didn’t get a ton of reps because the team couldn’t afford to lose games trying to develop them. Now several seasons later and Yabu is long gone, Romeo’s future looks unclear, and Grant Williams is still way too hit or miss. That’s 3 first round picks!! If you’re keeping the picks, you damn well need to have a way to develop them on the court. Or else what’s the point…might as well have moved them for more NBA ready talent when the team was closer to contention.   Now they’re in the middle and with no clear way to improve. The picks are all used up. The experienced vet stars have all moved on/gotten washed up. By trying to contend and develop, they ended up accomplishing neither."
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
Idk about smartest but Jaylen Brown and Grant Williams are both smart as hell
Grant Williams is extremely smart
Grant Williams and Westbrook are very interesting cases I didn't know about. Thanks for this.
"This post inspired me to read up on the smartest NBA players and I gotta say there's some real scholars   Jaylen Brown took masters level courses and studied chemistry while at Berkeley (As someone with a chemistry degree, I'm impressed)  Westbrook apparently got accepted to Standford with a 3.9 GPA but DIDN'T get recruited for basketball or offered an athletics scholarship, just his academic merit   Grant Williams apparently got accepted into Ivy League schools but didn't go to pursue the NBA, and his mom works at NASA   Malcom Brogdan got his degree in Public Policy and could have pursued studying Law   Hard to pin how much of this is true but it was just some quick Google searches. Very interesting stuff"
grant williams
"&gt;Third-year forward Grant Williams is a newly elected vice president on the NBPA and he spoke about advocating for all players in the league no matter what their vaccination status is in his role, including pushing for letting unvaccinated players scream from the bench without a mask on, for better team “communication.”  Great, thanks Grant. Not only are you essentially a bust and borderline useless on the court, you're also a fucking moron."
"Several of them are vaccinated but willing to give concessions to the unvaxxed because of ""rights""/""personal choice"" etc logic. In the article about Kyrie and the other anti-vaxxers, Grant Williams (who is vaxxed) had logic along these lines."
"Grant Williams is a VP   he isn’t really popular, he just advocates for the personal freedoms he wants and can do it in a selfish way while helping other players achieve that goal"
"For me, worst part was about how even Grant Williams(member of NBPA) and other players, who are supportive of vaccine, trying to make a league go for compromisses with those who stand against full vaccination mandate. Like, why? Why is 1,5 year of this shit wasn't enough for you to understand that only full vaccination is the way to go?"
Grant Williams missed like his first 30 3s or something. Now he’s Shooting 43% from 3 and is the only 50/40/90 Player this Season
i forget but there was a rookie who hadnt made his first shot or three over an absurd amount of games / attempts. grant williams?
Grant Williams
"Damn, he sucks. They should just trade him to the Celtics for the goat grant Williams"
"It's a bit of both. With that being said we have a few guys like Smart, Tatum, Nesmith, Pritchard, and Al Horford who are mired in big shooting slumps. On the flip side we have a couple of guys like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford who are shooting better than their profile. We suck at shooting in aggregate, but we're also shooting worse than we probably should be."
"I’ve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He’s totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn’t enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It’s harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he’s just not really quick. He’ll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he’s not automatic like Durant so he’s inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he’s on, sometimes he’s off.  So I think it’s a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it’s easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there’s no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It’s when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he’s good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."
"That's just not true, our depth is a lot better than last year. Langford is shooting 43% from 3, Grant Williams is having a 50/40/90 season so far, JRich has been solid and Horford is a stretch big we didn't have last season."
Would love to see the Bulls trade Pat Williams + Derrick Jones Jr for him but I’m not sure how either side feels about that deal  Lonzo-Lavine-Demar-Grant-Vucevic is scary to think about
which one would be #2 and which would be #3 for MVP this year? (assuming Grant Williams wins like hes supposed to)
Shout out to Grant Williams. The only 50/40/90 in the league right now. Just as we all expected.
Grant Williams kinda look like a turtle   He could join Westbrook and Rondo to round out 3/4 of TMNT
Let us pray that Grant Williams did not suffer a career-ending injury from that brutal album by Precious. 🙏
Imagine your best player is a son to Grant Williams? I’d throw up fr 🤣🤣🤣

Grant fucking Williams
Their depth quality has gotten worse and worse for a few seasons now. Going from Kyrie/Smart/Hayward/Brown/Tatum/Horford/Morris/Rozier/Theis/Baynes to  a bench of JRich/Langford/Jabari/Grant Williams is brutal
Grant Williams at that. Couldn't have happened to a better person 😂
I don't understand why they'd delete this unless they are Grant Williams
"Don't look now, but Grant Williams is shooting 40% from 3 20 games into the season."
"Marcus Smart is the default shit on player because of his bad scoring numbers but he does literally everything else at a high level.    Grant Williams also got a lot of flack until this hear, but idk wtf people were expecting from him?"
A couple of weeks ago Jackie Mac was on the bill Simmons pod talking about how Kelly olynyk used to make her irrationally angry even when he got better. Grant Williams is that player for me. I audibly groan every time that guy touches the ball. What does it say about the roster that he plays big minutes?
"Celtics fans can’t tolerate bad play from Grant Williams. He’s played much better this year, but I can’t think of any other player besides maybe Smart who gets so much hatred. Maybe his terrible 3 point shooting start to his rookie year just left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth."
Just moved to boston and have season tickets and everyone I’ve talked to seem to love grant Williams
"Also helped that you guys opened up with Grant Williams guarding Patty.  Dude's improved a lot, especially his shooting, but guarding quick constantly moving guards is probably his nightmare."
Grant Williams copes a lot of crap from the Celtics fan base. We are harsh on rookies.
We have quite a few:  Grant Williams  Marcus Smart  Jayson Tatum(to some extent)
We have a long love/hate relationship with Grant Williams.  It's love right now though.
"&gt; Top 100 in win shares, everyone else in top 100 is in hall of fame unless it's an active player  That's not true. There's a lot of players in the Top 100 who aren't in the HOF. Here's some examples. Laimbeer, AC Green, Jeff Hornacek, Otis Thorpe, Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Buck Williams, Horace Grant,  Terry Porter, Elton Brand, Larry Nance, Detlef Schrempf, Sam Perkins, Rasheed Wallace, Andre Miller and Eddie Jones."
"Dawg lmao come the fuck on lol. You can hate Grant Williams and still be able to see KD's arm hook him and yeet him across the floor. It didn't get called and was more funny than anything, but don't pretend it was something it wasn't."
"Once Rob Williams comes back Kanter gets no PT right?  Rubio's a pretty solid defender so Rubio-Brown-Tatum-Horford-Williams, with Schroder, Richardson, Grant Williams, Langford is a pretty solid rotation.  Also I think we have 3 more games left haha"
Nah our biggest issue is that everyone on the team not named Grant Williams or Romeo Langford is shooting like 10% below their career 3pt%. And we weren’t a great shooting team to begin with.
"Fair enough! I'll gladly take it when I know where its coming from lol.   On that note, i'll give you Grant Williams and a 2nd for Simmons cuz that's all he's worth. Hell, i'll throw in a late first if I can move the Sixers to Canada even if I think its an overpay"
"We have salaries specifically to match in trades (Smart, horford, jrich, hernangomez) and young players with potential (nesmith, langford, pritchard, grant and rob williams) plus all of our own draft picks.   In a sign and trade situation, or a situation where a star wants out, we are obviously suited to make a deal. Our young talent clearly isnt good enough to pry a star from a team for no reason, but what would be? That doesn't normally happen, it takes special circumstance for a star to leave anyways."
"Lol what is this revisionist no assets bullshit?  They had Tatum, Brown, Smart, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, and every one of their FRP going forward with the only negative asset being Kemba. Ainge did an incredible job as GM despite his terrible injury luck. I have no idea why you’re shitting on him.  Like literally name 5 teams with more assets than that?"
And because Grant Williams and Horford are significantly better
Yeah it’s just cause Robert Williams is out. Horford and Grant Williams cant eat all the minutes so they need to put The Turnstile out for his retirement tour
"Hahahaha dude you couldve just drafted Thybulle! Instead you chose Grant Williams and Carson Edwards. But your defense of that move is that Grant Williams is a good defender???  I love it. The Militant celtic boot licker FO defender mindset is beautiful. You are a flower. Never change my friend, it's people like you who keep this league so fun"
"Keep on making your excuses man. Your FO has squandered every single stockpiled pick post tatum and now you can see the middling, play in team you were last year and will be again. 5 first rounders in the four years since Tatum and only Robert Williams looks even remotely like a player. Pretty pathetic honestly. Definitely wouldn't look better with Tisse or Bane or Maxey instead of Langford, Grant Williams, Nesmith and Pritchard. But yeah keep making excuses. Enjoy the rest of the season my guy"
Grant Williams is juicy
"Hb some love for our very own Grant Williams. A bit undersized for the 5 but can play small ball 5 or a great stretch 4. Dude can shoot, he’s a leader, and he always makes the right play. That is a recipe for a longtime NBA role player."
Grant Williams has 3 and D journeyman written all over him.
"I thought he would flame out, and at times over the past couple years he's looked like trash, but if Grant Williams can actually shoot threes like he has this year he will have a long career."
Grant Williams will be a solid 7th man for a while
Brown  Tatum  Rob Williams  Horford  Schroder  Smart  Romeo  Grant
Tatum  Brown  Rob Williams  Horford  Smart  Romeo  Nesmith  Grant Williams
"If we're losing by more than 10 at any point in this game I can guarantee our subreddit will complain about at least one of Tatum, Grant Williams, or Smart.  Brown almost never catches flak over there though"
Swap Thanasis with Grant Williams and you have the 2020 Boston Celtics
"Not a superstar, but Grant Williams is going to be viewed as an X factor type glue guy in a year or two."
"he sucks. trade him to us for GRANT WILLIAMS, SHOOTING 40% FROM 3"
Grant “Best shooter in the draft” Williams.
I read in some article that Grant Williams asked Ime how he could get playing time.  Ime told him play defense and shoot 40% from 3.  He's at 40.4% for the season right now.  Also makes sense of why he's so quick to gun it this season.  I think he knows that being a 3 and D guy is his path now.

If you’re referring to Grant Williams you’d be correct
"Bro Al Horford is chunky af, and he simply knows how to rebound. Grant williams as well, to a lower degree. I don't think it's outrageous to get out rebounded by Horford give the man his respect."
How are you going to lose a game that Grant Williams is starting?
How you gonna get out-rebounded _and_ outscored in the paint when the tallest two people on our team were Al Horford and Grant Williams. WTF.
Grant Williams &gt; AD  J Rich &gt; LeBron  Schroder &gt; Westbrook  Its simple.
"Grant ""Steph Curry"" Williams"
Is Grant Williams really really bad or is this a bad game?  Or like a little of both?
I've not watched much Celtics but in from this game alone Grant Williams looks completely terrible
"Definitely woudn't say Grant Williams is among the ""best players"", but if he is he's definitely the worst of them"
I’m positive just having Horford and Grant Williams run the 5 would be far better than playing Kanter.
watching Grant Williams in this clip is hilarious
Grant Williams looking like he's falling asleep lol
Grant Williams left LeBron to go double THT LMFAOOOOOO
"grant williams deserves every single meme that tacko got  no offense to tacko, it's just his only defining trait is literally just being tall af"
[Grant Williams asking Enes Kanter if he farted on the bench](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ie7htx/grant_williams_asking_enes_kanter_if_he_farted_on/)
Grant Williams is the best I can do
"""brad stevens dropped a gosh darnit in the lockerroom at halftime""   ""grant williams, who had stayed up late the night before playing settles of catan, fainted at the sight"""
"In 1200+ minutes last year he had 58% TS, and so far this year hes 8/34. If a star player shoots 4/17 for two games in a row that could easily be dismissed as a cold streak / mini-slump. He did enough last year to earn more chances in my view. For context, Pritchard is 6/23 from 3pt, Grant Williams had a stretch earlier of being 1/15 but he's already back above 40% on the year."
We did a good job preventing Trae from scoring but he did an awesome job finding the next guy.  But holy shit we need some help shooting. Grant Williams balled out and we still shot 26% from three.
Okay you better be posting Grant Williams and Precious Achiuwa hitting 3’s next time it happens. Apparently that’s what you want to see
Grant Williams with the high water mark of a +10
Does Grant Williams think he's Klay Thompson?
"Not trying to sound snarky but Udoka's response in the thread here is exactly why: ""We're switching a lot and doing some things that probably are not as natural for him and that's limited his time to some extent""  I forget where I heard it but I think the Celtics are switching *by far* more than any team in the league. The only bigs we are playing at this point are Robert Williams, Al Horford, Grant Williams. They might not be able to defend quicker guards, but all three of them can at least hang with wings. The *second* we put Kanter (or Jabari Parker) on the court, the entire defensive scheme has to change."
"If all the reddit GMs are right, and Ben Simmons has zero trade value, the Celtics could get him for grant Williams and a second."
"Pretty sure it's Grant Williams yelling it out, you hear him yell out YEAH after the miss"
Where does the offence come from for the C’s with the lineup of timelord Langford grant Williams smart and Richardson?
"If Boston wins this we claim the letter B and Bucks have to trade us three players of our choice as compensation (we will take Giannis, Middleton, and Holiday in exchange for Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Romeo Langford)."
Grant Williams has slimmed down a TON this offseason though.
Add grant Williams in there
Cause they want the Timberwolves to trade them Kat for Grant Williams and Marcus Smart and 3 2nds
"Boston and Toronto are the two most biased fan bases in the league and it’s not even close. They hype up mediocre talent more than any fanbase.   Philly fans shit on their team more than anyone. Celtics fans and raptors fans don’t even self loathe to be funny — outside of scape goated players (see Jeff Teague, Abdel Nader, Grant Williams, etc.) They have arguably the worst fans, but OP’s description is just untrue."
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections.

"I'm a huge fan of Simmons on this team, but echo what everyone else says in that Brown is way too much. I would be fine with a package of Smart, one of the young guys (Langford or Grant Williams likely), and two firsts. Losing Smart would hurt but I'd be more willing to trade him than Timelord. And the team doesn't have too many assets outside of those two."
"&gt;Would I trace Vucevic for that package? Sure I would.  Youd trade Vooch for more than you paid for him? Crazy!  I do enjoy how youre using his past like it has any bearing on that trade, especially accolades. The mother load of potential? Bro If you're all about potential I have one Romeo Langford, he was a FRP and is just oozing with potential. Grant Williams won the SEC player of the year, so that means his potential must be CrAzY!  Imagine thinking youre going to get a top 20 player in the league for Ben Simmons. Talk about delusional"
"well I guess I'd take Simmons, 5 unprotected FRP's, Seth Curry and the rights to half of Joel's points per night for Jaylen, 2 Seconds and Grant Williams.  BUT I wouldn't be happy about it"
I’m sure rhythm is why grant Williams and jrich can’t shoot. Celtics generate most open 3s in the league.
"Boston fans were talking shit about Jayson fucking Tatum because of his bad start, booed the team multiple times at home alread and spent all if last season making fun of Grant Williams. Simmons would get bullied out of the league if he went to Boston and played like he did in the playoffs."
Grant Williams
"Doesn't mean he's right tho. He called them out for not trusting their teammates, but their teammates have been shooting like absolute trash.  Anyone pointing to the Magic or Heat game obviously didn't watch it.  Despite blowing both teams out, the offense was still trash.  They won because they held both teams under 80.  In the Magic game, removing Brown's shooting, the team shot 37/24/61.  How the fuck is Brown supposed to trust his teammates when they get open looks and put up those shooting splits.  Smart is shooting 31/28/70.  When he's been handling the ball, he's not getting guys open looks, not because he's a bad passer or playmaker, but teams are treating him like Draymond Green.  They're sagging off him really hard because they want him to shoot the open 3 or floater.  It's the same when Schroeder/Brown/Tatum drive, and draw a double.  They start swinging it out and when it gets to Smart, teams are practically begging him to shoot it or he has to pass it to someone with a guy on him essentially wasting the initial play.  That's what's happening with the offense right now.  And when the ball is swung to everyone who isn't Brown or Grant Williams (somehow), they're missing open shots."
"smart, Richardson, pp, nesmith, Schroeder, and grant Williams shooting a combined 7-25 for a robust 28%. and Richardson is 4-5."
"Yeah, that's why Trez is a great regular season guy but will get eaten alive in the playoffs. There's just no real way to win with those guys in the modern NBA. He's what I call a 4.5, stuck in between 4 and 5 but can't really play either.    We have a (way less talented) 4.5 in Boston, Grant Williams. too slow to defend 4s, too small to defend 5s. Can do a lot of things well but just doesn't have a true position in 2021."
Yea this year defending the 3 has been an issue. We almost lost the celtics game because we didnt guard Grant Williams at all. Then we lost the Pacers game because we let Myles Turner do whatever he wanted from 3. I think its because Fournier and Kemba arent as good of defenders as Reggie Bullock and Payton were last year  We have 2 rookies who are  good defenders in Grimes and Deuce but  they get no time to play
"I would assume the record is held by some big man who attempted around 30 half/full court heaves in their entire career and missed all of them. For players who actually attempt 3s frequently, it has to be Grant Williams missing 25 3s to start his career."
grant williams being all about this is giving me life
Grant Williams started his career 0-28 from 3
Grant williams*
"His stats were artificial though. He got them mostly when Nurse put him out against the Celtics bench. It was like Payton Pritchard, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, and Rob Williams against the Raptors starting unit. I think his first half stats are more relevant to his play."
"The ""feisty bulldog mentality"" guys that don't mind being hated by opposing fanbases. The Marcus Smart, Grant Williams type."
"Grant was really good tonight, but not exactly a great start overall for Grant this season.  His offense imo has been fine. He knocks down his open 3s and he's had some pretty passes, but his defense was really bad for awhile. I think it's because he was being asked to play the 4 rather than be a smallball 5, and he doesn't quite have the quickness to keep up on the perimeter sometimes.  It doesn't help that he's mainly playing with guys he didn't have much time with last season after no training camp in Ojeleye, Robert Williams, Pritchard and Teague, so that also seems to be leading to some communication issues, which is normally a strength for him."
Tatum was so good tonight that Payton and Grant Williams will get overshadowed
No offense to the Celtics but he hasn't exactly been going against a star studded front court of Robert and Grant Williams the last 10 minutes.
Grant Williams got skinnier in the offseason. I rate it.
"Boston has no wing depth actually. Stevens love 2-4 switch everything and even 2-5 switch everything with Smart in the small ball line up.   Their current bench trotting out Jeff Teague, Pritchard and Grant Williams"
"Depends on Minny's situation by the deadline. Good thing about the TPE is they can get young players plus picks without getting a huge contract in return. We have Robert Williams, Nesmith, Pritchard, Langford, Grant, and of course our own picks. Again it depends on Minny's situation, if they still suck I think it would be possible. Other teams can offer more of course, but I don't think any other contender can offer better."
If you mean contribute as a potential starter then I would agree but Pritchard has shown the potential to be a valuable bench piece this year and grant Williams was a decent bench big last year (though to my eye test he looks like he’s stepped back so far this year though it’s obviously early). Langford is a complete wild card that has shown flashes of being an nba ready defensive player but has been healthy all of 10 games (an exaggeration) so whether he can contribute or not when he gets back is completely unknown.   To be honest I think you have too high of expectations for end of lottery/non lottery picks. They’re not picks anyone values as more than filler in trades and if we get productive bench players out of those picks that’s actually great value. For every Siakam there’s 20 fab melo’s. The two picks he held too long were the Sacramento and Memphis picks as those may have had some trade value but as a Celtics fan I was willing to bet on both those teams (especially Sacramento) giving us a high pick and while I would have been wrong both times I’m not sure betting against Sacramento is a bad decision (sorry Kings fans).
"Not that this was key to the game, but where was Grant Williams this game? I can't find anything about him"
"Who the hell is General Widebody, Grant Williams?"
"Trade for Harden probably.   But they need to use that TPE and get some nice complimentary pieces; a lot of players from the Magic could work (i.e. Gordon, Fournier, Ross) or even Harrison Barnes.   The bench is too raw but they need at least one of those guys between Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford to break out. None are great shooters at the moment.  They'll probably continue to be a perennial second round exit though until Tatum/Brown become the next Jordan/Pippen."
"To improve on the team that made the ECF last season we really just need Kemba healthy. The Jays have stepped up in a big way. Tatum, Brown and (healthy) Kemba is looking like a really strong top 3.   To take the next step, we're one starting level wing short and it means we're asking for a lot from everyone. We're relying on our top-end talent having huge nights every night and we play a lot of bad lineups that end up costing us games.    All of our main bench players are individually good when they're playing with the starters. The issue is when we play our bench players with other bench players.   Grant Williams is a great example, he looks good playing next to Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum. He looks pretty bad when he's playing next to 2-3 other Grant Williams.    We could chase a secondary star, but even just 1 decent wing would take a lot of pressure off our guys.   Eg:  * Robert Covington * Otto Porter Jr * Jae Crowder * Harrison Barnes * Terrence Ross * etc etc  Our bench players are good fill-ins but 1 more starting wing would mean we don't have to play so many lineups that have a bench majority."
"91-93 Bulls were a worse team than any of LeBrons championship teams.   Pippen was a borderline top 10 player. And Grant was an all star the same way Mo Williams was an all star with LeBron.  It's not nostalgia there just hasn't been a player that dominant over the rest of the league that their team was the #1 favourite by default.  You replace Pippen with Larry Johnson, Shawn Kemp, or any other solid second option/all star from that period and the Bulls do not lose a beat."
"also a rockets fan here, this trade is alright but i think i’d rather go for the grant williams and a 2nd package"
"How about if the Celtics offer the Rockets Robert &amp; Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards &amp; 4 seconds? Who says no?"
"Well he stated Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, Payton Pritchard who looks good so far, grant Williams has been a solid bench piece, Robert Williams is promising, Romeo shows promise when he's on the court there hasn't been alot of misses imo"
"The celtics have 2 good players, one solid guy and then the next best player is Grant fucking Williams...I honestly didn't realize they had this little depth."
thats what happens when smart and grant williams are taking half the shots in crunch time.
"Smart and Grant are far from consistent even with wide open looks, especially if it is majority contested. The idiots part was just me in my feelings, but yeah, a Jayson Tatum contested step back three is a better shot then a wide open Grant Williams three imo"
"Hey idiot Celtic fans...this is what happens when you don’t have your best players play hero ball in the last two minutes. You have Grant Williams taking three shots, of course missing them all, and Marcus Smart taking awful shot/s and missing them. Stop complaining about Tatum taking “bad shots” at end of games when he easily has the skill to make it. The other guys don’t."
"Smart and Grant Williams both play wing spots for the most part in the Celtics system, Smart just happens to be playing the point a lot more with Kemba out.  But even then he's at times almost more like a 4th wing while he and Tatum trade ball handling duties.  But fully healthy it's basically a 1-3-1 offense."
He beat the .500 celtics and crossed over the all-mighty grant williams?? wow what a superstar
grant williams straight up played better than tatum last night
"This is where looking only at Stat lines doesn't tell you the story.  Donovan single handedly blew the game open from a 4 point game last night to an 11 point lead in 50 seconds, and then did the highlight drop of Grant Williams."
Yes. A million times yes. Trade Cardio Kemba and Grant Williams ASAP
Why doesn't grant williams look like he needs to drop 25lbs? Ishe always so soft lookin?
"As a Grant Williams hater from his time at UPee, I could watch this all day."

"Fuck Grant Williams at the end. He pushed Gobert, but fortunately, Gobert held on to the rim."
Grant Williams can't tie shoelaces
grant williams is who tatum thinks he is
Grant Williams just saved Kemba &amp; Teague because that is literally the worst thing they could’ve done on defense.   Like literally what they teach you not to do
"Yes. Hear me out.   We don’t have a ton of expendable assets but we have a blank check for 28.5M (if we move TT). Trading for a Barnes or similar type player will probably cost us significant assets (Sacramento/whoever have no real motivation to move them for a single protected first or Grant Williams or *insert mediocre asset*.  OKC likely would be willing to move horford for a collection of seconds. That’s a price we can match. Horford is still a good player, just a little overpaid.   Horford and Theis is an excellent big man rotation. Both of them are good defenders and can shoot the 3 ball. Horford was great in Boston and his passing/pick and pop game is elite."
"In absolutely no way is it typical for middling 1st round draft picks and up to produce players who will ever be high quality championship caliber role players, let alone within the timespan of their rookie contract.   Teams who have high quality championship caliber role players on contracts whose salary was low enough for the Celtics to trade for without having include their valuable players for salary matching would have been incredibly dumb to have traded them to the Celtics for a pu pu platter of middling to late picks.   What Grant Williams and Timelord provided the Celtics with in the 2020 playoffs was clearly a positive outcome for picks that were made in the 20s considering it was their rookie and sophomore seasons. And Pritchard has shown himself to be a better option for what the Celtics need than any near minimum salary guy who was available for a late first round pick."
"it's not complicated - other than Smart, Tatum, and Brown  - and maybe Rozier- Ainge's draft picks have sucked.  They should have the deepest, most talented bench in the league with all of those picks....and you have Grant Williams, who is limited at best, Robert Williams, who isn't the brightest bulb on the strand, and a bunch of G league guys.  Now the C's fans are going to rush with me Ojele is a really good, Edwards is a baller, Langford can still work out, etc,etc...fun stuff."
I thought it was Grant Williams?
"Grant Williams has been awesome this year so far. His stats don’t really show it, but he’s quite a good complimentary player. Plays good defense, sets good screens, and moves the ball well. He knows his role. The biggest thing is that he’s started hitting his threes at a high rate. We’ll have to see if that persists throughout the season though  Not sure who I’d say is performing worse. Both our best players are playing great, Smart is Smart, and everyone knows Kemba is struggling coming back from injury right now"
"Grant Williams better, Jeff Teague worse. Pretty sure everyone knows Jeff Teague sucks but if you haven’t watched our games you can’t know just how bad he has been."
"I think Grant Williams has improved SO much. He shoots well now and defends with confidence. He will be even better when his reputation grows a bit and he stops getting the Theis treatment from the zebras lol.  I don't have anyone in particular in mind tbh. We need a PG who can just carry the scoring load on the 2nd unit. Jrue Holiday or Lou Williams or whomever. And we need someone who can stand in the corner and knock down an open shot (Korver from 5 years ago or so).  If we can turn the three trade exceptions we have, Kemba, and 2-3 role players into someone like that then I think we have a chance. As presently constituted, not happening."
"Yeah the celtics definitely would have had to trade brown or tatum to get a star, it's not like they have wasted 7 first round picks on Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Matisse Thybulle (traded), Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Desmond Bane (traded) in the past 3 years 😂😂😂. Definitely can't trade draft picks 😂😂"
"I think Kemba is just what he is at this point. If we could move him on for a PG that can get to the rim and score and defend better then I would. idk who is going to want him at this point though.  We need to do something with that trade exception too. It is possible that something big happens esp with the 9 role players currently getting time/looking serviceable.  Kemba/JT/JB/Smart/Thompson/Theis/PP are the only playoff worthy players they have right now.  Teague/Grant Williams/Timelord/Semi/Edwards/Nesmith/Javonte Green are not realistically good enough. If we could turn 3-4 of them into one player to get into the first group, we could be in business.  Edit - Grant Williams looks like the closest to knocking on the door of the other group. He has played really well. Gotta see it for a long time first though."
Bet they called OKC and offered Grant Williams for Dort and 2 firsts
"Grant Williams was actually doing a good job but he needed to rest so he could play the last 5 minutes. The 4-5 minutes he sat and Theis subbed in was fucking brutal. I knew we lost the game after the first bucket, knew Bam would just spam the matchup and annihilate us. Brad tried to get Grant back in but it was too late, damage was done. Score out of reach, Bam got hot, cue the Celtics iso fadeaway, contested 3s."
"It was boston, and that was him just absolutely abusing a mismatch. Theis could not guard him and their second best option was Grant Williams"
"Actually I think he means he feels intimidated by our #12 Grant Williams, also known as the smartest player in the NBA"
Grant Williams I hate his body looks I hate how he plays. Whenever he’s on the court nothing good happens
"If anything, Dude should have never left his feet. Grant Williams is usually smarter, but he has his lapses like most of the Celtics bench."
"As amazing of a shot as that was. And no doubt it was other worldly, I still hate that he’s allowed to jump into a guy that’s going by his side and that they call it a foul for the offensive player. Grant Williams does everything right to contest that but he isn’t allowed to be able to land safely because Steph jumps into him."
Smart did well against Curry. Kemba and Grant Williams got cooked
I’m glad someone said it.   Grant Williams went sideways to avoid him and Curry created the contact.   This is a ridiculous shot and I’m glad I saw it when it happened though lol
we’ll gladly take him off your hands for Grant Williams and a protected 2nd rounder
enough grant williams
Grant Williams should not be on the court
Grant Williams can enjoy that highlight for the rest of his life
HAHAHA GRANT WILLIAMS
Grant Williams will make a great Tank Commander some day
Grant williams?
Grant Williams will single handedly sink the Celtics.
"That was a great spin move by Grant Williams, sadly it was against Draymond that's all."
Let Grant Williams shoot or punt the ball into the stands? Same result!
Duck jerami grant. Knicks finally have an okay record . Meanwhile jerami grant is getting the Michael Carter Williams treatment. Inefficient af
"You're very generous putting Romeo and Grant Williams in that first tier. Romeo needs a lot more run until I feel comfortable calling him ""solid"", and Grant needs a very specific defense-only assignment against a bigger player that's not very quick, otherwise he's useless. I think they are overplaying Romeo right now to try to jumpstart him getting re-acclimated and also because Fournier is out. I expect to see some DNP for Romeo over the next few weeks. Not a knock on him but I don't know if he's ready to be a major piece yet.   Nesmith has to go down a tier as well, he's just not making any progress. He has flashes of NBA level play, but really he's just running around out there and hasn't demonstrated the lights out shooting he allegedly can do any more than Carsen.   In any case, Jabari Parker has lost more basketball ability than Wagner ever had, so I'm sure it can't be any worse."
"Holy shit, what a way for me to hear the news lol.  I'm surprised that Wagner was waived instead of Carsen Edwards, but maybe that's just because I expected him to be the better piece between him/Kornet.  But Brad had relegated Mo to the deep bench, and so this move amounts to cutting dead weight for a gamble on *mayyyybe* a 10th man.    Jabari was probably the best guy left on the market, even if that isn't saying much, and I don't recall having heard about any recent chemistry issues, so I don't think it really hurts to kick the tires.  He has always been a very good inside scorer, so at a minimum he can probably provide some matchup-dependent scoring, perhaps instead of Grant Williams in some lineups.  I think a high-end outcome for him would be as someone who can come in and simulate some of Tatum's game and stabilize the lineup with Jaylen a little bit when Jayson sits.    Really, he's a low-risk pickup so I'm not expecting much, but it would certainly make my heart happy if he gets that Duke boy chemistry boost from JT and revives his career."
Anyone that lets Grant Williams blow by them needs to be benched for at least 3 games.
"AD’s watching Grant Williams in the post, glad he’s injured."
Grant Williams with the orca defense there
grant williams was a ghost on offense lol
And the Celtics traded him for Grant Williams🤦‍♂️
Then where will Fourniers minutes come from? Last night Ojeleye and Langford combined for 11 minutes total. Pritchard had 11 and grant Williams had 21 but grant plays an entirely different role from Fournier. We can take 5 mins from jaylen but that still only leaves 16 for Fournier if we don’t cut pritchards minutes. Don’t forget smart is our backup Pg even though he starts at sg. Technically Smart will take pritchards minutes and Fournier will take smarts but in essence that’s Fournier taking pritchards minutes.
grant williams and marcus smart are the 2 best celtics
"Grant Williams is not disciplined lol, he'll get you 5 fouls in 10 minutes of play"
Celtics overhelp too much imo.  That’s the biggest issue with their defense. Last year they were insanely disciplined.  Part of this comes down to playing out of control guys like Langford instead of disciplined defenders like theis and grant Williams.
Grant Williams Locked him up i dont know what your talking about :P
"Tl;dr: No I’m not. I think this years performance was expected given fatigue, injuries, and covid - the first two I assumed would be a problem before the season started. People expected the Celtics to be way better because they assumed certain things about the team’s health that didn’t end up happening.  Kemba/Smart/the Jays have played less minutes together the entire regular season than they did in the bubble last year. Our ideal lineup in Kemba/Smart/Jaylen/Jayson/Rob Will has started only 7 games together. We went 6-1 with our only loss being against Philly and we beat teams like the Bucks and blew out teams like the Nuggets.  Only three guys have played at least 60 games: Pritchard has the most with 66 then Tatum with 64 and Grant Williams with 63. Every other team with a rookie leading the team in games played is in the lottery.   In this scenario, especially given that we are a top heavy team, you get things like Mo Wagner as a starting center, Jaylen Brown playing out of position as the starting point guard, or starting our two way player at point guard with our rookie point guard coming off the bench.  Atlanta, despite the many injuries, had John Collins, Trae Young, Clint Capela, Kevin Huerter, and Solomon Hill all play over 60 games. The Knicks had RJ and Randle play 72 and 71 games respectively plus all of Bullock, Noel, Quickley, Payton, and Obi play at least 60. Miami’s probably had the closest situation to us but their rookie was at least fourth in games played as they had Robinson play all 72 games and Bam, Iggy, and Precious play at least 60. Bucks had Lopez and Forbes play 70 games and Pat, Middleton, Donte, Portis, and Giannis all play over 60.  There’s actually a ton more reasons I’m very optimistic about our future after having lower expectations than most this year but this is already way too long. I’m happy to share if you’re interested though."
Put some respect to Grant Williams 😡
They could even get a Grant Williams!
"Kemba and grant williams for Beal, who says no?"
He made history by not being Carsen Edwards or Grant Williams
Carsen. Edwards.  Grant. Williams.
"They put the clamps on Grant Williams, if they can do that they can stop annybody"
Robert and Grant Williams were the only players on the Celtics with positive plus minus numbers
"If I'm Celtics' ownership I am giving Mike Zarren an ""exit interview"" where I ask what he'd do differently from Ainge. Then I'm giving him the GM job if he shows any signs of willing to shake things up rather then keep pouring resources into Edwards/Ojeleye/Grant Williams"
"Easy to do against *check notes* Romeo Langford and Grant Williams, and all the other literal whos on the Celtics roster."
Tatum playing like grant Williams
"Brad Stevens should be playing Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Semi Ojeleye, and Grant Williams 48 minutes. Develop the rookie and play guys you don't care about to save the stars from potential injury."
"I saw kd, kyrie, harden, grant williams, luke kornet, carsen edwards, tremont waters, romeo langford, semi ojeleye, tristan thompson at that exact same party as Porzingis"
24-14 is definitely decent against actual centers but he was playing against Kornet and Grant Williams all Game. Yes his defense has been better this Season but still not what you want off a Center. Is still stick by my opinion that he’d be the 3rd Option on the Celtics
"Wrong on:  * Anthony Edwards. I thought he was a really good prospect, but the shot making he showed in the second half of the season was really impressive and ahead of schedule IMO. * Sekou Doumbouya. He's still a very young prospect, but after two years he hasn't improved as much as I would have hoped. I thought he had super high potential coming out of the draft but so far he hasn't shown much.  * Grant Williams. I wasn't as high on him as some other draft people were, but I didn't expect to just be flat out terrible.  Right on:  * Jarrett Culver. Great college player but I never understood why he was such a high pick. He's an inefficient jump shooter and he's not athletic/explosive enough to be a great finisher. His offensive strengths (passing/ball handling) aren't very valuable unless his scoring is good enough to be an on-ball threat. By all accounts, he sounds like a great dude and hard worker so I do hope he proves me wrong in year three though. * James Wiseman. He looked really raw which I expected. I still think he has high potential moving forward, but I was not surprised that he was a net negative as a rookie. This one is a major TBD though because he could make huge leaps moving forward. * Desmond Bane. I'm a biased Grizzlies fan, but Bane has been really damn good this season. He's older so his potential is lower than most picks, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's someone who averages like 19/4/4 in his prime."
"Rozier was used to get Kemba. You can do these for every GM, although yes. Some of Danny’s choices have sucked. Criticizing 2nd rounders is really stupid, almost everybody misses on them. Grant Williams doesn’t have much higher to go, but he cannot he fully evaluated. Yam Madar isn’t even allowed to play in the NBA yet. Romeo Langford is hardly a bust yet, he is like Matisse Thybulle with even less offense due to never getting a full offseason. Nesmith has looked very good last few months and has a very high ceiling. But yeah, no excuses for guys like James Young. Everybody thought he would be great, but it’s on the GM for not finding the right guy."
"Pritchard at 27 isn’t anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that’s solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn’t like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it’s concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn’t pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
"No, but I still hate them.  Grant Williams is the only one on the Celtics who really does it, but he does it like every single time. So annoying.  And the worst part is he is absolutely terrible so half the time it was at the end of games because those are the minutes he can get (outside of Brads weird love for him that randomly comes in and out) and it will be like a 20 point game and he just takes it.  Obviously our other guys do it every once in awhile, but not consistently, just so annoying to watch.  But shouldn’t be punished."
Trailblazers obviously need the only guy that can lock down jokic: grant Williams. A simple trade of Williams for lillard should do it
"Just because your fanbase is high on a player doesn’t mean everyone else should be.  Fans are always delusional when it comes to what their own player are worth. I’ve seen Celtics fans throw out some asinine trades with Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams etc who aren’t worth a bag of chips. It happens in every fanbase, don’t get defensive.  &gt;there is a market for him but what that market is nobody knows   What ?"
1.	Marcus Smart isoing 2.	Grant Williams or Semi Ojeleye checking in 3.	Tristan Thompson posting up
1. Marcus Smart taking a three 2. Grant Williams doing anything on offense 3. Tremont Waters getting minutes
Can i interest you in one Grant Williams
"He had a variety of times in college where he intentionally tripped players, just was a huge dickhead overall, he would try to be sly and get away with it which was even more angering.. in his first summer league he committed a few dirty fouls like tripping Grant Williams and later hitting him on the head out of anger, and at that point I just believed he was a lost cause. Seems to have improved his attitude and the interviews I’ve seen have made me like him a bit more, still he’s one of my least favorite players.  Also he looks like Ted Cruz, dude just has a punchable face."
"Him paired with a rotation of matchup centers (guys like TT, Kanter and Grant Williams) would be great if he could stay healthy because you can lean on whoever is the strongest in each matchup as his back up on any given night and not need to to push his minutes too far. We kind of have that this year obviously but health hasn’t let it work and we don’t have a traditional big so sometimes we struggle when a team has guys with legit size if TT can’t handle them. Obviously Kanter isn’t a good defender, but a guy like him is passable as long as the opposing center is another similar style player who isn’t a crazy athletic freak.   He would’ve been a helpful guy to keep for those matchups, would’ve been nice in hindsight to have a rotation of Rob, Theis and Kanter and skip out on signing TT."
I’d still take Turner over Grant Williams or Tristan Thompson but I understand your sentiment
"If you think he's turning down that player option then don't bother responding, no one is paying a 33 yo pg with bad knees any kind of serious money,, you're trash, your city is trash, your team is trash, please, respond with whatever you'd like, i guarantee you I'll never read your stupid, incoherent response, once again , you're a big doof , no one is taking kemba after the bad games he's put up, enjoy semi and grant Williams as main role players lollllllllllllllllll"
"I am sure he asked and the arrogant Danny Ainge refused because he can't be seen as capitulating to any player, even though that decision was to his own detriment. Ainge is very arrogant. Just look at his draft history picking Yabu and then Grant Williams who is Yabu 2.0"
No you're probably thinking of Grant Williams lol
"Even if the Celtics get eliminated, which seems likely once Brooklyn start hitting 3s, so far they showed enough of the Nets flaws so that I'm optmistic someone might be able to take them down.  Also, I'm absolutely shocked that Grant Williams hasn't seen a second of play so far. Thought it was a good matchup against the Nets."
Grant Williams will either drop 40 or have 40 dropped on him — no in between.
bruh can we organise a chess tournament between NBA players... there's Grant Williams from the Celtics who was like a mega pro back in the day... also [Gordon Hayward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiKxjL-HPSM)
Grant Williams robbed
"Celtics didn't use the picks when the opportunity arose. That was the problem. They could have gotten stars or even good role players with them. Instead, they chose to keep the picks and are stuck with the likes of Romeo Langford, Grant Williams for their bench."
no Grant Williams?
"The average value of a double-digit pick just isn't that high, is the thing. Most players picked later in the draft just aren't going to be stars. Sure, we don't have the track record of, like, the Raptors wrt late firsts, but since 2015 we've had 9 first-round picks outside the top 10 (not including the ones we immediately traded), of which:  — 2 (Terry Rozier, Rob Williams) are already starting-caliber players  — 2 (Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard) project to be very solid NBA players going forward  — 2 (Romeo Langford, Grant Williams) are fringe NBA-caliber players, although we've seen so little of Langford that he could end up either a tier down or up  — 3 (RJ Hunter, Guerschon Yabusele, Ante Zizic) were complete misses  For late firsts, I don't think that's a bad track record at all. He hasn't *completely* missed on a first-rounder since 2016 (though we'll see about Langford)."
Where the fuck is grant williams
I am shocked Grant Williams and Semi are nowhere to be found on here.
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Does Grant Williams not qualify for this List
We'll give you Romeo Langford and Grant Williams for Sabonis.
"I’m curious to see what we do with our draft picks this year. We could package them for a vet with scoring abilities like jerami grant, maybe a better rim protector like Myles turner.   We could also double up on shooters/playmakers in the draft. Davion Mitchell at 7 and Jalen Johnson/Zaire Williams at 17 would be a sweet first round."
"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"
"I think the biggest thing with the Sixers is that they handed over the reins to a bunch of guys to play huge minutes and lead their offense, who were not only unqualified to do so, but what’s worse is that they had no intentions of having those guys as future pieces of the franchise. Look at the dozens of guys who littered through the Process Sixers.  But this year I think the Thunder did well to give a lot of opportunities to guys they actually envision as part of their future. Or at a minimum they found out of guys deserve more time. Guys like Maleson, Bazley, etc. earned/were gifted huge minutes this year because of OKC’s situation. I think both of those guys will be on the team in 2-3 years.   ***  In contrast you have the **2013-14 Sixers** - their top 5 minutes leaders were:    - Thad Young (not with PHI following year)   - MCW (in season trade following year)   - James Anderson (not with PHI following year)   - Evan Turner (traded mid season that year)   - Tony Wroten (played 38 more games for PHI after 2014 season)  **2014-15 Sixers**  Top 5 minutes leaders    - Nerlens (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15)   - RoCo (finally someone they developed and held onto long term)    - Mbah a Moute (gone at end of season - why did they play a 28 year old vet 29 mpg to score &lt; 10 PPG on &lt; 40% FG)   - Hollis Thompson (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15, but this is exactly the type of young player they should’ve been playing, not known value vets like Luc)   - Henry Sims (gone at end of season)  **2015-16 Sixers**  Top 5 Minutes leaders    - Hollis Thompson (lead team in minutes, but then only played 31 games for them the next year)   - Jerami Grant (played 2 games for PHI following year)   - Isaiah Canaan (didn’t play with PHI following season - but even though he wasn’t in their future plans they had no problem letting him score 11 PPG on 36% FG)   - Nerlens    - RoCo  ***  Obviously, you never know what’s gonna happen, but this year the following were the top 5 minute-getters for OKC:   - Maledon (OKC acquired him in Horford deal and promptly signed him to a 3 year deal with a 4th year team option - ie they invested in his future)   - Bazley (used first round pick on him)   - Dort (signed through 2022-23 with OKC)   - Kenrich Williams (acquired via S&amp;T, signed through 2022-23)   - Isaiah Roby  With SGA and Poku rounding out the top 7.  Did sitting Horford make them less competitive? Of course. But let’s say, even if they didn’t have their own draft pick, sitting Horford still would’ve been the correct decision because realistically he is not a part of their future."
"Not dysfunctional. Unhealthy and no chance to build cohesion. The Jays/Kemba/Smart have played fewer  minutes together this season than in the bubble last year. Only 3 guys played at least 60 games: Pritchard (we’re the only play in or better team with a rookie leading in games played), Tatum, and Grant Williams.  Trust me, we know what a dysfunctional team looks like. Everybody’s taking responsibility for the team’s poor play and directing any criticism at the team as a whole rather than specific individuals and getting excited when their teammates do well. I might very well be an anomaly but I enjoyed this team notably more than 2019 despite doing worse."
You’re lucky to have dodged us. With superstars like *checks notes* Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye backing us up Embiid doesn’t stand a chance
"Waters is gone.  I think there is a strong possibility Thompson is moved, but I think that most likely only happens if Smart is also moved. I think we move both or zero.  I could see us letting Parker go, I think he would be solid to bring back tho.  Hopefully, literally praying that Grant Williams is somehow gone.   I guess Fournier could leave, but I doubt it.  And then there is always the possibility of Kemba if we can find a trade."
"Nah man, Smart is going to turn into Curry, Nesmith is gonna be Pierce, and Grant Williams is going to grow 5 inches and gain 50 pounds so he can guard Embiid."
Why on earth is Grant Williams in a playoffs ad
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
"There a lot you can hold Brad accountable for this year, trying to play Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson together is one of them. We even played a game against LAC and started Theis, TT AND Grant Williams LOL   But his star player catching Covid and missing 3 weeks, his star PG having to be heavily managed  cause of his knee and other injuries, his team captain missing time after his calf exploded, his second best player playing through knee tendinitis, a torn ligament in his wrist and being generally banged up, the big veteran center catching Covid and missing 3 weeks, his best center not being able to stay on the court, the guy they traded for to come save the bench catching Covid and not having actual NBA players on his bench from 10-15, is not Brad Stevens fault."
Yeah I thought he won the chess match against Nurse. It was a really great series for basketball nerds.   The best thing I have to say about Brad Stevens is that he tricked me into thinking Grant Williams was a good player at one point
So happy to not see Grant Williams out there
Can’t wait for Grant Williams to prove the haters wrong on national tv
"What is this parallel universe you're living in where Stevens didn't help develop Smart, Brown, and Tatum? Or perhaps Robert Williams, who was taken 27th and has become the team's best center in 3 years despite constantly dealing with injuries? Payton Pritchard is already playing very well, Aaron Nesmith started out poorly but has already improved a ton over the course of the season and has been balling lately. I guess Grant Williams is pretty ass. Do we blame Brad for Romeo Langford being perpetually injured? The rest of our ""young core"" is second rounders and two-way guys so I really fail to see what else he could have done here."
"Well you can disagree but thats what it was. Richmond consistently made all-nba over Miller and they were both on dream team 2 by the way. Richmond put up better stats and made almost everything off the dribble while Miller was mostly off ball   Miller made the playoffs more consistently but  had a better roster around him rik smits, Dale Davis, Chuck person, Mark Jackson, Jalen rose.   Compare that to the kings roster around Richmond Lionel Simmons, Warman Tisdale, Walt Williams, Brian Grant   In a vacuum Richmond was better and accolades wise had a better career than"
"This is what I’ve been saying. You can’t have Tacko, Waters, Edwards, Semi and Grant Williams. I love em all but that’s not a functional bench."
"I'd really only want/need to protect 6-7 players.  Tatum, Brown, Smart, Time-Lord, Nesmith, Pritchard &amp; Grant Williams + Langford if they Celtics *need* to protect 8 players.  Obviously the Celtics are better with Kemba Walker, but if an expansion team wants to take the last 2 years of his deal off the Celtics cap sheet I'd be okay with it."
Goodbye Grant Williams
I think Grant Williams might see some time if we go small but nothing more than 6-10 minutes.  But yeah you still right
He’s not good and reminds me of Grant Williams with hops
"I agreed with pretty much everything but the overrated coach part. I don’t see what you expect Brad Stevens to do with a roster that has the worst bench depth in the league. Blame should go to Ainge for surrounding the Jays with Grant Williams, Carson Edwards, and Romeo Langford."
What is Grant Williams good at exactly?
"But I think the ultimate point of the discussion is what Tatum and Zion did with the talent on their team. And for that, you have to look at what talent actually played. Which I feel is very much in the Pelicans’ favorit but it’s at least comparable.  You wouldn’t say well actually the Warriors have more talent this season than (insert team here) because they have Klay on the roster. And when the Nets lost to a Memphis team without JJJ and with Ja playing only 12 minutes earlier this year, it would be fair to say that a lack of talent was a factor since they might have had Kyrie and Durant on their roster (this was before the Harden trade) but both guys were irrelevant in the outcome of the game.   And similarly, a lot of talent was unavailable to Tatum through the season as only he, Grant Williams, and Payton Pritchard played over sixty games compared to Zion, Ingram, Bledsoe. And you lower it a bit to 55 games and get only Jaylen beating the benchmark vs Lonzo, Adams, Hayes."
"Ben Simmons for Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye and our 45th pick this year. We can also add Grant Williams if they ask for more."
"Celtics fans are so used to busts by now, Carsen, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Sullinger, Guerschon, the list goes on"
Those are Grant Williams numbers!
Celtics don't have a pick and were rumored to be looking. Maybe we are one of the teams. Not sure what we have other than like 45th pick and Grant Williams/Carsen Edwards? But no one is wanting Carsen Edwards lol
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"To a large extent I agree, but there are times when Tatum is out there with a lineup and its like whobdi you esxpect him to pass to. Smart, Richardson, Grant Williams lineups for instance"
That's too many wishes for Rob Williams to grant bro
"The roster is godawful outside of their top 4. The Celtics made 7 first round picks in 3 years and only kept the bad ones. They traded Bane and Thybulle while keeping borderline nba players like Langford, Pritchard, Nesmith and Grant fucking Williams.   I wrote that Ainge was the worst GM in the league over the past 3 years and got downvoted to shit on this sub. I can’t believe y’all are only now catching on. He caused one of the greatest outflows of talent I’ve ever seen."
"Hey come on now, we're right on the cusp we just need a few things to go our way like:  * Tatum needs to start hitting 3s again and finally turn into a good finisher  * Brown needs to turn up his assist numbers  * Smart needs to start limiting himself to only 7-8 shots a game (or start actually hitting his shots) and be relegated to a defensive minded ""shooting"" guard and occasional PG, rather than a starting PG  * Nesmith needs to become the sniper we know he can be (Currently averaging *checks notes* 0.00 points this season)  * Pritchard needs to become the #2 option at PG and hit his shots  * Schroeder needs to become the #1 option at PG and be a pass first guy  * Rob Williams needs to stay healthy  Langford, Al, Grant, and Richardson just keep doing what they're doing. They've been just Okay at worst, to our best player at best so far  Other than all that though I think we'll be good..."
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
Yup I agree. Unless we’d be getting someone like Grant (unlikely) or adding Williams+ for Siakam (not happening) then I’m more than happy to keep White. Can’t believe Bulls fans are even entertaining the idea of Bagley lol.
Coby white and a first for grant Williams who says no
"Could probably get Marvin Bagley for DDJ + the 1st.   Siakam, Jermai Grant, and Christan Wood are probably getable if they include Patrick Williams."
Ikr? Embarrassing that Grant Williams isn’t even mentioned
"Oh I guess Nesmith, Langford, Grant Williams, PP, and Carson Edwards (33rd pick) are all really helping the team.   Let’s not forget Ainge traded bayne, who’s killing it, for PP (who was over drafted by 15 spots). He also traded Thybuille for something no one can remember.  Ainge absolutely fucked this team up. To go 0/7 on first round picks and early second round picks is fucking your team up."
Brown and Tatum are good two way players they are like a lesser version of kawhi and pg. the problem is their roster around them. They start grant Williams he should be like a 12 th man. Dennis Schroeder is one of the worst starting pgs.
"Obviously hindsight is 20/20 but those Sacramento and Memphis picks had a lot more speculative value than actual. They were one pick away from Tyler Herro and when you look at who was drafted afterwards no real candidate steps out.  That being said, we can totally shit on Ainge for taking Grant Williams over Matisse Thybulle (see above post for that whole debacle)"
Ainge had multiple 1sts at his disposal so why not package two together to move up a spot or two?  Did you really need to add Grant Williams to your roster?
"I dunno, they've been leaking talent for like five years now.  Kyrie, Horford and Hayward walking for nothing hurt them badly.  Smart should be an energy defender but he's trying to run the offense alongside Schroeder, who, for all the flashes has never shown signs of really putting it together and being a starting level player.  Horford is pretty washed now and they're starting Grant Williams.    They're just shallow and Tatum/Brown isn't the elite, Kawhi/PG or Bron/AD level pairing they may have hoped a couple years ago."
"Their starting lineup doesn't have great playmaking or someone to legitimately run an offense. Brown is inconsistent coming off of an injury and COVID. The bench sucks. Schroder and Richardson are both one dimensional, which wouldn't be a giant deal if the rest of the bench wasn't just awful. Grant Williams has turned out better than I thought.  And for the controversial part... Tatum is overrated. He isn't about to carry a team with major issues past actual good teams. He's been able to in the past due to having a more balanced roster surrounding him and them being able to fill more needs that he struggles with. He doesn't have as reliable shooting around him this year, and doesn't have someone that is really able to create for the team outside of rarely Schroder or Smart.   I see Boston as a play-in team this season"
"To some degree is maybe correct but it is a rather poorly constructed 3 point shooting team. Outside of Brown and Tatum, 6 of their next 8 guys are career 35% or below shooters. The two who aren’t are Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard who are rather low volume."
"Horford 5 years ago sure he was a good player. Frankly he’s in the twilight of his career.   Schroeder is wildly inconsistent. I wouldn’t call him a 6th man candidate. He’s an average backup PG. He will win them some games but also lose them some games.   Grant Williams? Nice player, but not moving the ceiling of this team  Smart is kinda like Schroeder in the sense that he will win you games and lose you games. Also kinda injury prone at this point unfortunately.   Sure these are not BAD players, but are they better than some of the other ensembles in the East? They’re certainly not better than the heat for example. Offensively they’re probably better than the Knicks but not defensively. The bulls have talented offensive players. Idk. I think people have this old image of the Celtics that made the conference finals because smart Tatum and brown are still there but this is a very different team and the East is completely changed. That first Boston team when They went to the ECF vs lebron was a VERY weak eastern conference.   Robert Williams however, is awesome. If he can stay healthy"
"He played against Grant Williams, that's why."
"2 players that were in the 3 point contest last year, Al Horford who’s a top 5 shooter at the center position, Grant Williams who’s a great shooter, and Schröder?  Idk but to me that should be a pretty great shooting lineup"
The best high-ish volume 3pt shooter is Grant Williams…that’s not ideal
"Yeah we have two all stars, but literally no supporting cast. It’s actually terrible. Jabari Parker is one of our key bench guys. Grant Williams and Romeo Langford are borderline starters. Marcus Smart is our 3rd best player, and we’re starting two big men who can’t shoot, one of whom is 36. You can say covid decimated us, but we also don’t have 3 of our 6 best players from last season, so it doesn’t necessarily translate to a better record. Throw on all that replacing a top 5-10 coach with a rookie, I don’t see how we should expect more than a couple wins better than last season."
"I don't watch many Wizards games - is Bradley Beal always this annoying? That collision he initiated with Schroeder where he collapsed to the  floor, the push off on Grant Williams where he expected a foul call? Just his general bitchiness. How do yall watch this and root for him?"
"Trade you Grant Williams for him.   Grant is already an NBA starter, (started one game this year), AND is younger than Siakam. Siakam is a very old G-League prospect that can't possibly have the potential Grant has."
