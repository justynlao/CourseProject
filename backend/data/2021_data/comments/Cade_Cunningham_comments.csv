We really beat the Nets twice then said fuck it Cade Cunningham looks nice
Cade Cunningham tho
Cade Cunningham going to look nice is a Detroit uni
"Bruh, this Homie ODing on copium. Get him 50ccs of Cade Cunningham highlights. STAT"
Cade Cunningham gonna look great in blue and orange
"At this rate, Mavs are closer to the Cade Cunningham sweepstakes than making the playoffs."
people laugh at the pels but when we draft cade cunningham its over for you hoes
Cade Cunningham is still too shook to confront D Rose to this day
Cade Cunningham. Every game is a knife fight between the Faders and team Winning Culture.
"Cade Cunningham was born sept. 25, 2001  We‚Äôre getting old"
"All team got worse, which is good for Pistons &amp; Wiz, in hope of getting Cade Cunningham with d first overall pick in July 2021."
I honestly thought we would struggle to win 15 games this season and tank for Cade Cunningham. I am also ashamed to admit that I wanted to trade Garland in order to make room for Cade. I've never been so happy to eat crow!
"Hornets. Then we draft Cade next year  LaMelo, Simmons, Cunningham &gt;&gt; Luka/Giannis"
"We give him westbrook, guess we‚Äôll have to give him Cade Cunningham"
Y‚Äôall get yourself a nice Cade Cunningham. You deserve it.
"You‚Äôd better sharpen up and win some games. My Pistons have only played bad enough to sniff a #1 pick once in the past 40 or so years, and that was when we got Grant Hill.   Teams like the Wolves are always getting the top picks. Stop being so selfish and let another team have one!  We need Cade Cunningham like we needed Isiah Thomas in the 1980 draft.   Everyone else, fuck off!"
"After the season perhaps, why not go for a Top 3 Draft pick to ensure its out of the Warriors hands?  Then get one of Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs."
If they get Cade Cunningham that will help. That dude can ball!
"Exactly. Bulls fans who are not against trading Zach don't think he's a bad player, just don't think he's a true #1 due to his poor defense and decision making as a play maker.   People bring up Booker, who was always a bit better of a passer than LaVine, and point to the Suns now being good. Well yeah, they added arguably the best point guard of all time to their team haha. CP3 can turn anyone into a playoff team ‚Äì we saw it with OKC last year.   I would have loved the Bulls to get him. So, our doubts are more about trying to get the superstar winning player like a CP3 to pair with Zach. If we can't bring that guy in, or develop one of our young guys to be that soon, then maybe trading him and trying to land a Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley type potential two way superstar is our best option.   I trust AKME to make smart decisions."
Hope Cade Cunningham likes cold weather
That's a weird way of spelling Cade Cunningham
I'm torn between the Evan Mobley/Cade Cunningham potential and just wanting these dudes to absolutely lay waste to everyone in the east for the next 5 months
"The NBA ain't letting Cade Cunningham come to Detroit.   Prove me wrong, Adam."
Gonna be interesting to see how he looks next to Cade Cunningham next year lol.
What if miraculously Cade Cunningham falls out of the top 3 (you never know. We still haven't seen the G-League prospects) and we get him with the Minny pick  Cade/EP/Wiseman with Andy as the elder statesman to carry the torch after Steph/Klay/Dray hang it up üí¶üí¶üí¶
Cade Cunningham
That means you might win the Cade Cunningham lottery though
"Yeesh. Nasty sprain right there. I'd start watching some Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs highlights if I was a Rockets fan"
"I agree that the state is producing lots of top tier talent, but I think the chance either of these guys get drafted #1 is very very low. Cade Cunningham is basically a lock barring an injury."
Yeah except Cade Cunningham is getting drafted first in 2021.
Get cade Cunningham
If they get Cade Cunningham and Mikey Williams
"It‚Äôs gonna end up top 3 so they will get it, then they will draft Cade Cunningham and he will be a superstar but KAT will leave and they will just be mediocre to bad for years even with a superstar."
Chris Boucher said ‚Äúfuck a Cade Cunningham‚Äù
"Warriors gonna land Cade Cunningham from this Minnesota pick, calling it now"

"Yeah if Zach stays, Coby probably tops out as a sixth man since the fit is so awkward. Sadly they'll always have to share the floor at some point, even if you stagger them as much you can. It would be better if we had Cade Cunningham üëÄ"

Better angle?  Trade your players and draft Cade Cunningham after you go 17 and 55.  Better fucking angle.  Sign FVV trade everyone else go 22-50 and draft Cade Cunningham.  That is and was your only path.
cade cunningham i‚Äôm ready
Like contending for Cade Cunningham sweepstakes or like probably picking around 10??
"I mean you could do this for every team right. Here I'll do it for the T-Wolves:  Malik Beasley has been good for them averaging over 20 points a game, Anthony Edwards looks like he's going to be a star, Ricky Rubio is good enough to contribute for a contender, and their own pick could fall top-3 this year and they could get Cade Cunningham. D'Angelo Russell has had a rough start but once he gets going he's gonna be scary. KAT's mom passed away through COVID and he's going through a lot rn as well, and he's missed a few games through a hand injury, but there's a great chance he could get to all-NBA level play soon enough and Wolves could go on a winning streak.  But nobody gives Wolves or any other team extra context for no reason. So I'm not sure why you feel Warriors need so much extra context."
"Honestly, these are why I'd prefer one of two options if they do pay players:  1) My preferred idea: Make intramural sports a federal work-study position. It could be added to scholarships and give some money to players in addition to it legally- but at the same time, federal work study pay is limited to a certain amount, so the star basketball player makes as much as the star QB, and they make as much as the low person on the bench, and they make as much as the top women's basketball player in the school, and they make as much as the low-level swimmer or wrestler at the school...and they all make as much as much as the kid who works at the campus library or is busing tables in the dining hall. It's not a LOT of money, but it gives players a little bit of spending money.  And if you think ""well, the top players should be allowed to get a market rate"", then my secondary plan:  2) Yes, let players for college basketball teams sign for a higher price and what the market rate for their talent would be. If Kentucky wants to pay the top high school player $1 million, let them do it...  ...but there's a catch. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. If a player agrees to take money from a college team, that constitutes a binding contract with the college. As such, any player who takes the money is required to play all four years of eligibility with the school (or at least ""they must graduate from the school before declaring"", which often times is still at least three years.) If James Harden couldn't say ""I don't want to play for the Rockets anymore, I choose not to honor my contract and am declaring myself a free agent"", then Cade Cunningham shouldn't be able to say ""Oklahoma State offered me 1 million for four years of college? Thanks for the million, now I'm declaring for the NBA Draft."""
"if you look at european soccer, the lack of a draft allows teams like barcelona, man city and real madrid to poach talent. smaller markets in europe will never even dream of getting someone as marketable a zion or a cade cunningham. so you have teams who can buy up all the exciting youth talent, which leaves every other team searching desperately for scraps. getting rid of the draft would have enormous implications for small market teams who relay on lottery picks to turn their franchise around. Without the draft, trae young is not a hawk. zion is not a pelican, donavan mitchell is nowhere near utah. every soild youth prospect will either be a laker, a clipper, a knick or a bull. why would you sign with the charlotte hornets, when the most iconic franchises in the league are offering more or better amenities? do not get rid of the draft. small markets NEED the draft."
"I think he‚Äôll end up in the Booker/Zion tier rather than the Luka/Jokic one. He‚Äôll be a scoring stud, might even win a scoring title if he ever ends up in a position where he needs to take that many shots. But future stars come into the league every year, it‚Äôs not as simple as looking at all the young guys now. Who can say whether Cade Cunningham might be better in four years"
I see y‚Äôall criticizing but how is that bad of an idea? You all act like every player would join the Lakers. But the reality is that there would still be a salary cap and players wouldn‚Äôt want to play in a team where they won‚Äôt have minutes to prove themselves. If I‚Äôm Cade Cunningham I would rather go play in any other team than the Lakers where I know I won‚Äôt have a chance to prove myself.
For the most part that is what happens already. And not everyone will go there because there is still the allure of playing time and priority on the court. A guy like Cade Cunningham will make more money in endorsements as the number 1 option in OKC compared to being 3rd option in LA
Whatever keeps Cade Cunningham out of Memphis is fine with me
CADE CUNNINGHAM COMING TO HOUSTON BABY!
Yeah if we can get Cade Cunningham
"Take Kyrie and every pick the Nets have. Kyrie retires, saving the Rockets millions upon millions in cap. Now you got cap room and a horde of picks along with a pretty good supporting cast of Wall, Gordon, PJ Tucker, Wood, Nwaba and Boogie. You got the ammo to trade up for Cade Cunningham (or whoever tf they want), and the cap space to sign a someone like Oladipo, Millsap, Blake Griffin etc."
This is why we need Cade Cunningham.
I would‚Äôve said Luka but I‚Äôm getting the first overall pick and therefore Cade Cunningham so I guess I don‚Äôt need a point guard.
"Here‚Äôs mine:   I start off by picking Giannis. LeBron is a good option because he‚Äôs going to give you a shot at the title the quickest, but at his age there‚Äôs no telling if he‚Äôll be able to play at a high enough level by the time the rest of the roster is in place to contend. Although the other positive with LeBron is he‚Äôd likely be the best at being able to entice free agents to come play with him following the first season. I‚Äôd consider Luka too.   After Giannis, I snag D‚ÄôAntoni from the Nets assistant coach spot and take Cade Cunningham with the first pick in the draft. With the rest of the team I surround Giannis with the best unprotected 3 and D guys I can get from every team. Also try to get a pure point guard type like Rondo, although there‚Äôs a good chance he will be protected. Basically just build a team of shooters around the gravity of Giannis, with distributors who can get the ball to the open man consistently. Get a center that can at least play defense and run Giannis at the 4. D‚ÄôAntoni will play a lot of pacey small ball with Giannis at the 5 which has the potential to be absolutely devastating. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a team that could contend relatively quickly. Giannis would need help, and I would hope that Cunningham quickly develops into a reliable ball handler and scorer that can create his own shot and distribute effectively."
"To be fair I think Kobe really solidified his legacy with the 2 rings he won without Shaq years after the thread, I was a kid then but was Kobe really talked about as a top 10 all timer at that point? I don‚Äôt think it was as crazy as like asking if Cade Cunningham will surpass Lebron in the current day."
Oh god Cade Cunningham with the developmental prowess of the warriors god no
"Pascal playing well, now imagine this team with Cade Cunningham üò©"
Siakam said Cade Cunningham ain't coming to Toronto
Knicks playing for Cade Cunningham and Jalen Suggs.
"Cade Cunningham isn't even a guaranteed #1 tbh. There are some guys who might push him. Thing is those few guys are still considered better options than, say, Anthony Edwards."
"Cade Cunningham, the presumed #1 pick in the draft rn, playing at Oklahoma State"
"I still have hope that the Thunder land a top 3 pick in 2021 and get one of Cade Cunningham, Suggs, or Mobley to pair with SGA.   Having one of those guys as your Batman going forward and Shai being your Robin along with Bazely and Dort for supporting cast then that's an excellent young core.  Poku is still really raw and has no idea how to play basketball and Maledon could be a really solid backup guard."

"Kerr take off the fucking bench, let‚Äôs tank and get Cade Cunningham or Jalen."
"I‚Äôve watched enough OSU basketball to know that if we draft Cade Cunningham, he won‚Äôt be the starting 1 and would likely play the 2, maybe 3.   We have a treasure trove of picks right now. If Presti sees a must draft prospect, we can easily move up the draft board to get him."
Cade Cunningham prayer circle boys
The Hornets are too good that we don't even need Cade Cunningham.
Bet we see more of the same from Cade Cunningham next season.
Cade Cunningham really about to be a Wizard next season
Orlando but that might change next season after we draft cade Cunningham and are fully healthy.
"This team, with Klay instead of Oubre, plus Cade Cunningham? Lmfao hard as a rock"
"this hurts our chances of getting cade cunningham, doesn‚Äôt it"
"So the Pelicans are entirely dependent on Lonzo Ball having a good game? No thanks, that seems too risky. If we're not willing to shell out for Ball in RFA (and some team will overpay him), you might as well as package him and Bledsoe for expiring contracts, bench help, picks while rolling with a NAW/Hart backcourt. Unless our plan is to ""lose competitively"" and then Griffin wears his lucky tie for Cade Cunningham.      We had this problem last year too when we got off to that 6-22 start, and we just assumed it's Gentry.  But this team should not be dependent on Lonzo Ball when it's built around Ingram and Zion."
The tank continues. Cade Cunningham is ours
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a Cade Cunningham / Anthony Edwards trio with KAT as the seasoned vet.
Welcome to the Cade Cunningham prayer circle üôèüèª
"Please just let us die for this year..... we deserve it, we deserve Cade Cunningham"
"Fred VanVleet, Cade Cunningham, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
IT‚ÄôS CADE CUNNINGHAM WITH A STEEL CHAIR
Toronto is on my top 5 list to draft Cade Cunningham and Miami is my favorite to get Lowry in a trade
At least now it will make more sense for the Pistons to draft Cade Cunningham
Wolves really traded Wiggins + potentially Cade Cunningham for D'Lo ..
Imagine the Raptors get Cade Cunningham.   Luka Doncic all over again
"Plus, with Cade Cunningham coming out this year, this is the year to be bad if you have too. Deep draft."
"I wouldn‚Äôt trade Bageley for Randle straight up what makes you think I would give you a 22,11,7 player AND Cade Cunningham"
"Given the history between the wolves and the bulls, Id say two more seasons including this until KAT realises he wants to play beside PatWill and cade Cunningham and hence demands a trade. So approximating 6-7 years for the picks to blossom, the wolves are officially 10 years away from contending"
Cause there's a special kid named Cade Cunningham playing for Oklahoma State.
Thanks for beating us. Cade Cunningham szn
Pascal Siakam and the draft rights to Cade Cunningham.
I still have faith we can turn it around  THAT BEING SAID  Cade Cunningham looks nice
Cade Cunningham
cade cunningham
"Timberwolves are going to waste KAT, Anthony edwards and possibly even Cade Cunningham a sad sight"
Cade Cunningham will take them to the promised land.
"OKC before Cade Cunningham dropped 40 pts: *let‚Äôs give it our best every night, we can beat anyone with teamwork!*  OKC after the Cade dropped 40 pts: *I‚Äôve fallen and I can‚Äôt get up*   Coincidence? I think not"
Idunno Cade Cunningham might
"It's not seen as virtuous or whatever (anymore at least). The NBA just won't let you join until you're a year out of high school. I'm sure Cade Cunningham would love to be making his big NBA money right now, but the NBA won't let him."
"Cade Cunningham going to Oklahoma State was such a W for him though, nobody's watching Ignite games, and Cunningham is building a brand in college."
"the best timeline: after he wins one in brooklyn, old man harden goes back to houston (when tilman isn't owner anymore) to pair up with cade cunningham and chris paul, with russell westbrook coming off the bench(still averaging 10/10/10 on 10 turnovers) wins a ring."
Cade Cunningham?
"Sharife Cooper has a mountain of flaws, but Cunningham is not even close to Cooper level as a passer.  Cooper might not be able to show that off in the NBA cause his other flaws will expose him, but he makes insane passes and finds people on lobs that no one expects.  So Cade ranks highly in this class as a passer, maybe he is easily top 2, but I think he probably is closer to 3 than to 1.  I bet he is a lot closer to Giddey as a passer than to Sharife.  Cade makes super smart reads a lot of the time, but he isn't that level of special as a passer.  And Cade's handles are pretty bad if the comparison is Luka or Trae or LaMelo, so he can't even create that many passing angles compared to the elite lead players in the NBA."
"I think we should tank. This team will clearly not accomplish anything in the playoffs, which is why we should trade giannis to the warriors for wiggins and rebuild around cade cunningham"
With our luck we get the number 1 pick and Cade Cunningham sits out a year
"Kuminga is a way better athlete and defensive player, and is a pretty good playmaker himself and ball handler. Just shooting, he‚Äôs really a guy who can play 1-4 defense. As far as size, Cunningham is laughably over listed in his height, no way he is 6‚Äô8, he will measure closer to 6‚Äô6 and Kuminga just judging by his height on court in the G league is right there with him 6‚Äô6 or 6‚Äô7. You take Cade for his offensive ceiling but Kuminga probably has the highest overall ceiling and provides yet another defensive weapon."
Celtics just need to tank for Cade Cunningham üòÇ
&gt;Cade Cunningham OSU highlights - Next Celtics Star?  LMFAO
"They still need that star imo so I got my fingers crossed for Cade Cunningham. Sexton, Okoro, Cunningham, Nance, Allen with a bench of Garland, Windler/Stevens, Cedi, Prince and Love (He‚Äôd probably bristle at coming off the bench but he doesn‚Äôt really fit with the idea of this starting unit, which needs Nance‚Äôs defensive versatility) would be pretty fun basketball to watch next year with real upside going forward."
Teams with interest in Cade Cunningham
They saw Cade Cunningham play at halftime
His passing improved so much. However I‚Äôd prefer drafting a true PG. Cade Cunningham is still my preferred pick

Cade Cunningham is looking like he could be one
"Depends on the rookie. Top 2 should liiiikely be Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley, and both would be really good fits in my view, and look like they could have pretty serious immediate impact."
Warriors will be selecting Cade Cunningham
"'And with the first overall pick, Miami Heat drafts Cade Cunningham' \[not\]"
Just think about Cade Cunningham before you do anything rash here wizards.  Edit: god dammit.
"&gt; The most impressive thing about Cunningham‚Äôs game is that there aren‚Äôt any real holes in it. He can shoot, score, pass, rebound, and defend. It isn‚Äôt as simple as it sounds, especially for a perimeter player with so much size. Most teenagers with his physical tools are able to cut corners at lower levels of the game, and then have to spend years improving their weaknesses and making up for lost time against better competition in the NBA. Cunningham has skipped that part of the process. He‚Äôs a diamond without any flaws at just 19 years old. He could help almost any NBA team right now.

It‚Äôs an underrated though but:  I‚Äôd rather overpay for an asset/player that fits than to be left without it.   This ideology is why I think we‚Äôll trade for Cade Cunningham
Zion is alright...but Lamelo is in a whole other level in terms of popularity and talent.  1 Year Later...  Lamelo Ball is alright...but Cade Cunningham is really special probably the best prospect since LeBron  Rinse and repeat
Pair him up with cade Cunningham or kuminga(if we get either) and see if we can make a run next year fully healthy.
Thank you for your contribution to the Cade Cunningham Contest
Praying for Cade Cunningham/One of the Jalens/Kuminga lol
"I assume that this is aimed at Thunder fans because we are complaining about winning too many games and missing out on Cade Cunningham, but I'm sure there are other fans who would like to win the lottery as well. But look at it from our perspective. We had KD who was drafted high. Our GM also drafted two other MVP level players with top 5 picks. KD left us for nothing and our championship Hope's were gone after he left. Sure we have fielded competitive teams at making the playoffs since he left, but we are tired of first round exits. Internal development will only get you so far until you have to find a way to acquire talent. There is nothing wrong with punting a few years and letting young guys like Pokusevski and Diallo get 20 + minutes a game and losing games in hope to get a high lottery pick. The last thing us fans want is for Shai to make it to the first round year after year and get bounced, so he has to leave and we are left back where we were never getting anywhere. The idea is to suck and develop for a few years if you win too many games that's fine you can always trade up in the draft, make moves whatever, but ultimately you want that top 5 pick for your GM to have a chance to draft who he wants. Especially in our case where Presti has proven he is above average at scouting talented players. We just want a young team that is competing for a championship in a few years instead of constantly getting knocked out in the first round. Heck the Jazz are great this year, but we all know come playoff time LeBron and AD will beat them in the playoffs. OKC wants one of those next generational guys like LeBron and the only way to get one in a place like OKC is to draft them."
So if they scored 106 points this year they would be looking very closely at Cade Cunningham.
Cade Cunningham would honestly be perfect for the Bulls. Play him at the 3 as the main playmaker and run with White/LaVine/Cunningham/Markkanen/Carter Jr.
Zach LaVine has been great and probably should be an All-Star this year. I‚Äôm unconvinced on Coby White being our starting point guard though. He had a great game tonight and I‚Äôm tired of tanking but I‚Äôd loooove to see us get lucky with the lottery and draft Cade Cunningham. Also Patrick Williams is actually developing really well
We appreciate your contribution to the Cade Cunningham contest
"Depending on our level of play once kat returns and if we keep our pick we traded to gs (only a 40% chance if we finish bottom 3) trading kat is an interesting thought exercise. Its starting to become inevitable at this point and seeing some of the recent hauls for superstars (imo) you gotta wonder what a rebuild around anthony edwards, malik beasley and say cade cunningham and assets from kat and probably dlo would look like"
Is he wrong though???? Mitchell will lead you to the 3rd seed while Westbrook would lead you to Cade Cunningham
Why get 8th seed when 15th seed and Cade Cunningham do trick?
Cade Cunningham in OKC
I‚Äôd take the Rockets and build it around Cade Cunningham.
"Could be somebody not in the league yet like Cade Cunningham, Emoni Bates, Chet Holgrem."
I mean sure it could happen if a team wanted to gives a established very good young player for a chance at a very good young player. But no on is gonna trade him for a chest full of lottery picks. Because when teams trade for a chest full of picks they do it in hope of landing a Cade Cunningham
"Cade Cunningham isn‚Äôt LeBron prospect level.   If a team makes a ridiculous offer, it can happen"
Cade Cunningham would fit right in

"Cade Cunningham - Trevor Lawrence: Tall/Big generation talents that every team wants  Patrick Beverly - Jalen Ramsey (ramsey a lot better but the attitude and skillset): Defensive focused players in LA that are aggressive, get a lot of fouls, talk shit and love to take on the star player of the other team, heart and soul of team  Daniel Jones RJ Barrett:Young top 10 picks out of 2019 Duke that have been really good but sometimes inconsistent. Are both doubted and underrated by media  Kyler Murray Devin Booker or Lamelo Ball: Young exciting prospects out of Arizona (Besides Ball) that will be top players in the future  Aaron Donald Rudy Gobert: Large players that impact the entire defense of their team  DK Metcalf/Zion Williamson: Large freak athletes with a really bright future in the league  Baker Mayfeild Lonzo Ball: Top picks in their respective class that haven't panned out but are still good players, Lonzo is a lot like a QB and they both have been overshadowed by better players in their draft"
What about a generational point forward by the name of Cade Cunningham
"The Jays literally have no blame. They are forced to iso because nobody else can be a ball handler on the court. Your a Sixers fan, correct? So how do you see the Jays sweeping you guys in the playoffs without any help and come to the conclusion that they must be the problem. They should‚Äôve impressed you last playoffs, if they haven‚Äôt, then you might not be watching. Just like you guys aren‚Äôt gonna blame Embiid for the playoff losses last year, we are absolutely not gonna blame our two best players who are the only reason this team isn‚Äôt drafting Cade Cunningham for the losses."
It‚Äôs disgusting how they do these media blasts. Last year it was Ja and now he‚Äôs just a fart in the wind because we can talk about Lamelo or SGA.  Can‚Äôt wait til all of a sudden Lamelo doesn‚Äôt contribute to ‚Äúwinning basketball‚Äù because the hornets are under .500 and Cade Cunningham is the REAL future.

I know he‚Äôs not in the league yet but Cade Cunningham will make whatever team gets him a lot better. He‚Äôs the perfect modern player
Prolly  Cade Cunningham is gonna be a very good player.  His best skill is his playmaking and his size is very good. He‚Äôs really smooth and of course he can shoot. His defense is pretty good  Whatever team gets Cade will be good for a while
Cade Cunningham sounds like a Knight of the Round Table
I am hoping we get that guy this year. Would love one Cade Cunningham
"Cade Cunningham, captain of the B2B Champion Houston Rockets."
Many people dont realize that Pokusevski is two months younger than Cade Cunningham. Just the fact that he can go out on the floor in the NBA and make a few highlights and contribute a little shows how much potential he has at this age. I don't watch a lot of OKC games but everytime I watch Pokusevski he seems better than he was earlier.
Keep the Cade Cunningham dream alive
"I never said the #1 pick couldn‚Äôt play on a great college team. Yes Suggs is playing well, but he also has the 2nd best post player in college and the best shooter in the nation along side him. he did not have a better year than Cade. Stay wise or production wise. And when talking about NBA PROSPECTS. A 6‚Äô8 lead ball handler that‚Äôs an elite PnR player, elite iso player, switchable defensively, a 40% volume shooter 3pt shooter, and high level playmaker isn‚Äôt getting passed up on again.   Give Cade Cunningham JUST Drew Timmie and Corey Kispert and he would look like the best PG prospect we‚Äôve ever seen."
Cade Cunningham is not the best prospect of his generation.
I miss the old Cade Cunningham
FVV heroball + Aron Baynes = Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham
cade cunningham that you?
Okeke and Mo Bamba are the TRUTH  Okeke so smooth with that jumper. Magic future is bright.   Imagine adding Cade Cunningham to this young developing core.

"The year is 20XX. De‚ÄôAaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report.

The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De‚ÄôAaron Fox apocalypse. But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox‚Äôs raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association‚Äôs version of basketball.

So how likely is it for OKC to package this truck load of picks for Cade Cunningham? And then package the others for Bronny Jr if he turns out to be a stud?
The wish for parity in the NBA is rediciolous and just logically wrong in compedetive sports. I guess Cade Cunningham is thrilled to stay the next 8 years in Fettita Houston in the name of parity while other young player can strive in well run franchises. Open the market.
"I believe it is ""Trading Kyle and getting few players who are good (Like Kyle but younger) would hinder our progress of fading for Cade Cunningham"""

OKC Thunder drafts Cade Cunningham from the University of Oklahoma State
I‚Äôm scared of you guys getting Cade. League would be fucked in 3 years if a healthy Cunningham/Edwards/KAT trio are together
"Magic  Cavs, Wolves, and Pistons would still be lottery teams right now with Cunningham and his fit at Minnesota and Cleveland is uncertain  Rockets have Wall and KPJ so Cade would probably struggle to be the main ball handler there too  The Magic are better than the Kings when it comes down to those 2 particular rosters"
"team was 6-2 and had one the best record in the league with Fultz. Yes thats not many games but it looked very promising. We dont even have JI who is a premier defender in the league. We HAVE to flip Gordon and Evan together for something substantial.   We are actually in a great spot to get a top 3 pick which is either Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Evan Mobley. All 4 I think are gonna be good. Cades 99% going 1st so hypothetically lets say we get Suggs or Green to fill that SG spot our team looks like this  1. Fultz 2. Green/Suggs OR a guy that can be packaged with Gordon and Fournier. Oladipo again? 3. Okeke (Can put your top 3 pick here too if you move those guys for a SG..Either way the SG and SF could be interchangeable) 4. Isaac 5. Vooch  Bench: Cole, Bamba, Ross, Birch, Bacon  Thats a top 5 seed in the East"
"Sexton is honestly an undersized shooting guard. The only reason he‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúpoint guard‚Äù is his height. Garland is the real playmaker in the offense and while Sexton shows flashes every once in a while - almost literally once in a while - he definitely doesn‚Äôt look to facilitate. Kinda like early career Kyrie, only difference is Kyrie had to learn how to be a facilitator and play off the ball once Bron showed up and ever since he left Cleveland his playmaking has been a lot better. I think for how the Cavs are constructed right now with not too many shot creators it works because somebody has to score, and Sexton is definitely a great scorer, but I also believe someone‚Äôs going to have to come along (fingers crossed we somehow get Cade Cunningham) and be the primary ball handler to help Sexton develop and learn to play more within an offense. I do think CP3 is an unfair comparison. His passing vision and feel for the game are almost innate, but I understand your point. Hopefully Sexton can continue to grow and evolve as the team does but I don‚Äôt think his current play style is sustainable for a full time starter on a contender, more of someone who can come off the bench to score and provide a spark."
"Cade Cunningham will be an all after year 1 and All NBA year 2.  Technically that‚Äôs still college tho, so Marcus Smart is a more impactful player then Julius Randle."
Stop giving a damn for Cade Cunningham
So what is an ideal world for the Thunder?   * Swap Hill/Horford/Ariza for 1sts * Houston gets the 5th pick * OKC gets in the lottery and lucks into the 1st pick   Then they enter next year with SGA/Dort/Poku/Maledon/Baze/Roby + Cade Cunningham and Mobley/Kuminga/Suggs (this draft looks nuts just at a glance)

I‚Äôm talking Cade Cunningham man.   We know SGA will never go first. He‚Äôs already been drafted.
trying to get cade cunningham
"Agreed. That move would be another ‚Äúlet‚Äôs bring in another big name to cover up for other issues that ultimately won‚Äôt get us anywhere‚Äù. If I were Minnesota, I would be trying to move D‚Äôlo before Beasley. Especially with it looking like Cade Cunningham might be going there if the lottery shakes out correctly.    I actually think either you guys or Sacramento would be a good spot for Collins"
"Could it be about this seasons upcoming draft? If so Cade Cunningham will be an all star year 1, one of the greatest rookies we will have ever seen."
"Absolutely, I think the competing philosophy though is all the top picks play the same position as Russell and Towns. Maybe I am overthinking the positional overlap as basketball is becoming more and more a sport where you can play your 5 best guys regardless of position, but if you're drafting Cade Cunningham you have to start wondering about the fit next to Russell, and if they can't fit then you gotta see what you can get back for Russell (and maybe Rubio too).  From there you gotta start wondering about Towns because you just traded one of his best buddies. Russell was brought to Minny in part to make Towns happy and get him to stay in town. How much longer is he going to want to play in Minny waiting for a 19 year old Cunningham to develop.  This same argument works with Mobley and Towns. Issues of fit, then how much Russell would want to be in Minny without Towns. They seem like a package deal: if you deal one, you gotta deal both."
Yeah imma need that Timberwolves pick chief   Maybe even find a way to get rid of that top 3 protection   I want to live in the bizarro universe where the Mavs draft Cade Cunningham and we have 2 6'7 point guards on the court at the same time
"So the goal is to win the finals in 2 years? With a 28 year old KAT and a 21 year old Edwards? That doesn't seem likely.   I think MINN just has to ask for a lot. GSW is a team many think will want to go all in on KAT. KAT for Wiseman, Oubre, Looney, with the MINN 2021 1st protected, the GSW 2021 1st, and whatever other 1sts and pick swaps both sides can agree on?  This way you have Edwards (SG), Wiseman (C), Cade Cunningham (PG), and the MINN 2022 1st as a core. They'd also go into next year with Beasley, Oubre (resigned), Rubio, and Russell.   You get the young core that can build together, and maybe make a great playoff run next year.   Or even a similar Ayton deal with the Suns."
"Lamelo for me, I feel like people are way more interested in him as a person than Zion. People only really check out Zion for highlights.   I could see Cade Cunningham/Jalen Green, or Emoni Bates/Chet Holmgren in a couple years also entering the conversation, they all have the talent+personality to do it imo. Kinda stretching the personality part with Cade, but he has the media push to make up for it."
i‚Äôm so excited for cade cunningham
"I watched Cade Cunningham today, we also don‚Äôt play a non-playoff team until april 1st"
"Honestly, I'm beginning to think you might be right.  It comes down to how our core bounces back from covid. Virus is a bitch. Even when they come back, it might take a couple months to get back to form.  Trade lowry for pieces, dip into the lottery, grab us a cade Cunningham or an Evan mobley, chip in three years nbd."
"This is the difference between a team mentality and a franchise mentality. The team mentality says go out and win as many games as you can always, the franchise mentality says this isn‚Äôt about the 2020-21 season, or the next couple for that matter, its about the long-term health of the franchise.   The Inside guys seem to think the warriors have one more run in them, I don‚Äôt see it that way. With or without Klay Thompson, none of those guys who were part of the 2015-2019 teams are the same. They have two choices here  1. Mortgage the future of the franchise (Wiseman, T-Wolves pick, Wiggins) to try to bring in a player to help them win now against the likes of the Lakers, Nets, Sixers, and Bucks  2. Trade Steph and Klay for talented young players and picks, building the team around James Wiseman and possibly a Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green with an eye toward returning to the top of the top of the mountain in 3 years or so when the Nets and Lakers are no longer as dominant"
I‚Äôd prefer the fucked with Cade Cunningham than without
Well outside of the team I root for(Go Blue!)   I would say cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley
"Absolutely, but as talented as some prospects and ncaa players are it would be unfair to make them play against euro teams. They are officially amateur while the euros age professionals.  And no, Cade Cunningham is currently not better than let's say, Vasilije Micic."
"Man, would love to see him with OKC if they miss out in Cade Cunningham. With their development staff, I think he could really thrive there."
Peace out brother. Let's get back to the basement where we belong. Cade Cunningham one time dealer.
"Actually if you knew how good LaMelo was *this year* in the NBA and he was still eligible to get drafted in 2021, is he a lock for first over Cade Cunningham? I‚Äôm not so sure."
&gt; I‚Äôd bet my life savings that all of the top 5 this year won‚Äôt be putting up 20/7/7  Do you know something about Cade Cunningham or is your life savings really small?
"How so? If I‚Äôm the Cavs this is a steal. I get rid of Love and get something for Drummond. Add proven vets who have been in the playoffs and made deep runs. They wouldn‚Äôt play a lot just be good to show Cavs young players how to go about being more consistent. Cavs get KP and only give up 2 picks which are top 5 protected so if he‚Äôs not the player he once was, we can still obtain Cade Cunningham or another top 5 prospect if we‚Äôre in the lottery. But if KP is great like before, I think the Cavs would have a unique team with a lot of talent and depth. The KP and Allen combo would be a nightmare on defense. And KP would get mismatches every other night at the 4 easy baskets so Cavs won‚Äôt have to depend on Sexton and or Garland to score 25 plus every night"
"You've been reading about Cade Cunningham, heh.   Yeah for the very general meaning I'd say it's kinda the same as Basketball IQ, you can use it. I guess technically feelings and intellect should be something opposite, but the terms are actually used for something quite similar."
I've heard good things about that Cade Cunningham...
"So you've been watching Sharife his whole career and when you saw him averaging 20/8 in the SEC as a freshman guard without having a jumper, you thought he should go back for another year of college? Despite being a near lock for the first round.   He's a better playmaker than anyone in the draft not named Cade Cunningham and got to the free throw line like 100 times in 12 games and got to the rim more than anyone else on his team did over the entire season. Again, as a 6 ft guard with no jumper or move off the dribble but a floater. I think you're really underrating him as a player and future pro."
There's a difference in being a well known high school basketball player and being Lonzo Ball in the 2016-17 season...  I'm not sure you actually believe what you're saying.. Cade Cunningham doesn't have 1/2 of the popularity Lonzo Ball had as a freshman at UCLA lol.
"Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, Evan Mobley.  Davion Mitchell, Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, Isaiah Jackson.  Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, Kai Jones."
a month after that Cade Cunningham will be a Toronto Raptor
"Preparing for Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs or Jonathan Kuminga??"
"lmao where did the lakers get the assets for AD. building through the draft, if not the final step, is definitely the first and a major step for any team to want to be great in the near future.  case in point: you look at how the pistons were stuck in the mediocrity for so long, with blake and drummond and reggie jackson and that team wasn't going anywhere, nor was it allowing detroit to be bad enough to get a number one pick to boost their team. this year, with a new gm, theyve done amazingly well, to sign a young Free agent in jerami grant, draft guys like hayes, stewart and bey (the former has bbeen a little injury prone, but shown his potential, and the latter 2 have been beasts) and now they're gonna have the slight opportunity to maybe even add cade cunningham to that core. just seeing how bad they were and where they might be soon is proof that getting young players, and hitting on draft picks is huge."
Cade cunningham please
"Kuminga was a #1 high school player a year ago. Cunningham is a blue chipper. They could bust, but hard to see those two failing. They‚Äôre both ballers. Kuminga has experience playing against grown men and Cade is a generational type prospect. Getting those two together with Shai would be beyond spooky"

Cade Cunningham   Also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Masai fleeced the Knicks for some Siakam-Randle trade
Idk make it like a play-out game or something. Winner gets Cade Cunningham
*proceed to win the lottery and draft Cade Cunningham*
"That‚Äôs a good way to look at it. And in that event you guys already have another young superstar with Edwards to build around. Not to mention that pick that will probably be Cade Cunningham. It‚Äôs been said before, but shit really looks to be turning up in Minnesota. The organization looks better today than it did when KAT came"
Rockets young core is really good.  Kevin Porter Jr-20 years  Kenyon Martin-20 Years  Christian Wood- 25 years.  Plus they could get Cade Cunningham and have alot picks like OKC.
or just if the Cavs get Cade Cunningham
He went to the Luka Doncic and Jaren Jackson Mavericks and then went back to Washington with the number 1 pick in 2032 and Cade Cunningham to win 3 more rings before retiring after 21 seasons. He averaged 1 PPG in 6 of those. Markelle Fultz also became an MVP for the Bucks after they traded Giannis for DPOY Day'ron Sharpe. It was an epic simulation.
Vogel wants to coach cade cunningham next year
"OKC is at #13 of what?  the ""fair"" thing here is probably to give the #1 pick to minnesota. i'm pretty certain that team is proof that the league isn't constructed to sustain 30 teams. i used to think the exact same thing of charlotte, and would frequently say ""low key, the league would be much better off if they just got rid of the twolves and the hornets and dispersed the talent.""  i still kinda think that's true, but then charlotte got a transcendent player and it reshaped their entire franchise. i feel like minnesota probably deserves its own lamelo at this point, and cade cunningham feels like he could easily be it.  detroit, orlando and sactown are deserving candidates, too. i'd argue for the bulls, but hoenestly we don't deserve it."
Nothing but vibes in the Cade Cunningham gang.
"So the pistons are worse than the thunder, cavs, and magic but aren‚Äôt Cade Cunningham gang?"
Bj and Davion way too high there bud    Cade Cunningham   Evan Mobley   Jalen Green  Jalen Suggs   Jonathan Kuminga   Moses Moody   Keon Johnson   Jaden Springer  Jalen Johnson    Franz Wagner
"Thanks for the win. Not being snarky.  This game was a win-win for both sides. We wanna make the playoffs, preferably top 6. And y'all want the Cade Cunningham sweepstakes, which for the sake of KrispyFlakes, I hope happens for you guys"
Jerami Grant for Cade Cunningham??? YES PLEASE

By God that would take forever in the NBA.  32 teams write down Cade Cunningham.  Although if you were only allowed one name to submit that'd be intense in drafts like this year.
"Is not gett8ng Cade the end of the world for OKC Thunder? There are a lot of talent in this draft. Kuminga, Green, Mobley to name a few that's not named Cade Cunningham."
"Lakers can‚Äôt pick top-5. Their pick is reverse-protected to the Pelicans. If it‚Äôs in the top 7, it goes to New Orleans. I can see it now, knocked out in the play-in tournament, pick shows up #1, and the Pelicans get Cade Cunningham because of the Lakers‚Äô ego."
Sam Presti wanting Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham and SGA are gonna rock the league together I really think so.
One of the perks of being a small market team? Tank as hard as you want ...ain‚Äôt no one paying attention. Now let‚Äôs go get Cade fucking Cunningham
"Oh no the best teams attract the best player. Great.  Who cares about parity when some franchises work a thousand times better than others? Does the Spurs deserve limitation and the Timberwolves privileges? No. If the best teams get the best player: great, they deserved it. If you want to have the best players, position yourself to get them. But Cade Cunningham doesn't deserve to get into Fertittas dumbsterfire of a franchise."
He would be #1 easily. Better prospect than Cade Cunningham so it's not even a question.
Yeah banking on Cade Cunningham is like the Knicks counting their Zion chicken 5 months before it hatched.
"Levert wouldnt fit their rebuilding timeline, turning 27 this year.  Plus a Cade Cunningham and Kevin Porter Jr backcourt has much more potential."
He‚Äôs a SG next to Cade Cunningham.
Imagine they get Cade Cunningham too
Cade Cunningham joining them next season
jacksonville has drafted cade cunningham with the first overall pick
"Well that's outrageous, what if we settle for Cade Cunningham?"
"Our guard rotation atm is Facu, PJ Dozier, Shaq Harrison and Austin Rivers bro.  That's-- a let's go get Cade Cunningham rotation."
"I love how the 6 step gather into a 3 step Euro never gets called but the bullshit ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt put the ball on the floor‚Äù gets called all the time.  Cade Cunningham takes a step before he dribbles a lot, hopefully the NBA will loosen up on this rule trying to market the new future."
"I'd say Ja. The Grizzlies are on the rise and he should have the counting stats to do so.  I think the other player to consider would be Cade Cunningham. If he gets drafted to like OKC and they have Cade, SGA, and another star then Cade could possibly be the #1 option on a top team in 6-7 years."
Cade Cunningham and Emoni Bates
"I looked up his client list. Middleton, Murray, McCollum, Jokic, Kemba, Ingram, Herro, Drummond and more. Sheeesh. He even reps the guy we‚Äôre tanking for, Cade Cunningham lmao"
And you're (probably) getting a top 3 pick too. Imagine adding Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley to the best team in the league. Easy chip next year
Especially if you can get Cade Cunningham
And maybe one Cade Cunningham perhaps?
"https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/basketball/nba/player-news/headlines/10105976  &gt;Lu Dort (The Al Horford Special, right hip, tank commander, Cade Cunningham) will not play on Monday vs. Philly.   &gt;Of course he won't. Dort has had a remarkable season and that's why the Thunder continue to hold him out of back-to-backs as they try to make up ground with fellow tankers Houston, Detroit, Minnesota and Orlando. This draft class is loaded with talent if you're wondering why tanking has gotten out of hand this season. Look for Svi Mykhailiuk, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams to soak up extra minutes. Dort will probably see time in three of OKC's five games this week."
"I'm not a Wolves fan personally, I just check up on whether or not they have been winning, but from a quick research, KAT is locked in for another 3 years with the Wolves. I mean he could always force a trade, but I legit think the Wolves will be half decent next year if they add a Cade Cunningham or one of the Jalens."
"2021 Mock Draft  1-Houston Rockets - Cade Cunningham  Adam Silver: And this is the end of the 2021 Draft, thanks for coming."
"You should be thanking him. Tyrese Halliburton and Deaaron Fox ain‚Äôt getting you no where. Embrace the tank, get that #1 pick and in Sacramento Kings fashion, pass up on Cade Cunningham"
Cade Cunningham*
"No it‚Äôs not. Those are just more terms that don‚Äôt actually describe the players impact. Randle literally changed his entire playstyle, attitude mindset, he went from a horoible shooter to an elite shooting big, he went from a ball hog to a legit primary playmaker. He‚Äôs taking a team that was projected to be in Cade Cunningham talks to a legit force in the East. He went from being the best player on the team to the actual leader of the team.   MPj was given more opportunities and a bigger role on his team and he stepped up to the occasion. Which is very impressive and deserves respect but is in no way on the Same level as what Julius Randles improvements."
One Cade Cunningham please
"I really do hope this becomes a viable option for high school players, but it definitely isn't good for brand or fame right now. I mix up whoever played for the Ignite this year, but I sure as hell know who Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs are."
Cade is the youngest player to be a one name guy. When I saw Cunningham I was like there‚Äôs another Cade?
"daily reminder he is the same age as cade cunningham and all the draft prospects this year  this doesnt mean he will be so good as them, but keep it in mind when thinking he is not dominating already as they do in ncaa"
Are there active subreddits for Cade Cunningham and Olympic basketball?
"And this news was posted on the college basketball subreddit too. Should the mods have removed all news about the Olympics, or Cade Cunningham, Luka Doncic, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, and Markelle Fultz prior to being drafted too?  I get where you're coming from but this sub has always contained small amounts of basketball news from outside the NBA when it's relevant"
Enter Cade Cunningham
pistons fans are actually excited. instead of chasing an 8th seed we're chasing Cade Cunningham and have at least 2 good rookies.
"If we get Cade Cunningham, I will legit Cry"
"I agree with you that this year Minnesota's  had some really shit luck that's no one can be blamed for but I think he was asking about the 6 years that Kats been in the league and if I remember there was some unforeseeable injuries and bad luck. But at some point you have to ask is it the players or the coaching or maybe the front office. Sometimes it is systemic and is all of the above and it's just a poorly run franchise.  If I'm a timberwolves fan I'm praying to the lottery god's to give them ping pong balls in the top three because this is a pretty good draft and I think there's a real chance of getting Cade Cunningham, Evan mobley, Jalen suggs, or Jalen Green. And I really do think that any one of those guys on that Timberwolves roster would be a pretty good team. And if it's not a top three pick it's going to Golden State"
Cade Cunningham
"no it would not. Teams like the Warriors, Knicks, Mavs would be fighting for Cade Cunningham without their Curry, Randle, Luka. Meanwhile, there are multiple contending teams that would probably be a low playoff at worst play-in team without their best player on the court. None of those 3 deserve MVP but they are definitely more valuable if you use the word more traditionally."
"Okay so there isn‚Äôt a scenario where a 10th seed wins their play in games, makes the playoffs but stays in the lottery and gets Cade Cunningham lol."
"the Knicks could get Cade Cunningham 100% for him in the summer. His contract is comparable to James Harden after leaving OKC, All NBA player on a MASSIVE discount. Julius is averaging a double double scoring 23 and STILL does 6 assists a night in addition to the defense."
So why exactly do y'all deserve Cade Cunningham?
"I wouldn't be too upset if I were a Wolves fan. I mean, they might get Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs after this season. Idk who they move to make the roster work but Cunningham/Suggs with Anthony Edwards, KAT, D'Lo and Beasley is a solid crop of talent and decent assets to assemble a squad.   If this don't work out though, yeah, I'd be fucking pissed."

"If they got rid of the draft lottery and had young players go straight into free agency, like soccer actually. This way the biggest market teams would just get all the best young players. No more Zion to NO. The Lakers will get Cade Cunningham, etc."
"The year is 20XX. De‚ÄôAaron Fox plays at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on the injury report. The Fox availability metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, the Sacramento Kings, and their army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning championships with the other. The basketball metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so other teams pray Fox is out for the night, and that‚Äôs the game.  The leaders of the anti-20XX movement aim to keep 20XX from coming. These warriors include Trae Young, Luka Doncic, LaMelo Ball, and Cade Cunningham. They are all fighting to keep the apocalypse at bay, the De‚ÄôFoxcalypse . But their efforts are futile. Their silly stepbacks, thirty foot jumpers, slick passes, and height are no match for Fox‚Äôs raw speed, the only viable advantage in the National Basketball Association‚Äôs version of basketball. Try as you will, but 20XX is coming. Or maybe, it‚Äôs already here."
&gt;  Try and get a cost-controlled PG that's actually a floor general.  Did someone say lottery win for the #1 pick? Welcome to NOLA Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham said Orlando is his city in an instagram live by the way
"I stand by my statement.  ‚ÄúAnd with the 60th pick in the NBA Draft, the Brooklyn Nets select... Cade Cunningham!!!‚Äù"
I‚Äôm not worried if the Wolves get the #1 pick because if they do they‚Äôll just fuck it up and the Rockets will get Cade Cunningham.
If you want Cade Cunningham
"Emoni Bates, Evan Mobley and Cade Cunningham."
What? That doesn't answer my question. Do you think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs right now? Do you think Alen Smailagic is better than Evan Mobley right now? Paul Reed better than Jalen Johnson? Kyle Guy over Davion Mitchell?
I mean this isn't even close to true. You think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham right now? Or Saben Lee is better than Jalen Suggs?
&gt;The 15 worst NBA players are better than the 15 best NCAA players right now  That's not true. Tremont waters is not better than cade cunningham right now for example
You are not cade cunningham
This will make up for when the Wolves get the #1 pick and will get Cade Cunningham and we can all act surprised.
"That's kind of what I was thinking. The narrative would be spectacular though, Cade Cunningham an Oklahoma legend from college to the pros"
Yeah like I said those 4 teams are all on the same tier. It‚Äôs splitting hairs and I decided to put the teams with championships higher.   I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a rockets fan. Don‚Äôt worry Cade Cunningham is coming to wash away our pain.
I hope it goes Russel Beasley Edwards Cade Cunningham? Then Towns
Better get Cade Cunningham first
Have you heard of Cade Cunningham?
Suddenly I‚Äôm a Cade Cunningham fan now.  Glad Khris is getting the recognition he‚Äôs earned.
"Whatever you say, bud.  You done crying yet? Cade Cunningham is the one who compared PG and Middleton. So take that up with him..."
"Having watched Cade Cunningham, Khris Middleton does not come to mind in terms of his game"
Is Cade Cunningham even that good?
"With this logic, the number one overall draft pick is valueless because Cade Cunningham has not scored a single point in the NBA."

"I'm glad that outside of the Suns-Nuggets series, all the series right now are competitive. It's important for the NBA, however, nothing is probably more important for the NBA than the Pistons winning the no. 1 pick for the NBA lottery and selecting Cade Cunningham."
Cade Cunningham
"This is basically the equivalent of Chris Paul signing with the Lakers next season, getting hurt running into Cade Cunningham, and then AD getting hurt, and then Lebron getting hur-wait shit that's a lot of parallels"
Why didnt the Kings draft Cade Cunningham with the first pick in the 2021 NBA draft?
"Not really the exact same thing. Passing accuracy and handles are not really the same as playmaking. A playmaker makes his teammates better in a lot of ways (from common sense plays like passing out of doubles to the open man or giving good instructions on defense to harder stuff like playing with the gravity of the other team's defense to generate open looks. Simmons is great at passing and handling the ball but he isn't Jokic, you don't see him as involved as those guys who are offensive (and sometimes defensive) engines. Just look at Cade Cunningham, not the most accurate passer or the best ball handler but touted as the next great playmaker because of how he manipulates defenses."
"  ‚ÄúThis was a MAS-TER-FUL move by Steve Kerr and his compatriots! They saw the writing on the wall. No Klay, No James (wiseman of course) AND if you lose you get a shot at the #1 OVERALL pick!? And the cherry of all cherries on this Sunday, you lose and get to see injured ‚ÄúKing James‚Äù lose in the first round to a Chris Paul led suns team! AND NOW YOU GET CADE CUNNINGHAM!? Talk about the STEAL of all STEALS! Kudos to Steve Kerr and Bob Myer and company ONCE AGAIN out smarting ‚Äúthe king‚Äù as he likes to call himself, LeBron James.‚Äù  -Skip if Warriors win Draft Lottery"
Spurs can just trade KP into their cap space if they want.  No need to send out salary back.  As for contracts then you're talking Kemba/Al Horford type deals.  Not sure if KP makes sense for Celtics since Tatum is a 4.  Maybe OKC takes a flyer if they get Cade Cunningham or one of the Jalens in the draft.
Thought it was Cade Cunningham
One Cade Cunningham will make it all worth it
Nets bout to draft Cade Cunningham
"One of the main reasons I think it was a solid trade is because Houston owes their pick to OKC this year, but it is top 4 protected.  Because Houston had the worst record in the league, they have a 52% chance of keeping their pick and a 14% chance of getting the #1 pick. If they got Simmons and Thybulle they probably wouldn't have fully committed to tanking, and would have had a lower chance of keeping the pick. For example, the 5th worst record has a 45% chance of getting a top 4 pick and the 6th worst record has a 37% chance of getting a top 4 pick.  If they end up getting the first pick and getting Cade Cunningham then the rebuild was already a massive success."
Until Cade Cunningham or the next guy that is
"I think you're spot on. After the Detroit Pistons draft 6'8 Cade Cunningham, and he goes on to 3 peat twice alongside 6'8 center Isaiah Stewart, the league will have no choice but to follow suit and go 5 out with 6'8 players"
"increases or stays the same. Players that are tall are learning to handle the ball at point guard levels now. Ben Simmons is an anomaly now but players are going to learn to dribble better and faster at earlier ages. Aleksej Pokusevski, Bol Bol, and Kristaps Porzingis are all 7 foot shooting guards. Cade Cunningham is a 6‚Äô8 point guard. Not saying that they are that good but there is a trend."
"This game may very well decide the Eastern Conference finals. So many questions surrounding it, none, arguably, more important than if Cade Cunningham will come home to the Detroit Pistons."

Maybe you guys will get Cade Cunningham xD"
"Tough to accept but want him to win a ring regardless, def need Cade Cunningham tho"
Cade Cunningham already had a kid!
Is Cade Cunningham gonna be better than Ben Simmons?
Cade Cunningham has a 2 years old daughter
Cade Cunningham has a 2 year old daughter already and he's just 19.
Cade Cunningham. No way that mfker is 19
Yeah swap cade cunningham (whoever that is) for Mitchell
"Zion is a significantly better scorer than Booker already. All other aspects of their game are about equal, he has more room to grow than Booker as well.  Zion is a better scorer than Tatum too but depending how much you value Tatum‚Äôs defensive impact vs Zion‚Äôs defensive and playmaking potential I could understand putting him above Zion.  Trae isn‚Äôt far behind Booker as a scorer but spaces the floor better and is a much much better playmaker and ball handler. His defense is getter better every season as well.   I‚Äôd put SGA over Mitchell and Sabonis as well, he has better defensive potential than Mitchell and Sabonis and puts up better efficiency numbers than Mitchell. Big guards are also easier to construct a roster around.   Then you have some unknowns like Chet Holmgren, Emoni Bates and Cade Cunningham. I can understand not listing them if they haven‚Äôt made the nba yet but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see one of them being a top ten player in 6 years."
"Development in the NBA is never linear and things can happy like D Roses injury or something else but anyway here is my prediction   Luka,Giannis,Tatum,Booker,Cade Cunningham,Emoni Bates,Lamelo,Zion,Trae and some kid in high school"
Cade Cunningham is vegan üò¨üò¨üò¨
Cade Cunningham
Man if this amazing game has taught me one thing it's that the Detroit Pistons deserve to draft Cade Cunningham
"So I can just anoint stuff as the greatest of all time based off of 10 or so games now? That's rational thinking now? Fuck it, I think Cade Cunningham is the GOAT. Better than Jordan, Kareem, all of them. People here are obsessed with thinking they are watching the greatest. The Nets offense is great and will be great, but if you legit think they are the GOAT offense right now, you are utterly delusional."
"Congrats, you just gave Steph &amp; Co. one shiny Cade Cunningham."
Cade Cunningham?
Cade Cunningham will not be the best player from this upcoming draft class.
"Cade Cunningham looks extremely good - it's an interesting question whether all those picks they have would be enough for them to trade up for him.   And not just saying that because he scores a lot of points in college or something, he fits the vision of the league's future - tall playmaker who can shoot and defend and create shots for himself."
Blow it up??? The Knicks were expected to be in the Cade Cunningham sweepstakes this season
LeBron whined all game. Dude is already planning starting a super team with SGA and Cade Cunningham in OKC
Lol focus on getting Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham could be anything. He could even be Ja Morant!
why Cade Cunningham
"KOC was asking wether or not they should tank instead of going for the playoffs. His argument was ‚Äúthink of Cade Cunningham with this group‚Äù. First it doesn‚Äôt move the needle if everyone stays. Second no way they keep Beal/Russ if they‚Äôre tanking. Good job making the playoffs, but there‚Äôs a ton of work to do."
"I mean that's about the only plan possible right now. Wouldn't be surprised to see wood traded.   I've actually seen a few random ""off season"" trade proposals saying wood for Wiseman. I think I'd be down if a pick was involved. Wood is a damn good offensive player, but probably not a true franchise cornerstone. We almost certainly won't be good next year, and I'm sure he's ready to play for a winner. Warriors offense would be unstoppable with him out there   KPJ is still not a sure thing either. He's shown flashes of greatness, but he doesn't really play defense or do anything off the ball. Still hopeful for him, and it was a weird season for the rockets. Literally nobody was playing defense so hard to fault him.  The real hope is we get cade Cunningham."
Cade Cunningham? Chet is definitely the biggest size/athletic freak since Zion though
The next super team being in Chicago when the Bulls win the lottery get Cade Cunningham and sign Demar Derozan and sign Rose
Would never happen but imagine if the rockets get Cade Cunningham in the draft then kawhi signs with us... what a pipe dream.

I'll take one Cade Cunningham please
Houston is less talented than OKC right now and their front office isn‚Äôt even on the same planet.  Their prior front office set these guys up for failure.  There is a small chance their best pick isn‚Äôt even theirs this year. If Wall can get and stay healthy then he can anchor a young core that needs to find another star (statistically speaking let‚Äôs say Cade Cunningham) to get Houston back on track.  Morey left that cupboard really bare and I think it will take several years of bad basketball to rebuild.    Agree that the wizards are kind of in limbo unless Deni or Rui get better quickly.
Me to. Him and Cade Cunningham would be a helluva duo in backcourt.
"Yep, the Cade Cunningham / Anthony Edwards Eastern Conference powerhouse Minnesota Timberwolf dynasty is shaping up quite well.   ...in my wildest dreams."

"Cade Cunningham is gonna be an All Time Great, You heard it here first 07/20/21"
Prefer Cade 'Can't wait to see you at draft night daddy' Cunningham
"Jalen Green is gonna be a star. Moreso if the Raptors got him. If Rockets got him tho, idk.   Josh Giddey will be the one picked at 10 or later who will take a run at that ROTY. He might be picked earlier tho, I won't be surprised if any team took him at top 5.   Cade Cunningham will be targeted by NBA's elite perimeter defenders. I think it will be like the Lonzo trajectory with awful early season but decent to great later on.   Mobley will get eaten inside."
"I‚Äôm Cade Cunningham, you got me"
"Reasoning:   1. Cunningham is the surefire guy of this draft. You could argue other guys have more upside, but nobody has a higher floor. Cade will be an NBA starter, it's just a question of whether he'd be a third option, second option, or first option on a contender.  2. Green is the type of hyperathletic scoring guard that teams crave. He's the most likely in this draft to become the first option on a contender, in my opinion. He fits well with the Rockets rebuild, forming a dynamic duo with KPJ in the backcourt.  3. Mobley is a fascinating prospect who brings great perimeter skills in a big man's body. His post offense is worrying, and his lack of a shot is too, but his perimeter defense and driving ability as a seven footer make him a unicorn, even if those other skills don't develop.  4. Suggs is the purest PG in the draft, a classic ball handler who projects to do everything right, even if he lacks any one exceptional gift. He's a sizable point guard with no holes in his game. A very safe pick with long term upside. This guy might be Toronto's starting point guard for the next fifteen years.  5. Barnes fits that Patrick Williams mold, and if Williams can go 4th off the Seminoles bench, Barnes can do it as their most important player. He's a big, high motor wing who can lock down guards and has shown potential at the other end. Even if he doesn't develop his shot, he'll be a valuable wing for years to come.  6. Kuminga has the body, he has the athleticism, but his basketball IQ is horrible. He showed flashes of ball handling, shot creation, passing, and mid-range shooting, but his only positive talent right now is getting to the rim from a midrange spot. He's the definition of a boom or bust project pick, but his boom is big enough that he's worth betting on by a rebuilding team, similar to Poku last year.  7. Wagner here is probably going to be controversial. In my defense, John Hollinger at The Athletic and Deanondraft both agree with me. He's a big wing who can guard 1-4 and projects to be very above average at it in the NBA, rebounds well, passes surprisingly well (&gt;2:1 AST:TO), slashes well, and shoots FTs at an elite level for a 19yo, let alone a 6'9 forward. He projects to be a Kelly Oubre type with less hops and finishing ability, but more shooting and passing. He'll be a valuable player from day 1 as a teenager at a premium position, and has all the tools to become an exceedingly solid wing, if probably not ever an all star due to his lack of elite quick twitch muscle. As a final point, if you want to bring up his last game (where he wasn't great), I'll remind you he also outplayed Scottie Barnes in their March Madness matchup.  8. Moody is the most likely guy in this draft to become a plus 3&amp;D wing for the next fifteen years. Lots of Warriors fans want him, but I simply don't see him having the upside of Wagner. He slides into the Orlando roster, providing needed spacing and defense.  9. Johnson has a lot of question marks, but when he has it all together, he puts up crazy numbers. He can do it all. His shot may be questionable but he shows promise. He's the second biggest boom or bust prospect after Kuminga, in my opinion, and Sacramento needs to swing for the fences to get out of their current purgatory.  10. Bouknight has been flying up mock drafts, and I think he's a good pick, but a little overrated at this point. He has some major flaws despite his highlight play athleticism. His ball handling, shooting, and defense all need more work than I think most people recognize.  11. Keon is similar to Bouknight: some very promising signs at the shooting guard position, but a whole bunch of question marks as well. Not too much to say here, just a guy drafted for his potential.  12. Sengun has promise - Hollinger would say I have him way too low - and I get it: he's putting up good numbers in a really good league as a teenager, and such guys rarely fail in the NBA. However, he's a tweener, neither a PF nor a C, and he lacks the shooting that would cover for his deficiencies at either position. He could put it together and be a valuable big man, but he might end up getting run off the floor, too.  13. Giddey is another boom or bust guy, a huge point guard who can pass like crazy, but lacks the shooting or defense requisite for the position. He's young as hell, so it all comes down to a team's deep scouting on him. Can they fix his obvious flaws? If he develops right, he could end up being an amazing player. But that seems to be a long way off. A team like the Pacers, in that 8th seed purgatory, needs to take a gamble to get out, similar to the Nuggets with MPJ.  14. Kispert projects to be the best shooter in this draft, and his defense is actually pretty good. Was in the 25th percentile for lateral movement at the combine, FYI - I definitely had some bias against his defensive skills, picturing him as a lumbering (white) player. But he has the size and strength and shooting skill to be an elite floor spacer, and can drive better than you might imagine. There are questions around his shooting stroke being effective against NBA defense, but in all likelihood he'll be a good-if-not-great 3&amp;D player right out of the gate.   No Davion Mitchell, you ask? Yeah. I'm incredibly low on him. His FT% has declined each season in college. His first two collegiate seasons he shot about 30% from deep, then happened to shoot 45% his last year, without a corresponding increase to 2pt% or FT% - that's the definition of an outlier. Yeah he plays good defense, but his 6'0 height limits him on that end. At best he'll be a smaller Marcus Smart, which is wonderful, but very limited. And I don't think he gets to that level."

Damn we can‚Äôt pick Cade Cunningham then
ESPN.     When the game tracker says LeBron turnover (bad pass) Cade Cunningham steals  followed by Cade Cunningham makes 31 3 point jumper to give the Pistons a 22 point lead i know its the right time to make a post declaring LeBron is no longer top 20

"ABOLISH THE DRAFT. This is the best way to balance the scales. Players and teams both get to choose their situation. There is zero justification for a draft IMO. And before you hit me with a ‚ÄúLA and New York will get all the players.  1) not every kid is gonna want to ride the bench on a championship contender just because they can. A lot of dudes will opt for situations where they can be the franchise cornerstone.   2) the market would give a more accurate representation of a player‚Äôs worth throughout the life of their career. If Brooklyn wants Cade Cunningham, they could theoretically sign him to the minimum, but it‚Äôs not certain that Cade wouldn‚Äôt pick a Detroit or an OKC that was offering him $15 million a year to bring their franchise into a new era. The draft already doesn‚Äôt benefit teams like it was designed, (see Sacramento, Orlando, Minnesota). We already bemoan the lack of parity under the draft system that‚Äôs always been in place but we somehow think it would get way worse if we didn‚Äôt have the sacred draft."
"You guys were literally ranked dead last in terms of defense. You need defense.   You couldn‚Äôt win twenty games. You need the best player available and at 2, that‚Äôs Mobley. He was arguably the best player in college ball last season and was an amazing scorer. To put it into context, let‚Äôs compare him to Cunningham. Cade put up 31 points per 100, Mobley wasn‚Äôt far behind with 28/per100 and was his team‚Äôs anchor defensively.   I know the potential of a Zach LaVine type player is tantalizing, but Green has serious holes in his game. I think in time he‚Äôll work them out and be great, but I don‚Äôt really ever see him being the generational talent Mobley or Cade can be. And losing out on someone who can be Kevin Garnett because you wanted Zach LaVine is the exact type of move that‚Äôll have you winning 43 games a year languishing in mediocrity.   And I‚Äôm not a fan of twin towers either, even if they‚Äôre both lights out shooters as that can be wonky on defense. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd move Wood for picks or young players without hesitation if I was Houston."
Cade becomes a government controlled building that may contain an alien species. Raid Cunningham
"Well it depends on your draft spot and this post is talking about Cade Cunningham. If you draft a player at #26 who says his goal is to be the next Taj Gibson that's cool, Taj Gibson was a great pick for that late in the first round. But if you're picking #1 you don't want Taj Gibson with that pick."

"Wait, people think the draft was rigged to get Cunningham to Detroit?!?!? Golden State has TWO lottery picks. Cade paired with LaMelo or Zion would be box office. Houston is a major market.

Cade raining threes. Cascade Cunningham
"Well that first could be anything, it could even be another Cade Cunningham!"
"idk, it's the East, anything is possible too with the play-in. 10th place this year was Charlotte with a 37 win pace. Last year it was also Charlotte who were on pace for 25 wins. So let's assume 10th place is on average a 30-31 win team in the East.  Detroit won at a 22 win rate last year (20-50), a core of Sadiq Bey, a full season of Jerami Grant and Cade Cunningham could win 30+ IMO. Then it would just take winning two games against a Chicago/Washington/Indiana level team."
"As someone already mentioned, that was never an offer. It was a combination of multiple first round picks and likely KPJ if Detroit wanted to revisit him. Not saying Detroit should take that offer, what you presented just wouldn't be the case.   Detroit passing on the SGA and the 6th pick for Cunningham would be absolutely mind numbing. Cade isn't a LeBron or Zion type prospect. You take the 22 year old who just averaged 24/6/5, plays good defense, and raises the play of those around him"

"&gt;But the selection at no. 2 will cause ripple effects throughout the draft. Will the Rockets‚Äô choice be Jalen Green, a 6-foot-5 scorer who played in the G League? Evan Mobley, a versatile big man out of USC? Jalen Suggs, a floor general from Gonzaga? Or will they trade down?  &gt;League sources say the Rockets prefer Green. Selecting him would make perfect sense: Not only is scoring a premium skill, he‚Äôs also flashed playmaking ability. Green is raw, but the Rockets have a young team that doesn‚Äôt need to worry about contending anytime soon. He‚Äôs a hard worker, and at just 19 years old, he‚Äôs only starting to tap into his full potential as an elite athlete with shot-creation skills. It would not be a shocker if he ends up as this draft‚Äôs best player.  &gt;Though Mobley and Suggs remain in consideration, teams are planning for scenarios in which Houston will pick Green.   https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/16/22579643/nba-draft-houston-rockets-cade-cunningham-jalen-green-evan-mobley"

No way Cade Cunningham will be top-5.
"Clearly, Dirk‚Äôs prime is clear stat wise and in today‚Äôs era he would be even more effective. The fact is that Dirk, even being as humble as he is, was compelled to say this.   Luka gets slandered for his 1st round exits and many use regular season stats/wins against him. I watched all of this turbulent Mavs season and the common problem is that almost half of the nights the team doesn‚Äôt show up to play. They have a ridiculous undefeated record in the regular season of winning a game when they lead in the first quarter. Luka often only unleashes his full effort in primetime games against star matchups. This Mavs team can beat the Jazz or Nets only to lose to the Kings or Rockets. That is because Luka‚Äôs energy is so varying. This is an offshoot of his ultimate looming problem of bad conditioning.   The playoffs are a different story. I‚Äôve seldom seen a player turn on a switch like Luka does. The Mavs theoretically should not match up well against the Clippers and their style of switching in their defensive scheme. The Mavs role players are one-dimensional, but they do their role so well. However, they were simply way out talented by the Clippers. Luka‚Äôs creation for himself and his teammates was all time great. All the players minus Porzingis and Brunson are meant to be catch and shoot players. Both of these players were disappointing this particular series. Porzingis‚Äôs biggest problem was not even offense, but his defense. I hope the Mavs FO adds talent quickly.   The thing that stood out to me most was how Luka played Pat Bev and Zubac off the court. This added with Ibaka being injured convinced me that the Clippers were in a deep hole. Pat Bev who looked unplayable hit daggers against Utah and locked up Devin Booker in the WCF. All I‚Äôm saying is that 90% of Mavs fans would agree that minus Luka, the Mavs would have been in contention for Cade Cunningham. Minus Kawhi, the Clippers won 2 straight against Utah and took the Suns to 6. Would have been 7 if not for an amazing play by Crowder/Ayton.   The part that hurts most is that after a loss to the Clippers in the bubble, the Mavs should‚Äôve been the team that got better in the offseason. They got worse minus Luka‚Ä¶..replaced a highly productive player in Seth with Josh Rich. Clippers who should‚Äôve had depth issues received great production from Batum and the rookie Mann. Mavs FRP Josh Green had no playing time. Brunson who was supposed to help was targeted on defense and locked up on offense. He got benched for Trey Burke. This team played their 3rd string center Boban for 30 minutes in a Game 7.   Luka is far from perfect and Prime Dirk is clearly better but to me hes already an all time great level floor raiser. One thing improved the most for Mavs in the short offseason. That is Luka‚Äôs midrange. How he added that in 3 months and started shooting like Dirk was crazy. I can‚Äôt wait for the future."
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
Okay fair enough. Let's say he gets traded to Detroit. Fast forward 2 years and Cade Cunningham is who we thought hed be.   Do you see the Pistons 2 years from now with a Sexton Cunningham backcourt as a playoff team?

"Lmao. Cade "" SloMo"" Cunningham"
"Smoke from who? No credible reporter has ever said they think Detroit will take anyone other than Cunningham. They can like Jalen Green as a prospect but like Cade better, which is what every report since the lottery has alluded to."
"I'm typically the guy on the anti-hype train, but Cade Cunningham sure looked like a legit NBA-level player to me."
"Yea bro we on the same page. All these dummies thinks Cade Cunningham is going to be a beast. Cunningham is extremely talented, but who knows how his motor is going to translate in the NBA. Jalen Green going to be a bonafide superstar, people underestimate the G league, but he was cookin grown men"
"Copying this from another comment I made a few weeks ago, I agree with all the criticisms this guy has including the passing like you mentioned. I do have my doubts he will be a star in the NBA.  &gt;**(4) Cade Cunningham 6‚Äô8 PF Oklahoma State**  &gt;It is going to be controversial to rank the¬†[consensus #1 this low, but there are serious question marks about Cade](https://deanondraft.com/2021/06/18/is-cade-cunningham-clearly-the-best-prospect-in-2021/). It is easy to see why he has so much hype, as he has excellent wing dimensions at 6‚Äô8‚Ä≥ with a 7‚Äô1‚Ä≥ wingspan and is a great shooter for any size as he made 40% 3P and 84.6% FT as freshman for Oklahoma State. He also has a point forward skill set with a 20.4% assist rate and showed competent switch-ability on defense, and it‚Äôs just not common to see a prospect with this intersection of strengths.   &gt;But before getting too excited with his strengths, Cade has some serious flags to address. First, his assist to turnover ratio was awful at 3.5 vs 4.0. From watching film, his passing just isn‚Äôt on the level of the other guys in this tier. He often makes bad decisions, throwing turnovers into traffic or feeding teammates in unfavorable positions that lead to them getting blocked or turning it over.  &gt;Further, his self creation was inefficient as he has a somewhat loose handle and was prone to getting stripped. And he was more of a bulldozer who tried to run over defenses instead of finding seams in the defense for easy buckets. Consequently, he shot a pedestrian 46.1% inside the arc and his team performed equal to slightly better with him off the floor.  &gt;He also has a suspect motor, as he is sometimes lackadaiscal on defense and has an anemic offensive rebounding rate for his size at 2.3%. This makes it questionable how good he will really be on defense.  &gt;If he improves his effort, decision making, and handling, then he has an excellent upside based on his strengths. But these are some nasty warts for a guy to be consensus #1 overall, as he currently has quite a bit of fat to be trimmed from his game"

Cade Cunningham
Relatively speaking. He‚Äôs the consensus first. The draft lottery will be the Cade Cunningham Sweepstakes in retrospect  But it‚Äôs not Tim Duncan or Kareem level where it was just one player and the rest of the order from there is a complete crapshoot
"That‚Äôs what you think.   However from the scouting reports I heard, no one showed up to Cade Cunningham‚Äôs birthday, but both Kuminga and Barnes birthdays were popping.   At this rate I could Cunningham go to 46-47 in this years draft."
We all now there's at least 3 players better than Cade Cunningham.  Cade will get picked at #4 in a best case scenario.
Thats a weird way of spelling Cade Cunningham
"It depends what you're looking for, but before anything else since you're in Europe if you want to watch any games live make sure it's an Eastern Conference team otherwise the scheduling will be extremely unkind.  I personally think the Pistons, Hornets or Hawks are the most fun Eastern teams for a new fan.  Pistons - their rookies performed really well this year, and they've got the consensus number 1 pick of the draft Cade Cunningham likely joining their team. They had a miserable year team-record wise, but are potentially only a couple of years away off being scary once their young players gain experience.  Hornets - They got rookie of the year LaMelo Ball, and without his injury would likely have made the playoffs this year. LaMelo is really fun to watch, and there could be a lot of off-season movement around him as they build a future contender.  Hawks - Young team with superstar-in-the-making Trae Young, who is not only extremely fun to watch but does cool shit like shushing crowds, shimmying, and talking friendly trash. His supporting cast have all shown heaps of potential, and are all like &lt;23. They made the conference finals this year, and it honestly looks like they can only get better every year."
Legit question because I‚Äôve never really watched the U19 team play: why do top players like Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green not play? Do top players usually play?
Markelle Fultz and Cade Cunningham
Seriously. He can be your best player on a god-awful team. Every Pistons fan hopes/expects Cade Cunningham will be better than him by the mid-point of his rookie year.
My deep rooted analysis and supreme Basketball intellect leads me to believe Cade Cunningham will be making his way to the motor city
No thanks lol. Edwards hasn‚Äôt even turned 20 and has a solid season under his belt already. The #1 pick in this year‚Äôs draft in Cade Cunningham is only younger than Ant by a month and Evan Mobley is even older than Ant.
"SGA is like 21 with a high ceiling. OKC isn‚Äôt trading him for Cade Cunningham, let alone Anthony Edwards."
I too would like cade cunningham
"On your team above, I would choose Cade Cunningham over Kevin Huerter for a wing (+he can handle the ball).  Also I would for sure have Donovan Mitchell on the team. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the bigs/Cs too much. Only need to carry like 3 at most so you can cut Allen."
"Man these guys are gonna be working out all summer with the best players in the world, and come back to Detroit to find Cade Cunningham waiting to ball with them. I‚Äôve never been so optimistic about a 20 win team!"
"Cade Cunningham would significantly improve the Cavs. Your pick next year won't be as good as this year's unless you win the lottery. Your pick two years from now will be even worse. And nobody is being condescending, you just made a dumb argument."
"By all means. Please explain what puts Brandon Ingram on the same tier as guys like brown, Bam, Donovan, shai when we are talking about young talent.  Dudes the second best player on a lottery team and Pelicans fans act like he‚Äôs untouchable in a Cade Cunningham trade."
"Pass. Houston won't be picking in the top end of the lottery next year, if at all. Not trying to give Cade Cunningham to Cleveland and then take their pick next year. They will improve."
Cade Cunningham would be wasted by the Pistons with no reliable vets on that team. I‚Äôm just hoping that at least he would have unlimited playing time. This franchise is not what it used to be anymore. They‚Äôve grown accustomed to a losing culture. Not sure what changed.
You mean Mason Plumlee and his sidekick Cade Cunningham
"Jaylen Brown and multiple picks for Cade Cunningham, who says no?"
So... Where do they sell Cade Cunningham cards?
"This rebuild feels different in Detroit. Jerami Grant had a breakout season, 2 NBA all rookie guys drafted last year plus Killian Hayes, and now Cade Cunningham. Crazy things happen but I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre not a playoff team within a couple seasons."
"Don‚Äôt know much about high school basketball but it seems like Montverde is the most stacked basketball school. Cade Cunningham played with Scottie Barnes, Moses Moody, DayRon Sharpe (all R1 picks) and Houstan who will be a R1 pick next year."

"&gt; There's more upvoted posts about Kuminga than Cade Cunningham, why is that?  Kuminga has played twice as many games as Cade over summer league and California classic tournaments.   You very accurately illustrated my point about Raptors feeling the need to hate on Kuminga because of non basketball reasons.   The shot at warriors bandwagon fans is petty af too."
"Nah. That ain't it. It's just that GSW fans are loaded to the tits with young bandwagon fans so there is a disproportionate number of posts about Jonathan Kuminga relative to what he's shown so far. There's more upvoted posts about Kuminga than Cade Cunningham, why is that?  Combine that with the fact that I actually watched him play last year, so I feel like I'm in a good position to talk some basketball with some real fans. Raptors fans are too high on Barnes and consider him the next coming of Giannis. It's also a lazy comparison.  Anyway, you can carry on getting baited for clicks by the beat writers in The Bay. As, I said, he'll be a good player and has a good head on his shoulders. But if you think his game has shown the capability to be a 2xDPOY, you're on several."
"Oh yes, the wheel was a really interesting idea, considering that it is 8 years old the ‚Äúinitial traction‚Äù unfortunately doesn‚Äôt seem to have gone any further than that  To clarify the second one: does this mean that for example Cade Cunningham could have chosen to take less money to stay in Oklahoma and play for the Thunder?"

"Rumor has it you can deal 3 2nd rounders for a first rounder, 3 1st rounders for a lottery pick, and then 3 lottery picks almost allows you to trade up for Cade Cunningham!"
"OKC wins that trade, full stop.  Of course the Clippers made the WCF. With players of Kawhi and PG's caliber, that should be the minimum expectation.  OKC acquired a young superstar-potential player, a 20 ppg 40% 3pt shooter, 5 unprotected 1st rounders, and another 2 1st rd swaps.  That's the kind of haul you expect to pay for one of the 11 superstars in the league, letalone PG.  Balmer even admitted that he looks at the package he gave OKC as the cost for both PG and Kawhi to come to LA, since Kawhi wasn't coming without PG.  The SGA trade rumors were also overblown. The only trade OKC was willing to entertain was Cade Cunningham, otherwise SGA was untouchable, and cemented that by giving him a max contract.  The *only* scenario where the PG trade is worth it for the Clippers is if they win a championship while he and Kawhi are there."

"Well, Simmons had less time, but I think their impact was quite similar, especially factoring in the money United paid for him.  Listen, I'm not saying Pogba is a bad player (neither is Simmons) but they aren't the difference makers they were made out to be. They could help a team win or push them over the top with their talent, but can't carry a team.   And whenever you pay that kind of money or select a guy 1st overall (especially with the hype that Ben had) you kinda expect him to be great. Look at Detroit and Cade Cunningham..."

"It would make more sense without the rookie salary limit. If the idea is to just let the salary cap do the job that the draft is doing, you have to let it do its job. Let rookies sign up to 25% of the salary cap like other players.  If you have Lebron, AD, and Westbrook, you don't get to offer a big contract to Cade Cunningham.  It could spread players out with just the contracts offered.   The problem then might be like in the late 90s/early00s, where rookies get paid too quickly and don't have the motivation to earn that big contract after four years."

"&gt;I like you call almost going pro in an entirely different sport  uhhh, no. MJ did not almost go pro. He was &lt; mediocre actually. And riding around the nation in a luxury tour bus/no pressures and all while playing against minor-league baseball talent, *is far from going pro*.  So yes, he was resting if you compare it to the pressures he'd just absorbed for 3 straight years of trying to win an NBA Finals series. I agree with Cade Cunningham, especially since Lebron never had to go rest for 1.5yrs then come back refreshed to continue his greatness."

"Nobody is ignoring the context. He said he wanted to live in Detroit because he wanted to be picked #1. He got rejected because he is inferior to Cade Cunningham. Now he's salty that he wasn't picked #1 and was embarrassed on national TV (in his head), so now he's shitting on Detroit. As I keep saying, he's fake. He was fake then, he's fake now.   He's an insecure teenager. It is what it is. Sometimes they grow out of it, sometimes they don't. I'm happy the Pistons chose the better player and the more mature person.

"This is a tricky question.  All the NBA players are very good at the basketball thing. A guy like Luke Garza was the player of the year in college and a late-second-round pick whose only pro potential is overseas. But, very few can be superstars in the way you described.  There's the added layer of there being a lot of ""stats guys"" on bad teams. Putting up points on the Cavs or Magic or Kings is a lot different than being a superstar. I don't even think SGA is a good example. You can't have a young player on a team that is taught that losing and franchise turnover is good and then expect them to be more than a stats guy.  So, I suppose I will go with four options:  Jamal Murray - Is very close. So close that ""Could Denver have made the Finals if Murray was healthy?"" is a fairly legit argument. Being the second-best player on a Finals team means the player in question is really, really good.  Michael Porter Jr. - Nowhere near as close as Murray and much more unlikely to reach star level. But, if ability/health/work ethic ever comes together? Watch out.  Jaylen Brown - Will he ever be the best team on a Finals contender? Not sure. I do think he can be the second-best player on a Finals teams. Before you scoff at that, the second-best player for the most-recent Finals teams were Olympians.  Cade Cunningham - Don't want to hear top draft picks? Welp, don't give a fuck. The guy has never played a second of NBA ball and I think he will be the best #1 pick since LeBron. Will be a perennial all-star and will win a title sooner than LeBron, Giannis, KD, etc. That is delusional and far-fetched for many. But, I think he's that damn good. And, like MJ during his title spree and Duncan during the Spurs stretch, he has the chance for a run of greatness where the more established stars are aging out and where younger players aren't as developed."

"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."

"I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre gonna be in the play-ins or anything, but I think 26+ wins is more likely than not. You gotta remember we rested Jerami Grant and almost all of our veterans for the last chunk of the year and still won 20 in a shortened season. The team adds Cade Cunningham, and a solid veteran in Kelly Olynk who can spread the floor, add in another year of development for Bey, Stew, Hayes, and Diallo and I think this team will win more than 25 games."
"They don‚Äôt know about us man, we had 20 wins last year in a 72 game season and we rested Jerami Grant and most of the veterans for the last chunk of the year. To be honest we were mostly very competitive in our losses too, if you look at the point differential we were a lot better than the other tanking teams. Then we add Cade Cunningham, and get another year of development out of Stew, Bey, Hayes, and Diallo and they expect us to only win like 25 games."
I've seen a lot of doubles in the summer league so far actually. Its kinda weird. The Thunder doubled Saddiq Bey and Cade Cunningham a lot
"If you give any other superstars klay and draymond in 2015 they don‚Äôt go 73-9. He won MVP, came back and averaged 6 more points a game on better efficiency.  That Cavs team was not terrible.

Not that different of the roster with no klay they end up 39-33 with some of the worst spacing in the league to begin the year. Would be in playoffs without new rule. If he didn‚Äôt play, they would have Cade Cunningham right now."

Cade Cunningham is gonna prove once again why Scouts shouldn‚Äôt draft for archetypes and dismiss their weaknesses:   -he will be a great roleplayer at best due to never becoming a great slasher or primary ball handler (both getting to the rim and his playmaking will pose to be problems - his abysmal AST/TO Ratio in college won‚Äôt improve much in the NBA)  -not getting to the rim much will hurt his freethrow rate aswell  -also his handle is below average for a primary ball handler which is why it might be hard for him to create quality shots

"Yeah, I also agree with that, Cade Cunningham is jack of all trades master of none. Green is just money, who although not as good as at other things as Cade has the potential for a lot like defending. It will be really interesting to see both of them develop and I don't know if we can ever really compare them due to their different styles. Not going to lie though, looking over at 2023 draft; Victor Wembanyama and Emoni Bates looking different level. üëÄ"
"Cade didn't foul out, but what I did mean is he did get taken out due to the fouls. That said Green and Cunningham didn't even really play most of the same times. Really my point was to some of the pistons fans that they can't keep saying Cunningham beat Green."
"Honestly I did think he fouled out, but I guess he just got taken out so he wouldn't get fouled out. It really doesn't change the point. Also again, I am not saying Cade did good; Cade Cunningham did good. But because I know Rockets fans are better then that. I am going to be worse then them and fuck with the Pistons fans for saying shit about Green."
"Can't believe Cam Thomas fell as far as he did. Sure he has his flaws, I'm not saying he'll be amazing (especially not right off the bat) but his college profile makes it real hard to believe he fell that much (from someone who does not follow college much).   The dude averaged 23 as a Freshman in the SEC for a 19-10 team. Legit 4th highest scorer in all of D1 basketball and 2nd out of any player in any major conference (only to Luka Garza). Only other freshman in the top 20 was Cade Cunningham (who just made the cut at #20). Those 3 names plus Scotty Pippen Jr from Vanderbilt (#16) are the only P5 conference players in the top 20 in scoring in the nation.   I know plenty of dudes can get buckets in college which dont translate to the NBA and I'm not saying he should have been a top 10 pick. But to put up the kind of numbers he did, playing the competition he was playing, contributing to winning the way he did, while only being a freshman, you'd think he'd be on more teams radars in the late lotto to the teens yet he lasted to 27.   Not complaining at all. He's in a place where he can take his time to develop without much pressure, learning from guys like Kyrie/Harden and a coach like Nash. Excited to see what he can do for us!"
"Green went all out trying to bust through the screen and beat Cunningham to the spot. It wasn't a great move by Cade, it was a risky move by Green that didn't pay off."

"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
I didn't think Cade Cunningham would show up on reddit tbh.
"&gt;Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF  I don't think you will see a ""lot"" of that.  Casey and the front office have stressed how important shooting is this year. For that reason, Frank Jackson &amp; Saddiq Bey will be playing a lot of SG/SF.  Also, if we re-sign Hamidou Diallo (which I expect), there is another guy who will be playing at the SF spot."
"&gt;my point is these teams should rebuild through the draft or continue to develop those players   They would be rebuilding through the draft in hopes of getting a player as talented as Simmons. Why do that when you can accordingly trade for him when he‚Äôs still young on a long term deal?   &gt;not trade for ben simmons and his giant contract.   You‚Äôre eventually going to have to pay players no matter what and all these guys I named are on starter level, high starter level contracts and some like Sexton, hunter, reddish may all see new deals nearing 20+ despite not being nearly as good as Simmons. Money isn‚Äôt a problem.    &gt;if the pistons traded cade cunningham for simmons it would probably make them better, would they ever do that tho?   Ok but we‚Äôre not talking about #1 pick Cade Cunningham, we‚Äôre talking about rotational guys like Fred VanVleet, Derrick white, Harrison Barnes, Collin Sexton etc."

"Tanking doesn't threaten the integrity of the sport because tanking teams *are* trying to win. They are just prioritizing winning playoff games in future seasons over winning regular season games in the current season. It's not a business move. It's an investment in future on-court success and not just for profit.   As a fan of a tanking team you watch the young players on your team. You want them to develop into guys that can help your team compete for a championship. In games you root for them to have a great game, have your team be competitive right up until the final buzzer. And lose. Losing increases your team's draft lottery odds.   I've been a fan of 2 tanking teams now. I started following the Sixers right before their infamous 10 win season because they signed a player from our town and it was **great**. It was sooooo much better supporting a franchise willing to sacrifice in the short term for a chance to achieve greatness. There was so much drama around the squad that year and games were fun to watch since I was invested in players.   I became very unhappy with my favorite team, the Pistons, because they were constantly engaging in short term thinking by continuing to attempt to fill some holes in the roster with free agents and prayers in order to just make the playoffs. With no chance of advancing further. Year after year they struggled to be mediocre. It was just so frustrating.   **Finally** the stars aligned and the Pistons got better management and our dumb owner finally figured out that his team wasn't going to get anywhere just by him demanding they win more. Injuries had forced the team to give up their hopes for making the playoffs and after the season the new GM didn't just try to plug in new guys to continue the cycle of mediocrity at best. The Pistons tanked last season and were rewarded with the #1 pick: Mr Cade Cunningham. Hopefully a future All-Star to anchor a Pistons team that can legitimately contend for a championship."
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."

Pistons. Cade Cunningham
"The simple answer is that teams will let players use retired numbers. For example Cade Cunningham will be using number 2, which is retired by the Pistons."
"Make fun of him.  Eventually - and in theory - yeah, we would. However, there are often instances of un-retired numbers (I think Cade Cunningham on the Pistons is an example of one).  If it got really bad, the NBA would probably just wipe the board and un-retire every number whilst doing something for those whose numbers were previously retired (like some special banner or a jersey patch on that number)."
"Place them on your average SWAC school  Is Cade Cunningham taking Alabama State to the national championship? No. You can eliminate everyone worse than him  That leaves you with about 50 players. You can take out about 35 of those guys, and the other 15 would make Alabama State a favorite"

Lol harden and bron aren‚Äôt point guards. D lo and Westbrook are 6‚Äô4 Cade Cunningham is 6‚Äô7... there‚Äôs no one else
"Tall pointguard.  Imo, the difference is based a lot on how much the ball handler has to turn his back to a defender.  For example,  I don't think Cade Cunningham will be able to bring the rock up and initiate the offense against good defenders without turning his back and limiting his vision forward. Doesn't impair his vision if he gets it in the mid or low post.  Lamelo on the other hand is better able to remain faced up and burn you for reaching.  With all due respect to his game, thered be no question about Luka being a tall pg if he were in great shape."
Same height as Cade Cunningham if true
"Cade Cunningham becomes the first player in NBA history to win the scoring title, ROTY, league MVP, and FMVP, in the same season after leading the Pistons to an 82-0 regular season record and sweeping the playoffs.    The Pistons set a new finals record for average margin of victory at 44 points per game over the Lakers. A humiliated LeBron James realizes the futility of continuing his career and announces his retirement during the post game 4 news conference. Still in awe of Cunningham's performance the media is largely disinterested.  Unsatisfied with his performance Cunningham vows to do better in his sophomore season and spends summer of 2022 hard at work shoring up his ""weaknesses."" In the 22-23 season he delivers on that promise and becomes the first player in NBA history to win the scoring title, DPOY MIP, league MVP, and FMVP in the same season after doubling his scoring average, repeatedly breaking Wilt Chamberlain's single game scoring record, and leading the Pistons to their second straight undefeated season. Behind Cade's increased defensive intensity the Pistons post the first 94 shut outs in league history.   LeBron James talks Bronny and Bryce out of persuing careers in basketball and together they found a religion with Cunningham as their deity. Cunningham is not affiliated with the faith.   In the 23-24 season Cade continues his dominance, again winning every game and virtually every award.   Little Caesar's Arena changes its name to Cade's House. In an unprecedented move every other team in the league follows suit renaming their arenas variations of Cade's Vacation House, or Cade's Home Away From Home. The owners unanimously decide such a tribute is insufficient and with the exception of the Pistons every team retires not only Cade's number 2, but every multiple of 2 as well.   In the summer of 2024 Cade expands his record setting to the Olympics, single handedly dominating the Paris games as every other American player watches in awe from the bench. After the medal ceremony the nation of France immediately gives up both the French language and the metric system, and changes their flag to a replica of Cade's jersey. The rest of the European union follows suit shortly afterward. Soccer falls into obscurity.   A jealous and starstruck Kim Jong Un threatens to launch his entire nuclear arsenal unless he's allowed to meet Cade Cunningham. Cunningham agrees and upon their meeting Kim converts to Cadeism which has become the world's fastest growing religion. Reverend LeBron James annoints Kim into the faith with drops of sweat squeezed from Cunningham's game worn socks. Cunningham who remains unaffiliated with the religion vows to stop leaving his socks laying around after games.   Kim attempts to abdicate his position as Supreme Leader to Cunningham who politely declines. Regardless the nations of North and South Korea after seven decades of hostility put aside their differences and become one united nation under the name the United Republic of Cade-rea.   There's more but honestly after this it gets a bit far fetched."
Cade Cunningham
"Just judging off of what i saw at OSU in college, Cade Cunningham. Looking back i don‚Äôt think people will think he was worth a #1 overall draft choice.   Not even sure if this counts for this thread since he hasnt played a minute of NBA basketball."
Why has no one said Cade Cunningham? Dude was pretty hyped in a stacked draft and definitive ‚Äúnumber one pick‚Äù and I don‚Äôt really see any aspect to his game that I am Wowed over.
"what? AI went #1 overall, so as a prospect he was...the #1 overall NBA draft pick. he was picked ahead of: Camby, Abdur-Rahim, Marbury, Ray Allen, Antoine Walker, Kobe, Peja Stojakovic, Steve Nash, Jermaine O'Neal, and a handful of other NBA players who had long and successful careers. Even in a bizarre Groundhog Day where they ran the same draft ten thousand times, AI would go ahead of Cade Cunningham ten thousand times."
"I think y'all are conflating AI with who he was as a prospect. He was an undersized scoring guard and his shooting isn't particularly inspiring by today's standards.   Zion doesn't have the range, but he's comparable or way better at everything else. I'd rather go with his size and power than AI's range. Health concerns at this point would've been silly as Zion came back and played well.  Ja is bigger and a better passer with comparable athleticism.   Green is meaningfully worse as a primary creator, but he's also waaay bigger,  superior shooter, and younger;  when you adjust for size/position, his athleticism is comparable, if not better.  Cunningham is a tougher call since he lacks the athletic upside of any of these guys and some scouts weren't convinced his shooting is real, which is the scoring upside. If you trust the shooting is as good as say Tatum's though, you could make a solid case for Cade too, given the size, passing, and hustle he's shown."
"Well, that‚Äôs still better than that 5‚Äô1 midget Cade Cunningham."
True that's why I think that Georgios Kalaitzakis has equal chance of being an all star as cade cunningham

"Cade Cunningham will be better than Michael Jordan  Luka Doncic will be better than Cade Cunningham  Anthony Davis fakes injuries during bad games so that he can get high in the locker room   Blake Griffin is a serial killer  Kawhi didn't choke against the Nuggets, his knees couldn't handle the strain and he'll never get passed the 2nd round without copious amounts of rest during the playoffs   From watching Harlem Globetrotter games in the 70s, I can tell that NBA players back then were certainly capable of being great ball handlers by today's standards, and not untalented white dudes who couldn't dribble like people on here say. Frankly, the strict rules did not allow them to do things with the ball that players are allowed to do now.   Steph Curry's foot fetish is breaking his family apart  Fox is a future superstar because he's an insanely efficient finisher for a point guard; he's just too good at the rim  When Zion plays in the 2024 Olympics, it's over. His game is absolutely made for Olympic ball. He brings the finishing and physicality that no one on Team USA had."

"Cade Cunningham isn't getting the recognition he deserves as the GOAT. People get really hung up on the whole ""he hasn't played a game yet"" thing. Ridiculous."
Has me more nervous than ever to see Cade Cunningham
 Cade Cunningham hasn't played an NBA game yet
Tbh i think most of it can be acreddited to turnovers and nerves. Our team has been attrocious with keeping the ball in their hands this season but other than that they really seem to play well together.   Btw: massive cade cunningham fan and I have a gut feeling his first game is going to be against us
&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if the best player in the draft class ends up being someone not even on anyone's radar right now  Someone like Cade Cunningham?
Wait why does Cade Cunningham look so French?
Cade is barely 5 feet tall at this point  Cade Cunningham 4‚Äô11‚Äù
"&gt;Cade Cunningham - 6‚Äô6‚Äù  Lmao it seems like Cade keeps getting shorter every time he‚Äôs mentioned  To answer the question, Cade and Giddey are much closer to Luka on paper than Scottie, in terms of play style.   Scottie‚Äôs biggest selling point coming into the draft was his defence, with the intriguing possibility of developing on the offensive side of the game.   Conversely, one of Luka‚Äôs biggest detractions coming into the league was his defensive ability."
Cade Cunningham
"Why?   Pistons have great defenders. They give Zach and Vooch trouble with their length and athleticism. Good thing DeMar got going. Then bulls bench choked them with their energy and hustle plays.   And that‚Äôs a Pistons team without Cade Cunningham. If Pistons can add another scorer(which they‚Äôll likely address later in the season), they‚Äôre a hard team to beat. Bulls were lucky to face them this early in the season."
Cade Cunningham
"That may be but man‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve not really ever been a fan of KP and he just looks like the worst version of himself right now: shooting from all over the court instead of using his length, poor defense, not fast enough to rely on getting down court in transition. I honestly think the Pistons minus Cade Cunningham are a flat out better team than the Mavericks minus Luka Doncic."
"Yeah, Luka was my first thought. I seriously think a case can be made that the Detroit Pistons roster 2-15 (so minus Cade Cunningham) plus Dwayne Casey is a better team than the Mavs sans Doncic with Jason Kidd."
Damn looks like I messed up dropping the currently injured Cade Cunningham for Maxey then. I want starters on my fantasy team!
"&gt; We aren‚Äôt gonna be good but we kept it close with what should be a solid Bulls team in a game where Lavine popped off.  Seeing the Pistons play tonight is an eye opener for me. And this is without Cade Cunningham. Saddiq Bey is a contributor already. And I would say a future all-star. He's not some rookie anymore.   Saddiq Bey and Jerami Grant are going to carry the team. And we haven't seen Cade play with them yet. Pistons are a shooting guard away from being a playoff contender IMO. I can only think of Eric Gordon being most likely available. But of course, Pistons can do better.   I am not sleeping on this team."
"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant. We will be exciting at times, but mostly sucktastic, until we get more players to space the floor."
"2011-2012 lineup: Brandon Knight, Rodney Stuckey, Tayshaun Prince, Jason Maxiell, Greg Monroe  2021-2022 lineup: Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart  One backcourt of the future vs. another backcourt of the future. All I know is I have a good feeling about Brandon Knight moving forward."

"|***MVP***|KD| |:-|:-| |***DPOY***|AD| |***ROY***|Cade Cunningham| |***6MOY***|IQ| |***MIP***|Terance Mann| |***COY***|Finch from the TWolves|  RATIONALE: KD will play like he actually cares in the regular season and if he does I think he walks away with MVP EZ, especially if Kyrie misses a lot of time.  AD is the centerpiece of what I think will be the Association's best defense.   Cade will post the best counting stats among rookies. He won't be as efficient as Davion Mitchell but he'll still get ROY.  IQ is in a great situation and I think Rose and Ingles will miss time while Clarkson will be way too inefficient to win it again. I also don't have the Jazz as a top 4 seed.  Mann should get a lot of usage and I think get like 19 ppg.  Timberwolves gonna have home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs out west. Finch ain't the reason but he'll get some credit for it."
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"

"It‚Äôs Cade Cunningham. And idk, this draft was widely talked about as potentially the best in years."
"I find it so funny that GMs really think Jalen Green is going to win rookie of the year over Cade Cunningham. Cade can defend your best player, he will shoot from the perimeter, he will get all in yo' mug. He is the most complete rookie in the game today - bar none."
"For anyone else wondering, Cade Cunningham turned an ankle in practice two weeks ago and missed all of preseason. From what I just read, he hasn‚Äôt returned to full speed practice yet, and I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs doubtful to be ready on opening day."

"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Cade Cunningham is his kryptonite.
Cade Cunningham. So just a cut below
"I think people overlook the fact that Poku is younger than Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and Scottie Barnes."
"Top 5 Now Steph Curry, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Trae Young.  In 5 Years that‚Äôs tough, but I say. Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Cade Cunningham."
Cade Cunningham hasn't played in the preseason yet and there isn't a clear timetable for his return. Could be fine to go for the opener or could be out for weeks. We don't really know.
"Cade Cunningham. 0 points, 0 assists, 0 rebounds so far. Trade him already"
He was a PF in high school (as Cade Cunningham was the teams PG!) so he came up learning the game from down in the post.  I'm hopeful he can become a decent shooter. He's got nice touch and is only a consistent shot away from unlocking his limitless potential.
Killian Hayes or Cade Cunningham. an accomplice might be Isaiah Stewart.
"the 2019/20 Montverde Academy team with Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes, Dayron Sharpe, Moses Moody, Caleb Houstan (projected 2022 lottery pick) surely stand a chance"

"Coz when it comes to Westbrook and building a team around him, he has to be the first option. Considering the amount of money that I give him, he will not settle for less because he def thinks he's worth a max contract. I'm not having any of it. I'd rather tank, miss the playoffs and develop Cade Cunningham/Paolo Banchero (if Im a GM) than overpay Westbrook and make the playoffs."
"You're totally right, the bad boys era is fire but it's time leave that in the past. That's why I haven't bought a Cade Cunningham jersey because I feel like at this point a rebrand is inevitable."
"This kind of reminds me when I was trying to voice search on YouTube for Cade Cunningham and it kept giving me ""cake cutting ham."""
Imagine he turns Cade Cunningham into Cade Beefingham  I‚Äôll leave
"I don't think Ayton should be that high, there was already a strong contingent of people who thought Luka should go 1st in 2018, and there were concerns about his motor in college.  In 2014 many people thought Embiid was the most talented prospect in the draft, and only slipped due to injuries. If Wiggins and Parker are on this list I feel like he should be around them somewhere.  Cade Cunningham is too high, there are already some people who believe Jalen Green or Evan Mobley have a higher ceiling (look at the GM survey) so he already has a fair amount of doubters entering his rookie year.  It's been a while but I think Kyrie Irving should be a bit higher. He was the consensus #1 pick all year."
"he's about a foot taller than Cade Cunningham, so that makes about 6'6"""
"cade cunningham will lead the pistons to the finals  sounds crazy now, might not be in a year"
"I don't mind the top half of the list. But I have a few problem with the logic they used for some of the guys down lower. For example, they used TJ Warren and Jusuf Nurkics injuries as a reason to place them at 99 and 93 respectively, but Spencer Dinwiddie, who too missed all of last season is at 68. Additionally, the inclusion of Cade Cunningham and not other top rookies is Wierd to me."
&gt; 74 - Cade Cunningham  I'm asking that someone play *a* game before they get put in these lists. Is anyone gonna be mad that someone who has not played an actual NBA game doesn't appear on a top 100 list?
"Whoever were dumb enough to put their faith in Cade ""Better than Luka Doncic"" Cunningham deserves to be poor"
"I don't usually like to be too hard on player ranking lists, but Cade Cunningham at 74? He hasn't played a game"

K but Scottie &gt; Cade Cunningham.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
How do you rate someone like Cade Cunningham in the top 100 when he hasn't even played a single minute in an NBA regular season game?
Cade Cunningham: 6'8 --&gt; 5'4
1. Zion  2. Anthony Edwards  3. Cade Cunningham  4. Ja Morant  5. Jalen Green  6. LaMelo Ball
1. Zion   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Green (A lot of teams would of taken him #1 instead of Cade)   4. Ja Morant  ( Wasn't a great prospect was clearly ahead of Barrett though. It was a perceived weak draft class at the time which might have been correct.)   5. Anthony Edwards (At the time he wasn't unanimous)   6. Lamelo Ball (Dropped because of Lamar and Lonzo Ball nothing would of changed)
"PG: Cade Cunningham $2  SG: Donovan Mitchell $4  SF: Caris LeVert $2  PF: OG Anunoby $2  C: Joel Embiid $5  --------------------  You have to give up value somewhere, so I think taking Cade for $2 is a worthwhile bet.   Embiid is an obvious choice IMO.   Anunoby for $2 seems like an absolute steal.   Then having to decide between either getting another $5 player and a $1, or taking a $4 and a $2, and IMO I'd rather take a guy like Mitchell and the step up in talent from $1 to $2, than have a $5 talent and have to somehow shoehorn someone like Danny Green into the lineup."
$2 Cade Cunningham 20-25  $4 Donovan Mitchell 25-30  $2 OG Anunoby 24-29  $3 Jerami Grant 27-32  $4 Bam Adebayo 24-29  I went for youth and versatility.  this list was tough.

"Detroit seems very unlikely to be a trade partner as well. We aren't moving Cade Cunningham and do we really wanna give up Grant, Hayes, and Josh Jackson for a max salary nonshooter?"
"Imagine Simmons with Cade Cunningham, Jemari Grant, and Saddiq Bey."
"As soon as the 1st preseason game begins, we will see the antivaxx/Simmons posts being replaced by overreaction, and I'm looking forward to see the ""Is Cade Cunningham a bust? 12/4/4 stat line, total bust"""
"they chose suggs specifically because he just got drafted by the magic  it would be weird if they chose cade cunningham because then the  whole ""rookie who got drafted by the magic  says it's part of god's plan"" thing doesn't work"
"I can see Mobley but Mitchell and Kuminga are going to be decided based off of how badly the rest of their team is in order to soak up minutes and get extra experience from the get go.  I agree with Cade and Green winning this thing. It's too easy. They are both on each conferences' respective bottom dweller teams. They are too talented to not be playing 32 minutes a game, either.  My bets are first team: Cunningham, Green, Mobley, Suggs, Giddey.  Second: Barnes, Sengun, Mitchell, Kispert, Duarte."
"Cade Cunningham seems the most plug and play... All of the guys on this list are stars don't get me wrong, I just feel like Cade could fit anywhere."
"Ngl idk who this reporter is but there can only be one Cunningham in the league and that‚Äôs Cade, this guy gotta go by Craftypork from now on, it‚Äôs too confusing"
Anyone else confused for a second about why Cade Cunningham would be talking about being in Sacramento?
They‚Äôre all feeding off of Cade Cunningham and stealing his height and weight

"Pretty sure we're already seeing it with the hype and attention around ""big guards."" Most recently being Cade Cunningham and before him, Lamelo. The NBA is getting bigger and taller and the taller you are with ""little man"" skills, the more valuable you'll be.   Shorter players will have an even harder time getting into the league unless they're absolutely dominant somehow. If starting PG's are becoming 6'6+, it'll be hard to put a 6'1 PG out there that isn't incredible.  I imagine that once position less basketball becomes more dominant since everyone's height becomes a null factor since everyone is so tall that everything is switchable, we'll see a trend backwards into the importance of post play. Obviously post play is still important right now but you can argue that it's at it's weakest since everyone is trying to extend the court via three point shooting. People are going to stretch out so far (and actually be able to guard further due to increase in length) that having a dominant post presence is going to be super important.   I can be incredibly wrong but that's just how I would imagine it with the current importance and emphasis on extending the court and increasing range. There's only so far that players can shoot from, there's eventually going to be a point where it's more efficient to use the space in the middle (most obvious example might be Giannis and the Bucks right now)"
I feel like red flag is a bit harsh. I am not trying to trash Oklahoma State but I feel like Cade Cunningham basically did that this year and came out fine. I know Oklahoma State has a decent basketball history but does not seem like his supporting cast was much better than Simmons at LSU for last season.
"Honestly i dont even get the question lmao like it would be interesting if we knew how the careers turned out and which established star is the worst guy who you would still take over the Cade Cunningham, Chet Holmgren, Paolo Banchero etc but idk wtf is this"

"I just feel like Cade's court vision is better than Scottie's right now. Maybe I'm wrong on that. I haven't seen a ton of Pistons games, obviously (even I, a fan of this craptacular Spurs team, have limits to how much terrible basketball I can watch)...but what I did see, I'd put Cade and Giddey at the top of this class as passers, with Scottie a step below right now.   I'm not down on him as a passer, I just think Giddey and Cunningham are going to be triple double guys."
"Cade was pretty good last week at the same time that Giddey struggled to score. The rookie ladder is like done on a weekly basis.   This week, Giddey is ballin while Cunningham is struggling. They'll probably switch position on the rookie ladder"

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1.

"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%).

Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Still crackin me up man, how are you this ignorant to the concept of branding  What do you want them to say on the billboards, ""We got two great players this off-season and hope we are good but wouldn't dare try to establish an identity!"" probably wouldn't fit fyi  Really enjoying the Pistons campaign this year of ""We will be unwatchable shit but Cade Cunningham has potential"" by the way"
Killian Hayes is easily number two behind Cade Cunningham and no one can disagree
"Just a few days ago there was a whole thread of people gushing about Cade Cunningham for a 3 game streak, saying he‚Äôs clearly the best player of his class (over Mobley). In his last 4 games (two of those included in the aforementioned 3 game streak), hes averaging 13.5 on 32.8% fg and 19% 3pt. This sub is damn stupid man"
"Here‚Äôs a count of people who have been called potential  all stars in this thread: Duarte, Cole Anthony, Tyler Herro, Malik Bridges, Halliburton, Eric Paschall, Saddiq Bey, Cade Cunningham, Mattisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane."
Ziaire Williams  Floor - the better of Cade Cunningham/jalen green at their peak  Ceiling - if a KD with integrity and a Giannis with a jumper had a kid that turned out to be the second coming of Christ
Cade Cunningham seems like a solid wing starter do it all role player in the future. I don't think he has the sauce to be a high level scorer but maybe like an Odom type on a good team.
"Different question but in your opinion, say Lamelo Ball and Cade Cunningham (also big high IQ card with excellent instincts/touch/feel) fill out their potential   What will separate Luka from those two?"

"&gt; unless the Pistons unexpectedly decided to throw Cade Cunningham, this year's No. 1 overall pick, into the mix. Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  Lol, Morey is fucking delusional at this point."
Morey must think he trading Joel Embiid. There is no way he actually believes that Ben is worth as much as Cade Cunningham AND Jerami Grant
"Ben Simmons is a bigger villain in this. But holy fuck Morey just continues to whittle down his respect. Is this guy the most arrogant prick? I know it only takes one dumb owner/GM - but is anyone falling for this bullshit? Does he think he can speak it into existence? Jerami Grant + #1 pick Cade Cunningham for Ben Simmons would still be ""a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to""? Give me a fucking break."
"From what I know definitely not, for a few reasons:  - Pistons organization views Jerami Grant as a centrepiece - rejected three first round picks last deadline  - Pistons also view Saddiq Bey as a centrepiece, calling him part of the ‚ÄúCore 4‚Äù  - Pistons can‚Äôt trade any firsts as its currently owed to OKC  - Theyre trying to tank this year, and they‚Äôre angling to free up cap space for 2023/2024 off-seasons  - Organization keeps speaking about ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù and how talent doesn‚Äôt matter if their character isn‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for   - Theyre building around Cade Cunningham as the franchise star   But I‚Äôll say, Weaver hasn‚Äôt been afraid to make moves (traded literally everyone on the roster, Killian‚Äôs the longest tenured Piston) and he loves taking chances on highly drafted players that need fresh starts (Okafor, Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, Dennis Smith Jr, rumors of Bagley).   He also makes calls to every team about everything so even if this ‚Äúinterest‚Äù was true he was prolly doing due diligence."
They are so delusional LMAO. In a few months they will be happy if they even get a Cade Cunningham signed jersey as exchange for Simmons
"&gt;  Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  It's quite straight forward. Cade Cunningham is a maybe. On this like, Ja Morant would require a lottery protected 1st. Fox, probably an unprotected 1st.  Again, I can reason with not trading him for a bs package. But Cade for Simmons is a straight up yes, not a ""uhn, let me think here for a bit""."
"The recent report out of Philly was a pretty good indicator of why nothing's going to happen until they lower their standards.  &gt;[Amick] A source with knowledge of the list said there are approx 30 players who would satisfy the 76ers in a Simmons swap, &amp; there‚Äôs an internal belief that a fair amount of them ‚Äîlet‚Äôs say 5 to 10‚Äî could become available in the next year or 2. ‚ÄúThis is like a multi-year thing‚Äù a Sixers source said  That was released in a ""see we're not being unrealistic and actually have a very open mind"" sort of way.   When you actually think about what that means, it's a 30 team league so Philadelphia is essentially asking for the best or second-best player from a decent team, with bad teams not even having a player who qualifies.     WEST | EAST ---|--- Steph + Klay (GSW)|Harden + Durant (BRK) Paul + Booker (PHO)|Beal (WAS) Mitchell (UTA)|LaVine (CHI)  Luka (DAL)|Butler (MIA) Murray (DEN)|LaMelo (CHO) Kawhi + George (LAC)|Garland (CLE) Ja (MEM)|Tatum + Brown (BOS) Dame (POR)|Siakam (TOR) LeBron (LA)|Giannis + Middleton + Jrue (MIL) SGA (OKC)|Trae (ATL) Edwards (MIN)| Fox (SAC)|    That's 30 names already and there are a lot of really good names still not on that list.  We're not counting centers (Jokic, Towns, Davis, Bam) because of their fit next to Embiid.   We're not counting rookies because apparently the timeline of rookies like Cade Cunningham ""would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.""  We're also not counting dozens of high-end secondary pieces like Tyrese Haliburton and Jerami Grant, who originally were names people assumed would be included.  There isn't a single realistic name on that list."
"Wait, getting Cade Cunningham for Ben Simmons would be tough for‚Ä¶ PHILLY to say yes to???  What fucking planet am I on"
"I guess maybe, you could want to take some pressure off of Cunningham on the offensive end. It lets Cade be more of a facilitator and they can play Sexton at the 1 with Cade being the point guard"
"Seriously. Simmons for Grant isn‚Äôt exactly a good return for the Sixers. Of course there will likely be some picks and/or other players involved, but Morey is literally insane if he thinks Ben Simmons for Cade Cunningham is in any way a reasonable trade request."
"Do Philly fans struggle with reading comprehension?  &gt; unless the Pistons unexpectedly decided to throw Cade Cunningham, this year's No. 1 overall pick, into the mix. Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  It's the fact even if DET threw in Cade, Morey would consider it. It's fucking delusion at this point."

"JP/Steph conundrum, too many cooks in the kitchen when they both play, not enough touches for Steph, JP and Dray, which makes it harder for both Steph and JP to get in rhythm, since Dray tends to direct the offense, and will priotizie getting Steph going (unless Kerr gamelans to get JP going early), no Steph means lots of touches/the ball in JP‚Äôs hands a lot more allowing him too get into rhythm (he also seems somewhat intimidated starting with Steph and Dray)  Chiozza‚Äôs a BUM, literal human victory cigar, shouldn‚Äôt get meaningful minutes ever  Cade looks like he‚Äôs mostly struggling with speed of the game atm, especially when shooting (also strength issues with the shot), the windows close a lot faster at the NBA level, but everything else is as advertised, great passer, high BBIQ, solid handle, runs PnR well, better than advertised D,   DET did not demonstrate high BBIQ outside of Cade in the 1st half, they miss a lot of open looks in favor of passing around the perimeter, got better in the 2nd half  Not a fan of the Hayes/Cunningham backcourt, split their minutes as much as possible to maximize they‚Äôre potential growth (although I‚Äôm not a big of Hayes)  Small sample size but the G-League seems to prepare guys better NBA game speed than college ball,   Frank Jackson, another random bench player having a career game against the Warriors, at this point all you can do is laugh  End of the game was a ref fuckfest (DET shot 15 free throws in the 4th), mixed with awful crunchtime execution by both teams"
Cade Cunningham looks so much like Eric Andre
Pistons have been decent with Cade Cunningham playing.
warriors came to play in the 4th tonight but they arent ready for 4q cade cunningham tomorrow
"But the Suns are tanking this year after starting 1-3, oh yeah, and Cade Cunningham is a bust.  That is what this sub was telling me"
"His game really opens up with his shot.   Cade isn‚Äôt a super explosive first step guy that can beat people off the dribble, but he does have a great shot/IQ.   By hitting his 3‚Äôs he forces defence to play him tighter, which then allows him to utilize his handles/size better to get around guys. I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble assessing Cunningham as a player, but I think his ceiling is going to be largely dependent on how good his 3 point shooting is. However I could see Cade be a high volume 3 point shooter hitting 40-ish percent. Either way, this kid definitely has shown flashes of what he can be longer term already."

Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun

A W for the team's record is more important than gaudy numbers and an L.  2. I think he's saying that 3/5 starters are so young that they could still be playing in college. The whole ""pouring concrete"" quote is probably a comment about creating a foundation for the future, using young players making it more....rewarding? 3. No translation necessary."

I mean I like Green. But Cunningham and Suggs ain‚Äôt it. Cade will never be a star due to his unathletic nature. Suggs it‚Äôs too early to say I could see him turning it around. Cunningham just doesn‚Äôt have the game of an NBA star
Way too many missed free throws. Overall bad team defense and Coach Casey working his voodoo on his former team. Good to see Pascal play well and Cade Cunningham is pretty clutch.
"I can see the trailer now  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the high school quarter back‚Äù  Coach: only you can make this throw, Cade!  ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs about to learn, if he wants to really feel the heat,   High school announcer: ‚Äúmy god another touchdown for cade Cunningham!‚Äù   ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to have to get back in the kitchen.‚Äù  Cade: No way.

These threads are so dumb. ‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs list young all nba guys and then Cade Cunningham‚Äù. Meanwhile in reality the real list will be full of sleepers nobody could have predicted. And old guys getting in on rep/fan votes.
Cade Cunningham is essentially a Ben Simmons who can shoot so I‚Äôd just draft him
Cade Cunningham. I think he will stuff the stat sheet while being a winning team player that elevates his teammates. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really all that close.
"It was our best rookie class since probably 2002, when we drafted only Tayshaun. That's not saying much though. I still think it was good. 2 all-rookie team starters, 1 starter potential, 1 rotation potential. I feel like drafting Cade Cunningham will make them all better as well."
"I‚Äôm from the future, Cade Cunningham jr. averages 50/20/30 and is a bench player for the Scranton Jelly Beans."

"I‚Äôve accepted the fact that as time moves on and Jordan‚Äôs career is further in the rear view mirror, these questions will become increasingly common.

"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
that sounds very fun until a team like the warriors gets cade cunningham
Naw we are point guard heavy with Killian and Cade Cunningham now thankyou very much.
"Idk if this is actually unpopular but I think the NBA and WNBA should forbid all pro players from playing for the national team. The USA will win the Olympics this year and it won‚Äôt be close. Instead of having our best players dominate the tournament, it should be non-pro/minor league players (College, G-League, Overseas Americans, Semi-pro, etc.). The tournament would be way more competitive and it would make our gold medals more worth it. It would be interesting to see Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green and co represent The USA Men‚Äôs team in the Olympics. We‚Äôd also likely get to see some Americans playing in China or Europe, which would give them great recognition. The way it currently is makes for a stale product. Who really wants to see team USA effortlessly wallop every single opponent? I‚Äôd much rather watch games that are actually gonna be close.   Just an FYI, The United States Men‚Äôs team currently has a record of 138-5 in the Olympics. The Women‚Äôs team has a record of 66-3 in the Olympics."
"Knicks fans are completely overrating our core.   IQ did great for a rookie but he basically only has two ways to score and once you take away either of those things, he‚Äôs completely ineffective since his ability as an actual point guard is not great   RJ Barrett had a good season but he‚Äôs unproven as a star and his playoff performance proved it. Is he capped out as a solid starter, or can he eventually become budget Dwyane Wade? Evidence seems to point at the former.   Mitchell Robinson has basically only played half a good season, and been injured for the rest, so you‚Äôre asking to commit serious money and time to a player that‚Äôs only had half a season of actual good basketball in his career   The Knicks FO is in a more precarious position than people realize, and their newest lottery draft asset was a complete flop this year. The one year we didn‚Äôt tank was the Cade Cunningham draft, a point guard for a team that desperately needed a point guard."

"&gt;The Cavaliers hold the third pick in the draft. While many believe they will choose from a highly regarded pool of four prospects -- Cade Cunningham (likely the top pick), **Evan Mobley (who many believe will go second to Houston)**, Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs -- the Cavs are expanding their search beyond that quartet. Sources say Kuminga is in the No. 3 mix, with the organization believing that particular draft slot isn‚Äôt too high for him."
What‚Äôs amazing is he said on his podcast with Cade Cunningham that he currently has tears in his Achilles‚Äô tendon at the insertion point in his heal and he will most likely need surgery at some point. Never made a blip.  I don‚Äôt even know if he plays next year‚Ä¶

Watched every second of Cade Cunningham in college. The Pistons are about to have a special talent. Oklahoma State had no business being in the tourney but he dragged our asses there anyway.
"Post-lotto mock draft.

"I could see the Warriors going all in.   Warriors get:   * Jerami Grant   * Cade Cunningham  Pistons get:   * James Wiseman   * Jordan Poole   * Eric Paschall  * Filler contracts (Mulder, Smailagic)  * 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st   Warriors go all in on winning. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney, Cade/Oubre/Grant/Juan/Chriss   Pistons turn one pick and one good player into three blue chip prospects and four first round picks, two of which are for sure lotto picks and one (2025) that will likely be a lotto pick as well once Steph, Klay, Dray age out  Look at it as Wiseman, #7, #14 to move up to #1. Then Poole, Paschall, filler, 2 1sts for Grant."
Detroit should try to get Simmons. Imaging him and Cade Cunningham together.

1. Hayes can probably play the 2 2. Even if he can‚Äôt it‚Äôs CADE CUNNINGHAM
"Potential wise I would say Green. If based on current skills and game, Cade Cunningham is a scorer and playmaker. His game is mature for his age at the offensive end. He keeps it simple with rhythm jumpers and step backs. He doesn‚Äôt rely too much on athleticism for his moves which is always great for a young guy. Though people worry about his too droopy eyes. He gives the Brandon Ingram impression where you‚Äôre hesitant to interview him because he might be high."
"After winning the 2021¬†[NBA](http://bleacherreport.com/nba)¬†draft lottery on Tuesday night, the¬†[Detroit Pistons](http://bleacherreport.com/detroit-pistons)¬†are open to trading the No. 1 overall pick.¬†  According to¬†[Rod Beard](https://twitter.com/detnewsRodBeard/status/1407679561169506305)¬†of the¬†Detroit News, Pistons general manager Troy Weaver said Wednesday that trading the top pick is ""an option.""  Per¬†[The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2668326/2021/06/23/nba-mock-draft-2021-picks-for-every-lottery-team-including-jalen-suggs-to-magic-and-evan-mobley-to-cavaliers/)'s James Edwards III, Oklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham is the likely pick for Detroit if it stands pat, although G League Ignite guard¬†[Jalen Green](http://bleacherreport.com/jalen-green)¬†and USC center Evan Mobley are under ""strong consideration"" by the Pistons as well."
"Cade ""7/11"" cunningham"
I dont think there's any FO in the NBA outside of the one in Minnesota who would take Anthony Edwards over Cade Cunningham. But yes generally agree with your premise.
"They're obviously not, but of course it's ""an option"".  If Luka or Zion are really all pissed off and want out and their teams somehow don't think the relationships are easily repairable - well Cade Cunningham plus is a really good return."
"cade cunningham, jalen suggs, and more"
"It's not a good comparison. Cade Cunningham is widely believed to be a lock for #1, but not everyone agrees (Sam Vecenie of the Athletic)  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don‚Äôt think we should necessarily write this in stone yet. The one thing that every person in basketball says about Troy Weaver is that he absolutely does not subscribe to group think. He said in a post-lottery presser that they‚Äôll look at five guys and then make the best decision. It‚Äôs worth taking him at his word. After the lottery, I got texts from multiple sources that said the Pistons are also thought to be fans of Jalen Green. So look, I‚Äôm mocking Cunningham here. Pistons fans who want Cunningham shouldn‚Äôt have a meltdown based off this. But this isn‚Äôt like 2019 when Zion Williamson was a done deal and everyone in the basketball industry knew it. Cunningham is considered the likely choice here. He‚Äôs the overwhelming favorite. But everyone seems to be acting like this is unequivocally a done deal, and I‚Äôm not totally convinced of that as of right now, an hour after the lottery.  Most people have Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley at similar levels, with some adding Jonathan Kuminga to that mix. Since yesterday, Rockets fans have generally be in favor of drafting Jalen Green, followed by Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs a distant third."
"Pistons would get roasted hard if they take anyone besides Cade Cunningham from Oklahoma State (compared to Luka &amp; Tatum), although there is Jalen Green (compared to Beal &amp; LaVine) who did a year in the G league instead of college that people are saying could have a higher upside."

Cade Cunningham for Scottie barnes
"Bro he was there when cade was born. Then he went into first take and declared, cade cunningham would be a future 1st pick in the 2021 nba draft"
wow you saw one clip posted on reddit last night and now davion mitchell owns cade cunningham
"Simmons is also really fast for his size, which is why he's so switchable on defense. Cunningham doesn't project that way. Luka was also craftier as a prospect, whereas Cade tends to lean into his size advantage. That's not a fault so much as it's just a feature of his game that isn't likely to change very radically.   Cade is great, an A+ prospect by any reasonable standard, but comparing him to MVP and DPOY candidates right out of the gate is over the top. Let the man's shoes touch the floor before you start going over the top."
"Cade Cunningham is such a QB name, if that makes any sense"
Cade Cunningham listens to Jordan Peterson confirmed
Yeah you‚Äôre right. Cade Cunningham and Juhann Begarin have the same potential as of right now. Neither has finished their first training camps so no way to know!!!
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
My grandma says that Cade Cunningham is a nice young boy
Isnt it a great feeling? We have a young group as well  PG: Cade Cunningham - 19  SG: Killian Hayes - 20  SF: Saddiq Bey - 22  PF: Jerami Grant - 27 (our old man in the lineup)  C: Isaiah Steward - 20  With some young dudes off the bench as well in Josh Jackson and Diallo
"So you're going by Cade Cunningham now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Tanner from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic.."
"Hey man, I totally get the point you're trying to make, but the fact that you're claiming it like you know for a fact is making you look like an ass.  Cade Cunningham, on the night Detroit won the first pick, was on instagram live celebrating. ""Detroit gonna be lit this year"" and stuff, he seems genuinely hyped to go there. Whether he stays there long is not something anyone knows at this point, especially not a bunch of armchair analysts on reddit."
Hard to argue against it.  We got the best player in the country and Cade Cunningham.  We're back baby!

"Cade Cunningham just oozes ""cool motherfucker"""
man im loving cade cunningham
I think Williams is more complete simply because you can trust him to hit a jump shot already.   Barnes though has unreal upside. Even if he never learns to shoot he can be a real game changer. If he does learn to shoot than he could be a Cade Cunningham type prospect but with elite athleticism.   For what it's worth he was a smart shooter at FSU. He never took looks that would make you grown and he'll take a wide open 3 unlike a Ben Simmons. I don't think his shooting mechanics are *that* broken either.   I'm interested in if your organization sees him as a PG or a PF.
In 5 years we finna call Off-Night the Cade Cunningham stopped.
"With the 60th pick, Cade Cunningham."
With the 60th pick the Milwaukee bucks select Cade Cunningham.
Cade Cunningham to the bucks
OKC couldn't get Cade so they got the poor man's Cade Cunningham
Scottie is a jump shot away from being a more athletic type of Cade Cunningham prospect. He was always going to rise with the draft workouts.  It can be hard to pin down FSU players because we usually like to go 12 deep. So Patrick Williams and now Scottie Barnes end up not playing quite as much as they might elsewhere.
IF (and it's a big if) Scottie can learn to shoot then he has the potential to be a more athletic Cade Cunningham type of player.   I'll be interested if Toronto wants to make him a PG or a PF.
From the State of Oklahoma you mean. Blake Griffin went to University of Oklahoma and Cade Cunningham went to Oklahoma State University

Cade Cunningham is a pretty normal name. Not sure why you have him in the Star Wars category
"This kind of reminds me of the cade Cunningham thing.  I‚Äôd weaver trades down for green, he‚Äôs going to get shit on too even if he thinks that greens a better player."
From my thorough research on this year's rookie class which includes 1 highlight video per top 10 pick and looking up some of the strengths and weaknesses of these prospects on a scientific website called espn.   I will predict Cade Cunningham is not a primary playmaker and will play at shooting guard.
"That‚Äôs the impression I got for both of them. It‚Äôs not so much that Baylor played better than Gonzaga, they just didn‚Äôt belong on the same court. I assumed Butler was older but nah, he‚Äôs the same age as guys like Bouknight and only a year older than the top 4 guys.  Here‚Äôs some wild perspective  Player A  22.1/6.3/4.4 (pts/ast/reb) 2.6/0.5 (stl/blk)  .524/.416/.780 splits  Player B  22.8/3.9/7.0   1.8/0.9  .438/.400/.846 splits  Player A is Jared Butler.  Player B? Cade fucking Cunningham. And he‚Äôs only a year older.  Obviously he‚Äôs not as good as Cade, I‚Äôm not even suggesting he goes in the lottery. But he had a fantastic season at Butler and there‚Äôs every reason to believe it will translate to the NBA"
"&gt;The next 4 highest scorers on the team all hit a significantly higher % of their shots than Cunningham  Cade took 14.8 FGA/G, the highest amongst those 4 guys was at 9.0 FGA/G. None of them would‚Äôve faced defences the way Cade did either. The only other player on his team to shoot above 33% from 3 was Likekele, who took 0.8 3PA/G.   I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and act like I watched every game. I only saw a handful that were on ESPN but every time I watched, I saw his teammates miss some pretty easy shots that he would create. And anytime I read about Cade, I would read the same thing."
"The next 4 highest scorers on the team all hit a significantly higher % of their shots than Cunningham (*48%, 64%, 48%, 51%, Cade was at 43%*) and the team as a whole ranked 79th in FG% (.458), just inside the top quarter of all teams.

why do you think it's terrible? you can pick any number you want all that matter is that it's on the same scale...   just look at any [college player](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/cade-cunningham-1.html) on sports-reference and they have a per 40 section... it's been done like this since the dawn of basketball analytics.. pro's are usually per 36 to reflect common play times... in college this varies quite a bit so instead of settling on a per 36 number they just used the whole game...  all it's doing is giving a common scale so you can compare different players with different playtimes so you can see how they are producing on a per minute basis...
"Yeah, and Hakeem was closer to 6'10 as well.  They called him a 7 footer because (see Cade Cunningham height narrative, it isn't new) you know."
"Yeah, there's absolutely no way to tell how he'll do against NBA level athletes and ball handlers, like a Jalen Suggs or Cade Cunningham.

From Point forward to Point-Point.  The Cade Cunningham story.
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.

"Yup. Getting as much historical context on these players is a must to properly evaluate.   The other interesting thing is that as a shooter, Cade was 1/13 from 3 point range during FIBA international play. In fact the only year that he ever shot the ball good from deep was college. The guy actually had some 1/7 and 2/10 nights during FIBA play on top of it.  [https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Cade-Cunningham/Summary/124839](https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Cade-Cunningham/Summary/124839)  So I was a little confused when people said he his shot was ""automatic"". I do think the guy is a good passer though.  Not hating on Cade at all, but there a ton of people who were very quick to say he was in that AD/Zion category and the best prospect since Lebron too."
"I just see OKC trading picks for a disgruntled star as an incredibly unlikely outcome.  Rarely (if ever) do disgruntled stars demand trades with a bunch of years left on their contract.  And when they're down to 1-2 years left, they can basically demand to be traded wherever they want knowing that teams without the ability to re-sign them won't offer good enough packages.  So, which disgruntled star would demand a trade to the Thunder?  Maybe Cade Cunningham if he pans out?  I don't see anyone else wanting to go there."
"Cunningham is celarly not standing straight up in that picture, and green was wearing [Balmain runners](https://www.balmain.com/ca/shoes-b-runner-sneaker-white-and-grey-leather-and-mesh-b-runner-sneakers_cod11984726wo.html?dept=shsvwll) that have a really thick sole while Cade had on [Louboutins](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/christian-louboutin-mens-louis-junior-tonal-spike-low-top-sneakers-prod238850161) that are much thinner"
"&gt; ""It‚Äôs not just the shooting. He doesn‚Äôt explode of the dribble and can barely drive past defenders. His decision making is also questionable. Hope he turns it around but the eye test doesn‚Äôt look promising.""  I saw this exact take about Cade Cunningham in a thread yesterday lol"
"Well I just came up with a wayyyyy better Comp than Jaylen, Jayson, Luka, or Harden.  Cade Cunningham is literally just like Paul Pierce.   Case closed."
Cade Cunningham trick y'all
"That‚Äôs true, it doesn‚Äôt indicate skill but Jaylen Brown is incredibly skilled so I used him as a comp. If the Pistons got someone as good as Jaylen Brown #1 you‚Äôd be elated. Jaylen is an absolutely incredible player. If you are expecting your 6‚Äô6‚Äù guard to be a 6‚Äô8‚Äù guard/forward you‚Äôll be disappointed.  Do you think it‚Äôs an insult for Cade to be Jaylen Brown or something? Jaylen is an elite two-way shooting guard/small forward with great playmaking prowess and elite scoring ability.   If Cade Cunningham becomes close to Jaylen Brown‚Äôs level by the time his age 23 season comes around that would be an extremely good pick. Don‚Äôt go in expecting your rookie to be on Jayson or Luka‚Äôs level by the time he‚Äôs 22, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for disappointment. Those two are an exception to the rule, not the rule."
Scottie Barnes is 6'8 without shoes and 6'9 with shoes with a 7'4 wingspan according to his latest measurements.  On top of that Barnes attended the combine and Cade obviously didn't to hide his height.  Most players wear a 1 inch to 1.25 inch shoe.  Cade Cunningham is out here wearing 2 inch platforms.
And I thought I‚Äôd seen it all until someone on Reddit just stated that Liangleo Ball is a better prospect than Cade Cunningham
"Wait, isn't Cunningham a guard, too? I'm a Rockets fan, but I thought that Cade is still considered to be the best."
Liangelo Ball &gt; Cade Cunningham confirmed üòÇ
"After hearing all the Luka Doncic comps being pushed, it definitely looks like Cade is both smaller than Luka AND not as quick (handle isn't remotely comparable yet either). So I dont see that one at all.  But yeah SL stats doesnt mean anything , Cunningham is a pretty sure bet to be a good NBA player."

Cade Cunningham better be really fucking good lol

Dude is gonna be way better than Cade Cunningham
Haha the two losers of the great Cade Cunningham. Have fun with your inferior players.
Cade Cunningham hasn‚Äôt scored a single Point in the NBA. Clearly number 1
"Cade Cunningham and Balsa Koprivica played in Montverde together. They were both drafted by the Pistons this year. In highschool, the one team that kept giving them trouble was La Lumiere, led by Isaiah Stewart. Stewart was taken in the first round by Detroit last season."
"Anybody that thinks otherwise is ridiculous. This was on short/no practice, with 3 key players who played a Finals game the week before, some players who had the join on short notice and some potential players missing such as Curry, Kyrie, Harden, Lebron, Kawhi and AD. Team any of them up with KD and it would have been an ultimate joke.  2024 will have a prime Tatum, Booker and Lavine.  This year's rookie class (Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Scotie Barnes and Evan Mobley) were blowing teams out by nearly \~100 points the last few years. They showed some incredible chemistry reminiscent of what the original Dream team looked like vs the competition and played lockdown defense. That 2028 team is potentially going to be special imo especially when you combine them with vets from the 2024 games which I'm thinking will potentially be Lamelo, Ant, Ayton, etc.  Remember, these NBA players are the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the world's best basketball players and Team USA is the best of the best of that."
"Let's see we just drafted Cade Cunningham so I'd say the ceiling is winning the finals in 4, and the floor is winning the finals in 7."

Any thoughts on whether Cade Cunningham gets the call?
Cade Cunningham
ah yes the iconic duo of cade cunningham and kawhi leonard in detroit that everyone should have seen coming!
"Kuminga. He currently doesn't have any real NBA skill. All of his positives are theoretical because he has nice physical gifts  Zaire Williams was a massive reach so i consider him less of a bust if he flops  ROTY - Cade Cunningham. Green probably scores more but the league has been moving away from just giving ROTY to the leading scorer (Edwards vs Lamelo, Simmons vs Mitchell)"

Cade cunningham tbh.  0% bias detected
Detroit putting the rest of the NBA on notice. Pistons are an embarrassment. Poor Cade Cunningham.
"This is a fun question.  I don't know if Pistons would value everything a contender could reasonably trade over Cade Cunningham.  Same with the Rockets and Jalen Green.  I could see the Cavs pulling the trigger to recapture some Lebron glory days.     I think he drops all the way to 4 though were toronto tries to make a run with FVV, Siakam and Jordan.  They might be able to bring Lowry back for one more year and attract some ring chasers.  They have had luck with one year rentals to chase a chip."
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
"PG: Darius Garland/ KPJ SG: SGA SF: Cade Cunningham  PF: Jerami Grant C: Jonathan Isaac or Jarrett Allen  Being hopeful here that Cade is as advertised and what Isaac showed before getting hurt is real. I think this lineup is good enough for at least a second round appearance assuming they don‚Äôt run into 76ers, Bucks, or Nets.   Coaching is the real difference maker here"

‚ÄúLooks like the Magic are starting 4 two-way contract players tonight and the team manager from West Central High School they signed to that one-day contract.

cade cunningham literally the only player in history who has teammates miss off his passes
"Cade has only played 5 games and Pistons have won 2 of em. Neither was against great competition and the team sucks ass, but they've been notably better when Cunningham plays."
"I am fascinated that you are aware that KAT for Cade Cunningham + Stewart + picks and filler (maybe grant) is unlikely to happen but think that the Wolves can get Siakam and Scottie Barnes for KAT or John Collins, Reddish, Huerter + picks"
I remember when my Pistons friends used to say the same thing when I‚Äôd tell them trade Blake and Drummond. There‚Äôs no point in mediocrity. Something tells me there happy to have Cade Cunningham now
[Cade Cunningham walking into the training facility to get measured at 6‚Äô8](https://youtu.be/D1RgdMLbx3M)
"Jalen Green, while in transition, beat a backpedaling Cade Cunningham for a Dunk and started yelling shit at Cade to (imo) try and rally his team, it didn't work as the Pistons ended up winning the game."
Cade Cunningham and Anthony Bennett are both #1 pick. Prove me wrong
"The day Cade Cunningham graced Houston was the most important day of your life. For me, it was Wednesday."
Cade Cunningham sponsorship for beats by Dre noise canceling headphones incoming.
Cade Cunningham has double the career wins that Jalen Green has. That‚Äôs my GOAT üò§
"Jalen Green has the raw athleticism and aggressive mindset to become a star.  Cade Cunningham has the sound fundamentals, workmanlike approach to his game and is constantly wanting to take coaching to become an all-around star.  It's going to be fun to watch both of their respective developments."
Jalen Green getting a taunting penalty for screaming at Cade Cunningham is the least surprising thing ever.
Goddamn Cade Cunningham already dishing shit on opponents
Why is Cade Cunningham reporting this doesn‚Äôt he have a game tonight
"I mean if that's the question (which is a totally different one), then I have to say probably Cade Cunningham, the #1 pick, who is the captain of the brick layer's guild.  But I'm not trying to shit on Cade and I think Cade still has huge upside. He's a fucking rookie on a HORRIBLE team, I'm cutting a little slack."
By this logic Cade Cunningham would be the worst player dude is shooting like ass (27% TS). Would I take him over a bunch of 0 minute roleplayers. Absolutely. You can't look at box score and say this dude is the worst player. Using that logic Draymond Green is a terrible player (triple single). There are a lot of things that stats won't tell you about someones impact on the game.
"Cade Cunningham  Watched him 4 times so far and tbh if I didn't knew I was looking for him, I wouldn't even have recognized him. So I was under the impression that he is nothing special, but yeah NBA scouts, fans, media etc all seem to see him as a consensus super talent.  Obviously I'm in the wrong here, so I don't know Cade Cunningham."
"Top two picks Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green going up against each other in that game. And people have been hyping up a baby beef between them which seems entirely artificial, but I'm here for it either way. So yeah we both suck, but it's gonna be entertaining as hell anyway."
He has a better PER than Cade Cunningham. Who I‚Äôm guessing doesn‚Äôt have enough minutes to qualify for this stat. And is functionally identical to Jalen Green.
"Shaq was absolutely dominant but he's 1 for 1, he only changed how teams played him while he was in his prime. Curry meanwhile changed how the game is played and has hoards of ""the next steph curry"" comps in every level of the game. Does Cade Cunningham get taken #1 overall if it wasnt for Curry?   Now as a player I don't think Curry is better than Kobe, Lebron, KD, or Shaq. I think he might be somewhere in the 10-15 range all time. But now one has revolutionized the game like curry since MJ and maybe KAJ or Wilt before that."
"OP clarified that the question is meant to exclude rookies. The problem with the question, as originally stated, is that the answer is always Cade Cunningham."
This question makes absolutely no sense. You have to eliminate rookies from the player pool or the answer will always be Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley.
Cade Cunningham? Nailed it.
Chet holmgren is the most made up sports movie name. Even worse than cade cunningham
"&gt; 99% of people had Cade as the top prospect.  https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/detroit-pistons-cade-cunningham-toronto-raptors-nba-draft-shakeup  Detroit's own FO had people that wanted Green or Mobley over Cade  Personally I didn't have Cade #1, I had him behind Green and wasn't super confident in his ability to be a great #1 guy in the NBA because of problems with his handle and athleticism. Do I have to wait longer to say Cade shouldn't have gone #1?"

"Go read my post again:  In summary: Cade Cunningham is shooting 17% from the field and 4.7% from 3, which is a worse shooting % than Anthony Bennett in his first ~39 FGA. He also has a negative PER.   How does that imply that he is going to be or already is a bust? What, now people can‚Äôt say a rookie is struggling without calling him a bust?

We are all idiots. We just choose different things to be stupid about. For some it Cade cunningham
"Cade Cunningham had his first good NBA game yesterday.  Sure, the address was bad, but he weighed in more in the game. That will come and he will play more liberated in the next few games.  The best is yet to come."
"You can share it, that‚Äôs fine. A lot of people myself included can also downvote it. Your replies just seem disingenuous to me especially when you say you‚Äôre worried. Cade Cunningham doesn‚Äôt seem worried that boy is getting them up even when missing. That‚Äôs confidence."
But this is exact thread we're in now is specific to a stat about Steph. It's not about Cade Cunningham or Al Horford or whoever the fuck. Quit being so obtuse.
"Karl Anthony Towns ‚Äì 16/40 FG (40%) ‚Äì 1/1 from 3 (100%)   Ben Simmons ‚Äì 18/41 FG (44%) ‚Äì 0/2 from 3 (0%)   Markelle Fultz ‚Äì 8/23 FG (35%) ‚Äì 0/0 from 3   Deandre Ayton ‚Äì 16/29 FG (55%) ‚Äì 0/0 from 3   Zion Williamson ‚Äì 24/36 FG (67%) ‚Äì 4/6 from 3 (67%)   Anthony Edwards ‚Äì 19/45 FG (42%) ‚Äì 4/17 from 3 (24%)   Cade Cunningham ‚Äì 7/39 FG (18%) ‚Äì 1/21 from 3 (5%)"
"No need to overreact so early on. Cade's got a high floor and he'll eventually get there but the early numbers are what they are. And since everyone is bitching about his stats being comped to Anthony Bennett, here's his numbers next to the last 6 number 1 picks.

"Markelle Fultz scouting report: [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/markelle-fultz/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/markelle-fultz/)  Cade Cunningham scouting report: [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/cade-cunningham/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/cade-cunningham/)  Incredibly similar report by professionals on these 2 guys. That and the fact that both were injured to start the season makes Fultz a great benchmark to compare Cade to. Fultz may have had 2 more preseason games, but his more severe injury takes away that advantage. And the thing is: Fultz isnt exactly a high bar to reach. Cade hasnt even come close.  So no, just because they're different people doesn't mean their playstyle and skills are completely different."
"This might surprise you a bit, but Cade Cunningham, Zion Williamson, and Markelle Fultz are different people and their performance is wholly irrelevant to one another."
I look at Cade Cunningham and I see young Khris Middleton
"I did the math: 25.6358347826 feet is the distance from 1 foot in from the sideline to the net. If he is moving at post the speed of light he could steal with no resistance as soon as the ball is thrown in, so we're assuming the other team passes the ball in as far away as they can to reduce Cade's points.   983600000 feet per second is the speed of light, to any relevant specificity.   38368167.3862 is how many times he'll have to make that distance to meet the speed of light, so we find how many points that gives him at 4/17 accuracy (he won't be taking freethrows since nobody is fast enough to foul him). We'll assume they're all 2 pointers though since he can move so much faster than the ball.  That means 9027804.09087 is the number of 2 pointers he can score going the speed of light. That means 18055608 points. He will only score a number that is 3* higher than the previous night though, so let's see our options.  2, 6, 18, 54, 162, 486, 1458, 4374, 13122, 39366, 118098, 354294, 1062882, 3188646, 9565938, 28697814.  Bing bing bing! We have a winner! When Cade Cunningham scores 28697814 points he will be exceeding the speed of light! This will happen in 13 games!"
"Math, gotta love it. At what point will Cade Cunningham be moving faster than the speed of light to score all his points within 48 minutes?"
other than Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant (and occasionally Saddiq Bey and Kelly Olynyk) they don't have anyone else on the team with a scorer's mentality
Sixers are good.  Detroit is bad.  Embiid looked pretty gassed on the 2nd half of a b2b.  Cade Cunningham has the greenest green light I've ever seen.
At least Cade Cunningham finally scored in double digits?

"Why you being so damn rude just cause I shared an opinion, WHY bro Ben simmons isnt even in the top 100 best pgs even this new kid Cade Cunningham is ahead of him"
I'll take the underdog #1 pick Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham the consensus number one pick?
"Yes, 2018 is also special.  I call these 'generational' or 'once in a decade' drafts.    In theory, there should be one year within the decade loaded with studs.  However, what makes the draft special is that it's pretty much a normal draft year (a few All-Stars) that gets topped off by one guy who has potential to become a Top 10-15 player ever.  That's MJ, Kobe, Lebron, Luka.  In this case, it's Cade Cunningham....if he fulfills his hype."
Wiggins and Rozier are now following Cade Cunningham on Twitter
"If the players don't regress, it might end up becoming a Top 3 draft class.  That means, out of 84, 96, 03.....2021 might end up knocking one of them out.    Now, much of that will depend on how Cade Cunningham looks like in a few years but it's looking like the Top 5 picks will be players that every team is satisfied with (to varying degrees, of course).  Then, there's potential for guys like Wagner, Giddey, and Duarte (among with a few others who have not, yet, refined themselves)."
Who's Cade Cunningham?
Cade ‚ÄúTua‚Äù Cunningham
Was that a slight against Cade Cunningham?
"What makes you say Trae and Luka are leaders? As far as I know they are both more ""lead by example"" types, which usually means they are just the best players but not really a leader.  If we are talking about young players though, Ja tops the list as an immediate leader. I'd also put Cole Anthony and in his own weird way, LaMelo Ball as young leaders on their teams.  I think Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes will be that as well.  I think a lot of it can be developed with experience, but it depends on locker room dynamics as much as anything. Bam wasn't really a leader when he was drafted, but under UD's mentorship he basically has become one. It's not super neccessary with Butler and Lowry there, but he's a good example of someone developing those traits."
"Yeah, definitely can fit and execute the ""tall point guard"" meta: can score on all three levels and has the courtvision to make some terrific passes. I always thought Jalen was exceptional enough to be a heliocentric player. That game he had in highschool vs Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes and Day‚ÄôRon Sharpe he was pretty much the main point guard and threw some insane passes then too to lead his team and get the win.  However, if you want him to load balance an offense and for him to be a defensive stopper, I really think you start asking for too much. For example, Mavericks fans have accepted that Luka won't be able to be a defensive stopper if he's carrying the entire offensive load.  Earlier than better is the time to decide the skill tree: outside of scoring (the given) do we want Jalen to execute the offense top to bottom or expend more energy on defense?   Now if Jalen does both, that guy would be something else entirely.  This would also affect what we want out of KPJ: if we want Jalen to carry the playmaking then kpj should be able to anchor the perimeter defense."
"We are 6 games into the season. You ready to call Cade Cunningham the worst number 1 pick of all time yet or are you going to wait until he's played 10 games so you can make a fully informed decision?   You are completely avoiding that he is creating his own shot on most those attempts. Don't mind me though, I actually watch the games so I'll have to defer to you who thinks that people overvalue him because he's white."
If anyone is selling Cade Cunningham stock I'm buying
"I know Cade Cunningham isn't horrible, but guy looked pretty lackluster in the NCAA Tournament too.  I was saying he's not gonna be this slam dunk of a pick, at least not right out the gate."
Cade rolled his ankle 1 month ago.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/cade-cunningham-injury-update-pistons-unsure-when-no-1-overall-pick-will-return-after-rolling-ankle/
The Chad Jalen Green vs the Virgin Cade Cunningham
Downvote all you want but Mobley and Barnes are absolutely better players.  Mobley was a freak in college and Barnes was more hidden by his coach as they had a deep team.  Meanwhile Cade Cunningham wanted Isaac Likekele to run the team.  The only worse 1st rd pick was Moses Moody because at least Cade will have a long NBA career.  But he‚Äôs a top pick so it will end up being below expectations.
I'm not going to declare #1 overall pick Cade a bust but so far he's 0-14 from 3pt range averaging 3 PPG. Meanwhile:  \#4 pick Scottie Barnes is averaging 18/9  \#13 pick Chris Duarte is averaging 18/4  Cade Cunningham isn't off to a ROTY start I think it's fair to say.
Cade ‚Äúno extension‚Äù Cunningham.  It doesn‚Äôt really go but oh well.

"It's a little early, and I'm going against the grain here, but I'm going to be the first to say Cade Cunningham has already surpassed Anthony Bennett for career legacy. The first bar on the ladder to surpassing Michael Jordan has been cleared."
Cade Cunningham is average 4.0 PPG
‚ÄúCade Cunningham looking like Bob the Builder‚Äù damn bruh
Why does Cade Cunningham look so lost on the defence
Cade Cunningham at his best will be lucky to be as good as Khris Middleton. How did this unathletic dude who isn't a great passer (as evidenced by his mediocre ast/to number throughout his career) go no. 1 overall in a stacked draft?
Pistons are undefeated when Cade Cunningham plays. Goat?
"There were definitely people saying he *might* be the best prospect, but Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green were more polished players and have greater offensive potential. Plus Mobley is underweight for a center and needs to do a lot of bulking up."
"&gt;this kid is currently behind Green, Suggs, and Cade in ROTY rankings  Cade Cunningham with the greatest 2 points in NBA History"
This list has Cade Cunningham above Franz Wagner lol
This tells me there is a diva no 1 pick every 5 years. So Cade Cunningham it is!
Hot take incoming Cade Cunningham has ham in his name
"Personally I can't believe Cade Cunningham is the greatest draft bust in the history of the NBA, since we all know that debut games after missing preseason are career-defining."
Is it time to declare Cade Cunningham a bust?!?!?!? üí©üò§üò§
Cade Cunningham is averaging 2.0 points per game
"Just last year, LaMelo Ball went scoreless on his first NBA game. He went on to win the rookie of the year award, and now this year he‚Äôs taken another leap.   It‚Äôs way too early to judge Cade Cunningham!"
Cade Cunningham is averaging 0.0 points per game
Just practice before he practices with the proper Team. Cade Cunningham is doing the same
Cade Cunningham. 4 games aren't enough to outdo an entire scouting world that had Cade as the consensus #1.
"My impression of Cade Cunningham when I saw him in summer league was that he was too small to play on an NBA floor, but then I went to wikipedia and read that he's 6'6"" 220 and I realized I should stop taking my basketball opinion seriously"
"&gt; Maybe he should have tried it LOL. &gt;  &gt; There is another comment chain I'm on right now where someone said Harden's step back would be called a travel in the 80s and my question is how do you know...did someone try it back then and it was called a travel? If so then when were the rules loosened? Basically the same conversation me and you were having  With complete sincerity, I've got to tell ya, yes, people *did* often try to push the envelope and were subsequently shot down by officials. NBA rules and the officials who enforce them set the tone for what maneuvers are possible on a basketball court and what's not. And those goalposts have steadily shifted all throughout NBA history.   [We already talked George Gervin's all-star travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yxQJYkmpL4&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen).   [But here's what happened when Rafer Alston finally got some garbage time minutes in 2001 and attempted a move that, by all accounts, probably was technically legal at the time but officials nonetheless weren't having it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgZp38dF9B0&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  [Isiah Thomas taking one too many steps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy47A-WOOog&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen)  Basically, it's always up to the players to recognize the framework with which they're allowed to operate. I know you were half joking but suggesting that maybe Bob Cousy should have tried the ol' Giannis 4-step would be similar to suggesting that maybe Cade Cunningham should give a six-step shuffle a try in his debut just to see what happens.   In short, we *knew* what was generally considered legal and what wasn't. A big part of the reason we knew? Because we'd make mistakes and be punished for them. There'd be times where we'd accidentally take an obvious bonus gather step and get whistled, or we'd scoop the hand just a little too far under the ball and get called for carrying, or we'd step back a little too dramatically and got called for steps.   Players need to know the modern framework just like the older guys had to know theirs. James Harden knows he can get away with what appears to be a double-stepback to the older generation viewers because it's within today's framework. But he also knows not to attempt a quadruple stepback because it's not legal in today's game. Maybe, over time, guys like Harden will help nudge us toward that quadruple stepback zone, but that's not where we're at now and it's not an evolution that happens overnight."

Cade 'How I Get Em Out' Cunningham.
Cade Cunningham   Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham   Cash Considerations
"I don't understand how this comment makes any sense in relation to the report. We're talking about a pick that will be Cade Cunningham in 2 days not some nebulous future pick that will convey in 10 years.  If Cade sucks/is worse than Shai, Presti will eat all kinds of blame for it within a couple years. That's the opposite of absolving himself of responsibility, if he made this deal he'd be putting his ass out there as the target of criticism if it fails. Keeping Shai instead would be the safe choice by far in terms of criticism and job security. Just look at this thread's reaction to the proposed deal."
Wtf... Do you people not realize that this is not some nebulous unknown future pick in 2038? It's literally a pick that will be Cade Cunningham in 2 days. How tf is that not team building.
"He had a hyperextended knee against the rockets. I guess he didn‚Äôt miss too much time with that One.  Either way shais really good man, he‚Äôs way better than anyone the rockets have‚Ä¶. But he‚Äôs not Cade freaking Cunningham"
"&gt;Cade Cunningham as the first franchise player in Detroit since Grant Hill  I would say Chauncey Billups was a franchise player in Detroit, even if he wasn't drafted by Detroit."
The only pick/player they have made him available for is Cade Cunningham and he legit could be the best young player in the league next season after Luka and Zion.
"With the first pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, the Detroit Pistons select *NOT Cade Cunningham*"
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential"" and I'm not sure SGA has that  y'all are wildin i swear lol...Cade hasn't played a day in the nba"
" This deal isn't for a ""future first"".  This deal is for Cade Cunningham.  The odds of him being a better player than Shai is not low."
Lol why would the Pistons do that? Cade Cunningham is a potential superstar talent. SGA is good but probably not superstar material
"&gt; Kick the can down the road absolve yourself of responsibility while having fans praise you for how brilliant you are for hoarding up on assets and their theoretical value.  I actually don't think that's what this is at all.   If this is a real offer that they made--and I'm not entirely convinced that it is--then i think what it indicates is not that they want to kick the can down the road but simply that they don't think shai can be the best player on a championship team. And while shai is an awesome and promising young player, I don't think that's a crazy opinion. If OKC thinks that cade cunningham can be the best player on a title team and shai can't, then why wouldn't they make that move?   To be clear, I am not saying that *I* think that. Honestly, I think cade basically projects to be a slightly taller version of the same exact player, and thus i don't think i would make this move if i were OKC. But if they think Cade is the guy, this is a totally defensible move."
More like these people are acting like Cade Cunningham (who hasn't played a minute in the NBA) is LeBron James.
ESPN: Is Cade Cunningham a certified SJW?
Maybe because he wants Cade Cunningham?  Shai is good but Jesus people get too hung up on the ‚Äúbut he hasn‚Äôt played in the nba yet!‚Äù Crap.  He‚Äôs a great bet to become a superstar and better than shai
"You pay your scouting department to identify if a guy like Cade Cunningham can be a better player than SGA in a couple years time. They know SGA better than any other team, if they don't think they can build a real contenter around him, but could with Cunningham, you offer this trade."
I mean he's getting back Cade Cunningham who you could also build around
"""More than anything, they show that athletes are more than just athletes,"" Cunningham told ESPN  Cade, elaborating further, told ESPN ""I walked into the room and saw Welcome \[Insert New Nike Athlete Here\]! on the PowerPoint slide. It was artistic and creative. That's when I knew this was like a family where we're all in this together contributing to a common goal. We're all Nike."""
"I think you got yes and no mixed up in the statement.   On topic I really can't tell. I think presti understands that in order to win a chip you need to have GREAT individual talent on the roster. Imo SGA has shown that he's that type of talent.   maybe they know more about his injury than we do, maybe they predict his ceiling to be lower than his current development indicates, maybe Cade is really that type of MJ/Bron/Luka/KD type of talent. It's a risky play but if Cunningham proves to be an NBA ready HoF, multiple MVPs type talent you might miss out on a generational talent to keep your Superstar talent around, even though you had the chance of acquiring said talent.  The fans want to get back into the playoff picture asap but in reality there's not a lot of time pressure on OKC when it comes to contending again. So if Cade turns out to actually be that guy they'd lose a year  on average but not more while potentially having the face of the league on the roster again. Prestis time on the thunder has shown that he's good at drafting and developing players, so maybe his intuition just tells him that Cade is the jackpot that will flourish like KD and Brodie in OKC.   So overall it's a somewhat risky but also ultimately understandable move. He'll either be praised forever or catch some criticism if Cade doesn't turn out to be that great after his rookie contract but even then people will defend him due to the all-time great noise surrounding this year's 1st pick. I'd probably try my luck with sga if he's projected to be 100% healthy again but trading for Cade can be an all-time move."
"First, it is just a rumor. As a thunder fan it would be ridiculous to trade SGA plus 6 for the 1st pick. SGA is a borderline All Star and there will be a good player at 6, so it would be better to just keep him and draft the guy at 6 than to give both away to move up. As Detriot I don't see how you say no to that offer. SGA can make an all star game in the east easy and Detroit would be in the playoffs and get to add another lottery talent at 6. OKC on the other hand would be left with just Cade Cunningham who has questions of his own.   Regardless I am in the minority of thunder fans when I say trading Shai should absolutely be an option for us. We will be paying him a max after next year and be on a clock to start competing. We have 6 years to start competing if you trade him straight for the first pick and a guy like Cade that gives you around 9 years of control. It allows an actual tank to commence and we can pray to get some generational guys in the top 5 in the next few drafts. With SGA OKC will be picking 12th every year and won't get the cream of the crop.   In no way am I saying we should trade SGA. I just think that there are benefits to it if Presti decides to go that route."
Presumptive No. 1 overall pick Cade Cunningham has reportedly agreed to an endorsement contract with Nike ahead of the 2021 NBA draft.  ESPN's¬†[Adrian Wojnarowski](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1420021096275927041)¬†reported Cunningham is expected to have the largest shoe deal of any player in his class.
Not if he can be turned into Cade Cunningham.

"""League sources have indicated there is a level of disinterest within Evan Mobley‚Äôs camp regarding Houston as a destination, raising questions as to whether that potential marriage would be ideal for either side. Rival teams do not expect Mobley, Jalen Suggs or Cade Cunningham to work out for Houston before draft night."""
The fuck are you on? Whag makes cade cunningham a sure thing? Shai is already a sure fucking thing. Were literally building the team around him because hes worth it. And the 6th pick is still a damn great pick. You turning down that offer is nonsense.
shai is amazing and is a great self creator   but cade Cunningham is a wire to wire #1 overall pick. he‚Äôs the best passer in the class and he just shot 40% from 3.   build your entire franchise around this kid. legit AD level prospect. better prospect than KAT and Zion imo  Cade is Luka-esque
After a 29 team trade the Thunder trade every pick in the 2023/2023/2025 draft for Cade Cunningham
Cade fvcking Cunningham
Who has the better resume Cade Cunningham or Evan Mobley? In my opinion Mobley because he lost to Gonzaga
Unbiased but Cade Cunningham after we 3-Peat the next 3 years
Cade Cunningham could very easily be better than SGA
"Cade Cunningham has been hyped up a lot, just below zion levels tbh"
Cade Cunningham
Cade Cunningham
"No, he talks like Cade Cunningham"
"&gt; Listening to offers isn't ""dangling"" the pick  Sure it is, if the player in question is a surefire #1 pick, then you don't even listen to offers and you hang up the phone. The Pelicans weren't listening to any offers when they had the chance to select Zion or AD.   Cade isn't that level of prospect.   The overwhelming likelihood is that Cade does go to the Pistons. But the fact that we're 3 days away from the draft and Woj is saying ""Detroit isn't fully there yet on committing to Cunningham with their first overall choice"" is a telltale sign that the situation is fluid and can change at the drop of a hat."
This is bullshit smokescreen nonsense. If Detroit doesn't take Cade Cunningham I'm gonna send them an application to be their new head of scouting.
All this just for Woj to tweet ‚ÄúThe Detroit Pistons have their sights LASER FOCUSED on Cade Cunningham‚Äù at 7:58 EST on Thursday
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De‚ÄôAron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
Trying to get Cade Cunningham. I don't hate the strategy tbh.
"If you want to build a sense of identity with a team you should choose either the closest one to you or a young rebuilding team. Some good options for this are the Thunder, Pistons, Rockets, or Magic. The thunder have a historic amount of draft picks in the upcoming years,and already have some lovable young players in SGA, Dort, and Poku. On top of that they are set to have a very exciting draft next week. The pistons are a team primed to turn it around soon with the likely first pick Cade Cunningham. The Rockets also have quite a bit of draft capital, but less young lovable players as the thunder. Jalen Green should be a blast to watch for them though. Finally, the Magic have two top 10 picks this year and a slew of young players themselves. You can‚Äôt go wrong with any option.  Alternatively, if you want to watch good basketball without rooting for the favorites, the Celtics, Nuggets, and Suns are all teams with good cores that should compete for the next few years.   If you want to watch a young team play good basketball, but don‚Äôt want to sit through a rebuild, try the Hawks, Grizzlies, or Pelicans. All three have recently drafted stars who aren‚Äôt in their prime yet.  If you want to watch chaos and a full rebuild then become a trailblazers fan. They will likely be blowing it up this off-season or next. If you only want misery then go with the Sonics. Sonics fans are perpetually miserable and the only thing they have to do is root for the thunder to lose.  Finally, some people choose to just root for a certain player. If you find a certain player that you love, you might just choose to follow them wherever they go."
"Yup. The AI gives you stuff like ""Cade Cunningham shoots 43.7% from the right corner with a defender within 4 ft"" or ""Cade Cunningham spends 18% of his minutes walking"" not ""Cade Cunningham is the next Michael Jordan""."
They have Cade fucking Cunningham now tho
"Rockets have no assets to give that would be worthwhile to move off Cade Cunningham.   Pistons have a cornerstone guy, that doesn't come along often."
Cade and Jalen Green are both gonna be amazing. Why waste a bunch of assets to go from Green to Cunningham?
Cade ‚ÄúBaditwaba‚Äù Cunningham
"I get why they wouldn‚Äôt entertain a trade. Cade is the safest pick with the highest floor, and he‚Äôs the consensus pick, so Weaver won‚Äôt risk getting fired by taking him.  On the other hand, I think it‚Äôs entirely possible Mobley or Green wind up being the best player, and this would be a good opportunity for them to get the best player in the draft while picking up more draft equity. Unfortunately, Detroit isn‚Äôt in a position to gamble like Boston was in 2017. If they were to pass on Cunningham and he winds up living up to the hype, Weaver would never work again in the league."
This quote sounds super white lmao. Cade Cunningham also sounds like an investment counsellor in a small city
Someone will either look like a genius or a real dumb dumb if they say Cade Cunningham so Imma say it
"&gt;I think I'm going to become the best basketball player  -9th grade Cade Cunningham, shortly after getting laid the fuck out on a slant route, probably."
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
"Stephen A. Smith does not believe Cade Cunningham should go no. 1 citing his ability to speak another language: ""You shouldn't have to have an interpreter for the future face of basketball"" He also made mention of his nationality, not being 100% American."
"&gt;Cunningham: ""I wanted to meet with the team that had the No. 1 pick because I feel like I'm the No. 1 pick. If the Rockets go get the No. 1 pick, I'll meet with them if there is enough time.""  Doesnt say it was Cade. You sure it wasnt Dante Cunningham?"
Cade Cunningham will be a bust sorry
Cade Cunningham might entice teams to much. That‚Äôs why I think he goes #2
Lottery but not top 3. I'd rather have Cade Cunningham than try to see if this guy even wants to be an NBA player.
I think Cade Cunningham ceiling is more what Paul George is now than Luka. That‚Äôs not an insult or anything but I just think George is the better comp.
no way he‚Äôd be taken over the established cream of the crop guys. definitely later in the lottery tho I guess? because how would you justify taking a noob over Cade Cunningham who has proven they can actually play the sport lol
Cade Cunningham is Michael Beasley V2.0
"Cade Cunningham will be a top 15 player by the end of his rookie contract.  There will be 30-40 legit NBA players to emerge from this draft, far more than average.  Alperen Sengun is outdated for this league and will peak as a bench offensive big.   Moses Moody will be on the all-rookie first team."
Cade cunningham will drop to 11
Cade Cunningham while super aggressive will also does a great job protecting the ball. He is being underrated because of what Doncic is doing. The Pistons would pass up a generational talent if they don‚Äôt draft Cade. He is the best player overall.
"Cade Cunningham will be a role player.  Evan Mobley will be the best player in the draft, with Jalen Green a close second.  Kuminga, Wagner, and Keon Johnson will bust hard."
Cade Cunningham üò¨
"Fun fact Usman and Cade Cunningham went to the same high school in Arlington, TX. Obviously not at the same time. Cade went on to a basketball prep school afterwards."
"Seems like the vast majority of big boards have Cade Cunningham at #1, Mobley and Green have been interchangeable at 2-3, and Suggs is always 4.   You could basically make 3 tiers for the top 4 picks"
"Cade cunningham was 8 when the decision happened, born 8/25/01. Jalen Green was 8 when the decision happened, born 2/9/02. Jalen Suggs turned 9 a month before the decision happened, born 6/3/01. That‚Äôs just the top three prospects, I can keep going if you‚Äôd like?"
I agree he needs a lot of help but if you take away Luka the Mavs might be drafting Cade Cunningham this year. I think he‚Äôs the most important player on any team in the league.
"What I did was watch Nba highlights on youtube, and just followed players I found entertaining. From there I just supported my favorite players team, which was Westbrook and the thunder.   But if you dont wanna do that, here are some good teams you could support:  Bucks: just won the finals, Giannis is pretty entertaining and they‚Äôll be good for many years  Mavs: Luka Doncic is one of the best already at a very young age, has potential to be an alltime great  Nets: KD, Kyrie, Harden, all very entertaining. You would be supporting a superteam though, and they wont be around for many years  Pistons: #1 pick in this years draft, probably gonna draft Cade Cunningham  Thunder: Thousands of draft picks, and have an amazing young talent in Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Lakers: Lebron  Timberwolves: Have been bad for a while, but with Anthony Edwards entering his second year and KAT at center, they are starting to show some promise.  Obviously there are tons of other fun teams in the league, but these are some that I personally think would be fun to support. Enjoy!"
Cade Cunningham has never met the Kings in the Finals

You look at Giannis and think Cade Cunningham is gonna overtake him?

Cade Cunningham is who everyone wants
"Sources: Cunningham Wants Out   June 22, 2028      DETROIT, MI ‚Äî Four time NBA All-Star and reigning All-NBA First Teamer Cade Cunningham has formally requested a trade, sources tell ESPN‚Äôs Adrian Wojnarowski and Malika Andrews.      Cunningham averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 assists, and 6.3 rebounds in the 2027-28 season, leading the Pistons to a 44-38 record and the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. After the Pistons loss in the first round last week, Cunningham took some personal time at home in Arlington, Texas to mull over his options.      A trade has been theorized by many in NBA circles for the past two seasons as Cunningham starred despite a dearth of high level talent around him in Detroit. According to ESPN sources, the most likely destinations for Cunningham are Brooklyn, Miami, and the Los Angeles Lakers.      Cunningham has 2 years and $97.4M remaining on his contract before free agency.      Stay tuned to ESPN for updates as this situation evolves."
Cade Cunningham unless some total fuckery happens
Cade Cunningham has announced his decision to stay at OSU for another season.

I'm from the future...  Bulls get the #1 pick and selects Cade Cunningham.   That's all
I wish you all a merry Cade Cunningham
I gotta know- is Cade Cunningham considered generational?
"With the first pick in the 2021 NBA draft, the Toronto Raptors select Cade Cunningham from Oklahoma State."
This is Orlando‚Äôs year.   Year after year they always seem to fall one pick too late.   It‚Äôs a 3 player draft? They get the 4th pick.   The 5th pick is Trae Young and able to trade up for Luka? Well they get stuck with the 6th pick.   2021 is finally the year. They get Cade Cunningham and will be lifted out of the nba purgatory that is 35-40 wins.
I hope an East teams gets Cade Cunningham
cade cunningham has said orlando is his city on his instagram live. adam silver Please do me a favor
"Cade Cunningham already plays for OSU, why do you sick bastards want to take him away from Braum's?"
Cade Cunningham.
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
"But who are they even going to take with a top 4 pick? This seems like an incredibly weak draft class. Cade Cunningham is projected to be #1 overall. Sorry, but I just don't see him being a franchising changing player like Zion, KAT, Ayton, or even, yes, Ben Simmons, from the past few years.  That's why I'm fully expecting the Pistons to get the #1 pick and have it not help us at all. lol"
I believe I will bust if we get Cade Cunningham
"There's a consensus number 1 in Cade Cunningham. Then there's a strong 2-5, in Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga.  Beyond that it's your usual draft of maybes. That top 5 does stand out from the rest."
Who gives a single flying fuck about Terry Rozier and Devonte Graham when Cade Cunningham is available?
"Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley are top two for sure, with some cool G-League players like Jalen Green"
"You‚Äôre massively underestimating the lack of give-a-fuck among NBA players. You don‚Äôt think a team with players like Cade Cunningham, Jalens Suggs and Green, Lamelo Ball, Evan Mobley, James Wiseman level players would win every game by 20? France, Australia, Canada etc have NBA-caliber players in the starting lineup. USA at any level has NBA-caliber players at the end of the bench. Give these kids a chance who haven‚Äôt won anything of note to compete on the world stage as Olympians and you‚Äôll see something special"
This dude sounds pretty smart. What's his take on Cade Cunningham?
I will take one Cade Cunningham pls  Or one Evan Mobley if you're out of those
"With the first pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, the Toronto Raptors select Cade Cunningham from Oklahoma State University."
Deserves is an interesting word choice. But I think the Magic are due for some lottery luck. I believe they‚Äôve dropped in every lottery since they won the Dwight sweepstakes in 2004. Getting a piece like Cade Cunningham could really do something for that franchise and market.
"Has to be the Timberwolves, they‚Äôve had at least 5 different number 1 picks on their roster the last 5 years and have consistently stayed at the bottom of their conference.   Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, KAT, DRose, Anthony Edwards‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not including their other top picks that have resulted in nothing. They definitely do not deserve Cade Cunningham."
"I don‚Äôt know shit about college hoops so I‚Äôm sure cade Cunningham is and will be good, but got damn dude looks like he‚Äôs pushing 40 not 20 lol Also Cade is an all time bad name imo"
So OKC (college) and Cade Cunningham Timberwolves (hometown) and Jalen Suggs Timberwolves are selling Timberwolves have a young upcoming roster I think Timberwolves get the second or third pick is the rigged  Warriors/Kings get Jalen Green
"With the first pick in 2021 NBA Draft, the Toronto Raptors select Cade Cunningham from Oklahoma State University"
Cade Cunningham just sounds like a bulls player
"Kobe got that popular by establishing himself over a long career he All NBA, Championships and an MVP. You wouldn't have that opportunity if you're Cade Cunningham and you sign with the Lakers this offseason to play in Bron and AD's shadow."
I hope you guys get Cade Cunningham

"Luka Doncic is seeking a trade to OKC for the newly-drafted Cade Cunningham, sources say"
King Cade Cunningham has a nice ring to it.
"There's some variability based on what player fits best with each team, but that is more common once you're out of the top 5-10 picks where the quality of each player is less clear cut and teams can draft based on need.  For example, in 2003, there was no way the No.1 pick was going to be anyone but LeBron James as all the scouting on him was very clear that he was the most talented player in the draft by a mile. Even if Cleveland had a good small forward at the time (LBJs position, and they didn't) they would have been fools not to draft him. They call this ""best player available"" rather than ""best fit"".  This year, Cade Cunningham is unquestionably the best prospect, he's a great mix of size, ball handling and offensive ability at a position thats always in demand. He's not nearly as can't miss as LeBron, but its 99% that the team that has the first pick will take him.  After that, the next 3 prospects, Green, Mobley, Suggs are all significantly better than the people ranked at 5 that people are confident in what the rough order will be. Those 4 guys, then others.  [Here's a link to a Mock Draft just for illustration purposes.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/6/17/22534812/nba-mock-draft-2021-lottery-order-first-round-cade-cunningham)  Teams do sometimes go rogue and pick players that aren't ranked that highly, but its relatively rare. The best example of a team drafting someone people didn't expect is [Anthony Bennett in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_NBA_draft), who was a massive disappointment. Its always easier to see that in retrospect though, as the 2013 draft also contained Giannis and Rudy Gobert, but no one had them going in the top 5."
"People read Mock drafts which help give an idea of who's going where in the draft, but it's still mainly speculation. In this draft Cade Cunningham is pretty clearly going to be the #1 pick, and Green, Mobley, and Sugs are the next ""tier"" of players and they could go pretty much in any order"
Cade Cunningham is just a good version of Ben Simmons tho
"Cade Cunningham is so good i somehow knew about him last year through the sub, he looks really good"
If we land Cade Cunningham tomorrow then why not trade Simmons for John Wall? It‚Äôs clear that Sixers need an actual point guard.   Christian Wood as your stretch center. Ben Simmons as your point forward. JaSean Tate as small forward. Cade Cunningham and Kevin Porter Jr as your guards. Young team. Simmons gets a clean slate and can get help from John Lucas. Stephen Silas can start with a younger core and hopefully develop the team into a real contender.
Cade Cunningham has the potential to be generational. This would be a criminal trade to make and there is no way any GM would do it except maybe Vlade Divac.
Imagine we get Cade and then some trade that lands us Simmons (like John wall)   Stretch Center Wood Point forward Simmons Small Forward Tate Guard Cunningham  Guard KPJ  Tell me that is not a scary fucking lineup.
Let‚Äôs cool our jets a bit.  Vegas has us at 8.3% chance of having Simmons on our team.    We have a better chance of Cade Cunningham being on our team.
Ben Simmons or Cade Cunningham who ya got
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
"After yet another abysmal playoff run it may be smart for the Sixers to consider offering Simmons and whatever else it takes for the rights to the #1 pick (Cade Cunningham). He may not be as tall, but he will shoot the ball."
"Simmons going to OKC and a 1st for Kemba and some seconds. Presti is gonna get him back into shape and flip him for the 2025 1st overall pick. 2024 okc lineup Cade Cunningham, sga, emoni bates, pokuMVP, Evan Mobley"
Too early to tell but I'm not high on Hayes. Halliburton is super nice though. The draft isn't the best draft to get an elite talent at 7 overall. I just want the Pistons to win the lottery to get Cade Cunningham.
He has. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs always like ‚Äúthe Houston rockets are enamored with Cade Cunningham‚Äù
"Christian Wood and Cade Cunningham by year 3 will be in the WCF, book it"
Christian Wood and Cade Cunningham is 3 years will be in the WCF I pray
"Right now I‚Äôm curious if the Magic will be the team that helps the Knicks move up, and if there‚Äôs the potential for any player trades if y‚Äôall end up with Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs.  Outside of that there are times where I legit forget that Miami isn‚Äôt the only team in Florida."
Add Cade Cunningham to this list when he‚Äôs drafted
Looks like the Thunder are gearing up to make a run and move up to draft  Cade Cunningham
"We have 2 rookies on All-Rookie teams, killian hayes, jerami grant, and Cade Cunningham."
"If they don't get #1 this year, trading half those picks to get Cade Cunningham probably worth it.  But with their luck, they'll probably have the #1 and #5 from the lottery."
"Depending on where the Thunder falls in the lottery, Cade Cunningham trade incoming. Possibly Houston and Detroit would fair way better collecting picks then drafting Cade number 1"
Pretty soon he'll be able to take second rounders with the first overall pick because he'll still be able to get Cade Cunningham outside of the top 10
"Cade Cunningham said he models his game after Middleton, man has a deep bag of moves and is a phenomenal 2 way player despite not being a top tier athlete (for NBA standards of course)"
Cade Cunningham says sup
I can‚Äôt wait till you guys get cade Cunningham and still enjoy another 7 years of pain
"Detroit quietly had a very good draft. If they can somehow get Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, or even Cade Cunningham in this draft, they‚Äôre set up for a bright future!"
&gt;Imagine graduating from a prestigious school at the top of your class and being told that your minimum salary is nearly a million dollars per season.   I'd actually be pretty pissed if I were a player like Cade Cunningham who would make significantly more if teams had to bid for him in an open market.
I agree the NBA is a monopoly but it's not as if the players aren't compensated. Imagine graduating from a prestigious school at the top of your class and being told that your minimum salary is nearly a million dollars per season. Not too shabby.   If you don't want to watch noncontending teams then don't. Personally I have enjoyed this season of Pistons basketball more than any since I realized SVG wasn't going to lead them anywhere but I also didn't watch as many games as I used to when I had League Pass.   Our team is building through the draft by picking up prospects on salary-restricted contracts to build a foundation that free agents will want to join to make us a contender. If our team lucks into being able to draft Cade Cunningham or another breakout star they will be that much farther along.  Sure there are superteams and I'd like to see that issue addressed by moving to a hard cap and removing the max salary but that doesn't mean the draft itself doesn't make the league better.
"Hey, the last two times we stared the proposed barrel of relocation to Seattle, we got the #1 overall pick, Cade Cunningham, come on down!"
"Wolves fan, what comes first? ‚ÄúBig Purr wants out‚Äù headline  ‚ÄúMalik Beasley gets out of jail‚Äù ‚ÄúCade Cunningham refuses to play in Minnesota‚Äù"
I think it's kind of a chicken egg situation. Top prospects leaving doesn't help but I'm not sure how much Cade Cunningham would get out of beating up inferior competition for a few more years. Players that play in foreign systems also seem to come over more NBA ready.  Even someone like Lamelo who's an American born prospect seems to have really benefited from playing in foreign pro leagues instead of college. I don't think the NBA would be investing so much money in the G league if they had faith in college programs and coaches developing players for free (from a NBA standpoint).
"""Cade Cunningham is claiming he will sit out if drafted by team in lottery""."
Cade Cunningham is reportedly unhappy with the team that is going to draft him and is already demanding a trade.
"It's not about getting the best player.   It's about getting the best situation.  Because they got no good players back they now have the worst record in the league and a real shot at Cade Cunningham.  Plus they can chase Holmgren and Bates in the next 2 drafts before bouncing back.  Because they only got draft picks back, they can do a hard reset and actually build a decent team, instead of hoping Ben Simmons can carry a bunch of bums.   Ben would have been just good enough to ruin their tank but he's so expensive they wouldn't have any cap space to properly build around him.  Plus, as this young core starts to improve, the Nets are going to start to fall apart, they aren't a long-term superteam. In 3-4 years the Rockets will start to get good picks to help flesh out the roster they just tanked for."
"This is the time to get in on the ground floor and support the Detroit Pistons.  It's a team with a pedigree of winning in its past (two well regarded eras:  The Bad Boys of the late 80s and the Going to Work team of the mid 2000s).  Both eras slayed giants.  And the new era coming up has #1 Cade Cunningham and a host of young budding players in their early 20s who will grow together.  Come on in, the water's warm!  D-EEE-TTTT-ROIIIIIITTTT BASKETBALL!!"
"I think he will improve, but the sheer amount of really good guards in the East is going to make that difficult. The East has:  Beal, Irving, Harden, Brown (G/F), Tatum (G/F), LaVine, Trae, FVV, Jimmy Butler, etc. And this isn't even including guys who are rookies or haven't been drafted yet. I'd honestly bet Cade Cunningham makes an ASG before White as of right now.  White would have to take serious leaps forward to make an ASG over the guys listed above."

All this just to lose to Cade Cunningham and Luka Garza
No many ppl even knew of cade Cunningham for years though..

Shit teams signing aging role players does not please me.   Source: Am fan of shit team that insists on paying aging role players.  Only we don't have Cade Cunningham to give us hope.
"Why would the Lakers count if that's where he was drafted. By your logic, Cade Cunningham has a 100% chance of being traded."
"I swear, mfs be trying to do a realistic simulation and next thing you know Kawhi is on the Pistons deferring to a rookie Cade Cunningham averaging a 30 point triple double."
"Definitely watch some historical clips over the years to watch how the game started and has developed. I personally recommend starting around the 80s and watching some highlights of the Celtics and Lakers match-ups, especially their finals match-ups. Detroit in the late '80s brought an overwhelming defensive presence to the game which changed things up a bit. Then of course you have to watch the greatness that was Michael Jordan in the 90s, the double three-peat.   After that you'll be caught up to the 2000s where things are a lot more current and familiar. Assuming you don't know but the Lakers (Shaq and Kobe) and San Antonio Spurs were the powerhouse teams in the early 2000s, followed by a power move by the Celtics in 08 to form ""the first"" ""Big Three."" I personally believe this move  by the Celtics is what has powered a lot of the motivation behind free agency/trades over the last decade plus. Around that same time was the rise of LeBron James, widely regarded as the second-best player (or best, depending who you are talking to) to Michael Jordan. LeBron James' move to the Miami Heat started his Finals dominance the last decade which was very entertaining to watch as he showed up in the Finals nine out of ten years from 2011-2020 with the Heat, Cavaliers, and now Lakers.   The Golden State Warriors rose as a titan in 2015 and began their reign, with Steph Curry greatly evolving the game by extending the expectations of 3 point shooting. Kevin Durant, regarded as the current second-best player to LeBron James in the NBA, joined the Warriors in 2016 and formed what was known as the ""Hampton Five"" - which was arguably the best line-up in the history of the NBA. Kevin Durant left the Warriors after 2019 for the Nets, which brings us to today's game (upcoming year) where there has been somewhat of a vacuum left by the Warriors from the last decade, in which several teams are in-contention (including the Warriors, I think) for the upcoming years to establish a new dynasty.   James Harden's trade from the Rockets to the Nets was regarded as the largest move last year and many expect Brooklyn to take home the championship in the next 1-2 years. It is a great time to get in the game as there are many young players on several teams who are still blossoming as the leaders of their franchises and are expected to join the ranks of the elite like Trae Young on the Hawks, Zion Williams on the Pelicans, and now you could say Cade Cunningham on the Pistons - while we are still watching the rise of other potential all-time greats like Giannis on the Bucks, Joel Embiid on the Sixers, and Luka Doncic on the Mavericks.  Great time to get into the sport and hope you enjoy it!"
Ok I am officially a Cade Cunningham hater now. Anyone who pronounces it JIF is wrong.
"1. Luka 2. Tatum 3. Giannis 4. Jokic 5. Some Prospect, Maybe Cade Cunningham?  Not high on zion due to his relatively below average defense, and lack of shooting. Also moved down jokic and giannis as they will be both 31/32 in 5 years time"
Wait until this dude hears about Cade Cunningham
Lol no wtf?? If Cade Cunningham has the career that Bogut did you think piston fans will be happy? YOUR expectations of a first overall pick are too low.
It's clear to me now after watching this why the Raptors took Scottie Barnes over Jalen Suggs he has a relationship with Cade Cunningham so if the pistons can't win with Cunningham build a decent team around him he will want to exit why not play with a former team mate. Raptors playing the long game.
"Sure, Cade Cunningham appears to have a higher ceiling than SGA. Then again, SGA has arguably already surpassed what people thought his ceiling was.   The point I‚Äôm making is that it doesn‚Äôt matter who the prospect is, they‚Äôre still a prospect. When you have a boatload of picks and literally one young player who can be a star, you don‚Äôt trade away your one young guy. Maybe if it‚Äôs a LeBron level prospect, but nobody is trading that pick."
I mean Cade Cunningham seems to have higher potential than SGA. The 3rd pick I agree would be a ridiculous trade though
I'm looking forward to that 2019 u19 USA team who *dominated* everyone in their tournament:  Tyler Halliburton   Jalen Green   Cade Cunningham   Jalen Suggs   Evan Mobley   Scottie Barnes  Those Suggs/Green and Halliburton/Green lineups were lethal.
"cade cunningham is easily the pig of the litter, but I think a few other guys will challenge him"
