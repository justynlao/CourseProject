"Ok first off, the portland trailblazers and Damian Lillard have a much better roster than the warriors right now. That's not a debate, the warriors have no depth.. Outside of their average starting five, they have one of the worst teams in the NBA.   So if we look at the team success so far, Steph Curry's warriors, who are a worse team than Lillard's blazers, are essentially tied in record (10-9,11-9). Don't underestimate that blazers team though. CJ McCollum is an all-star level player, he just hasn't had the appearances because the team he's on isn't usually high enough in the standings to warrant a #2 guy like McCollum to make it. Why are the blazers not usually higher in the standings then? It's not the coaching, Terry Stotts has built a great system. It's not the surrounding cast, the blazers have guys like Nurkic, Kanter, Trent Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Rodney Hood, and others in the past, etc... It's because Lillard is not good enough to push them to the next level. It's not always as easy as just putting up the numbers. It's the same reason why Harden, who puts up crazy numbers, hasn't had much team success. Both are not as efficient and don't affect the game in different enough ways to make up for that, unlike a guy like Lebron who does everything, or KD &amp; Curry who are extremely efficient."
"GSW has a good record of making ass players look like solid role players.  Ian Clark, Quinn Cook, Damian Jones, Patrick McCaw, Mckinnie  Playing with Steph/Dray/KD must be nice"
Damian Jones/anyone
Intriguing. Only a deal if you take Damian Jones back
Frank was never a solid role player for us he’s our 3rd center. We resigned him because Damian Jones is horrendous
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
mike scott was ejected for this. yes lebron should have been removed.  https://twitter.com/DefPenHoops/status/1188981931729395712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1188981931729395712%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fsixers-video-mike-scott-ejected-for-chest-bump-hawks-damian-jones%2F
"???? Why would you randomly bring up damion lee when there are so many other players from the warriors who have never really worked out? You act like GSW can develop everyone.   “These guys are only busting because the players suck.” So what’s the excuse for Kevon Looney, Damian Jones, Patrick McCaw, Jacob Evans, and Jordan Bell? All draft picks for the Warriors that never amounted to anything."
"Im pretty sure at one point last year I had to watch a lineup of Jeff Teague, Vince carter, Deandre Bembry, Bruno Fernando, and Damian Jones"
"How tf is he less Impactful than those guys so far? He’s been legit 1 of 2 additions to this team from last year that have actually played any minutes. This current team we’ve been playing with most of the season is just last years team, but instead of Bembry, it’s Bogdan, and instead of Damian Jones/Dedmon, it’s Capela. Capela has almost single handedly lifted our defense from 2nd worst in the league and one of the worst of all time, to a top 5-10 defense this season so far.  We are just funneling everyone to the rim and they’re getting stuffed, or heavily contested AND he nearly always grabs the rebound after his own contest. Idk how he does it, but he always ends up with the rebound. We were the worst rebounding team in the league last year, were the best this year."
"We were due for a good one after Jordan Poole, Pat McCaw, Festus Ezeli, Jacob Evans, Damian Jones, and Nemanja Nedovic. Granted those were all late 1st rounders and we hadn't had a lotto pick since Harrison Barnes, but not a great track record considering some of the gems we missed out on. Paschall was the only hit since the Draymond Green pick"
Hey that's 2x NBA Champion Damian Jones to you
"Hey now, Damian Jones is actually on a team, which is more than can be said for Alex Len and Dewayne Dedmoney."
"Suns need a center, Saric is our backup center right now. Kaminsky and Damian Jones sucks"
"Just checked, he’s averaging more fouls (1.8) than points (1.6). Good ol Damian Jones. Surprised teams are still giving him chances, he’s probably not good enough to start for most g-league teams."
Damian Jones is in the Suns now? how's he been playing
Yeah Solomon Hill and Tony Snell and co may not be great but still better than Damian Jones and Vince Carters corpse lol
Bob Myers missed on every player transaction in 2017 and 2018. Had Danuel House on the roster. Cut him. Had Javale. Let him walk so he could keep his pet project Damian Jones. Bad move after bad move by Bob
Beal was about to end Damian Jones' careeer god damn.
"Take your bets, which quarter will Damian Jones foul out in?"
"They didnt have the roster space for Boucher, they handed out too may guaranteed deals and couldnt move away from Damian Jones or Jordan Bell fast enough. They gambled that teams would still be hesitant about his knee injury  For Nunn, he didnt want to wait a year and then play behind Steph, Klay, and(at the time) Andre. Miami offered him a deal and a big role right after training camp"
I meant more this far into the season last year. Solomon Hill is way better than Damian Jones lol and we dont have Vince Carters corpse clogging up 20+ minutes. Dont get me wrong we SUCK but last year was a special suck i doubt we see again soon.
I forgot all about Damian Jones! At least he got two NBA final rings sitting at home.
"If you told me then that Boucher would be the brightest light outta him, Jordan Bell, Pat McCaw and Damian Jones, I would have looked at you like you were  shirtless and horned in the Capitol building"

Way better than Frank Kaminsky and especially Damian Jones so no
Damian Jones is way worse
"Yeah people forget there are still 3rd string centers like Cristiano Felicio, Wily Hernangomez, and Damian Jones still hanging around the league"
It’s especially refreshing cuz we don’t have to watch Damian Jones and Alex Len anymore😂
Obviously Damian Jones. No one fouls out at such an elite level.
"Honestly, I feel like that's an extra weird part for the Suns is that we've had a lot of player change as well.  I thought we were going to come off to a **WAY** slower start, because it takes time to build chemistry and we don't have the usual training camp this year.  * **Starters**    * Returning: Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges\*, Deandre Ayton    * New: Chris Paul, Jae Crowder * **Bench w/ 4+ GP**    * Returning: Cam Johnson,  Jevon Carter, Frank Kaminsky    * New: Langston Galloway, Damian Jones    * In-Between: Cam Payne\*\* * **Bench w/ 3- GP**    * Returning: Saric (2 GP)    * New: Jalen Smith (2 GP), E'Twaun Moore (1 GP), Ty-Shon Alexander (2 GP) * ***Notes***    * *(\*) Mikal noted as he started less than 50% of our games last year despite playing starter minutes*       * *Ayton not noted as the same as his lack of starting was due to Suspension.*    * *(\*\*) Cam Payne noted as in-between since we picked him up before the bubble.  Due to the chemistry we built in the bubble, I initially marked him as 'Returning', but think it's best to give him his own category as he was only with the team during the Bubble.*  Before we ended up grabbing Kaminsky after the Kings cut him, 50% of our roster is new (not including Payne.)  I think that the whole team deserves a fuckload of credit for making it work... Monty and CP3 for obvious reasons, but also the new guys for putting in the work and the returning players for helping bring them up to speed.  All that said, even though we're 5-1, it is clear that we're still trying to get our bearings as a team.  Mikal and Cam Johnson have been absolutely balling their fucking minds out as well as Payne this entire season -- and while their defense will stay, their shots will have to come down to earth, and then it will become more clear where our team is still needing to mesh.  * Mikal Bridges: 15.3 PPG on 53/50/100 Shooting Splits * Cam Johnson: 13.5 PPG on 52/43/100 Shoot Splits * Cam Payne: 8.5 PPG on 51/47/100 Shooting Splits  Where you'll start to see us struggle soon is going to be in comebacks.  The Suns strength is in dictating the pace of the game, and huge shoutout to Monty for this.  We're #30 in Pace, helping us to stay fresh while moving the ball around frequently for open shots.  In contrast, when we start trying to play too quickly, we turn the ball over frequently and get into offensive foul trouble.  It's honestly kind of Grizzlies-esque how they used to play with the Conley/Z-Bo/Gasol core with Tony Allen and various other role players.  Rather than being the 7SOL Suns, we're kind of the Grit &amp; Grind Suns with a 3-ball lol.  The secondary part that you'll see us start to struggle is when the 3 above-mentioned players have their shooting percentages come down to reasonable.  They are good shooters, but those are not sustainable splits... and our Offensive Rebounding Rate is 22nd in the NBA.  **We simply do not crash the offensive glass**, and this **will** hurt us when we start missing."
Definitely. You could see this coming from how they played last year. Getting rid of Damian Jones adds so much to your net rating.
Ayton staying out of foul trouble will be huge with Dario out today. Don’t want to see too much Kaminsky and definitely not much Damian Jones
"so is rajon rondo better than all because he and the lakers won a lot last season? trae young is clearly the better player. the question is whos the better player not whose team is winning the most.  trae and the hawks literally almost beat the nets the other day and are 3-1 this season. id love to see what jamal murray could do in a team of damian jones, deandre bembry, 40 year old vince carter, and a bunch of rookies.   trae became an all star with that team. murrays with the way better team, has he ever been an all star? i mean wins over stats right?"
"I mean, they had to start Damian Jones, but sure... the refs are the reason they lost"
No he was not. I swear y’all love to hate on people for no reason at all. Damian Jones has forgotten more basketball than you will ever know
"In the other thread they’re unironically telling me he played well. Bro, it’s Damian Jones. Playing well is if he puts on his uniform correctly."
Hold up... y’all started Damian Jones? Oof
Gobert is literally Damian Jones playing 30 min a game ^^^^^/s
"'Cause the FO got over confident. I was mad when it happened. Let's be real, Kostas, Cacok, McKinnie, Cook (before he got waived) were never gonna get real minutes during the playoffs. You know who could? Dwight. Why the fuck did we even care about developing these guys (who aren't even good prospects by any means) when we have a great shot at a repeat?  Instead we thought we had enough with Marc, AD (sometimes), and Trez. Marc gets into foul trouble, AD's hurt, and Trez is undersized. Whoop-di-do we now waive Cook and sign Damian Jones. And bless Jones for his hustle but he's an obvious downgrade from Dwight. This move about as noticeable an ""our bad"" as anything by the FO."
I'm sold on Damian Jones
"Damian Jones has looked about as solid as you can on a 10-day contract. Gotten lost on defense a bit but that makes sense when he doesn’t know the scheme. But he’s hustled and set good screens, and that vertical spacing is a good option"
Damian Jones starting nice
"Biased take... Rob Pelinka? Kinda obvious if you think about it.   Lost McGee, Dwight, Rondo, Avery Bradley, and Danny Green.   Gained Trez, Gasol, Schröder, Wesley Matthews  Drafted Talen Horton Tucker who has broken out for us   Recently signed Damian Jones who has been doing really well"
"True, but if a player racks them up quickly, like Jones is wont to do, you risk putting a team in the bonus early in the quarter.  With crafty players like CP3 and Saric, or slashers like Nader and Bridges, you could end up gifting them a ton of trips to the line.  That's obviously a benefit to the opponent because those are easy points, but another benefit some fans don't consider about getting to the line is that you also then remove the ability for the other team to get transition buckets and catch defenses out of position due to missed shots.    So yeah, you let Damian Jones go in and commit 3 fouls in 2 minutes (seen him do it) with 10 minutes left in a quarter and boom - you could fuck yourself."
We failed our other attempt to sabotage on Damian Jones.  He seems like he wants revenge.
"They should've started Damian Jones at center and let Trez come off the bench. I know he's brand new to the team and is foul prone, but would've been a more natural match up with the Suns big man rotation."
The Suns were mostly fully healthy though I think right? Booker got thrown out after 25 minutes but the Suns already had a nice little lead up until then.   Lakers were missing AD/Kuzma/Gasol and Caruso left the game early.  This is definitely a game that the Suns should’ve won imo. It would’ve really stung for them to lose a game where Dudley/Damian Jones combine for 20 mins.
Kuzma was having a really good season up until he had to step up after AD left. He’s a good defender now and he moves well off the ball. His shot creation skills are still meh though.   Gasol has looked wash some games and in others he looks like a 7ft sniper with passing ability.   Jared Dudley/Morris/Damian Jones arent all playoff rotational players though. No matter what you think of Kuz/Gasol they’re a massive step up from those guys.
Im just mad that they argued Damian Jones extendin his leg on a possibly illegal screen is the same as Booker intentionally yanking on KCP's ankle and tripping him badly  Booker then bitched on that call even tho he got off easy with no flagrant. Smug ass
surprised they didn't start the game with Damian Jones. Let Trez come off the bench and matchup with Saric.
"I assume they didn't assign a flagrant because Damian Jones stuck his leg out and they missed it.  Both were pretty clearly intentional, but Booker's was worse and I'm still surprised they didn't call it."
Damian Jones revenge game
"Damian Jones grabbed booker’s ankle and intentionally pulled it to trip him?  Must have missed that, you can post the clip if you want"
Because Damian Jones tripped Book first
At the very least Damian Jones has probably earned a 2nd 10-day contract
If Damian Jones can get like 5 pts 2 blocks that's pretty much Javale or Dwight production from last year
I hope Damian Jones gets that bag
Damian Jones skrong
Damian Jones a tall muhfucka
I really hope Damian Jones finds a place in the NBA. Glad the Lakers gave him a chance.
Damian Jones is doing his job of being a tall guy who can lob and block sometimes.
Damian Jones keep playing like this
am I trippin or was Damian Jones not nearly that tall when he was on the Warriors? Dude looks enormous
is this going to be the Damian Jones revenge game
"Damian Jones block, nice"
I like Damian Jones.
The Damian Jones revenge tour continues
#DAMIAN JONES IS BACK YALL
Damian Jones revenge game against the Suns let’s go
#LOOK AT DAMIAN JONES MAN
I know Damian Jones is a bad player but I'd rather see him out there than Dudley.
So is Damian Jones not gonna play?
The Damian Jones equivalent of a revenge game is when he fouls out in 15 minutes instead of 5.
Damian Jones revenge game (*i hope)*
Damian Jones time
Damian Jones revenge game?
Trez is probably going to be fine but if damian Jones gets big minutes it might be rough
Damian Jones boutta drop 12
I'm guessing trez starting and Damian jones backing him up.  Lol.
"Well, we did just waive Damian Jones"
"I went to check, ever since 2012 (when they picked Barnes, Ezeli and Draymond) they had:  \- 2 consecutive drafts when they didn't pick, 3 in total.  \- Looney at 30th pick in '15, solid pick that they developed well.  \- Damian Jones at 30th in '16, got outplayed by Looney and traded, still playing a bit with the Suns, doubt he's long in the NBA, but who knows.  \- Jacob Evans at 28th in '18, he was there, couldn't get his minutes behind Klay and Iguoadala, even with McCaw gone, he's not in the league anymore it seems.  \- Poole at 28th and Pascall at 41st in '19, both solid picks, I like Pascall more and he can develop into a solid role player, maybe a starter in a team weak on the forward position, still too early to tell.  And then this year with Wiseman and two second rounders, it seems that the Dubs haven't drafted too much in the last 9 years and what they did pick was solid enough, they had to pick cleared FA and G-leaguers though and even those fulfilled their roles decently."
Will the a lakers introduce Damian Jones tonight?
I will never forget Damian Jones fouling out in a summer league game as a fourth year player
Someone who recognizes that no one cares about Damian Jones.
I may have found the only Damian Jones stan on earth lmao
&gt; body outside of Lakers fans (maybe not even some of them) care about Damian Jones signing a 10 day contract with the Lakers. Which is why I tagged the sub  the hate is real lmao
"I’m gonna be honest with you, nobody outside of Lakers fans (maybe not even some of them) care about Damian Jones signing a 10 day contract with the Lakers. Which is why I tagged the sub"
"Damian Jones is a solid end of bench player. He will bring much of what McGee brought. He’s long, athletic and runs the court well. He doesn’t ask for post ups and usually will pick up points off put backs or cuts. He’s a good help side defender with blocks. Not a bad pick up."
"I'd give anyone a chance, but this kid just can't play the game of basketball. Monty used him once after Ayton and Saric got in foul trouble. Damian Jones literally fouled out with 6 fouls within 6 minutes on the floor."
We really could've kept Dwight and now we're experimenting with Damian Jones. Big oof.
"Bro stop changing the subject you said “Its that the game was TIED after the first half even though Steph had 0 and Harden/CP3 were both going off.  Because the Curry has always had the most help.” A lot of help in guys out or barely in the league in Alfonzo Mckinnie, Bogut, Jordan Bell, Livingston, Damian Jones, Jerebko, etc LOL"
Damian Jones and Jordan Bell have started too.
"Yeah, it’s wild. A failure that took 4 years of fuck ups to come rearing its ugly head. I don’t mind that we got Bogut considering Cousins got injured and even when he was healthy, he wasn’t great on defense. But our priorities were all fucked when it came to roster building. Not once in the Kerr years have we had a genuine shot creator as a backup point guard. Andre and Livingston shared ball-handling duties, but Livingston only hunted shots in the post and Andre was a reluctant shooter. Quinn Cook looked really good when he came up after a Curry injury and was running pick and rolls and bombing off of the dribble and then... he never got to play that role again. And then factor in picking Jones in 2016 and Evans in 2018. Yeesh. The 2016-17 roster is also pretty fucking nuts and I think gives a window into the organization’s priorities. At one point we carried the following centers: Zaza, David West, Javale, Looney, Damian Jones, McAdoo, and Varejao. We eventually cut Varejao for Matt Barnes but we literally had 6 C’s on the roster!!! And only three of them were playable in the playoffs. The next year, we eventually trimmed the C rotation down to Looney and Bell by the WCF. I understand the value of having a vet C to soak up minutes and have been advocating the Warriors do that this year for Wiseman and Draymond’s health, but Jesus fuck. You’re telling me that McAdoo’s roster spot couldn’t have been used to find a cheap wing to develop on a multi year minimum deal?"
"Fuck you mean? Booker obviously a scrub for not making the playoffs having Isiah Canaan as his STARTING PG going into the season, the rest of the roster made up entirely of projects, waaay over the hill verterans and g-league level players.  People in this sub seriously underrate how godawful a GM Ryan McDonough was and how much James Jones has improved the roster. We used to have like maybe 3-5 NBA level players, now (that Damian Jones is gone) it's the entire roster. We literally have one of the deepest roster in the league and that's with our #10 pick being sent to the G-league bubble after catching Covid."
"I don't really think Sauce was the reason we were 22-60, nor do I think swapping Damian Jones for Big Sauce will incur such a drastic decrease in team performance lol"
He only plays half decent against end of bench scrubs.  Damian Jones is very bad
Probably better than Damian Jones tbh. Though I think Boogie and CP3 might not like each other.
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
Damian Jones is pretty bad
"I actually haven't once referenced owners in any of these comments, I certainly haven't expressed any sympathy for them.  I'm a fan of the Suns. For that reason, I'm glad they have the contractually granted power to sit Damian Jones for every game for the rest of eternity, and I don't feel the least bit bad for him that he's being so terribly mistreated."
Jordan Poole Jacob Evens Damian Jones Kevon Looney  WHAT???
Damian Jones he is the worst player in the league provides nothing to the team. No one knows how he still on the team he must be related to James Jones
Some team should sign both him and Damian Jones
Clearly not watching this team enough to have a valid opinion if you bringing Damian Jones into this conversation.

Warriors dropped him for Damian Jones.
"Lakers are better, they've just not been healthy this year.  AD hasn't played since early Feb, and even then was playing semi-injured.  They also had a stretch of weeks without Gasol so their only centers was undersized Harrell then Damian Jones on a 10 day contract lol.  They also had another stretch where both AD and Shroder were gone, the latter due to covid.  Now they have LeBron gone.  They've added Drummond and he immediately gets injured.  They're now 5th in the west.  Fully healthy this Lakers team should be very difficult to defend while having the best defense in the league."
" Because he does what his needs him to. Last year he played as a roll guy  when Ad was on the bench. Lebron would be the screen partner for Rondo/Caruso and either pop or roll: https://streamable.com/5v26bb  But when Ad is back on the court Lebron goes back to being the pnr ball handler. That's because Ad can't be a pnr ball handler while Lebron can play either role. It's easier to find elite roll options (Ad, Harrell, Javale, Dwight, even Damian Jones etc.) than elite pick and roll ball handlers of which there are only a couple in the league (Lebron, Harden, Luka, Steph, Dame)."
Cue sad Damian Jones noises
I mean Dedmond is solid too but Damian Jones was really good in his role for us. Would’ve resigned him for the year if not for Drummond
damian jones has had a job all season and dedmon hasn’t. really an enigma
In this video he looks even more like a worse version of Damian Jones.
"Love the ""he speaks Mandarin, he will be able to figure out basketball"" crowd. Just like engineer Damian Jones figured it out."
not really following the point you are trying to make.  He has played predominantly at the 4 most years except last year when we had no other options at the 5 because Len and Dedmon were both shit and well Bruno is Bruno and Damian Jones is idk what but not an nba player.  He really hasn't played a ton at the 5 this year other than when we go very offensive with our lineup or when Clint was hurt to start the season.  JC has been slightly below average his rookie season defensively at the 4 to he is now more than serviceable at the 4.  He just cant play the 5 especially against teams with capable bigs
"Would have still been an improvement from last year's bigs lol.  Alex Len Damian Jones Jabari Parker, occasionally"
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."
and he actually was on every team in the Southwest- all four CA teams and Phoenix... which Damian Jones is only one team away from doing himself. Just needs to find a way on the Clippers
Oh no now were in trouble they signed DAMIAN JONES
"Jordan Poole like like he will be a legit scoring guard off the bench.   Warriors haven't started 10 players in five years either...  2015 was Looney with the 30th, he worked himself into a reliable rotation player.  2016 was Damian Jones, a raw, athletic center prone to fouling. Probably won't be in the league much longer.  2018 was Jacob Evans with the 28th pick, he never worked out.   2019 was Eric Paschall, someone who may not quite fit this roster but was a steal with the 41st pick and was all rookie first team.  That year was also when they selected Jordan Poole who looks like he will be a legit player. 28th pick.  Then of course 2020's #2, James Wiseman, who isn't very good but as a young, raw big man that's kind of expected. I believe he will be a great player.  They only had late 2nd round picks that year but Mannion already has given some ball handler minutes off the bench and Justinian Jessup is doing well in Australia.  It's rare to draft great players when you draft really low and expect for 2020 the Warriors have drafted really low. Despite that I think they've done well.  Also while Curry was a gift from the departing ownership/Larry Riley it was the new ownership and front office who drafted with better picks. Who did they select?  Klay Thompson with the 11th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th, Draymond Green with the 35th and Festus Ezeli with the 30th.  Stacked up against any other team during the last ten years I think the Warriors have drafted much better than average."
"Klay was drafted in 2011, Lacob &amp; Co bought the team in 2010  As for role players, we got Paschall and Poole in the 2nd round who are already contributing in their sophomore years. Drafted Ezeli who was solid before his injury in 2012. Jury is still out on Nico Mannion &amp; Justinian Jessup but they both show promise as well. And even some the players that didnt work out like Jordan Bell, McCaw, and Damian Jones still showed flashes of being a solid NBA player which may not seem like much but many players picked in their range dont even see the court let alone contribute a solid 10-15 minutes  Besides why are you acting like its some sort of failure of the Warriors FO for not hitting on every late draft pick? Picking past the high lottery its a crapshoot and most picks dont end up panning out, so the Warriors draft haul under Lacob has actually been pretty good."
Damian Jones can also jump.
"Why did Lakers give up Dwight *and* McGee? We already fucked up losing Brook Lopez for nothing. Now we're trying all we can to replace a piece we already had with Marc, Damian Jones, and Andre but with much worse luck."
"You mean Lee, Damian Jones is an unsigned C, but I get what you mean lol.  Poole and Lee would be fine in a Harden offense (though Poole is actually better on-ball than he has been on catch and shoot).  Wiggins and Oubre really aren’t great cutters, they haven’t been great off-ball in general which is the part of the problem for the offense."
I mean I think LEBRON is better than RAPTOR. RAPM is also useless on a one year sample. But in general defensive analytics are just ass so its really a useless convo here tbh lol.  Wiggins and Oubre are good cutters to the rim are they not? Even Damian Jones and Poole can hit open shots.
"The Lakers: Drummond 279, Gasol 255, Davis 253, Lebron 250, Damian Jones 245"
"Damian Jones looked like Prime DeAndre Jordan with LeBron, Drummond will be fine."
"They had that man Damian Jones shoot 94% from the field in 8 games, Drummond will be fine"
Not sure how you could say this when your team had both Jordan Bell and Damian Jones. They probably jumped at the word pumpfake in this comment thread already.
Steve Kerr spent that whole series whipping his dick around doing shit like starting Damian Jones. Warriors were all banged up and slept walked through every first half.....and yet a sweep. Lou Williams and Danilo Gallinari could take 2 games vs a healthy Warriors team but Portland couldn’t even get one   Portland benefitted from a favorable draw to make that conference final then just got swept as the Warriors flagrantly disrespected them with an undermanned squad. So yeah all that series did was highlight what a non contender Portland was
Almost on Damian Jones level
the damian jones special
"Drummond, we were starting Cacok and Damian Jones at center."
damian jones was starting a few games for lakers..
What he actually needs to be is better than Damian Jones. I actually thought Damian Jones was fine.
Why not Damian Jones?
We were starting damian Jones last week bro
Most of them think Damian Jones is better than Gasol.
Anthony Edwards is a dud and Damian Jones or Trezz can't stop KAT. I'll take the W.
"Damian Jones is playing decent, better than I expected for a 10-day contract.   Lakers still have to let him go so they can shop the buyout market, but if they can't sign a good veteran center (like Drummond), I could see them signing Damian Jones for the rest of the season and focusing on 3-point shooting for their last roster spot."
The great thing is that Vogel has kept the rotation the same.  With AD and Schroder out for a while he didnt throw Trez or Kuz into starter roles.  He kept them on the bench to get comfortable in that role.  Damian Jones is starting over Trez even tho Jones wont even get playing time in the playoffs.  Once AD comes back he just seamlessly goes back to the starting role and everyone else fits perfectly.
Damian Jones with 8 points on 3 of 3 in 16:32 minutes. Not too shabby.
"I was told Damian Jones is one of the worst players in the league, he ain’t Shaq but I’ve been pleasantly surprised with his play."
I was here to witness prime Damian Jones
"&gt;I'm talking about the fact that the Lakers are so deep even with multiple guys out they can still put out quality players most teams in the league couldn't if they were in the same situation.  Sure, right.  Guys like recently-cut Damian Jones, who any team in the league could have signed.  Wait, no, that's not right.  &gt; Being a casual is one thing but being an ignorant casual is just a bad look for you.    Well, luckily for me, I didn't wear that look.  What, exactly, were you looking like when you claimed that McKinnie only played because the game was a blowout, at that point?  &gt; Lakers are an all time deep team.   They have 3 players who have ever even made an All-Star team -- and two of them are 36 years old.  That is not in any way historic.  Even when healthy, they are playing Wesley Matthews 20 minutes a night, despite him being the 2nd-oldest small player in the league, and one of the worst regular players of any size.  That is not ""all-time"" deep.  Even when healthy, they are playing undrafted Alex Caruso 20 minutes a night, and he's arguably their second-best player.  Again, not ""all-time"" depth.  Even when healthy, they are playing 20 year-old 2nd-round pick Horton-Tucker -- veteran of 41 NBA games -- 18 minutes a game.  Still more evidence of lacking ""all-time"" depth.  Since you seem to have no concept of what that term means, here is an example.  The 1985 Lakers had ""all-time"" depth.  Specifically, they started two of the best players ever at their respective positions, plus a Top 50 all-timer.  Off the bench, they brought a Hall-of-Fame 3-time scoring champ and ex-MVP, another Hall of Famer, plus an additional player who is currently on the ballot for the Hall, plus at least 3 other very competent NBA players who started for significant portions of their careers on Championship teams.  That's what ""all-time"" depth looks like."
Dennis Schrodinger's lob: simultaneously both a floater and a lob for Damian Jones (but definitely not for AD)
"He just shot 100  percent on your ass, show some respect to damian jones"
"wtf. this whole thing started because   &gt;Hes better than Wiseman lmao   then you answered   &gt;Great hes better than a rookie. He's still not good. His size is important for the Lakers right now though given their situation. I'm not saying it was a bad signing but he is not a good player thus far in his career  and i'm saying that relatively, based on what GSW are expecting from Wiseman and what the Lakers are expecting from Damian Jones. He's better than Wiseman  then you answer   &gt;I'm not arguing anything about Wiseman lol.  lol"
the lakers aren't betting their future on Damian Jones though.
you put some respect on damian jones name god dammit
don't disrespect the 2x champion Damian Jones
Damian Jones is nice
"Not gonna lie, LaMelo and Steph in the back court would be super fun. Just throw Damian Jones at center or some shit lol."
wiseman is a poor mans damian jones
Damian Jones is outplaying a 2nd pick
Damn everyone is dunking from lakers.  LeBron kuzma Harrell tht and Damian Jones destroyed the rim
Wiseman could one day be Damian Jones
is it me or has damian jones been serviceable?
The Lakers have Damian Jones hahahaha
"How many ex-warriors are on the Lakers? Damian Jones, McKinnie.. is Cook still there?"
damian jones
"Whiteside would be a great fit. Really anyone but Damian Jones who can't rebound, makes dumb mistakes and is foul happy. We need rebounding and someone that can play average defense. I think Drummond or Whiteside are the best guys for that, and if they can catch a lob, even better. We just need a big who does two things for 15-20 a night."
"Also melo is a short version of his full name, jordan is an entire last name. It would be like talking about Damian Jones and calling him Dame."
"Lmao I forgot you guys are playing Damian Jones  I take that back, Gasol might be pretty important"
He is and has been a huge loss. We have zero interior defense right now between Harrell and Damian Jones...
"Recently Gasol's been playing better, not a world beater or anything but he was fitting the system more. I like him better than Damian Jones."
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
Ayo wtf I didn’t even realize Damian Jones was still in the league. I mean he was young but we never really were able to help him grow
"Slow down, he's no Damian Jones."
"I mean yeah, he’s the reigning 6MOTY. 3rd best player on the defending champs.  Not really sure what you’re trying to argue here.  When he was out we literally had two offensive threats, LeBron and Kuzma, and only one of them can dribble.   And we’re starting Damian Jones rn since Gasol is out with COVID. So yeah, it’s pretty obvious why we’re losing games."
But against Damian Jones? There's a reason the guy wasn't playing pro ball until the Lakers signed him to 2 10-days to get through that period. Though tbf Trezz and Bron bothered him more than Jones.
"Brogdon &amp; Sabonis is all there is on offense tho. When its not them its TJ McConnell &amp; McDermott trying to do way too much. Inexcusable that Turner did nothing offensively against a Lakers team who had nobody taller than 6'10"" besides the 15 terrible minutes Damian Jones gave them. Getting LeVert &amp; Warren will be huge for this team offensively."
"&gt;It is pushing it, but if LeBron can't carry without AD  We were 7-1 without just AD but lost like 4 straight without AD and Schröder. Also Gasol is out rn so we’re starting Damian Jones so that’s hard too.  I think it’s still possible but he needs to come back early and have a few big games."
lol the only other frontcourt players we have rn is trez and damian jones
We had a center rotation of Trezz &amp; Damian Jones going up vs. Sabonis &amp; Turner and held the Pacers to 12 points under their season average. This defense is awesome. Clamped Brogdon late also.
Yes Dwight Howard &gt; Damian Jones
Damian Jones just getting abused
"Anyone have some more input on Damian Jones &amp; setting screens? I’m not sure if it’s because he hurt his back during a game a couple of weeks ago, but it seems like he avoids making contact &amp; holding his screens right now."
Damian Jones going for 50 😤😤
"On the margins, healthy this team can go at anyone. An athletic big &amp; a reliable shooter would be nice, but its not the end of the world if we end up with Damian Jones &amp; Kyle Korver instead of Andre Drummond &amp; Otto Porter."
We got damian jones now instead of dwight.  And dwight wanted to stay even in a vet minimum deal.  Sadge
"Really? Admittedly, I don't have a counter-example to offer up as a better place for LMA to end up, but the Lakers don't seem like a team which needs Aldridge. If the Lakers need a center, it seems like they need someone who can fill the McGee/Howard role from last year as a full-sized center who can provide some vertical spacing. Aldridge doesn't provide those things. I'm not saying Damian Jones is the solution for the Lakers, but he's a closer fit *in theory*, albeit nowhere near as good as Javale or Dwight."
"Given that the dubs have only drafted from picks 28 and lower since 2015...I think he's at a 50% hit rate for late 1st round + 2nd rounders which is pretty good IMO. He's hit Looney (30th) and Paschall (first team all rookie last year) with Damian Jones and Jacob Evans being busts. I won't include Jordan Poole (too early, he was looking like a bust early on but has looked like a real contributor at the end of last year + flashes this year) nor this year's draft."
No you don’t understand Javale McGee and Damian Jones are actually better defenders because they block more shots
"Not to mention JC was out 20+ games, injury and suspension Traea first two years. Like come on people this is ridiculous. WE WERE STARTING ALEX LEN AND DAMIAN JONES"
Who needs that bum Curry when you got Damian Jones
"Is this our new enforcer? First it was Dahntay Jones, now Damian Jones, so is Jon Bones Jones next?"
"Come on man, Damian Jones isn’t getting less calls because he’s on the Lakers."
Saw him at the club in SF the night before a NBA Finals game. We asked him “What’re you doing? Get rest for the game tomorrow!”   He said “You know that I’m not playing tomorrow” and then took a shot.   Welcome back Damian Jones.
Specifically new players you guys add. It seems like every single time a new player joins your team no matter how bad they were on their previous team you guys are hyped as fuck about them. I looked on your sub right after signing Damian Jones and without even seeing him play in a Lakers uniform you guys were so pumped to have him despite his horrible performance with us. I admire the optimism but it seems like you guys give every single incoming player the benefit of the doubt
"I haven’t seen him on the Lakers, but I’ll be damned if this is true. I’ve never seen a worse defender at the center position than Damian Jones."
Hawks fan who has seen way too much Damian Jones for a lifetime: this guy sucks ass
"Damian Jones had the physical gifts but never seemed to develop a feel for the game. He fouled way too much. He also unfortunately suffered a couple pec tears.   I hope he makes it in the league, seemed like a nice kid."
"The Lakers are trying out Jones because he's athletic and a vertical threat around the rim on offence, much like JaVale and Dwight were last year. Cousins is more like Gasol in terms of athleticism, but a worse defender, worse 3-pt shooter, and worse team presence.  I don't think the Lakers are going to end up signing Damian Jones, but rather they're trying him out to see whether it's worth making a larger move to acquire a vertical threat through trade or buy-out."
Haven’t seen 1 play he was involved in that refs let him off.  I promise you the refs aren’t giving special treatment to 10-day contract Damian Jones
I think of Damian Jones when I think of Wiseman’s progress to date. I’m glad Dubs got Wiseman.
"He played a role in 18-19 because of circumstance, not because he was good. Cousins and Bogut couldn’t stay healthy. Damian Jones and Bell played comparable minutes to him when they were healthy (bell played a bit less though to be fair.)"
“is harden really better than damian jones? 1 of them has rings”
"Taurean prince going from pretty good to falling off a cliff, fucking Jalen Adams, JEREMY LIN (lest we forget), the living meme deyonta Davis. Allen Crabbe existed for a moment in time and we were actually excited to get him too lmao, who else? Fucking Damian Jones who is maybe the worst player I’ve ever seen in the nba, Tyrone Wallace, CHARLIE BROWN JR.   YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN LADS"
Didn’t you guys start damian jones for a while?
"I think Drummond's preference would have been to get traded to a team that wanted to re-sign him, but since that didn't happen his choices were either stay on the bench behind Allen in Cleveland and miss the playoffs, sign with Brooklyn who at the time had DAJ, Claxton, LMA and Blake to play center minutes, or go to the Lakers who were missing Gasol due to Covid, who didn't have AD playing and were looking for a starting center (having recently started 10 day player Damian Jones and G-League player Devontae Cacok). It was probably an easy choice for Drummond.   It was an easy choice for the Lakers as well, as they needed a short time starting big while AD and Gasol were out, and if Drummond played great and became the clear starter, then that's a bonus. If not then eventually they'd have Gasol and AD back. So for a prorated minimum Drummond was a guy with more potential upside than Damian Jones.   Where do you think Drummond should have gone? There wasn't some magical situation out there for him where he'd get a lot of playing time and exposure to showcase himself for free agency. This was pretty much it."
Lamelo is a more athletic Luka. Luka is a shorter Jokic. Jokic is a Brook Lopez with passing. Brook Lopez is a Robin Lopez that's not crazy. Robin Lopez is Damian Jones with a hook shot. So basically Lamelo is Damian Jones with some non essential addons
No i get the bench is why we almost lost (Lou/Solo fucking suck) but its just like... Trae wasn't doin anybody favors for a stretch there in the 4th lol. Our offense is talented enough now to where its like.. trae you arent playin with evan turner Damian Jones and Jabari parker anymore. there are better options than the 34 foot bomb with 15 seconds left on the shot clock!!  not even to mention the gimme layup he blew with a minute left but like w/e he cant make em all
Damian Jones is without question a more valuable basketball player. For the lakers sake they better figure out this guy is a net negative
Maybe the Lakers should've just kept Damian Jones. At least he won't get mad at being benched
"This is revisionist man, the Warriors had McKinnie &amp; Bell starting the games 😭 Damian Jones started game 3! Klay didn’t even play well, shot 38% for the series, Iggy didn’t play the last 1.5 games....not to mention the 17 point deficits 3 games in a row. It was just Steph &amp; Draymond dragging them. Should’ve gone minimum 6."
Damian Jones as in that guy who signed a 10 day contract with Lakers earlier this season?
"Mark Jones:  Damian loves to see that purple and gold!  Lakers are wearing blue tonight, Mark..."
"&gt;And how have they been since the deadline?  Injured, mostly.  Maybe try watching a game or two.  &gt;Their best lineup, on paper as I said, doesn’t feature Hield.   Their best lineup exists only on paper, since they acquired all those bench players at the deadline.  Before that, Haliburton had to come off the bench to give the second unit any hope at all.  Paper lineups do not win games.  &gt; So he’d be relegated to the bench.   So you're saying Walton is terrible because he hasn't coached a team that has not yet existed?  By the way, Whiteside is so good that he's lost his job to waiver pickup Damian Jones."
We also signed Damian Jones who is also better than Whiteside
I've been a believer since last season and when they were overreacting to a little early slump this season. They were already very close to retooling while remaining competitive despite the record. They just needed to use their cap space to replace the G League players they signed to lose on purpose with any NBA level players and they did that. Replacing Damian Jones with Capella was going to be an obvious floor raiser.
"Uh... We swept the blazers were one shot away from a game 7 without Klay, starting Alfonso Mckinney as well.   It's rich coming from a Lakers fan, you fools were always crying about how ""deep our bench was"" yet you hired Cook, Mckinney, Boogie and Damian Jones and they barely even sniffed the court before getting cut lmao"
 We LITERALLY started Damian Jones and Jordan Bell in the WCF and finals WITHOUT KD
"Should've kept Damian Jones over bloody Drummond at this point.  At least Damian doesn't care about touches and plays his role.  Regarding the OP, Gasol needed a rest but hopefully this is the game that opens Vogel's eyes that this team is much better with Gasol at the 5."
"&gt;You're completely missing the point. Davis does not like to play center against big, strong opponents. It's not a talent issue. He does not like to bang with physical centers.  And most of the players you listed don't really fit that description.   &gt;Positions exist on both ends, but Harrell spent many of minutes on Damian Jones last night.  They're much more blurred on offense tho. And again, role not assignment, is much more important."
"&gt;This is just baseless nonsense lmao. Ayton hasn't been anything special this year, so I'm not sure why he wouldn't that matchup. Gobert is useless with the ball in his hands and is only a threat as roll man. Zubac, Cousins, Nurkic, and Kanter aren't threats at all lmao. Jokic is the only real threat and he already matched up with him last year.  You're completely missing the point.  Davis does not like to play center against big, strong opponents.  It's not a talent issue.  He does not like to bang with physical centers.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Nah defensive role is much more of a positional indicator for big men.   Positions exist on both ends, but Harrell spent many of minutes on Damian Jones last night."
"Damian ""Remember me?"" Jones"
Pacific Division legend Damian Jones
Lakers legend Damian Jones
Damian Jones grabbed like 1 rebound in his entire lakers career. Y’all can chill
"Former laker legend Damian Jones, why you do this to Trez, sir why?"
Yall really wanted Drummond over Damian Jones lol
Damn Damian Jones is way better than drummond
So why isn’t Damian Jones still a laker if he shot 16-17 this season for them?
"There are plenty of them. Ayton, Robinson, damian Jones, gafford, claxton, Harrell and way more"
"I'll fault coach on this one.  Derrick Jones is tremendous catching alley-oops around the hoop. One opportunity DJJ has not gotten is to share the court with Nurkic. Who is a great passer. Damian Lillard and CJ both see hard doubles off the pick and roll opening up the pocket pass to the screener who is a very good passer.   If Dame/CJ can hit Nurk with that pocket pass, that opens up a 4v3 run to the hoop where DJJ can hover around the hoop waiting for lobs. Kanter did not have the ability to make this pass, but I think Nurkic would excel at it.  Unfortunately, once Nurkic has come back, DJJ has been benched which I think is extremely dumb. I'd prefer he starts to maximize his time with Nurk.     I didn't watch a ton of Heat last year, but I'd imagine Bam hit DJJ with a lot of these opportunities given he averaged 5 assists, and 78% of DJJ's 2s were assisted.  Can any Heat fans confirm if DJJ lived in the dunker spot on the P&amp;R last year?"
"I don't think they love playing small ball even though they play in it. Draymond gets worn down playing the 5 and this is the first year loony has been reliability healthy. They did well with Bogut at the center, but have just suffered with subpar centers since (Zaza, Damian jones, McGee) so they play small ball as a result."
Damian Jones cant really hang at center against the big bois either. Frank Kaminsky beat him out of a roster spot on the Suns...
"Hey, this is awesome!  I like Damian Jones. I think he has a lot of potential and was showing real improvement his last season with the Warriors (fucking injuries)."
Hasn’t Metu been better than Damian Jones?

Damian jones helping the lakers even after leaving us. That's a true laker right there
Undisputed michelob ultra player of the game Damian Jones
How do you lose to a kings team without fox and hb playing one half and damian jones playing over 20 minutes?
Laker Legend Damian Jones
"Lol, I admittedly don't watch many Mavs games, but he seems to have good hands and solid touch, plays smart and within his capabilities, and has the ability to hit cutters. I might have just lowered my standards after two weeks of watching Whiteside and Damian Jones though"
Damian Jones cannot catch the goddamn ball to save his life. The ball always ends up in his hands too
Me: man I kinda miss Damian Jones  *in and out of the hands of Damian Jones*  Me: oh yeah there was that :/
He averaged nearly 10 assist last year with Alex Len and Damian Jones as the Big men with lights out shooters like 42 year old Vince Carter and Bembry on the perimeter
"Don’t know if I’m wrong, but he doesn’t Seem bad to me. Might be because our center rotation last year was Alex Len Damian Jones and Bruno fernando"

Damian Jones was better than Whiteside tonight. Stop capping
Ex warrior Damian Jones looking out for our t-wolves pick this year. Thanks man
"He only takes 8 shots a game. Damian Jones and McGee were averaging 70% TS on low volume too on the Warriors, doesn't mean they were efficiency gods."
"As if getting self made buckets off the dribble is all there is to basketball. This team was 20-47 last season because we didn’t have a center like Clint who could defend the paint against anyone AND grab the rebound off the miss almost every time. Literally, going from Damian Jones and Alex Len to Capela and a rookie has gotten us at least 8 extra wins. Trae is not worth that many wins himself. We would be where the Bulls are without him. Without Trae, we’d be hovering where the Hornets are. He’s actually been bad for most games this season"
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
Lebron made damian jones look competent lol
"&gt;It was super strange last night. They started Damian Jones, played him five minutes, and then didn't play him the rest of the night.   &gt;   &gt;Big brain Luke Walton.  The Kings led in the fourth quarter, so whatever Walton did seemingly worked pretty well, considering the talent-gap between the two rosters."
Damian Jones walked so Andre Drummond can turn the ball over
But Damian you know i’m really Jones
"Wait, am I crazy or did Holmes not play  It looked like the Kings were playing Damian Jones and Hassan Whiteside"
"Yeah no , rather just re sign damian jones again over this guy"
"I'm on the fence on that, just because the Lakers were at their best with some redundancy at C last season.   But yeah, Trez sadly wasn't as good of a fit. I'd like to see that money go to a wing this time around and have Damian Jones type as a third stringer"
"Oh he loves the 6th man role, when Marc went out for a bit and we signed Damian Jones, he asked to come off the bench and have Jones start because he was so used to being the 6th man"
"See how you can't even mention our other ""good shooters""? 😂  Green was shooting 30% by the way   Quin Cook, McKinney, Ian Clark, Patrick McCaw, Iguodala, Livingston, Zaza, West, Damian Jones, McGee... Neither of these guys can shoot the 3 like the nets players I mentioned, 5 of them couldn't shoot at all   KD=KD Curry&gt;Kyrie Klay&gt;Harden   Then every nets player from 4th to 9th shoots better by a landslide"
"I love simmons....but its damian friccin lillard.  We'd have to give up all our young assets and multiple picks on top, not just simmons. It'd be maxey + thybulle + reed + joe (maxey and thybulle are the only two with real value there).  And we might have to still sweeten the deal with a trade of another player (maybe seth for derrick jones jr).  Without those young players and assets theres just no point for portland to do this trade otherwise.  Although to be fair, most trades i've seen seriously underrate lillard to my eye."
"Last year he had two rookies on the floor and Collins was suspended for 20 games in a shortened season.  The other players were Charlie Brown (no I'm not kidding), Jabari Parker, Brembry and Damian Jones.  The reason why he's doing so well is that he's been doing this the entire time."
NBA media is the worst major sports media IMO. A lot of these shows are only good for hot takes to get views and engagement with an argument and not actually use context for a discussion. Using the Trae example these talking-heads knew very well that until this year he was not surrounded by talent(Damian Jones and Alex Len were starters 🤢).
Stop it man. When the chips were on the table it was lebron playing the 5. Just get a cheap expendable rim running C like Damian Jones.
Damian Jones is great and all but this is a little too far
They were forced to sign another big because AD got injured and Gasol was in health and safety protocols for weeks. Do you not remember how they were starting Damian Jones and Cacok for a while there?
"Damian Jones is also a 2x NBA champion, and Damian Lillard has 0"
"Or Alex Len and Damian Jones, like it was for the Hawks for 2 years."
"They had to sign Drummond because Gasol was in Covid protocols for weeks, AD was out for months with his injury and Damian Jones' 2nd 10 day contract ran out. At the time the Lakers were super thin in the frontcourt and Trez was about the only guy left for a while there."
"Better Defender? Cody Zeller might be the worst defensive big in the league. He’s statistically the 9th worst defensive center in the NBA.  Better than guys like Metu (who?), Hermangomez, Damian Jones, as well as the corpse of LMA.  I’m a Hornets fan and have been listening to homers defend this guy since he went 4th overall. He sucks! Just stop.   There was a clown on the sub (Hornets) saying he was a top 10 center. I was called an idiot because I disagreed.  Cody Zeller isn’t good. And he sucks at defense. Maybe my fellow hornet fans will stop thinking he’s so awesome when he’s not wearing purple and teal."
Trae wansnt better past year hes just taken a lesser scoring role since theres mire guys that can score around him and theyre not starting Damian Fucking Jones
"There is no worse team than one that gives heavy minutes to Evan Turner (out of the league), Vince Carter (retired), Allen Crabbe (out of the league), Damian Jones (3 teams in one season), and Alex Len (3 teams in one season)."
Patrick Mccaw would’ve sufficed. Damian Jones and Jacob Evans as well. WCS had a short stint with us and was also very useless. all of them would’ve worked
"Even in the 2019 Finals it was bad.  Outside of the main guys (and obviously KD basically didn't play), you had older/less effective Iguodala and Livingston, Cousins, Looney, Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, washed Andrew Bogut, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell, Jacob Evans, Damian Jones...  Remove KD and Klay from when they were hurt and it was not good."
"Alex Len and Damian Jones are crap though. Can't just put anyone tall in there, scouting department still needs to be able to find the lobs and blocks bargain, but they are out there."
Capela is 100% worth it and has proven this season to have separated himself from those similar type players. The difference from Alex Len and Damian Jones to Clint Capela is night and day and the biggest reason the Hawks started winning.
"Gasol, Kuzma, and AD didn’t play that game. We also didn’t have Drummond yet. Our center rotation that was Harrell, Damian Jones, and Jared Dudley.  That’s a good game to only lose by 10."
"Tbf, we tried for a very long time to develop Damian Jones. We had more leeway since it was during the Durant years but he started for a good portion of the 2019 season."
"below replacement value players that have been through the Warrior's system and been ""serviceable"":  Ian Clark   James Michael McAdoo   Alonzo McKinnie   Damian Jones   Festus Ezeli   Quinn Cook   Patrick McCaw   Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Brandon Rush   Justin Holiday    Others who thrive in the Warriors system that may not look as good somewhere else:  Kevon Looney   Shaun Livingston   Juan T."
"Hopefully Utah can contain the likes of Louis King, Damian Jones, and Terence Davis"

"Offense:   Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Carmelo Anthony, Jusuf Nurkic  Defense:   Norman Powell, Derrick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Jusuf Nurkic."
I don’t know if he would’ve made a difference but the Suns had a C in Damian Jones before cutting him
"Depends on how big a star you are. Definitely Steph, Lebron, KD are more well known than the biggest NFL stars. Established NBA superstars are more well known than an equally comparable NFL star. For example, more people know who Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony are compared to Aaron Donald and Julio Jones. But more people know some average QB like Andy Dalton compared to Devin Booker or Jokic in the US"
This logic makes sense until you realize he averaged the same amount of assists last season with Alex Len and Damian Jones as his big men.  Trae is just a better passer
Damian Jones?
"Lol yes I meant brogdon. Damn autocorrect. But for sure Brogdon/Sexton, Ant, Brown is a solid perimeter lineup. I’d be worried about the front court though after getting through the Alex Len/Damian Jones/Dwayne Dedmon years"
"Yeah no, lets stop with slotting players at the 5 that cant shoot let alone cant even hit half of his shots in the paint. I rather  give that to a vet min like damian jones instead of this guy who wants to start. Time to give lebron and AD space to work"
You mean Warriors legend and 2x Champion Damian Jones
*Invest in Lakers Legend Damian Jones.
"I promise you he was absolutely awful from the moment we got him. If we were healthy and in the finals rn, it would be despite Drummond’s play, not because of it. I remember getting incredibly excited whenever he got into foul trouble, and a lot of us being upset that we didn’t keep Damian Jones instead lol"
Even for the minimum there are so many centers who are better than him. Damian Jones looked like a god on the Lakers shots 94% FG with them in his short stint while on a 10 day. Andre Drummond shot 53% FG on the same type of shots.
"He'll come back, marc already said its up to the team on what will happen to him so im pretty sure he wants to at least run it back for one last shot at a ring. Now i hope rob would not br dumb to offer drummond the MLE and actually use it on a shooter instead. If lakers want a backup 5, go get vet min big like damian jones or dedmon. Let marc start and thats it"
"Nah Harkless was an important part of a consistent playoff team. Derrick Jones Jr can’t get minutes over Rondae Hollis Jefferson  I irrationally love Moe Harkless though so I’m probably not being objective  Olshey 100000% sucks though, I think he’s the worst GM in the league and has been saved by having Damian Lillard"
"Damian Jones was limited but he honestly seemed solid in the time he was with us. Young, athletic, lob threat, won’t make demands."
Bro we gave Chimezie metu and Damian Jones minutes over bagley because how ass he is. The minutes are there for him he just can't defend for shit and is a black hole/turnover machine on offense
"We have like the 2nd or 3rd best record in the league since Nate became our coach and have a deep, talented roster but people are acting like we are still the 2019 hawks starting 42 year old Vince and Damian Jones/Alex Len at center lol"
"&gt; If Luka was in the East he would have been in the finals **last year**.  This is peak /r/NBA right here.  I'm betting you have absolutely no idea who was on the Hawks roster last year.  Luka would not have made the playoffs in the East with that roster.  &amp;nbsp;  The center rotations were Dedmon, Bruno Fernando, Alex Len, and Damian Jones.  None of those guys can even get minutes today.  We also started 2 rookies, Reddish and Hunter.  Hunter was bad last year, Reddish was bad to mediocre at times.  Heurter was our starting SG, good for about 12 ppg on terrible efficiency.  Our most seasoned player, 3rd year Collins, was suspended for 25 games.  &amp;nbsp;  Round off our rotation with Jabari Parker, Bembry, and Vince Carter chucking his way into retirement and you think that Luka instead of Trae is going to the finals lmfao this sub really never misses"
"Lukas supporting cast beat the 1 seed bucks with Giannis last year.  Trae had 41 year old vince Carter playing 15 minutes per game. His centers were Damian Jones, Alex Len and dewayne dedmon.   But Luka was heralded and Trae was called an empty stats player.  (Not saying luka is an empty stats player just saying the goalposts seem to shift an awful lot.)  Trae’s shooting splits don’t tell the whole story because he still got his team involved with his passing and kept an all nba defender attached to him at all times."
Damian Jones has won multiple rings before Chris Paul. Suck it those who clowned Jones as a irrelevant late pick
"Word after 2 years of watching us trot out Jabari Parker, Alex len, Damian Jones 43 year old VC, DeAndre Bemrby, Bruno Fernando and a bunch of rookies I don't want to hear shit about bad supporting casts lol."
"&gt; Interesting that the Mavs were a bunch of scrubs even though they shot near 50% from 3 those first couple games and shot 38% for the series. Meanwhile Trae's teammates are bricking wide open 3s and shooting 35% for the series.  Shooting isnt everything and even there through the playoffs its a wash, both shot around 37-38%% without Trae/Luka. Mavs legit dont have bigs that can rebound or rim protect or lob run or PnR on a good level. These are MUST haves next to players like Luka and Trae and the Hawks have such players.   Its not the fault of Luka that Porzingis regressed in defense after last year (look at every advanced stat even during his good shooting regular season) or cant rebound for shit and cant roll to save his life . And that no big men can in teh Mavs. Powel pre Achilles was a great roller and the Luka-Power PnR was literally the most efficient offensive play in the league so its not like Luka doesnt run amazing PnR sets when he has people to. Swap just Porzingis (who is supposed to be Mav's second best player) with Capela or Collins and the Mavs win the Clippers series.   Also the Mavs literally have no player on the roster that can playmake, create their own shot and put the ball on the floor safely at the level that Bogdanovic or Huerter. Its not ""Luka ball hogs so they dont have the chance to"". There was a whole season of any of them getting chances to find out but no one has the skills to take offensive load of Luka and run plays. You can ask yourself if a team would you trade the 2-4 best players in the Hawks for even the 2-6 best players in the Mavs ?   Hawks FO straight up outperformed the Mavs one and even then with a single small upgrade of KP with a big that can rim protect and run PnR we wouldnt be having this convo cause Mavs would have beaten a similarly good team to the Sixters.  &gt; Trae for some reason didn't get the benefit of the doubt when he was putting up 30/10 with 2 rookies, Jabari, and Damian Jones in the starting lineup last year.  People shouldnt have, i agree here  &gt; Doncic is a generational talent because why? What makes him a generational talent and Trae not a generational talent?  I believe that both are generetional in a way but i do believe that Luka is both better rn and has a larger potential.The gap between them isnt huge and Most aspects slightly or more noticably favor Luka besides freethrow shooting only thing i give Trae a smallish edge is playmaking.. Most playmaking and passing metrics through their career and playoffs are similar with Trae slightly better. And when Luka played with a bigs that could roll well they were closer. In the playoffs scoring stats increase in Luka's favor and playmaking increase in Trae's (small sample size). And also as an extension most advanced stats do favor luka  some slightly and some by more and i do think the vast vast majority of GMs, Coatches,FO  etc rn would pick Luka starting next year"
" Ok this is what I'm talking about. All of these reasons are just thrown out here as if Trae has no accomplishments of his own because people have already decided that Luka is the far better player due to the media and their unconscious bias.    Did I forget how Luka is 1st all NBA? No, i also didn't forget how Trae wasn't voted to the all-star game. Both ""awards"" are voted on by the media where all NBA is actually completely voted on by the media lmao.    &gt; remember how luka got first team all-nba, and pushed a team of scrubs (minus hardaway jr maybe) to seven games with the clippers?    Interesting that the Mavs were a bunch of scrubs even though they shot near 50% from 3 those first couple games and shot 38% for the series. Meanwhile Trae's teammates are bricking wide open 3s and shooting 35% for the series. Trae for some reason didn't get the benefit of the doubt when he was putting up 30/10 with 2 rookies, Jabari, and Damian Jones in the starting lineup last year.     Doncic is a generational talent because why? What makes him a generational talent and Trae not a generational talent?     Is it because he's bigger? Is it because he was great right away and Trae looked like a bust for half his rookie season before he became a great player? Is it because Luka has a more aesthetically pleasing game?    The answer is yes to all of these. Your unconscious mind tells you that Luka is better due to all these factors, yet when you look at the stats ... They put out essentially the same output. The media tells you Luka is better and your mind confirms it from watching a few games."
Trae should have had one all nba for this year or last year If Lloyd pierce wasn’t sabatoging the team in the 4th or destroying players confidence. He put up 30 and 10 with Damian Jones and Alex Len catching his passes.
all of darios highest used lineups were next to Crowder/Craig/Johnson who re forwards. he played 34 minutes all season with ayton and none with kaminsky or damian jones. how is he a PF?
Damian Jones is signed with the Kings.
"Best way is to throw a bunch of bad/washed centers who can't dribble or shoot together:   Baynes, Kostas, Damian Jones, Deandre Jordan, Felicio  You can full court press this team successfully. In the halfcourt they have zero spacing, it's just going to be them trying to drive in a straight line and fumbling the ball half the time. They'd probably have 40 turnovers in the game. Can't post up smaller players because defense can easily help off of ""shooters"" to double and all these guys have shit passing ability. Total disaster.  And then on D, there's nobody with the lateral quickness to defend off the dribble. The other teams' guards will get into the lane over and over and over."
AD only got one lob pass from Schroeder I think? He even give Damian Jones the lob pass before AD and it was already half the season in
"I think a 3 way with Blazers and Kings is a realistic move.  Philly gets Dame, Sac get Simmons &amp; Blazers get rebuilding assets (picks and young players).  I think the two biggest questions are:  1) who adds assets in a Simmons for Lillard trade? Lillard is the better player but is also 31 while Simmons is 25. How much are you really adding to Simmons to get a couple more years of Lillard’s prime? Maxey or Thybulle? Late 1sts? Personally I think I might do Maxey but Thybulle is off limits as he defense is too valuable with Simmons departure.  2) what young players would Sacramento be willing to put in a trade for Simmons? Would/should Sac do Fox? Personally I love Fox and wouldn’t but there is an appeal to keeping Mitchell and Haliburton (both on rookie deals for next 3-4 years). Gives a lot of options for building the roster out before they need extensions. The Hield fit becomes better with better defenders around him aswell. Ideally Hield + Bagley + Picks + Swaps would be the move but how many?  Phi gets Lillard  Sac gets Simmons + DJJ  Portland gets Maxey + Hield + Bagley + Woodard + Damian Jones + Sac 22 1st (unprotected) + Sac 23 pick swap (top 4 protected) + Sac 24 1st (top 4 protected) + Sac 24 pick swap (top 4 protected) + 25 pick swap (top 4 protected) + $13m cap saving/trade exception"
"Trae could also create these looks for KP, Powell and Kleber.  He did for Alex Len and Damian Jones, they just couldn't finish them."
i mean he had similar assist numbers when he had alex len and damian jones playing center.
"Trae’s had better assist stats since they got drafted. Even when he was playing with Jabari Parker, Damian Jones, Alex Len and Kent Bazemore."
"Got a little ways to go before he can tangle with the Summer League GOAT, Damian ""8 fouls in 25 minutes"" Jones"
"Don't expect anyone to have watched us, but Damian Jones was a very serviceable backup big for us last season. Far more useful than Whiteside, and I prefer him getting minutes over Len and Tristan Thompson."
Damian Jones in shock after team option picked up.
Wiseman has yet to prove he’s Damian Jones? Bro gtfo
"Kuminga is far more polished than Wiseman. That says more about Wiseman than Kuminga. Wiseman is big and has a decent jump shot and that's it. He has no post game, no feel for the game, he is contact adverse, can't play team defense and obstructed teammates drives to the rim. I watched Trey Young(!) steal a rebound from right under his nose. Wiseman was straight ass last year. His upside is obvious, but he has no skill and plays scared. Kuminga can pass, defend and drive and finish through contact, and plays with tremendous confidence. Hard to say exactly when he will arrive, but dude is clearly going to be decent NBA player. If he can hit his jumpers he is  a star. Wiseman is yet to prove he is more than Damian Jones."
"Hear you, but we hear this every year that draymond will “bring guys under his wing” which young guys have actually thrived or really developed defensively with those vets?  Bell, paschall, mcadoo, Damian Jones, spellman, mccaw, Lee, McKinnie, etc  I know none of those guys had tons of talent, but plenty of them had at least athleticism and some work ethic, but none developed defensively the way you would’ve liked despite draymonds presence.   Looney is pretty solid on defense, but does that credit all go to Draymond?"
"Bad signing. Going to be another Damian Jones, a bad player who inexplicably got minutes with a good team (that succeeded in spite of him).  People want to talk about the 14th/15th player as they don't matter, but that's BS and we all know it. We're going to cut him in December and have to sign Jeremy Lin or Emmanuel Mudiay."
*Alex Len and Damian Jones has left the chat*
"James Jones isn't always right and Monty can't fix Elfrid just because of Cam Payne. Elfrid Payton will probably matter at some point, it's dumb to defend it as meaningless.  Damian Jones was a bad signing. Probably didn't need Galloway AND Moore, lacked front court depth.  Teams should use both two way slots it's ridiculous not to."
"Waste of a roster spot. It's going to be the PG version of Damian Jones  We give it a shot and then cut him a few months into the season, which makes us wonder why we signed him in the first place."
"We'll see, and I'm open to being wrong. But Kings fans thought the exact same thing last offseason - just need a big body on a one-year deal to eat some minutes against opposing bigs. Whiteside was miles worse than that. He was a fucking saboteur who actually made the team worse every time he stepped on the court. The only reason he got any minutes at all was because the Kings didn't have another 7 footer on the roster until the trade deadline, when Whiteside was immediately benched for fucking Damian Jones.  I really think Jazz would have been better off with any other cheap vet at that position: Alex Len, Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, whoever. But I guess it might not matter, because there's zero chance he plays a single second in the playoffs."
"I mean, hard to be too down on any player when they're signed for the vet min. But at the same time... he was basically unplayable even for the Kings, who had a *desperate* need for a ""real"" big man and were playing for nothing. Most of whatever talent he used to have is washed; he was a walking turnover, a defensive liability, a mediocre rebounder despite his huge size advantage, and could barely score anything other than a dunk or putback. It took all of 10 days for *Damian Jones* to permanently bench him.  Far as I know he was a great locker room guy though, teammates loved him."
"Hes 53rd if you don’t put a minimum minutes requirement.  If you limit it to players who played more than 500 minutes this past season he’s 14th.    The players ahead of him include Isaiah Hartenstein, Javale, Goga, Dwight, Okongwu, Boogie, Mo Wagner, Wiseman, Cauley-Stein, Damian Jones, Grant Williams, Derrick Favors, and Dwight Powell."
Damian Jones did and it resulted in more effort in the games that followed.
Oh like Hassan Whiteside or Damian Jones?
All he needs to do is be better than Damian Jones
"I actually think Damian Jones would've been solid as hell if not for all his injuries.  Every time he started really showing promise... bam, another injury."
Doubt it dude was born in Nassau     Meanwhile Damian Jones in Louisville 4 years prior. Not that likely I‘d say that they are related.
Is Damian Jones his bruh?
Our only center on the roster is Damian Jones. Yes this is a win.
Drummond still makes the team worse even if LAL is getting the best out of him. Damian Jones on a 10 day contract was better than him. So was Javale Mcgee last year.
"They probably don't re-sign holmes if they get Trez. No reason to have two undersized energy 5s. They probably start looking for a veteran traditional 5 in case Damian Jones reverts back into the foul machine he's been most of his career (I'm hopefully Walton figured something out, he was a solid defensive coach in LA)."
"&gt; It actually is true. Show me a made it to the ECF trophy. Oh wait there isn't one. Only winning the conference and winning the finals. And because of this no Atlanta didn't have any better of a season because they didn't get any awards for their season  And you were saying I was semantics? Holy cripes. You're right though, Sacramento and Portland definitely had equal seasons this year.   &gt;Golden state between 2013 and 2020 has been the worst drafting teams in the league. They drafted Wiseman when Lamelo was clearly number 1 by the best scouts, and drafted complete bust like McCaw Jacob Evans and Damian Jones  You're correct, they're draft record hasn't been top notch the past few years. But when you're constantly drafting 25th or lower, that'll happen. McCaw was fine for where he was drafted, Looney was great at 25, Paschall was really good at 41, and Poole is looking as well. Funny how you left those guys out. As for Wiseman, give them a few years before touting that one. Even if Ball ends up being the better player (which is likely) give Wiseman some time to develop. He showed a lot of promise last year despite barely playing college, having no summer league, having no pre-season, and dealing with injuries. Wiseman will be fine.  &gt;The one team that did it was Philly and it worked, and the one team that is trying it is widely considered the smartest front office in the league.  It worked? But by your own words, if you don't win your conference then you didn't accomplish anything. So what exactly worked?  As for OKC, they were touted as being successful in part due to all the assets they acquired and still being a competitive team. As soon they start pulling garbage trades like trading SGA, they won't be looked at in the same way."

Just trade everyone and everything for both Beal *and* Lillard. Find some scrubs off the street (like Damian Jones) to play bigs while having 4 insane guards on your team.
"Yea…kawhi Leonard is totally comparable to guys like James wiseman, Damian Jones, Jacob Evans, Patrick Flynn, etc."
2 rings &gt; 0 therefore Damian Jones is first
Yes they can. They literally gave away Damian Jones on a 10 day contract for Andre Drummond even though the former is the better player. they just need to pick the right guys like they did in 2020.
"&gt; You mean the play where he got intentionally tripped by Damian Jones? Lmao.  Do you want me to link you the play or are you really delusional? Theres no way you think him tripping over a normal screen is the same thing as him literally grabbing another players ankle as hes making a move.   &gt; Also tripping is hardly “intent to injure”  LMFAO, ye im out bud if you actually think its okay to intentionally trip a player with not only your feet but your literal hands then theres no point in having a convo with you. The fact that you can't comprehend how that can seriously injure someone is sad"
"You mean the play where he got intentionally tripped by Damian Jones? Lmao.    Also tripping is hardly “intent to injure” like I said above. It’s a basketball play, and honestly not that different than hacking in the paint."
"Thats true, but even when knowing his limitations, you dont want Damian Jones getting NBA minutes on your team.  Trust me, Ive seen him play too many minutes for the tanking Hawks"
"Damian Jones knew his limitations and literally only did what was asked of him and was a poor man's McGee, in contrast to Drummond feeling like the main guy when he's supposed to be a role player"
"Damian Jones is a bad G-league player though, while Drummond seemed like he was in theory an amazing role player if locked in"
What sucks is that Damian Jones actually fit the team way better than Drummond did
DAMIAN JONES IS STILL A 1ST ROUNDER
"I liked what I saw from Damian Jones last year tbh, but that might be because I was comparing him to Whiteside. He brings some good size and gives effort on both ends, which is what a want from a 2nd/3rd string big.  I think there's a chance we trade Tristan Thompson if we can."
"They are being too confident. The starting lineup of Schröder KCP Bron AD and Gasol was really good all season, if the team had rolled with just keeping Damian Jones while Marc recovered from COVID it would’ve been fine and chemistry issues wouldn’t have been as bad. Marc just fit the team better and was playing better even if Drummond had better numbers"
I agree. I think there was rumor they tried getting Damian Jones back before DJ? Now that would’ve been perfect. To me this signing just feels like they want 2 centers that have the same style of play so they can build continuity and cause it already worked before. Regular season is going to be painful to watch but I’m glad Vogel has shown he’s willing to bench players during the playoffs.
It’s because we were missing a lob threat and we had no centers at the time except for Harrell because AD was injured and Gasol was out with covid. We tried Damian Jones but he wasn’t that great with rebounding. Drummond turned out to be a head case tho
Damian Jones' drive by gets me every time
"If given the opportunity, I’d pick Damian Jones than DeAndre"
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"Don't you think Game 7 is a pretty important game to not shit the bed in? The Blazers didn't put the Nuggets away in the first six games, so I don't see how it's excusable to play terribly in an elimination game.  &gt;Oh no, he lost to a team with 3 all stars as a lone injured all star without his 2nd best player   If he's injured, he shouldn't be playing. It's not an excuse for 2016 Steph, and it's not an excuse for Dame either. He averaged 22 points on bad efficiency against the hobbled Warriors with no depth and no KD. We started Jordan Bell, Alfonso McKinnie, Andrew Bogut, and Damian Jones at different points in that series. Klay also shot like shit that series. It's not like he was expected to win, but he could've at least put up a fight instead of letting Steph completely crush him pretty much single handedly."
"I really wish the Lakers signed Damian Jones again, playing with this group of guys he’d develop better and be an energy big man for practically no cost"
"And got swept by the Warriors without KD in a series where Jordan Bell, Bogut, Damian Jones and Afonzo McKinnie started at least one game each lol"
Stop it right now. Jabari Parker only got to play 13 games this year because he’s that bad Damian Jones played for three teams this year because he’s that bad and Deandre Bembrey is a worse three point shooter than Russ at 23.1%. I don’t see why you are fighting this so hard it’s ok for Trae to be better than Luka in something stop being so soft lol. Not to mention the two dudes you mentioned played less games then Deandre bembry did and the season was longer.
Barely. Also his starters. That stretch was Jabari Parker and Damian Jones and Deandre Bembry who are all significantly worse then who Luka is currently playing with.
Trae young did the same thing the year before this with Damian Jones as the center and collins being suspended for doping for 25 games it’s easy for him regardless of who he plays with stop trying to discredit him lol. Luka runs five out and it’s easier to make reads when the defense is spread out.
"Trae was averaging 9,3 assists the year before with John Collins suspended for 25 games at the start of the season with Alex Len, Damian Jones and Bruno Fernando as his bigs.  Basically the type of bigs he has is irrelevant to how good of a passer he is"
"&gt;	The list of active NBA players with at least 2 Championships is actually surprisingly short: ​  1. (1 player) Lebron James ​  1. (8 players) Stephen Curry, Danny Green, Draymond Green, Udonis Haslem, Andre Iguodala, Patrick McCaw, JaVale McGee, Klay Thompson ​  1. (5 players) Quinn Cook, Kevin Durant, Damian Jones, Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo  Is this looking like this because of my Apollo app or did OP mess up the formatting here? Context and general knowledge tell me it’s 4 chips, 3 chips, 2 chips, but I’d be lying if it didn’t take me a minute to realize wtf I was supposed to be looking at.  Edit: lol, and the formatting gets messed up even worse when quoting it. 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"I think those are good points, but I think it’s too reactionary of a take IMO this early. This team will take time to gel and this year’s team actually makes sense.  The Lakers lost KCP, Caruso, Kuzma, Trez, and Schroder this off season. The first three had abysmal performances in the playoffs. Even in the year the won the chip Kuzma was not playing well at all. Trez is effectively unplayable on the playoffs bc he’s a 6’7” non-spacing, non-playmaking center. And Schroeder maybe barely played better than Kuzma given what was expected of him after AD went down.  The Lakers got Bazemore, Ariza, Melo, Dwight, Westbrook, Monk, and Nunn. Reaves also looks good. Defensively the team will be a bit worse. Baze and Ariza just aren’t Caruso and KCP defensively. But IMO Melo is better than Kuz. Russ is a massive upgrade over Schroder. Monk, Reaves, and THT have a ton of upside. Dwight plays his role unlike Drummond. DJ is horrendous, but maybe Damian Jones becomes available by the trade deadline. I’m telling you, give this some time. Not even close to the finished product yet."
The random Damian Jones cross is still the best part of this video.
"This should go without saying, but I am much too young to make proper judgement of these players.   Of the ones that were already included in the top 50 list, I’d say Billy Cunningham, Lenny Wilkens, Earl Monroe are fringe at best, and I feel like others are more deserving. Players like Sam Jones, Pete Maravich, Dave DeBusschere are fringe as well but not enough to warrant taking them off the list.   I understand they don’t want to remove anyone from lists, but I think Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis is premature at this point.  Super glad they added in Reggie Miller, Dominque Wilkins, and Dennis Rodman"
"That's our third center.  Two years ago our center rotation was Alex Len, Damian Jones and ""Vince, you played center in the 90s?"""
List:   - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Ray Allen - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Carmelo Anthony - Nate Archibald - Paul Arizin - Charles Barkley - Rick Barry - Elgin Baylor - Dave Bing - Larry Bird - Kobe Bryant - Wilt Chamberlain - Bob Cousy - Dave Cowens - Billy Cunningham - Stephen Curry - Anthony Davis - Dave DeBusschere - Clyde Drexler - Damian Lillard - Tim Duncan - Jerry Lucas - Kevin Durant - Karl Malone - Julius Erving - Moses Malone - Patrick Ewing - Pete Maravich - Walt Frazier - Bob McAdoo - Kevin Garnett - Kevin McHale - George Gervin - George Mikan - Hal Greer - Reggie Miller - James Harden - Earl Monroe - John Havlicek - Steve Nash - Elvin Hayes - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - Hakeem Olajuwon - LeBron James - Shaquille O'Neal - Magic Johnson - Robert Parish - Sam Jones - Chris Paul - Michael Jordan - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Bob Pettit - Kawhi Leonard - Paul Pierce - Scottie Pippen - Willis Reed - Oscar Robertson - David Robinson - Dennis Rodman - Bill Russell - Dolph Schayes - Bill Sharman - John Stockton - Isiah Thomas - Nate Thurmond - Wes Unseld - Dwyane Wade - Bill Walton - Jerry West - Russell Westbrook - Lenny Wilkens - Dominique Wilkins - James Worthy
"I mean it's a pattern for Kerr to start off a ""weaker"" center with what used to be the death lineup. It was Zaza and Damian Jones for a long time. Looney usually doesn't start except for that monthish period last year where we stopped starting Wiseman and started Looney instead and we won a decent record (as far as I can remember, pandemic time passes differently).   It's tough because the Lakers have a really good center lineup with Davis and LeBron who are superstars and are a tough task regardless."
"After years of carrying random guys like Damian Jones, Anderson Varejao, Jordan Bell, and Alen Smailagic on the team it appears that the Warriors have decided fuck centers."
He’s gonna trade Simmons for Damian.  Damian Jones
With Damian Jones out of the league it’s a wide open category
"Fans are way too critical for the rooks especially the late first rounders  Poole turned out to be okay. Looney tunes out to be okay. Hell, even ezeli had his good days  The only one I'm truly mad about is Damian fucking Jones"

"Vince Carter, Evan Turner, Chandler Parsons, Treveon Graham, Tyrone Wallace, Allan Crabbe, Bruno Fernando, Damian Jones...do I have to go on?"
"That take is fucking ridiculous.  Please look at our team two years ago.  Outside of guys on rookie contracts we had 42 year old Vince getting 20mpg, Alex Len and Damian Jones playing basically all center minutes and DeAndre Bembry getting starter minutes.  It was legit painful to watch that team outside of Trae and JC (who was banned for 25 games)"
"Davion played great on both ends. He created at least 5 turnovers on defense. Haliburton looks amazing, he had 3 or 4 no look assists. Our rotation of bigs is deep with holmes, Thompson, bagley, Len, Damian Jones and Metu. Bagley looked as good as I’ve ever seen him, and even smiled a few times. Barnes looked great. Overall our defense looked a lot better even if it was just the Suns B squad."
What are they going to do with Damian Jones?
2016: Damian Jones becomes Deyonta Davis. This is a wash.  2017: Jordan Bell technically becomes Jawun Evans. This is probably a downgrade.  2018: Jacob Evans becomes Dzanan Musa. This is probably a wash  2019: Jordan Poole becomes Keldon Johnson. This is probably a downgrade.  2020: James Wiseman becomes Lamelo Ball. This is definitely an upgrade at this point in their respective careers.
Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin heurter Matisse Thybulle  Josh hart  Damian Jones   Aside from halli I’m fine with our choices 😂
"Damian Jones graduated with an engineering degree at Vanderbilt. I’ve seen on a few sites that he also graduated with a 4.0 GPA, but I don’t know how accurate that is.  Skylar Mays also finished with a 3.93 GPA in pre-med at LSU and plans to finish med school after his NBA career is over."
"People already went by that logic when Trae was playing with guys like Alex Len, Damian Jones, Kent Bazemore, Jabari Parker etc.   I think Luka will be fine though."
"Who wins Warriors min role players past vs warriors g league?  Bazemore, Bradley, Burks, Oubre, Damian Jones  VS  Chiozo, Poole, Damion Lee, JTA, Wiseman"
"Harry Giles/Damian Jones would’ve done that job much better. People gotta stop overrating veteran presence, especially when your team is that damn old."
"Yeah never forget Bell, Damian Jones, Jacob Evans, Manion, EP and Smailagic."
"Even when he has no one around him he averaged 30 and 10, throwing lobs to Alex Len and Damian Jones, the pieces-around-him argument is so bullshit. And Trae's only physical limitation is size (which he often uses to his advantage). He has insane speed/quickness and body control. Just because Ja almost dunks on people doesn't mean that Trae isn't more explosive, its just lateral explosion. Only argument is defense, but its not like Ja is a plus defender so it isn't really a argument breaker"
"For me, you look at who's behind them to see if its a bust or not, and even then its a toss up.  Really after 20 if in 1 in 5 are serviceable that's great.  Like, Damian Jones wasn't a great pick but for that position there was no one behind him we could have taken better.  Same goes for most of these guys."
"Sounds awesome. Hope you guys make the playoffs! Damian ""Prime Tim Duncan"" Jones will take you there 😤"
We thought Damian Jones would be DJ with a jumper 😂
Yeah if Damian Jones is doing that to you somethings wrong
Wtf THAT Damian Jones???
Wait this is our Damian Jones? Wtf lmao
Damian Jones and Bagley playing huge in the 4th. Wild
Who are you referring to? Pretty much every King outside of Damian Jones that played tonight is fairly recognizable if you follow the league.
Marvin Bagley and Damian Jones
That's back-to-back NBA champion Damian Jones to you.
That lineup down the stretch... What the hell  PG: Davion Mitchell  SG: Buddy Hield  SF: Tyrese Haliburton  PF: Maurice Harkless  C: Damian Jones  &amp;#x200B;  The Alvin Gentry experience is changing things up
This feels super weird to say but Damian Jones and Marvin Bagley won us this game.
reminder warriors fans thought jordan bell would be the next draymond and damian jones would be festus without the exploding knees
"Here's something I wrote for a different Kings post (after the Luke Walton firing).  ---------  As far as roster goes, I think everyone's movable at the right price. However, the biggest issue is the lack of decent players at every non-PG position. Peep their depth chart.  PG: Fox | Davion Mitchell | Jah'mius Ramsey  SG: Haliburton (also PG) | Terence Davis | Robert Woodard II  SF: Barnes | Hield | Mo Harkless  PF: Metu | Bagley  C: Holmes | Len | TT | Damian Jones  Let's get the first issue out of the way. Their roster stinks. They have maybe 5 rotation-level players (Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes/Hield). But then what?  Davion Mitchell is an all-D, no-O rookie for now. Terence Davis has some scoring ability, but is rightfully stuck behind three decent guards and D Mitchell.  Mo Harkless has been a body at his recent stops. They've started Mo Harkless in 11 games. They started Chimezie Metu recently. Not saying either is bad bad, but would either even be getting playing time on most teams?  Alex Len has been hanging on in the league by a thread for a few years now and wouldn't be able to play onto most contenders' rosters. TT is washed (partially because of the direction the NBA took) and is a walking trade chip at this point.  Ramsey and Woodard would be two-ways at best on most teams. I don't think Damian Jones has ever been good, even when he was on the Warriors. And Bagley hardly plays.  You look at other mediocre rosters and they all either are clearly developmental (Rockets, Thunder) or they have at least 8-10 NBA level players on the roster, if not more.  The Warriors, Phoenix, Utah, Wizards, Nets, Bulls, Heat, Cavs, Bucks, 76ers, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, and Knicks all have a decent list of players who they can play who aren't complete liabilities (that's half the league, at least). Even for the 4-11 Spurs, you can point to 8 guys who should be on a contender's 10 man rotation (depending on positional excess). The Kings pretty much only have five rotation-quality players, and no amount of coaching will salvage that.  -----------  Their roster is talent-dry AND they don't enough have any assets worth a damn. They have +2 second rounders in total. That's it."
Bonus: [Damian Jones nearly posterizes Boucher but instead send the ball into the announcer's table](https://streamable.com/wzzb91)
"Am I crazy or do the Lakers seem to target everyone that leaves the Warriors?   McGee, Quinn Cook, Bazemore, Alphonso McKinnie, Damian Jones, tried to get Iguodala"
"Kings: Barnes is hella athletic but doesn't dunk very often, pure hops probably Damian Jones  Suns: McGee &amp; Ayton  Mavericks: no real big-time dunkers, but DFS/Kleber can get up, KP too occasionally   Spurs: Lonnie Walker  Pacers: probably Turner/Sabonis  Cavs: Jarrett Allen  Pistons: Hamidou Diallo (2019 dunk champion)  Wizards: Hachimura got some hops, hasn't played this season though. Gafford &amp; Trez?  OKC: Bazley??"
"We are better than losing games to the Thunder, Spurs, and Timberwolves. No offense to those teams, but we really do have better personnel. I think you are underrating what we've got on our team: several great supporting pieces with no real star. Fox has been in a slump lately, but I've been very happy with the play of Hield, Holmes, Barnes, Haliburton, and Mitchell, and we've gotten more out of guys like Metu, Len, and Harkless than I've expected. Really the only rotation guys I'm disappointed in are Bagley, Davis, and Thompson (and TT is supposed to be the vet on the team and in the locker room, which he seems to be doing well).  Luke has had some atrocious rotations in the past, like pitifully bad. He's doing marginally better this year but I think he's still making poor decisions with our guards -- while Buddy off the bench is a good start, he needs to stagger Fox and Haliburton more. His big usage is okay but not ideal at times -- there are quite a few times when we are facing a big center and he chooses not to switch Len in when our smaller bigs are getting bullied, and I know Alex Len is not great but he has proven he can defend bigger centers for some time. (Also this may just be a me thing, but I have no idea why Damian Jones gets minutes. Every other big on our roster has a more defined role than him.) The offense has slowed down significantly under Walton, and under Joerger we were the fastest offense in the league, which also helped our defense out by tiring out opposing offenses. Joerger's defensive schemes also did a way better job than Walton's at masking our weaknesses on defense. I don't expect us to be great, but we certainly should've been better than last (or near last, I can't remember) last year with the personnel on hand. There's not one specific thing he does that I don't like, and I'm not a coach myself, but it was clear that Joerger's defensive schemes just worked better overall. The ideal position for us would be keeping up a similar level of offense (5thish in the league) while going to about league average in defense, with better defensive schemes and rotations being the solution to that. I'm not one to hate on every coach we've had, but I knew this one was a bad signing from the start.  And for the record, a lot of fans were still upset with Vlade over the Bagley pick. Any excitement was due to the fact that Bagley actually looked decent after year one, and that there was room to grow further. I know there are also some ride-or-dies that I won't make fun of for supporting a good season (by our standards) and having hope for the future is not a bad thing. I'm already much happier with McNair, even if the bar was near the floor. He's picked BPA in drafts and it's paid off, and has made a few shrewd trades and signings for our bench. I'd love to give him a few more years at the least to tinker with the roster a bit more heavily, but even with the roster we have I expect more out of it.  TL;DR I really dislike Luke Walton in particular for specific reasons and want him gone."
"Lmao Damian Jones should be used as a minimum bar for a center to be worth a roster spot in NBA. If you worst than him, you probably don't belong in the league."
"Let's just say out of Alex Len, Hassan Whiteside, Damian Jones, and Chimezie Metu, he's easily the worst"
"What do you mean bro? Zaza Pachulia, James Michael McAdoo, Pat McCaw, Damian Jones, Maurese Speights… they got a title contending lineup on their bench!!!"
"lukas teammates end up becoming spot up shooters because thats who they are.  KP and THJ are spot shooters, KP especially hates going to the rim unless its wide open.   look how much better and smoother their offense looks with a secondary creator like brunson sharing the floor with luka  are you trying to tell me alex len and damian jones are worse than dwight powell?  that man cannot jump. he calls for lobs and teammates ignore him because nobody trusts him to finish them.  you think luka can't run a PNR with collins when he has one of the best PNR games in the league?  and they still dont have a real center, KP can't play center.  they only have boban who can barely play any minutes.  if KP tries to play center he will probably get hurt again"
Luka is so ball dominant his teammates end up becoming spot up shooters.   Whereas Trae gets his points while also involving his teammates in the flow of the offense. Collins and Capela would not thrive nearly as much under Luka as they do Trae. Trae was averaging 29 and 9 throwing lobs to fucking Alex Len and Damian Jones ffs
"You forgot all about Looney.  But you nailed it, there really haven't been any draft picks to work with until last year.  Poole and Looney were both late 20's.  I think before that was Damian Jones, who was more of a high risk, high reward pick."
"&gt; GSW capitalized on a cap spike everyone knew was coming with KD.  Even our KD team was relatively homegrown compared to LAL. 2017 we had 7 players we drafted (Steph, Dray, Klay, Damian Jones, Looney, McAdoo, McCaw), 2018 we had 8 (Steph, Dray, Klay, Bell, Boucher, Jones, Looney, McCaw), 2019 we had 7 (Steph, Dray, Klay, Bell, Jones, Evans, Looney).   Signing KD I think still qualified us for ""superteam""-dom, and I understand why we became the villains, but we were always putting out rosters that were about half home-grown."
"Take into account a players history. Escalate punishments accordingly. A player like Bev should have a much harsher punishment than say Damian Jones. You make it out like players are going around injuring players intentionally regularly. This shit is super rare. An enforcer isn't there to injure people but to make things difficult and physical on the court. Physicality can exist without violence. Morris's suspect play could be reviewed and punishment dolled out accordingly, but Jokic's play was a hostile act and deserves harsh punishment.     EDIT: I use Malice because that's what happens when you don't keep things under control."
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
Is Bagley really bad enough that Chimezie Metu and Damian Jones are getting minutes over him?
"True, game logs could have errors. But I checked the end of each season to make sure all the assist added up to what LeBron has.   Also, I checked every game to make sure the number of assists LeBron had in the box score was equal to the number he had in the play by play. There were a few times where this number was off by 1 (mostly in the 2014-15 season for some reason), and so I used another website that has video of every assist to double check and make sure I gave it to who actually got it.  Also, there was a time where LeBron was playing with Damon Jones and Dwayne Jones at the same time, so I had to check who got it lol. Not to be confused with his future teammates Dahntay Jones and Damian Jones lol. Same thing happened with Derrick and Deron Williams.   But, I was very careful every game. Realistically, yeah these numbers MIGHT be off by 1 or 2 (in terms of WHO got the assists), but there’s definitely nothing significant."
Trae was lobbing it to Alex Len and Damian Jones when the Hawks were tanking and his assist numbers were still better than Luka's.  Atleast do research before making claims.
