"You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Just look at this past two years: Ja Morant, Dylan Windler, Jarrell Brantley, Justin Wright-Foreman, Miye Oni, Malachi Flynn, Jay Scrubb, Grant Miller, Sam Merrill, all from mid-major at best programs. If Seth couldn't get enough attention at Duke University that's his own fault."
"Im tired of people saying the Nets have no depth after the trade as if their own team has All Stars down to the 15th man. *Here's the Clippers top 9*  Kawhi/PG/Ibaka/Lou/Beverly/Kennard/Morris/Batum/Zubac   Very impressive top nine. Id say better than the Nets. Now here's the rest of their roster. Amir Coffey/Reggie Jackson/Kabengale/Terrance Man,/Daniel OToru/Patt Patterson/Jay Scrubb Im sorry if im the only one who doesn't think any of those guys are above Average NBA players. That looks like a pretty shite back of rotation.    *Now here's the Nets top 9* KD/Kyrie/Harden/Harris/Green/Deandre/Shamet/Bruce Brown/TLC  And the rest of the roster  Dinwddie/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton/Reggie Perry/3 open roster spots The Nets have the bi annual exception and a disabled player exception to use to fill those open spots. As i said imo the Clippers top 9 is better than the Nets top 9 even though its close. But the Clippers ""depth"" doesn't seem better than the Nets at all. And the Nets have money to improve their depth and all their 2nd round picks to trade."
"The clippers have 4 draft picks that they acquired in the trade for Luke Kennard. They have Portland‚Äôs 2023, Detroit‚Äôs 2024, 2025 and 2026 all 2nd rounders as part of the 3 team trading of shamet to the Nets. They also got the rights to Jay Scrubb in the deal."
Jay Scrubb
Just remember that we still have Jay Scrubb.  Scrubb and Mann will both win co-MVPs in the future
"We have Luke ""MJ"" Kennard and Jay ""Pippen"" Scrubb ready to lead the charge."
Is this box score correct? Swear I saw Jay Scrubb check into the game.
There‚Äôs an nba player named Jay Scrubb?
I play Basketball GM and Jay Scrubb is one of the best players to pick up in the game. Every sim he ends up becoming a 13 PPG player. Give him some minutes too.
Incoming Jay Scrubb 50 piece  Yes the clippers really have a dude named Scrubb on their bench
Jay Scrubb
"So what you are saying is, if he shoots and misses, the Clips are guaranteed to lose and should just put in Jay Scrubb and the scrubs."
Jay scrubb he was one of the best junior college players in a while last year he committed to Louisville but decided to declare for the draft. If he didn't declare scouts were saying he was lottery I hope he develops
No option for Jay Scrubb?
"You know, I think we probably tanked to avoid the Lakers, too(and don‚Äôt really think it matters either way, dunno why you do), but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs impossible that rest was more the goal here anyway. We have a deep rotation this year, and not playing guys and giving them rest for the last two games of the regular season which were pretty meaningless anyway, especially in a season that saw some serious injuries this year. Like we rested like 10 guys. We‚Äôve basically played everyone we‚Äôve rested those games.   And hey, what if jay scrubb or otoru popped off? They hadn‚Äôt had any opportunity resembling that in the nba before. Rodney mcGruder did against Portland the year before in a game we were similarly tanking against.   , the Lakers still almost lost the first play in game to the warriors, that came down to a pretty bad illegal screen call on draymond. If the Lakers hypothetically beat the 9 seed grizzlies, we‚Äôd of ended up in the same bracket anyway."
My boy Jay Scrubb ain‚Äôt even see the floor
Only 2/4 the rest of the way. What a Jay Scrubb
Just gonna diss my guy Jay Scrubb like that?
Okay but why does Jay Scrubb have 0 minutes? Dude was balling before the playoffs ü§£ü§£ü§£
Jay Scrubb bout to play 40 minutes.
Jay Scrubb sounds like the name you would give to a fake player in 2k who you made to intentionally be the worst player of all time
Jay Scrubb needs to play more.
Jay Scrubb is such a good name for a tank commander
"HEY     Jay Scrubb was on the r/ripcity draft board, you watch your dirty mouth with that slander"
"I remember it was either a Blazers fan or Mavs fan saying ""I swear to God there will be violence if we get eliminated by the Clippers because they played some dude named Jay Scrubb and outtanked OKC to avoid LeBron"" lmao at least he's good if he's a Mavs fan."
I literally kept saying this last week. Was told it has nothing to do with mental and their mental is fine. Was also told they were resting to be fully energized for the playoffs and they did not tank to avoid teams and that Jay Scrubb is a valuable player.
"They could've had Portland if not for letting Jay Scrubb play 30+ minutes and gifting one of the worst teams in the league a game. They didn't have to say ""we want the Mavs"" for us not to know the obvious."
"I know it's not the point of your post, but Jay Scrubb is a rookie who has been injured and rehabbing the whole year, hence the 68 DNP's."
I know you‚Äôre joking but looking at the box score for that game they tanked is fucking hilarious. Clippers had some guy named Jay Scrubb play 36 minutes? He had 68 DNP-CD‚Äôs this year. 42 minutes of Patrick Patterson?!
Need more Jay Scrubb
We played jay scrubb 40 minutes
"It's not every year an injured rookie makes a palpable difference like that, but we understand the pain. If Jay Scrubb played more than 3 games, we coulda been 1 seed."
1. Kawhi 2. PG13 3. Zubac 4. Ibaka 5. Marcus Morris 6. Terance Mann 7. Reggie Jackson  8. Jay Scrubb
"Thank you, Jay Scrubb."
2k hall of famer jay scrubb to you mate
Jay scrubb: my 15 minutes of fame are over üò≠
I can't believe the Clippers put a guy in named Jay Scrubb when they are trying to lose.   Such a perfect name
"*Jay ""I don't want no"" Scrubb"
"Jay ""No"" Scrubb"
Jay Scrubb is about to push the Thunder to OT all by himself
No way Jay Scrubb plays this poorly
fun fact Jay Scrubb is the first JUCO player drafted since 04
"Throw in Jay Scrubb for 48 minutes and it may be a toss.  But anyways, my point is clippers won‚Äôt be tanking, them losing would mean they would face the mavs which I think they wouldn‚Äôt prefer. Them losing today just put nuggets at a spot where the nuggets have no choice but to throw the last game or face the lakers in round 1."
"You played Jay Scrubb for 40 minutes and Yogi Ferrell for 30 minutes while giving Zubac and Morris a combined 12 minutes. It was a blatant tank, you can stop spamming comments trying to tell people otherwise."
"Trying and losing is one thing, not trying and losing is another. Jay Scrubb playing 40 minutes is daylight tanking. If Jokic isn't playing on Sunday, its tanking."
"Explain Jay Scrubb playing 40 minutes against the rockets, I‚Äôll wait"
"Jay ""I Don't Want No"" Scrubb"
2k legend Jay Scrubb
And so the legend of Jay ‚ÄúScrubb Daddy‚Äù Scrubb begins
"Little did OP know that this time next year, Jay scrubb will be known as the greatest of all time. How wrong he was about the scrubb lord"
Blazers legend Jay Scrubb
jay scrubb
I still can‚Äôt believe a guy named Jay Scrubb exists.
Blazers legend Jay Scrubb
Jay Scrubb sounds like one of them 2k auto generated names for the Draft Classes lmao
If we have to play the Lakers cause of a dude named Jay Scrubb Ima be so pissed
Jay Scrubb is like nahhhhhh
The legend of Jay Scrubb begins tonight
Bruh how can you leave out my guy Jay Scrubb?
Even Jay Scrubb?
"They were playing the Rockets and the Thunder, and they chose to sit not only Kawhi but also PG in both games.  Not only that, but they also played Yogi Ferrell meaningful minutes in both games.  NOT ONLY THAT but they literally also played a guy named Jay Scrubb in both games, and started him in the Thunder game.    So no, it was not just to preserve Kawhi.  The Clips were definitely tanking."
"Jay Scrubb, Clippers, 2nd round pick, missed most of the season due to injury but he showed flashes of being a productive player when he was finally able to play.  He's got good size (6'5"", 6'10"" wingspan), he can handle and shoot, good athlete.  Gave me some Terance Mann vibes.  [Jay Scrubb 17 Points Full Highlights (5/14/2021)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5fnNRmkTGA)"
Put in Jay Scrubb!!
#JAY SCRUBB MAKES AN APPEARANCE
Clippers gotta put in Jay Scrubb
Wtf the clippers have a player named Jay Scrubb? That's the ultimate human victory cigar.
who the hell is jay scrubb on the clippers lmao. thats a pretty unfortunate name for a bench rider
"0-2 Clippers will activate powers that turn Jay Scrubb into Jay Goat, Kawhi is only a recipient of this gift."
"They can send him here via trade, We will send Daniel oturu and Jay scrubb. These aint made up names btw."
"He may be a Scrubb but at least he's a ""Jay""."
Do you think Jay Scrubb should also see some heavy minutes?
~~Josh Smith~~ Jay Scrubb hitting [57%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201505140LAC.html) from 3?

Jay scrubb or Terence Mann
Jay Scrubb
"If we make the finals, jay scrubb is playing 40 minutes in games 1 and 2."
TIL Clippers actually have a scrub on the bench   https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4683023/jay-scrubb
Jay Scrubb is on the Clippers active roster?
"Daniel Oturu, Jay Scrubb, and Patrick Patterson took that personally."
Jay Scrubb***
#Put in Jay Scrubb!
I hope the Clippers play Jay Scrubb to rub salt on the Jazz's wounds
The cherry on top of this Clips comeback and Jazz meltdown would be if the Clippers decided to sub in Jay Scrubb at some point
Lmaooo at Jay Scrubb
jay scrubb
He may never have played a game that matters but I'mma say it Jay Scrubb
Lakers fans ready to shit on every clippers summer league player. I need a 2 paragraph post about how Jay Scrubb is a bonafide scrub.
"Jalen Suggs and Jay Scrubb, some very unique names."
Pretty good for their first game.   Keon was aggressive with 3s and was great on defense  Bj Boston was decent on offense but was good on defense with his length and quick hands  Preston had 8 assists and was great out there  But Jay scrubb was a walking bucket and had like 25 points
Blazer legend Jay Scrubb
"Terance ""the Boat Rocker"" Mann and Jay ""Don't Want No"" Scrubb"
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don‚Äôt bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"

Jay scrubb better
jay scrubb MIP incoming üòà
"yeah honestly agree  his stats only misrepresent him to super casual box score readers that just look at points and are like 'hurr durr jay scrubb better'  his rebounds, assists, stocks, +/- etc all are always pretty good"
"538 really missed an opportunity to go with the ‚ÄúJay Scrubb- Scrubb,‚Äù pun. Nate my dude you gotta work on those algorithms."
I‚Äôm here to support any and all positivity toward Jay Scrubb
"Jay ""don't want no"" Scrubb"
Jay ‚Äúnot a‚Äù Scrubb
OP is wrong there but the Clippers were tanking to avoid the 2 seed and playing the Lakers.  They started Jay Scrubb when they still had a shot at the 2 seed
Don‚Äôt insult jay Scrubb pls. Suns went to the finals on backs of injured teams and their fans think they above it all üòë
The Clippers legit tanked two games against the worst teams in the league though? They lost to the Rockets (17-55) and the Thunder (22-50). Both of those teams were trying to tank since it was the end of the season too and they wanted the best chances for a good pick.  The clippers started Jay Scrubb those two games‚Ä¶ he shot 13/33. He only played 4 games over the season. It‚Äôs one thing to play your bench but this guy never even played and he‚Äôs taking the most shots. The Clippers ducked and didn‚Äôt want the 3rd seed.

"Imagine being named Jay Scrubb and making it to the NBA, guy deserves a documentary."
Jay Scrubb - He's a scrub
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
Jay ain't no scrubb
De‚ÄôAron Fox: Is fast and cunning on the court like a fox   Josh Hart: has a lot of heart on defence   Rodney Hood: came from the hood  James Johnson: has a big johnson   Kendrick Nunn: is religious   Derrick Rose: Rose up several times when being down with injuries   Jay Scrubb: is a scrub / relatively unknown player in the NBA   Colin Sexton: has a ton of sex  Justice Winslow: Has never broken the law/his teams total wins are low when he plays for them

"I wanted the Blazers to draft Nwora so badly in the 2020 draft with the 46th pick, the bucks grabbed him one pick ahead of us at 45.  The Blazers sub was obsessed with Jay Scrubb, but I knew Nwora was an NBA ready wing.  Seemed like such an obvious hit of a pick, never should have slipped to the second round."
He needs to get on that jay scrubb juice. Man went from 185 to 220 real quick.
"So, what are your thoughts on Jay Scrubb?"
"If we are talking about straight up bench warmers, Jay Scrubb, Brandon Boston, Usman Garuba, Cam Thomas."
KAT was outscored by Jay Scrubb yesterday to give u some perspective
