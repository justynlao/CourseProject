Jalen and Jaden mcdaniels? Jalen plays for the hornets and Jaden for the Wolves
"Edwards has so much potential. My dream for him and the T-Wolves is we end up getting that top three pick, draft Jalen Suggs, trade Dlo for literally anything, and end up putting out a starting lineup next season of Suggs, Edwards, McDaniels, Vanderbilt, and Towns."
jalen mcdaniels  sophomore tho
He’s talking about jalen mcdaniels
I'd protect Jalen McDaniels before Vernon Carey but that's minor stuff.
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
LaMelo  PJ Washington   Miles Bridges  Jalen McDaniels  Terry Rozier  Devonte Graham  Cody Zeller
"Ball, Graham, Bridges, Washington, Monk are the only five that I'm sure I'd protect. Tempted to go with Jalen McDaniels and Gordon Hayward with the other two, but I doubt an expansion team wants to clog up half their salary cap on Hayward (when the Bobcats were brought into the NBA, they were only allowed 66% of the cap their first year) or a third on Rozier.   I'd be fine letting Hayward, Rozier, or both walk away for cap relief. I don't think either has actual trade value we'd be missing out on."

Ain't google that hard man it's on the wikipedia page  https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/former-federal-way-hoops-star-jalen-mcdaniels-sued-for-allegedly-secretly-videotaping-teen-girls-having-sex/
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn’t have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year’s. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte’ Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We’ve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he’s definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he’s still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We’re still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we’re young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we’ve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
The CHA box score isn't even close to correct.  Caleb Martin definitely played.  Jalen McDaniels definitely played.  Hayward had 27 minutes towards the end of the third.  Lamelo had more than 9 points.
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
"Where do the Ball brothers rank among active NBA brothers?  I got em 2nd  1. Steph and Seth 2. Lamelo and Lonzo 3. Giannis and Kostas (or Thanasis) 4. Jrue and Justin (or Aaron) 5. Brook and Robin 6. Marcus and Markieff (yeah I know that's disrespectful, but they're slacking this year) 7. Cody and Caleb 8. Jalen and Jaden (yeah the McDaniels are worse than the Martins)"
"LaMelo Ball / Cody Martin / Caleb Martin / Jalen McDaniels / Bismack Biyombo  It's our own death, but still"
"People think I'm crazy but everytime I watched the Celtics last year it always stuck out to me how freaking good Hayward is on defense. There was a game against us in the 1st Rd before he got hurt where he had 4 steals and forreal he was just dominating on defense.  He's a solid man defender but what really impressed me is how he plays passing lanes and protects the rim. You go from having a super versatile forward who can switch on to anybody to playing theis at the 4 and you're just not nearly as versatile anymore. I dunno how you replace that really.   Forreal you look at what's made the hornets competitive this year, they play a ton of small ball with Hayward basically at center sometimes with Jalen Mcdaniels or PJ Washington up front, they don't do it a lot but they kill it when they do +/- wise.   I hate the celtics but just as basketball fan I'm almost sad they couldn't make it work because they damn near had the ideal combination at the 2-4 positions. All 3 guys legit two way players with defensive range."
Wasn’t McDaniels like the best HS prospect in his class or am I thinking of Jalen
I mean we literally have a guy in the g league who is better than him in jalen mcdaniels.
Jalen mcdaniels looks very good. Can't believe we haven't been playing him at all this year.  Watch the same thing happen with Vernon Carey when he starts playing. Borrego can be a little slow.
"Nothing to add here, but I just want to say that I noticed Jalen and Jaden McDaniels have the exact same “run.”"

Jalen McDaniels going to need a bottle of Jack Daniels after this one
"Where are my hornets fans.       Jalen McDaniels flashes shit like this.  I think he's 1-2 seasons away from being a very good player.     Brad Wanamaker was very clutch with passing, defense, and a couple of timely shots in the 4th."
TIL there is a Jalen McDaniels and a Jaden McDaniels
"Give me your top-10. Not saying you're wrong, just interested to see who you got over him. Hali, Ball, Edwards and Wiseman are obvious choices, Jalen McDaniels is quite good, Poku has been decent post ASG, but is still shooting horribly, same can be said about Anthony and Maledon. Avdija is okay but not spectacular and I'm kinda blanking on who else could be in the top-10, it's not that deep of a draft."
"Aside from Jalen McDaniels, I would trade any of the other 4 Hornets for any of those 5 Celtics"
"Yes because they’re better than Jalen MCDaniels, or the average wing you can get for free right now like MKG"
Jaden and Jalen mcdaniels
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
"For those who don't know who he is. He is the brother of Jalen from the Hornets. He was a top 5 high school prospect who had a rough year at Washington before falling to 28.  He's a skinny 3/4 hybrid that was seen as a project that would take about 3 years.  Due to poor performances from all of the PF's on our roster as well as dudes filling in at the 4 (Okogie, Layman, Juancho) both Vanderbilt and McDaniels ended up being forced into rotation.  Jaden has been an absolute revelation for us. He's a fearless defender that loves to get a block and is a decent scorer putting up a career high against New Orleans.  He has been the brightest of bright sparks this season alongside Malik Beasley. Some of our beat reporters like Britt Robson even believe that he will be better than Anthony Edwards, whilst that is unlikely, the sky is the limit for Jaden"
Jalen McDaniels being a rotation guy is a stretch. I think the threshold should be higher than 100 minutes. Maybe 300 min? 250?
"Stanley Johnson sucks but he isn't next level, do-everything wrong-and-then-some terrible like Baynes  Edit: This post made me realize that Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels are two different people and some confusion I've had during the season now makes a lot more sense"
brother of Jalen McDaniels
"Hmm.  - Bridges was a good pick in the business sense, since we got two extra second-rounders which were then packaged in another deal... to move back all of one spot. It's blurrier in the basketball sense, since in the long run that trade helped lay the groundwork for Paul George to LA. We sort of facilitated the Clips getting their guy in SGA, and SGA is really good.  I suppose the final judgement is going to come down to how much you as an observer hate things working out for the Clippers.  - PJ has been more of a good pick than an amazing one.  - LaMelo, well, yeah.  - Graham, well, yeah. Anytime you get an actual NBA player out of the second round.   - I'd quibble a bit with the description of Cody Martin as 'good'. Longterm for second rounders I'll be rather more interested in Jalen McDaniels or one of the bigs we drafted this past draft.  - People had jokes about the Terry contract, and it did take a while for Terry to actually start being good on the regular. His raw numbers were definitely masking a guy with a legitimately lethal jumper, and part of why he's been so improved is cutting back on the things he's not so hot at (in addition to simply getting better at some of them). Likewise jokes about Heyward, but signing a guy with All-Star type of talent to Charlotte is generally going to require a lot of money."
How do they mention Cody Martin but not Jalen McDaniels?
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"It really is absurd.  Starting with the 2016 class, wroten, thybulle, Isaiah Stewart, jaden mcdaniels, jalen nowell, Markell fultz, marquese chriss..."
TIL: Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels are two different people

"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
Jalen McDaniels too
And let's not forget that Graham was a second rounder. Vernon Carey Jr. and Jalen McDaniels both show potential as well.
"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else. We're not a lock for the playoffs now, but are a play-in team.  Malik Monk, Miles Bridges, Devonte' Graham, PJ Washington, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Martin, Caleb Martin, LaMelo Ball, Vernon Carey, Nick Richards, Grant Riller, and Nate Darling have never seen the NBA playoffs.  Hayward (Utah and Boston), Rozier (Boston), Wanamaker (Boston), Biyombo (Charlotte and Toronto), and Zeller (Charlotte) have been there before."
"With all the injuries we've had recently, Miles/Jalen McDaniels/PJ has actually been fairly successful. They've been calling Jalen a 3 but all three of them are natural 4s"
"Nice! I also have becomes intrigued with Jalen Mcdaniels, can some hornets fans tell me about him?"
Twin really tried KD like he was Jalen McDaniels in practice.
He’s average IMO but he waited a long time to give  some good players minutes. Jalen Mcdaniels and Monk were buried behind the martin brothers.
"Good lord, Gerald Henderson just said Jalen McDaniels is the Hornets version of KD and even Ashley was stunned."
"the crazy part is our last 4 opponents have also been without their top players. We've played against nothing but bench units- we capitalized on two of them but simply ran out of gas in the last two because we straight up don't have anything left in the tank. Teams that are only 8 or 9 deep and then filled out with D-League caliber players aren't built for this, thank god Jalen McDaniels is emerging."
"they keep going back and forth. PJ looked better last year, Miles looked better to start the season, then PJ looked amazing for a month, then Miles took over again.  I don't feel the need to offload one or the other, I want to see what they're both capable of. I don't think either is a high level starter, but both can be average starting PFs in the future, with Miles having the ability to play a little SF if he improves the handles, and PJ a little C if he bulks and improves his rebounding.  Throwing Jalen McDaniels as a 3rd good looking PF will make things interesting eventually but I'm fine keeping them all around for now."
"Jalen McDaniels looks like a legit stud, but yesterday aside, I want to give Brad Wanamaker a shout out for looking like a competent backup PG."
"Yea but that changed when he got back though. Before he came back we had a better record with LAmelo. When he came back we had Miles get Covid, Graham and PJ missed games, and Gordon was hurt.  We have a very good backup point guard in Graham. Our backup for Gordon is either or the MArtin twins or Jalen Mcdaniels."
"Our starting lineup for about 5 games there was Brad Wanamaker, Devonte Graham, Jalen McDaniels, Bizmak Biyambo, and Vernon Carey......"
that's great but you haven't considered the possibility that Jalen McDaniels could win
"Graham has easily been the best second rounder in team history, and nobody is a close second. The next best second rounder in franchise history might very well end up being Jalen McDaniels to be honest.   Even going back to the original franchise, his only real competition is Lee Nailon, Malik Rose, Ryan Hollins, none of whom elevated past being average 8th men on okay teams."
&gt; Hornets went 23-42 last year  Without LaMelo Hornets still went 10-11.  They added Gordon Hayward this offseason. Miles Bridges and Jalen McDaniels both improved.  To act like he was playing with scrubs is simply wrong.
"Lamelo is the best rookie in the league, PJ is a solid center for small-ball, Terry is a 45%+ shooter on 39% from 3, Jalen McDaniels has been electric since coming up, Bridges is solid on both sides, and the Martins/Monk provide good depth. Purely off of talent, Charlotte is a better team than Indy/Washington, even without Heyward. They've been getting outcoached. Don't know why you thought you knew more about the team than someone whos followed them all year lmfao"
Jaden and Jalen mcdaniels are gonna be defensive forces for a while
"Just learned there's a Jaden McDaniels and a Jalen McDaniels  I was like ""wasn't this mf cooking the Wizards in the 1st half earlier today???"" even got similar hair lol"
Also a lot of Jalen/Jaylen’s:  Jalen Green (2021 draft)  Jaylen Brown  Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Johnson (2021 draft)  Jalen Lecque  Jalen Smith  Jalen Suggs (2021 draft)
The amount of Jalen is actually unsettling:  - Jalen Suggs - Jalen Green - Jalen Duren - Jalen Harris - Jalen Lewis - Jalen Adams - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Lecque - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith - Jalen Wilson - Jalen Pickett
Jalen McDaniels is Jaden's brother lol
"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
Never know which is which between him &amp; Jalen McDaniels on the Hornets
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
You could have a deep team if you chose Jalen   - Jalen Rose - Jalen Green - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Johnson - Jalen Suggs - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith  Funnily enough a lot of them are really young
"I really couldn’t care less about Cade, Mobley or Green I’m most excited to watch Bones (hopefully he gets pt) and Jalen Suggs  A couple guys from the 2020 draft are Tre Jones and Jaden McDaniels"
Jalen and Jaden McDaniels
A lot of people forget about Jalen McDaniels as well. I think he can still be something.
"I hope more than 15 of them become NBA mainstays just so I could field a team of Jalens on 2k.   A starting five of Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Brown, Jalen Johnson and Jalen McDaniels is easily a playoff contender, albeit a little backcourt-heavy.   Right now tho the bench seems pretty thin with Jalen Brunson as the only sure thing."
"Charlotte has Jalen McDaniels on the roster, brother of Jaden"
"Charlotte has Jalen McDaniels on the main roster, brother of Minnesota's Jaden McDaniels"
"Jalen Johnson did i think, but I’m talking about mcdaniels"
Jaylen Brown  Jaylen Nowell  Jalen Johnson   Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Brunson  Jalen Smith  Jaylen Hoard  There’s also 2-3 other Jalens/Jaylens who are young UFAs
Jaden and jalen mcdaniels. Juancho and willy hernangomez.
"Edit, some of these only have 2 brothers but still cool: Or the McDaniels, the Zellers, Morrises, the Martins, Curry's, the late gasols, Rush's ect..  I challenge anyone to find more nba siblings on a roster than the hornets past two years  Last year 20-21 5 siblings : Cody, LaMelo, both martin twins, Jalen McDaniel  5 again 21-22: This year we lost Zeller and a martin but gained a plumlee and possibly liangelo"
"I doubt he gets *paid*, but I like the idea of a dignity and trade for a small deal to Chicago. Lauri for Biyombo and Jalen McDaniels. Gives Chicago some players that can see the floor for short spurts for the front court depth."
"That would probably work for us if we can get a wing back in return. How is Jalen McDaniels? He seems kinda average, but maybe worth developing a bit."
Lauri as a starting five seems to just be asking for trouble defensively.  Especially with a team such as ours which already has no plus defenders outside of PJ and Jalen McDaniels  Miles and Hayward are fine but not plus on that end yet. At least yet for Miles   But the former has a bit too many lapses atm hope he improves on that end because his offense is slowly coming around
"The Wolves are one of the few teams that can make Simmons shine. The problem with Simmons is that you need to surround him with 4 shooters, but he can’t really play Center. That means you need a shooting Center if you want Simmons to thrive.   KAT is the greatest shooting center of all time, but not a great defender. That should make him and Simmons a great fit. Anthony Edwards is also really good at iso scoring, so he could get buckets in the clutch.   If they can keep McDaniels and/or Beasley, then the Wolves can run a starting lineup of:  Anthony Edwards (33% 3pt as a rookie), Malik Beasley (40% 3pt), Jalen McDaniels (36% 3pt as a rookie), Simmons and KAT (40% 3pt).   That’s pretty deadly."
"Charlotte has made a lot of use of their g league team lately and it’s paid off. Devonte, the Martin twins and jalen McDaniels. I expect Kai will see big minutes there (30-40 a night) and they sign another center for the season"
Would you trade Coby White in a deal that gets you Lonzo?   I could see the following trade as being a decent starting place:   Hornets Get:   -	Coby White -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo Ball  Pelicans Get:   -	Devonte Graham   Some smaller pieces might have to be added somewhere though. I also wouldn’t mind NAW going to the Hornets and other Bulls stuff going to the Pelicans. Maybe:   Hornets Get:   -	NAW -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo -	Jalen McDaniels  Pelicans Get:   -	Graham -	Tomas Satoranski  As a starting point.
"Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann and Jalen McDaniels all went after Smailagic too."
"2 of them are bottom 10 picks in the draft which are almost garbage.   2015 draft: 9/10 never played a game, the other lasted half a season  2016 draft: 3/10 never played a game, 5/10 were backups cut before finished their rookie deal, 2/10 were backups who finished their rookie contract and left the league  2017 draft: 3/10 never played a game, 5/10 were backups who didn't last their rookie contract, 1/10 finished his rookie contract and did not resign. 1/10 is **Monte Morris**  2018 draft: 2/10 never played a game, 5/10 did not last one season, 2/10 are playing backup minutes today, 1/10 is Shake Milton  2019 draft: 2/10 did not play a game, 3/10 did not last a season, 5/10 are backup players the best of which is **Jalen McDaniels (19 MPG)**  2020 draft: too soon to judge but 1 of them never signed with the team"
"LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Miles Bridges, Mason Plumlee.   Jason Preston, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, PJ Washington, Kai Jones."
"I understand it's value is pretty small But you can package it with other things to get actual assets.   And you can find contributors in that range. Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Jalen McDaniels are all recent picks in the 50s who have found big roles in the NBA quite quickly."
"Jalen Johnson is a great prospect on paper but reporters are saying that he’s falling due to his background, similar to what happened to Mcdaniels last year or KPJ the year before."
"do not forget the wolves prevented sachin gupta from taking the gm job in houston, which is only proper if they intended to eventually promote him from within.  this is the eagles going with jalen hurts over carson wentz.  rosas (wentz) may be good but flawed in the leadership category.  whereas hurts (sanchin gupta) is highly regarded in the locker room and has talent that is respected by many front office executives around the league.  also consider, four years ago, the timberwolves ownership stepped in to trade jimmy butler away when their general manager was not making headway.  it was said mulltiple times this offseason, the minnesota timberwolves were going to improve at the powerforward position via trade, and they got nobody.  had they gotten larry nance, they would'nt be in a standoff with philadelphia over ben simmons.  may we also recall that not only did anthony edwards fall into minnesota's lap, because they surprisingly got the #1 pick, but also that edwards was not considered a great fit in minnesota because they already had d'angelo russell and malik beasley scoring off the dribble.  meanwhile, the fact that the wolves already have in d'angelo russell what the sixers wanted from markelle fultz in terms of a 4th qtr closer makes them the very best fit for ben simmons in the league.    the wolves desperately need what simmons does well (defense, rebounding, collapsing defenses in transition and facilitating), and they already have people who excel at what simmons does poorly (4th qtr shooting and scoring).   Simmons-Russell-Beasley-McDaniels-KarlAnthonyTowns"
"Charlotte &gt; Washington &gt; Toronto   Idk why this isn't the consensus. Let's just look at the rosters real quick and see who people are over or under rating.  Charlotte: Lamelo, Rozier, Hayward, Bridges, Washington, Ish, Bouknight, Oubre, Plumlee, Jalen McDaniels, JT Thor, Kai Jones  Washington: Dinwiddie, Beal, Kuzma, Hachimura, Bryant, Neto, Aaron Holiday, KCP, Avdija, Kispert, Bertans, Trez, Gafford   Toronto: VanVleet, GTJ, Anunoby, Siakam, Boucher, Dragic, Barnes, Svi, Flynn, Watanabe, Dekker, Birch, Achiuwa  I see the Raptore as CLEARLY the worst of these teams. I think Charlotte is the the best, but tbh Washington is being underrated pretty heavily by most people in this sub."
"Lmao what? I agree Morey has to swallow his pride and accept less than what he wants, but as long as he does that, he’ll still get traded for better value than Wall + EG. whether that’s  picks, Malik Beasley and Jalen mcdaniels from Minnesota, or CJ straight up from Portland"
Lmfao is there seriously both a Jalen McDaniels and a Jaden McDaniels in the league?
Jalen McDaniels   lots of defensive upside and he shot the 3 well when Hayward was hurt and Jalen got minutes
"He shouldn't be a benchwarmer, but Jalen McDaniels has shown a lot of promise as a lanky, athletic defender who can play 3-5. If we're looking at true benchwarmers, Vernon Carey is our second round pick from last year who shown offensively at Duke and in the G-League bubble. There was some hope he could develop a shot, which looks unlikely, but the guy can really score and is a good rebounder. JT Thor is another second-round big man with shooting promise, he's a rookie and raw as hell so I doubt he gets minutes in our 4/5 glut but he has a good amount of upside."
"If the Kings offer Mitchell, then they’d probably have the better offer, but I’m not sure they want to offer Mitchell. They’ve been raving about him all summer.   I think the Cavs backed off of shopping Sexton after the draft as well. When those rumors came out, there was still speculation that either Jalen Green could drop to number 3 or the Cavs could draft Suggs. Now that the Cavs drafted Mobley, I don’t think that they want to trade for Simmons. A lineup including Simmons, Mobley, and Allen would never work.   If the 76ers do want Sexton, then a 3 team trade with the Wolves and Cavs might be the best bet. The Wolves can get Simmons. The Cavs can get Timberwolves picks and maybe Tyrese Maxey. The 76ers could get Sexton, McDaniels, Beasley, and Rubio."
There’s a jaden and a Jalen mcdaniels
"Doesn't matter. I'd probably take Scottie over every Jalen in the NBA **combined**.  Suggs, McDaniels, Green, you name it."
Where tf did Jalen McDaniels come from
Competing with his teamate Jalen and the McDaniels brothers @ 5-0
"I’m sure i’ll get accused of coping here, and that’s okay. I probably am. but people who would be considered starter quality on our team (miles bridges, lamelo ball, mason plumlee, pj washington, and i’m counting bouknight only because hayward, rozier, and kelly oubre were all out) accounted for a total of 82/240 possible minutes on the court. Our leading player in minutes in this game, jalen mcdaniels, is probably our 7th or 8th option on the team right now if not lower. we should have done better for sure, one of the worst games in NBA history is never excusable, but it’s not like this was the hornets best lineup getting destroyed. I’m sad bc it seems like nobody is taking that into account and just jumping straight to thinking we’re gonna be the worst team in the league in a year where a lot of hornets fans, myself included, have been excited to see what the team can do. I know it’s not that serious, but it has definitely been deflating for me personally."
Jalen and Jaden McDaniels on different teams tho
"I couldn’t disagree more. Mitch has done really well in the draft and free agency. R/NBA shit all over him for the first Rozier contract, but that same contract ended up being a bargain in hindsight. The Gordon Hayward contract was risky, but still has a ton of potential to work out. He’s by far the best free agent that Charlotte has ever signed, when healthy.   &gt;	literally zero players from the Swarm have developed into rotational players a la Miami or Toronto  Devante Graham developed into a MIP candidate on the Swarm. Jalen McDaniels seems to improving quite a bit too.   &gt;	Our scouting department is perhaps the worst in the entire league according to a few sources I’ve heard. And our player development is just awful  How can our drafts be good if our scouting *and* development is terrible. All of Kupchaks first round draft picks, PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, and LaMelo, have been pretty good so far. Bouknight looks like a really solid selection as well.   Mitch Kupchak hasn’t been perfect, but he’s been solidly good and leagues better than the Rich Cho era."
"PG: Jalen Suggs  SG: Jalen Green  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jalen McDaniels  C: Jalen Smith  For current players, ain't half bad"
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."

I think this front office is really trying to win a chip through good drafting tbh. I think there could possibly be a good trade for both teams somewhere where myles ends up in Charlotte but I honestly think that Mitch Kupchak wants one of our young guys to develop this year/ throughout the next few years and hope that works out. That’s just the way it seems to me. the reason we’re doing so well this year is largely because we have a couple guys coming off the bench that have taken really big leaps like cody martin and jalen mcdaniels who are now becoming genuinely great role players and for some reason it feels to me like the organization really just wants to keep running with the team we have now. idk maybe i’m crazy that’s just my theory on it
Does Jalen play defense? Mcdaniels is literally only in the game for his D. He looked promising rookie year from 3 (36%) but is down this year.  I think they're completely different players tbh.
Jalen McDaniels outscores his “better” brother by 10   Also something I have noticed is whenever lamelo and ant play each other they are always within 1 point of each other  🦍🕺🛸🐝
Very interesting to see how close some brothers are on this graph -Jaden and Jalen McDaniels and Cody and Caleb Martin.
Gordon  Terry  LaMelo  Miles  PJ  Cody Martin  Bouknight  Kai   Honorable mentions to Jalen McDaniels and Nick Richards
"Basically ever since Kupchak came in the Hornets have rarely made a wrong move:  * Hired Borrego, who's done a great job of cultivating a strong culture and atmosphere around the team, and has helped develop a lot of our guys. He's got his flaws no doubt, but he's nevertheless done a solid job.  * Drafting. His first draft netted us Bridges and Graham, Bridges is a stud and Graham turned out to be good (just didn't have a role by the time his deal was up). His second draft got us PJ (who's solid when healthy), Cody Martin, and Jalen McDaniels (both of whom are among our better defenders). Then last year he drafted LaMelo along with Nick Richards, who out of nowhere has become probably our best center (as recently as preseason he looked like trash).   * The Kemba-Rozier swap looks better every day.   * Hayward's provided the perfect vet savvy for a young team, although I still hate that we stretched Batum to make the $ work."
"LaMelo, Bridges, Rozier, Hayward, Bouknight, Washington, Jones, and Cody Martin (who has been a legitimately solid rotation player this year, believe it or not)  I would expect any of Oubre/Richards/Jalen McDaniels to be snatched up by an expansion team, and don't like it, but Jones and Bouknight have too much upside to let go."
"i’m glad we almost dug ourselves out, but god damn it felt like the hawks had our number all game. any time we almost got some progress for the comeback it was just like a highly contested 3 splashed straight in someone’s face or all of a sudden we leave kevin huerter wide open. we made a good effort but they earned that win for sure  edit: that call where trae clearly jumped into (I think) jalen mcdaniels had me sooooo salty. I thought we stopped calling those!"
I heard one of them call the 6’10” Jalen McDaniels “Terry Rozier” like three times lmao
From a neutral perspective:  &amp;#x200B;  SUPER SURPRISE:  Kelan Martin  - SF on the Pacers  Omer Yutseven - PF on Heat  Jalen McDaniels -PF on Hornets  Franz Wagner - SF on Magic  Malachi Flynn - PG on Raptors  Isiah Jackson - C on Pacers  &amp;#x200B;  NOT SURPRISING:  Scottie Barnes:  Patrick Williams  Mobley  Lu Dort  Tyrese Haliburton  Immanuel Quickley:  Tyrese Maxey
"Wizards making hornets bench look incredible defensively. Nick Richards, Cody Martin and Jalen McDaniels own the 3rd quarter tonight"
I always confuse Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels
Jalen McDaniels is legitimately terrible at defense. He was one of the only players I’ve ever seen who could go -20 in 4 minutes.
"Well there is Jalen McDaniels, who we never play for some reason.    Oh, well. Wouldn't be a Hornets season without one good player in JB jail."
That will happen when the best player on your bench is Jalen McDaniels. Hornets need to figure this roster out. Do they have guys coming back from injury?
"We need Jalen McDaniels, plays 3 and 4, can defend 4 positions, hits the deep ball, and is being completely misused on the Hornets right now so we could probably get him for a double double animal style and some fries."
Jalen McDaniels is being horrendously underused on the Hornets. It's like they WANT to have the worst ranked defense.
Jalen McDaniels needs to be getting way more minutes for the Hornets if they don't want to finish dead last in defense.
Even more alarming is Jalen McDaniels not cracking the rotation when he's clearly better than Kelly Oubre. Kelly just sometimes gets hot from 3. Jalen only played tonight because PJ was injured.
"Hello, do any of you have any centers you can spare for maybe a Cody Martin or perhaps a Jalen Mcdaniels?"
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I’m not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It’a a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he’s been with the Hornets he’s drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte’ Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."
"Ball, Miles, Pj, Bouknight, Jalen Mcdaniels."
Miles and Mikael Bridges…  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels…  Franz and Moritz Wagner….  Shit’s getting confusing.
Jalen McDaniels skinny but he looks like a body builder compared to his brother
