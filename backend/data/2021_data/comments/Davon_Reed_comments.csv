Davon Reed.
"Yeah and it only took him five years and a WCF berth to prove that maybe his talent was worth evaluating in a vacuum and not holding Ulis/Jordan Mickey/Canaan/Mike Jones/Dragan Bender/Jordan McCrae/Jimmer Fredette/Marquese Chriss/Jamal Crawford/Alan Williams/Alec Peters/Josh Jackson/Elie Okobo/Sonny Weems/Davon Reed/Jarel Eddie/Eric Moreland and dozens more of other's limitations against him.  Props for coming around, I guess."
*1 Davon Reed
"Elie Okobo, Josh Gray, Shaquille Harrison, Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Davon Reed, Elfrid Payton, etc. etc.  SO MANY G League point guards were sacrificed to the point god for this finals berth."
Davon Reed. Went to my high school. Always thought he could be a solid 3-D guy. Currently why I’m watching Nuggets SL games.
Trenton NJ   G: Davon Reed   G: Malachi Richardson  G: Dahntay Jones   PF: Dennis Rodman  C: Roy Hinson   Pretty terrible team but it’s Trenton. Rodman by far the most accomplished player from Trenton.
