"Its tradable so not awful, but he‚Äôs not been worth it for sure. He‚Äôs supposed to be Lou‚Äôs long term replacement but he plays with zero urgency to make anything happen.  He shoots really well but he hasn‚Äôt been more helpful than someone like Wayne Ellington would have been"
"At that point we're just making things up to justify the behavior.  No one is reporting that this is all he was doing, none of the reporters nearby, none of the players (Warriors or Pistons), no anonymous sources.  What has been reported/talked about is Toscano Anderson beefing with Wayne Ellington during the first half of the game (which Anthony Slater indicated was a significant argument, and also an odd one since Toscano Anderson wasn't playing and there's no known history with Ellington), then Macgruder coming over to the Warriors side and getting into it (which everyone also thought was odd)."
That is true to all these Pure Shooters or pure offense guys. Wayne Ellington ain't gonna be a lockdown defender
"I‚Äôve watched a lot of Mavs this season for obvious reasons and while COVID probably has affected them, the roster construction really doesn‚Äôt make sense. I see Luka being forced to drive into groups so often and no other player is a big enough threat to punish them. Mavs should look into Wayne Ellington."
LMAO this all started because wayne ellington was minding his own business
I totally agree with Wayne Ellington and I'm ok with Draymond/Klay comments too
"Juan, in street clothes, had as many points as Wayne Ellington."
"Wayne Ellington probably has one of the best reps in the league for a journeyman. Loved by every coach and player he has ever played with and by all accounts is one of the most genuine guys in the league.  If Wayne Ellington of all people feels like he's got to speak up and call out Klay and Dray that speaks volumes to me. Similar to the old adage paraphrased, ""if a man of few words speaks, you better listen""   That whole thing was just bullshit imo. Klay had no idea what was being said or what happened and decided to just use his mic to throw shade and everyone gives him the benefit of the doubt because he has that kind of influence. Dray then admits he didn't actually hear or see what happens but decides to follow Klay's lead and dig even deeper.   That's some classic HS level bully shit and it's ironic as hell that Dray talks about fake tough guy stuff while sitting behind a mic that Rodney will never have access to and when he's probably the biggest fake in the league who never stops running his mouth. Dudes like him always have a lot to say but are just full of air.   Regardless of who was in the wrong Ellington is right. This shit never should have hit the air and been out in the open like this. If they had a real issue with him then take it up with the guy don't just blast him while you're protected behind a mic and the court of public opinion giving the benefit of the doubt to the stars THEN call him a fake tough guy. That's some of the most hypocritical shit I've seen.  For people in this thread thinking this is routine trash talk it really isn't. Trash talk usually stays on the court and doesn't leave the court except for some rare bulletin board material between stars about to matchup.   These dudes are using their platform advantage to get the nba community to turn against this dude without really any context on the situation themselves. Pretty fucked up"
"For real. Wayne Ellington needs to get off of reddit and video game servers and actually check out a sports locker room some day, then he'll understand how god damn pathetic he is for thinking class or professionalism matter"
Wayne Ellington is a punk bitch.
He went to confront Juan Tuscano-Anderson individually about something he said to Wayne Ellington earlier in the game. It's not like he was starting something out of the blue. And he certainly didn't run to the media and tell them Juan is on his way out of the league or something like that.
r/NBA should really be focusing on how ridiculously good looking Wayne Ellington is.
"Yeah, I'm sure Wayne Ellington has no clue what it's like to be involved in sports"
"&gt; Juan Toscano-Anderson said something to Wayne Ellington in the first quarter.  Wow, you'd expect better from the legendary Juan ""91 career points"" Toscano-Anderson. He's probably gonna be out of the league soon. Why is he trying to start something like he's good or something?"
This whole post is soft as fuck. Rodney mcgruder is the type of guy to send a comeback the next day. And Wayne Ellington is lame for not handling his own
"Wayne Ellington should be in the ""who he play for"" Hall of Fame"
"Lol, actually both the Pistons and the Warriors players said that JTA said something to Wayne Ellington during the first half, instigating everything."
Exactly.  The bench was probably trash talking Ellington for having a bad night and Wayne probably mentioned it to MacGruder who came over to talk to them after the loss.
"Outgoing players: Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Mo Harkless, Daymean Dotson, Wayne Ellington  Incoming Players: Alec Burks, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Immanuel Quickley (rookie), Obi Toppin (rookie)"
Wayne Ellington?
"Actually , Wayne Ellington cleared the air on this. Rodney was just getting into Juan because Juan was talking shit to Wayne Ellington before."
I thought the Lakers guarded Blake wrong to be honest. They were daring him to shoot. The only thing he can do. Also wasnt Wayne Ellington on an insane hot streak in general?
"My thought is that it's ""he want us to chill with Wayne, huh"", meaning Rodney wanted them to stop talking smack about Ellington."
"He was sticking up for Wayne Ellington, that Anderson dude on the Dubs (was a DNP) apparently said something to Ellington during the game and McGruder was sticking up for him"
He did it apparently because of something Anderson said to Wayne Ellington during the game.
"There‚Äôs no clear footage. According to Draymond, McGruder got in Juan Toscano Anderson‚Äôs face after the game in defense of Wayne Ellington (?). JTA took his mask off lol then security stepped in &amp; separated them. Aftet this, you can hear Klay in his interview ask Juan off mic ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he say‚Äù and Juan answer ‚ÄúHe was talking crazy about...‚Äù but you can‚Äôt hear the rest. So who knows what he really said."
the brotherhood between Wayne Ellington and Rodney McGruder started this whole beef. The Heat are always there
Are Rodney and Wayne Ellington related?
"He was sticking up for his teammate apparently. If you watched Draymonds interview here, Draymond said Wayne Ellington told Rodney Mcgruder that Juan said something to him in the 1st or 2nd quarter. Rodney then confronted Juan after the game."
Wayne Ellington didn't hit a 3. Didn't score a single point. Yall can go ahead and shut that shit up.
Damn the Wayne Ellington hype train went off the rails tonight. Just a really bad night guy couldn't buy a bucket.
Celtics need to start trading some of these first round picks   There‚Äôs no reason for ainge to hoard them anymore. Celtics could use a good shooter and could probably get rose and Wayne Ellington for pretty cheap
Wayne Ellington is awful in a Knicks jersey we have established this
It's not stars. It's guys like Wayne Ellington that are balling out who can net their teams some last minute value while the contenders position themselves for the second half of the season.
"I completely forgot that Wayne Ellington played for us. Nice that Ed is still around, thought he was done after last season."
I'm honestly surprised Wayne Ellington is still in the NBA
Ed Davis somehow still plays for the Timberwolves and Wayne Ellington is on the Pistons (if you want to count him).
I grew up with Wayne Ellington.  I was 2 years older but I was in 1st grade with his sister alexi-rae.  We played ball for like 10 years together.  I love seeing him still having a very nice career.  I'll always root for my mans.
I would love to get Blake Griffin and Wayne Ellington for Kemba Walker and the TPE
"Why are you booing me? I'm right. Hes played for a bunch of teams. He's not a star. Have you ever seen anyone wearing a Wayne Ellington Jersey? No? That's because he's not that important. If he hit these numbers in the playoffs for a playoff team, we'd be talking about him, but a hot journeymen 10 games into an already very wierd COVID season isn't front page news."
"Wayne Ellington is genuinely scary right now, I‚Äôd imagine a scenario where he, Jackson, and Bey come off the bench and just snipe with impunity.  ü§§"
Wayne ellington is such a beast
Wayne Ellington was the original beta tester of the dribble hand-off 3s that you see Duncan Robinson feasting on these days
Lmao if Wayne Ellington steals it over grant and wood I‚Äôd actually love it
When the hell did we get Wayne Ellington
because he's Wayne Ellington.
Wayne Ellington is going off this year. Dude can hit a three from anywhere
Wayne Ellington
Wayne Ellington from 3 in the past 10 days:  7-11  4-9  6-10  4-6  6-9  4-8  6-9  Overall: 37-62 (59.7%)
"Also nobody really cares about Wayne Ellington, journeyman 3&amp;D guy on a hot streak, whatever"
We should make Wayne Ellington an all-star then. He‚Äôs got a higher RAPTOR than Jaylen Brown.
"Because he's Wayne Ellington, a 33 year old player for the worst team in the league."
Stop leaving Wayne Ellington open ffs
Lmfaoooooo Wayne Ellington
"Danny‚Äôs a good defender but he really struggles with elite off-ball movers (like a Wayne Ellington) and super quick guards like Scroeder or Kemba. Schroeder‚Äôs great, he‚Äôs such a needed dimension for that team."
"Not even close. Coming into this year Wayne Ellington had never shot 40% from 3 for a season where he qualified for the leaderboards. He's a good, arguably very good, three point shooter. Duncan Robinson is legitimately on track for like top 10 three point shooter of all time."
"&gt;Could get Wayne Ellington who's 90% the shooter Duncan is, for less than half the price. &gt;  Holy shit you are on crack"
Wayne Ellington?  Gtfo
"Could get Wayne Ellington who's 90% the shooter Duncan is, for less than half the price.  Any team that pays him the big money is going nowhere"
Wayne Ellington
I would have rather dropped DMC and streamed wayne ellington or some shit

Casey starts Wayne Ellington over him lol....
Wayne Ellington has always been a good shooter and it‚Äôs kinda puzzling how little minutes he gets sometimes
wait Wayne Ellington is still in the league? and he put up 17 points??
Wayne Ellington is playing fantastic right now so we might be able to trade him but if he comes back down to earth he could be a good shooter for somebody.
"i don‚Äôt really disagree with you, just feel he‚Äôs a bit under mentioned.  better than mentioning casey who is starting wayne ellington by the way. or bud who actually lost his own team the series last year due to minutes restrictions."
"I knew we'd be very bad, definite bottom 3.  Sad to see Killian hurt.  Glad to see our other rookies, Saddiq Bey and Isiah Stewart, look like solid picks so far. And Jerami Grant in balling.  Coaching is fine but you'll always get complaints from fans that we're overplaying mediocre nba vets too many minutes. The time will come in the doldrums of the season where the young guys are let out to run wild so who cares if we play Wayne Ellington 30 minutes a night for the first 2 months if it allows our young guys to safely adjust to the physicality and grind of the NBA, especially this season."
"He‚Äôs a scorer and did so efficiently, what, do ppl want him to turn into Wayne Ellington and be a spot up shooter now and take 7 shots a game?"
"It also says they have the highest full-strength rating (playoffs), that's probably more important than the percentage number. They're only 2% behind LAC and Milwaukee anyways.  The depth is soooo bad though, I think it's a very real concern. The buyout market is going to play a major role in their future -- will there be less buyouts with the expanded play-in seeding? If they can add even two quality players then that will be huge for them.   Maybe the Cavaliers buyout Javale McGee after adding Jarrett Allen. Trevor Ariza is a buyout candidate on OKC, not sure if he has anything left in the tank. Other buyout candidates: Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, Aron Baynes, Derrick Rose, Wayne Ellington, Ed Davis, Hassan Whiteside"
Hard to win when your second best guy is Wayne Ellington
At least Wayne Ellington can‚Äôt hurt us anymore. At least not with the Heat.
Wayne Ellington when he plays the Nets
"Last year the best ones were Marvin Williams, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris, Jeff Green, and MKG. 2019 was the best I can remember in recent years, Wes Matthews, Wayne Ellington, Enes Kanter, Jeremy Lin, Carmelo.  Realistic ones I can think of this year are Robin Lopez again and maybe Aron Baynes? If the Raptors continue to struggle"
manu ginobili  tony battie  bruce brown jr  wayne ellington  travis knight
Wayne Ellington and Anthony Tolliver
"Not that I think it's an incredibl trade, but I want the nets to thank kyrie for his professionalism by shipping him to Detroit for Blake, d rose, and Wayne ellington"
"I mean, Kyrie's kinda redundant now..  Just outta principle they should give him the fuck you and send him to Detroit for Blake, D Rose, and Wayne Ellington"
"Speaking of guards taken by Minnesota in the '09 Draft, TIL Wayne Ellington is still in the league."
"Hey Duncan! I'm a stat nerd so obviously I'm a huge fan of the guy with highest 3 point attempt rate in NBA history. I've noticed that, like you, both Shane Battier and Wayne Ellington have also had extremely high 3 point attempt rates during a season that they were coached by Erik Spoelstra. So my question would be did Spoelstra have to convince you to take more threes and do you think you would be taking more or less threes if you were put in a different system?"
"I've always had 2's in my jersey number but when I got to Miami Wayne Ellington was #2, Justice Winslow was #20 and Luke Babbitt had #22 so I decided to flip the 2's upside down and do 55. Also a big Jason Williams fan."
"&gt;He's averaging 1.6 assists per game while taking 19 shots. #1 &amp; 2 options on good teams average at least twice that - you're not going to be a good team if your leading scorer has that type of tunnel vision and isn't able to make his teammates better.  You gotta put things into context. The Pistons have almost no players capable of hitting shots around him (other than Svi who has been inconsistent this year, Bey who is a rookie and Wayne Ellington who isn't even really part of the rotation)."
"The thing with Bullock is that he did well in pre-season and the first few game so the season.  But the past 2 or 3 games...yeeesh.  Reminds me of Wayne Ellington last season, throwing up super quick 3's that miss most of the time.    &amp;nbsp;  I think he'll snap out of the funk."
"Not necessarily, but in some ways yeah.  Trading guarantees you a guy, with buyouts you can get left with nothing and no way to fill the spot if the deadline passes. Also, buyout guys typically aren‚Äôt notable contributors most years (Drummond will be a notable exception if he gets bought out, not sure if Griffin is gonna move any needles at this point in his career).  If anything, I think they make trades for deep bench guys way less likely. Why trade a 2nd for a Glenn Robinson / Reggie Bullock type when you might be able to grab Wayne Ellington for free? It also does lead to some contenders not spending their MLE in the offseason so they can offer it to the best of the buyout candidates."
"We need a 3 point contest of Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Doug McDermott, Wayne Ellington, and Matt Thomas"
Yeah so if Wayne Ellington could not sink 8 3s and if Rodney McGruder could be who Klay Thompson thinks he is that‚Äôd be great. We‚Äôre trying to lose around here.
Sharpshooter Wayne Ellington gave a look of pleasant surprise.
disrespectful comment. wayne ellington is a shooter and saban lee is a baller
"At least this will be a loss to a worthy opponent. I can't believe we got tripled doubled by both Plumlee and DSJ, allowed 8 threes by Wayne Ellington, and let Rodney fucking McGruder and Saben Lee (whoever the fuck that is) each drop 20"

Wayne Ellington has a beautiful smile
Wayne Ellington is like a modern day Gerald Henderson (Raptor killer)
"are you suggesting that a starting lineup of Wayne Ellington, Jarrett Jack, Saregy Karasev, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez isn't a national TV draw? smh my head"
"Most events except the dunk contest, three point contest and skills contest. Unless you count heat legends daequan cook, jason kapono, chalmers, wayne ellington and duncan Robinson allstars."
"18/19 was garbage and I dont hold that against him. I actually give him some credit for helping out Mudiay who I'm surprised hasn't found a team. 19/20 was a better team, and despite the improvements from Julius and barrett (and mitch who suddenly has like 3 less fouls per 36), I feel he underperformed        I say feel because, unlike players who I can see miss shots, it's kind of hard for me (a casual) to see what is and isn't a coach's fault. Fizz also had a third morris twin who couldn't miss a shot lol, and Wayne Ellington who filled in the time bullock missed decently well.       From the outside it also looked like guys were just confused, which probably led to some arguments. How do you hold your teammate accountable if you're both confused ?"
Am I wrong to call Duncan Robinson a cross between prime Wayne Ellington and prime Steve Novak?
I genuinely hate Wayne Ellington.
"I‚Äôd honestly be down to explore Horford as an option   Barnes seems to be the main target within the Cs subreddit but some other names tossed around    Terrence Ross, Devonte Graham, Alec Burkes, George Hill, Patty Mills, Danuel House, Wayne Ellington, Thad Young, PJ Tucker   pretty slim pickings tbh"
Wayne ‚Äòthe drain‚Äô ellington
Sixers could try to also trade for someone like Wayne Ellington or George hill to backfill some of Danny‚Äôs shooting.
A user in the sixers sub made these suggestions:  Korkmaz+2nd to the Pistons for Wayne Ellington  Ferguson+ Porier + 2nd for Bjelica   Scott+Bradley+Top 25 protected 1st for Hill+Muscala   Any of these would help us improve.   I really like the idea of adding ellington and hill.

Lakers should be trying to grab Wayne Ellington.  He‚Äôs on a super cheap contract.  Also rumors of PJ Tucker interest which they should jump on as well.
The Man with the Golden Arm - Wayne Ellington  13-0Karo - Okaro White  The Warden - Joel Anthony  Mario F*cking Chalmers  HEAT Legends
Korkmaz to Detroit for Delon Wright or Wayne Ellington.
"Prime Rose, Blake, Jerami Grant, Josh Jackson, rookie Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, Wayne Ellington. The Pistons would go from the worst team in the East to a playoff team, but I don't think they would have been title contenders."

This is shooting in general that I would take over Kat. Some are arguable but idk Kat isn't the best shooter on most teams in my opinion"
Wayne Ellington is on the case don't worry
"Would much rather try to make a deal for someone like Wayne Ellington to Philadelphia, anyways."
Wayne Ellington for a 1st probably get it done
may I interest you in Wayne Ellington
Wayne Ellington and his Ofer tried but Saddiq said no
"When Wayne Ellington and Blake Griffin signed their contracts they were much better than they are right now. Do you think Blake would get 40m a year if he was signing today?  Larkin is 28, he's not a young player anymore."
wayne ellington lol
"I know the feeling. There‚Äôs something special about those guys that gave it their all on mediocre teams. It‚Äôs why we love guys like J Rich, Rodney McGruder, Wayne Ellington."
"Bruce brown unfortunately didn‚Äôt really have a place on our team. We had drose, and just drafted killian at the 1 so we wanted to give him plenty of minutes to develop. Our other guards are Josh Jackson (whose def an improvement of Bruce brown), svi who is intriguing and I believe still has room to develop, saddiq bey who we just drafted whose been playing minutes at multiple positions, and Wayne Ellington who is a great veteran to have and has been killing it this season. We had too many players at that position and while he was good on defense Bruce‚Äôs scoring did not have the same ceiling as the other guys. His playmaking is good, but seems like there just wasn‚Äôt enough for weaver to want to keep him as a point guard after drafting hayes"
"More like Duncan Robinson is Wayne Ellington. Wayne broke multiple 3 point records while on the Heat, then he left and it seemed he fell off."
"Wayne Ellington, he shoots 50% from on ultra hard attempts, he was Duncan Robinson before Duncan Robinson for the Heat (the whole run all around handoffs and shoot) but was doing at a 38% rate more or less it was always more about volume than accuracy.  But this year he's making every off the balance stupid shot.  Also he's not been terrible defensively, he'll never be good, but whenever an opponent targets him he's been fine"
"The Pistons are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA - so I'd say a F.  The team's only pure shooters are Wayne Ellington (a vet who needs other to get him shots) Saddiq Bey (a rookie who is still inconsistent) &amp; Frank Jackson (a 2-way player who is shooting well form 3 for the first time in his career).  On top of that, the only offensive creators on the team are Jerami Grant (who is not yet a good passer), Hamidou Diallo (who only recently arrived in Detroit) and Josh Jackson (who is very inefficient).   On a bright side - the Pistons actually have a solid defensive team."
I‚Äôm sick of his adjustments man. Dude put Wayne Ellington at power forward to guard Julius Randle. Idek what he‚Äôs doing he changes everything every minute
"Lmfao I would. Our bench is literally a bunch of rookies &amp; hella soft vets. You really think Wayne Ellington and Delon Wright were chirping at Blake? Blake was literally the mentor, the leader, to 80% of this team a few weeks ago"
"**Killian Hayes** - started off slow, has looked like he has a much better pulse on our offensive movement since returning two games ago but still isn't scoring much. Really wish his success hadn't been tied to everyone's opinion of Kevin O'Connor because he's an extremely talented rookie who's been fine for what he was advertised, but because he isn't running away with RotY he's already been labeled a bust by some  **Isaiah Stewart** - was a fan favorite from day 1 for his hustle, but now his skill is starting to shine through and it's really exciting. He has shot 42% from deep (on limited attempts) and is above 50% from 10-16ft. His defensive hustle is insane (I believe he's leading rookies in Blocks per game) and he's a great offensive rebounder. He'll be fun to watch for a long time.  **Saddiq Bey** - came in as an NBA ready shooter (as advertised) but has shown a bit more ability than even that. He's put together a few moves with his back to the basket, can create his own 3 in a way that looks suspiciously identical to Wayne Ellington, and has put the ball on the floor as well. If he becomes a playmaker as well as a shooter, he should be a future all star.  **Saben Lee** - Isn't a revelation or anything but he looks like he'll last in the league which is pretty cool for a 2nd rounder. You can tell he's not comfortable with his shot but his ability to get to the rim and get fouled (or make the extra pass) has allowed him to stay on the floor. He also came very close to posterizing Vucevic so that was fun.  .  All in all, a pretty solid but VERY productive draft for Weaver's first year as GM. The future is exciting in Detroit."
Wayne Ellington wasn‚Äôt always old man
Why would you ever compare a defensive specialist to wayne Ellington?
"I‚Äôd imagine he could improve his three point percentage from 29% to at least league average, hopefully.   But yeah. I think he projects at best as a Wayne Ellington type role player.   Not everyone is going to be a star and that‚Äôs okay."
He's not even shooting that well from 3 though. 38.2% is good but not special. Guys like Justin Holiday and Wayne Ellington are making scraps and are shooting better than him.
Our best player was Wayne Ellington for a while and we still sold out tickets at a pretty high price.
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
Wayne Ellington and that damn smile he has.
"For whatever it's worth, even with Blake out, Andre was not the Pistons' first option, nor has he ever been. Pistons coaches have been variably open to trying to give Andre some touches in hopes of developing any semblance of a post game but they've all known better than to try to pretend he'd be a first or second option under any circumstances.  Injured Blake was still the first option for half of that series. Then it was pretty much anyone but Andre for the rest of the series. Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Wayne Ellington.   Andre's numbers can look deceiving; folks will interpret him as a certain option based off his scoring average. But his points are often a result of tip-ins or pick &amp; roll dunks. The times where he actually touched the ball as an option of sorts usually resulted in disaster on account of his incredibly low offensive skill (except for the few times where it works out, which then end up on a mixtape that makes him look like he's great).  Frankly, his TS%, for the type of skills he has, should probably be hovering around 65 percent or higher, because he has no business doing anything but dunking and tipping on offense."
I‚Äôll try for our team:  ‚Ä¢ Jerami Grant ‚Ä¢ Mason Plumlee ‚Ä¢ Saddiq Bey ‚Ä¢ Isaiah Stewart ‚Ä¢ Wayne Ellington ‚Ä¢ Dennis Smith Jr. ‚Ä¢ Saben Lee ‚Ä¢ Josh Jackson ‚Ä¢ Frank Jackson ‚Ä¢ Rodney Mcgruder

"&gt;He was a 19 yr old rookie lol.  And now he's a 20 year old second year player. And LeBron is 36. The title window is not gonna be open for that long.  &gt;KCP is shooting 40% from 3 on 4 attempts a game. Who are they finding on buyout better than that?  Avery Bradley (42% on 3.8 attempts), Wayne Ellington (43% on 6 attempts per game), Otto Porter (40% on 3.8 attempts). One of them will be bought out."
"Realistic targets would be guys Avery Bradley, Wayne Ellington and Gorgui Dieng. Unrealistic would be guys like Drummond and Otto Porter jr, but still being targeted."
"I think it's a pretty sure thing that you're not getting Grant. If you're getting anything, its some combination of Delon Wright, Wayne Ellington, and or Sekou Doumbouya"
forever almost sixer Wayne Ellington.
"No it‚Äôs not, Wayne Ellington was one of the best shooters in the league. Duncan Robinson is just a taller Wayne Ellington, pretty much his game is Ellingtons game as he was the player we showed film of."
Wayne Ellington to Philadelphia for Terrance Ferguson and a second rounder.  Troy Weaver has a thing for ex-Thunder players (as evidenced by the Mykhailiuk-Diallo deal yesterday).  Pistons have no need for a veteran sharpshooter during the restoration where he could contribute to the Sixers title run.
"Alongside Danny Green, Wayne Ellington and Ty Lawson."
"I'm not sure why, but I've got Wayne Ellington in that group too. I swear I've never seen the man miss a shot against us."
"His rotations are sus but i think a lot of them are out of his control. Like how he starts Wayne Ellington / Blake Griffin - clearly being instructed to do so in order to facilitate a trade.   He‚Äôs also improved his in game adjustments, often times we would randomly switch everything or go into a zone and confuse the opposition &amp; get a comeback.   I feel like he gets unnecessary stick from you guys. Like, he met prime Lebron every single time in the playoffs - you werent beating him. Maybe you wouldn‚Äôt get swept with Nurse instead of Casey, but you still would‚Äôve lost. Casey still developed your core, Nurse just had Kawhi added to it  I don‚Äôt want him at the helm when we‚Äôre back competing for a chip, but for now he‚Äôs great at development."
"Wayne Ellington, PJ Tucker, or Evan Fournier apparently"
"If you think resting Jerami, Cory, and Wayne Ellington is not purposely tanking I have nothing to say lmao. Upsets happen every year but this Pistons team has a much better point differential than their record shows. Wolves are improving and love Ant and KAT but until proven otherwise it‚Äôs a pretty mediocre team. It would‚Äôve at least been a close game"
"&gt;where both Cory Joseph and Wayne Ellington played over 30 minutes  Like I said, tanking"
"We had a win against the Grizzlies last week where both Cory Joseph and Wayne Ellington played over 30 minutes. Dont lump us in with the Thunder, who aren't even trying to hide it."
"DJJ from the Suns, Wayne Ellington, James Johnson. Honestly most of our roster from 2016-2019"
"The other guards with E are: Wayne Ellington and Dante Exum, and Ellington are already listed"
"Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez    They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge"
"PLUS: iq, burks, toppin, noel MINUS: Marcus Morris, Portis, Wayne Ellington   Starting Lineup is essentially the same cause mitch is hurt"
PG Coby White   SG Wayne Ellington  SF Rodney Hood  PF Harry Giles   C DeAndre Jordan  idk really. the best I could do
Wayne Ellington was on the roster before he was traded at the deadline and Sekou was our first round draft pick last year. Still a ton of new faces tho
I wonder how an Ish Smith/Wayne Ellington/Trevor Ariza/Thaddeus Young/Jeff Green team would do
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
"It is absolutely ridiculous how people thought KD would automatically join a Nets team when it had a starting lineup at one point of Donald Sloan, Wayne Ellington, Bojan Bogdanovic, Thomas Robinson, and Willie Reed. Like no. Sean Marks developed talent and poached players like D'Lo and LeVert to get to where they are now."
"By shitshow I mean  Dion waiters, Wayne Ellington, willie Reid or whatever,"
"You just got traded, along with second round pick, to the Pistons for Wayne Ellington"
Nah I'd rather not meet Wayne Ellington
Porzingis is a waste of god given size  7‚Äô4 and plays like Wayne Ellington
cant be scoring champ if his FG rate that assisted is like Desmond Bane and Wayne Ellington
Wayne Ellington honestly connects the Pistons out pretty quick. 11 years is nothing to scoff at. Not to mention he's been on something like 8 or 9 teams or something? He is a connections monster.
"Luke's never had a stretch as bad as Fizdale at the Knicks though.   Fizdale went 21-83 with the Knicks and had the worst spacing in the league despite having Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, and Reggie Bullock who would all go on to shoot over 40% from deep the year after he left. He's not only a shit coach but he makes players significantly worse"
Yea he‚Äôs really dumb at in game management for the most part. Whenever we faced the Knicks he kept putting Wayne Ellington on Julius Randle‚Ä¶
Wayne Ellington kinda DILF-esque
"&gt;	Plus 2 1sts, I forgot who they drafted. Maybe one of them was Randy Foye? Also considered like a can‚Äôt miss prospect. Just didn‚Äôt work out. Rashad McCants maybe, really can‚Äôt remember how those picks shook out.  One of them ended up being Wayne Ellington with the 28th pick. Whatever, not really an asset.   But the other pick was returning Minnesota‚Äôs 1st rounder to them, which ended up being the 6th overall pick only 3 years later. That Wolves infamously took Jonny Flynn with Steph Curry still on the board. (DeMar DeRozan was two picks after that.) And if a few ping pong balls bounced differently then that pick could have been Blake Griffin or James Harden."
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
When my team was in a tournament in 8th grade and Wayne Ellington was a 7th grader playing in the semifinals. Our team was already in the finals so I was scouting the game hard. He just made everything look so effortless. It was the first time I saw a kid younger than me play and knew he was a lot better than me without having to play against him.   His team lost that game and our team won the tournament but that day I realized I wasn‚Äôt as good as I thought I was.
"Four, yes.  And they played three of them. Their second pick, Wayne Ellington is still in the league."
They still drafted Wayne Ellington though.
"Re-sign Caruso, THT, Schr√∂der, and Morris.  Let Harrell and Drummond walk.  Trade Schr√∂der, THT, 2021 1st, and 2027 1st for Malcolm Brogdon.  Sign Dwight (vet min) and Wayne Ellington (MLE).  Brogdon/KCP/LeBron/AD/Gasol  Caruso/Ellington/Kuzma/Morris/Dwight"
Wayne Ellington
"It definitely isn‚Äôt a great fit, but I just don‚Äôt think you can turn down an opportunity for a player like Ben Simmons if the price is decent, ya know?  Plus, maybe we can get help him SOMEWHAT fix his jump shot. We turned Wayne Ellington and Duncan into 3 point competition shooters and helped LeBron get a jump shot. I‚Äôd think we could figure something out."
"Detroit's 2 best players last season (Jerami Grant &amp; Saddiqq Bey) are their starting forwards. They had Wayne Ellington starting for a while but Josh Jackson &amp; Hamidou Diallo will likely fight that spot this season.   Like, just like your team has set things up for Markelle Fultz to be ""The Man"", Cunningham will definitely be the lead guard for the Pistons."
"Fully aware. I worked in Reading when he was in high school. It‚Äôs basically the farthest stretch of the greater Philadelphia area. But that‚Äôs similar for Wayne Ellington saying he‚Äôs from Philly, but he went to my school in Douglassville (20min South of Reading) up until High school when he transferred to episcopal."

"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
"Do people in LA actually love Caruso or is it just an reddit meme? Like if he looked like Wayne Ellington, would he be talked about as much?"
The Lakers aren't that good and Westbrook was not that great of an acquisition. The roster they have set up requires Wayne Ellington to be a primary outside scoring option.
Because their roster is filled with a bunch of washed up vets. When you're relying on Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington to produce you're not getting very fat. The Lakers have zero shooting and their defense is half assed
"Give me Jeremy Lin, JJ Barea, DJ Augustin, Lou Williams and Wayne Ellington"
"Monk struggled a lot after returning from injury last season, but I think he can get back to form. Also THT, could argue Wayne Ellington and Nunn. I think Westbrook will also pull a CP3 and have a resurgence after everyone said he's trash"
"Huh? Everyone‚Äôs highlights aren‚Äôt this exciting lol. I just finished watching Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington, and Kendrick Nunns highlights and none of them are as cold blooded and exciting as these plays"
Wilt's 100 points is going to be broken by Wayne Ellington
"wayne ellington, kendrick nunn, malik monk"
"I'm judging it based on the roster that isn't at SL. Check the shooting splits you mentioned.  Bey is a good, not great, shooter. Grant is an average shooter. Jackson is a good, more volume shooter who won't get many minutes. Olynyk is another good, but not great shooter. Garza's defense is going to keep him off the floor, especially with Casey as our coach. This should be apparent from a mile away.  I feel like you're thinking 37-8% is great 3pt shooting and it isn't. It's just good. We were a poor 3pt shooting team last year (22nd @ 35%), and we lost Wayne Ellington and added Cade and Olynyk (a 37% career shooter). That doesn't leave us as a great shooting team."
Ariza and Wayne Ellington with Dudley as the trailer
"The title is literally, ""How much better is Buddy Hield compared to Wayne Ellington? Basic breakdown:""   I interpreted that at face value to assume that Hield's the better player.  If you weren't interested in a serious analysis why, why did you click on the thread?"
"I understand what you are saying money wise, but they are not very similar players. Wayne Ellington is a pure off the catch shooter, Buddy is a scorer that excels at off the catch shooting.   I advise anyone who hasn‚Äôt actually seen the type of flamethrower that Buddy can be to watch a few of these clips (at the very least, the first one against the Pistons):  [Buddy 35 pts &amp; game winner vs Pistons](https://youtu.be/QugJ4cirWNs)"
This analysis failed as soon as he went down this route. There's a reason why Wayne Ellington isn't getting 30 minutes a game
Never said he wasn‚Äôt. I agree with you. My question to you would be if you would rather have Wayne Ellington on the minimum or have Hield for $22 million dollars while also trading away Kuzma and Harrell (but Harrell doesn‚Äôt really count)? There‚Äôs a gap between the two players but is it that significant?
Buddy hield is better then wayne Ellington
"I'd still say it's still shooting. Wayne Ellington and Melo were good pickups, but I don't really trust them as starters at this point in their careers"
"Dude was so early to the facility, that he was even with the PR team, welcoming the other lakers free agent signees like Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, and Kendrick Nunn  Reminded me of the kid who showed up so early to class, that he started helping the teacher out with things üòÇüòÇ"
"Which big signing this year are you suspicious of? On the first day of free agency, all the Lakers did was annouce the signings of Dwight Howard, Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza. Did something get your hackles up about one or all of those?"
"Ah yes, the Lakers, with their blockbuster signings on day one of Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. Serious chicanery going on there."
"You mean the Wayne Ellington who played 46 games with the Pistons, shooting 42% from 3 on 6 attempts per game? Tf are you even talking about?"
"Last time you followed him must've been 3 years ago then. Now he's a (not that) young role player who only does one thing well (shooting threes) and does everything else at a below average level (and that's being generous) yet he still considers himself a starter worthy of $15m+ a year.  When you consider that last year Lauri shot 40% from deep, and had 14ppg and wants that much money, while 33 year old Wayne Ellington shot 43% from deep, had 10ppg in less playing time, and offers the exact same amount of playmaking and defense, and cost $1m, it's pretty clear why people aren't lining up to sign Markkane to a big long-term deal."
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
"&gt;Shooters get paid  No, playmakers get paid.  There are tons of guys who can shoot around 40% -- 100 players shot 40%+ last season.  Many are making near NBA minimum wage, guys like Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington, Jordan Nwora, and many others.  There are very few who can produce 6 assists per game -- only 22, last season, and almost all are very expensive, and none make close to the minimum."
"Players who are better per 100 possessions than Evan Fournier out of the min players on the Lakers roster. Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kendrick Nunn, Dwight Howard (arguably), and Wayne Ellington. Like his raw stats are better, but he isn't actually more efficient with the possessions he gets than pretty much any of them. He just has a larger role than any of them."
"When 33 year old Wayne Ellington can put up 43% from 3 and 9.6 ppg in 22 minutes, while providing exactly as much shot creation, playmaking and defense, for a $1m minimum salary, it illustrates why teams aren't lining up to pay Lauri $15m+ a year."
"Are we really under the notion that Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Carmelo Anthony is going to be some superstar combo in comparison to KCP Kuzma and the 22nd pick? Seems like a wash at best imo"
Yeah I‚Äôm sure teams were climbing over themselves to sign Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  ‚Äú The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.‚Äù"
You're going to get 31% from three Wayne Ellington and you're going to like it
You're going to get 31% from three Wayne Ellington and you're going to like it
"I mean we did sit guys like Mason Plumlee and Wayne Ellington and Jerami Grant a lot towards the last 10-15 games of the season. But yeah we still tried to win a lot for most of the year, we just sucked at it"
Wayne Ellington will start
"Yeah. Wayne Ellington has always been a sharp shooter. He‚Äôs the best pure 3 shooter, but can‚Äôt do much else. Guys like Melo and monk are more important because they will get more minutes because of their versatility"
Wayne Ellington had a 10 game stretch last season where he shot 43/77 from three. He can red hot in a hurry.
I don't get the Wayne Ellington signing. I forgot he existed is he really good enough to even play for them?
"Laker fans act like this but they hype up their guys more than anyone. Ive never seen as many pro-Carmelo Anthony comments in the last couple years as ive seen in the last 24 hours.  Seriously go back and look at last year‚Äôs Dennis Schroeder post and then compare it to the words on guys who either haven‚Äôt played in a year or were like the 8th man on a lottery team. Kendrick Nunn and Malik were solid gets for a bench backcourt esp at their cost, but no have no idea if they will perform to par in the playoffs, and I‚Äôm already seeing Pelinka won the offseason posts.  Also, I have no idea who is actually going to replace KCP as the 3&amp;D shooting guard for this time. All I know is, you have to be doing mental gymnastics to think Wayne Ellington or Kent Bazemore are upgrades there.   You think they‚Äôve been bad with the Bron stans + Laker fans together, now they got the Westbrook stans, and the Melo stans now. It‚Äôs gonna reach a zenith we haven‚Äôt seen yet"
Who else was gonna give Wayne Ellington anything less than the minimum
"Malik Monk - So insanely talented that the team that drafted him and is trying to rebuild it good young talent didn't even extend a qualifying offer to him.   Kendrick Nunn - So insanely talented that the Heat stopped playing him in the playoffs when they made a run to the finals.   Kent Bazemore - So insanely talented as a 32 year old he average a whopping 7.2 ppg and averaged a single made 3 pointer per game. I mean, damn, where do you get that kind of production?!  Wayne Ellington - On his 10th team he's bound to find consistency and success. This insanely talented sniper who turns 34 this year has shot above 40% from 3 exactly one time since 2014 -- last year in a 40-something game sample. The previous year he shot 33% on open catch and shoot 3s. I'm on the edge of my seat to find out if this middle aged shooter will find consistency in his 11th stop of his career!"
"what would be their ideal crunch-time lineup? They picked up some good shooters, but will Russ be able to fully accept deferring to Wayne Ellington for the final shot?  The components are there, but it'll be interesting to see how the execution plays out on the court."
you can't judge 3pt% from only one year. outliers happen(see Okc Shroeder).  Monk is a career 34% shooter.  Bazemore 35% last 3 years.  Wayne Ellington 38% last 3 years.
Wayne Ellington is a beast and will steal the DILF crown from LeBron
Wayne Ellington is a great 3pt shooter wtf.
All the players you signed are pretty bad and will most likely not be in your playoff rotation besides Nunn who took 5 million. Oubre is most likely gonna get paid in the 8-10 million range  EDIT: Yall Lakers fans are delusional do you seriously think fucking Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore will be in your playoff rotation
"First off, no he really wasn‚Äôt, seriously have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.  Second, even if he was, OP set the bar at ‚Äúthe greatest team of all time‚Äù so obviously the level of scrutiny is going to be significantly higher. So if you‚Äôre starting broken down Dwight and Wayne freaking Ellington then your other 3 players better be something like Lebron, Michael and Wilt to even be in the discussion."
Imagine saying this about a team with Wayne Ellington as starting SG and completely broken down Dwight Howard as starting C.
"&gt;SG- Wayne Ellington, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker  that's definitely an all time great list of shooting guards"

"Yup, exactly!  And, guess what?!? Older vets going to teams they hope they can win on is NOTHING FUCKING NEW!!  Jesus christ.  Wayne fucking Ellington joining the Lakers is not groundbreaking."
"- Trevor Ariza - 36  - Dwight Howard - 36  - Wayne Ellington - 34  - Carmelo Anthony - 37  Clearly age of the player isn't a big consideration for the Lakers, and Caruso is only 27."

Kendrick Nunn   Carmelo Anthony   Malik Monk  Dwight Howard   Trevor Ariza  Wayne Ellington  Kent Bazemore  My Guys ring chasing hard
I'd put my life on the line that the Lakers don't win this year. Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza as starters is woof. Also Westbrook hasn't had a good playoff series in 5 years.
"As of rn, they don‚Äôt have a backup pg and their backup sg is wayne ellington who probably shouldn‚Äôt get playoff minutes. they definitely need guard depth"
"The Pistons currently have 6 ACC players: Wayne Ellington, Jerami Grant, Frank Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, and Dennis Smith"
"Yes you missed my point, added Ellington, who was better from 3 than KCP, and KCP shit the bed in the playoffs. Wayne shot 42% on 6 attempts. Melo shot over 40%, your own Bazemore shot over 40%, and Monk shot over 40% on high volume. Yeah we lost KCP but they have made all the right moves to surround LBJ and Westbrook with elite 3pt shooters."
"Homerism aside, you're telling me the best fit around Bron and AD are a PG that can't shoot, the corpse of Carmelo/Ariza or guards that can score but can't defend in Monk or Wayne Ellington?   Don't get me wrong, I'm never counting out a healthy Bron + AD, but the post was asking about the most **complete** roster, and this ain't it chief"
Lakers new squad:  Russell Westbrook  Wayne Ellington  Carmelo Anthony  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  6th man: Malik Monk
Wayne Ellington
"Their scouting and player development is solid; they find hidden gems not only in the draft but in the pool of undrafted players. Their G-League program keeps churning out rotation players (Rodney McGruder, Tyler Johnson, Josh Richardson, Duncan Robinson). They seem to get the best out of guys, even revitalizing discarded veterans (Wayne Ellington, Dewayne Dedmon, Birdman, Anthony Mason had his only All-Star year with the Heat). They employ a lot of their former players: Anthony Carter, Keith Askins, Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Chris Quinn, Shane Battier, Malik Allen, Caron Butler, Kasib Powell."
Ok ur right 36 year old Trevor ariza and wayne fucking Ellington will lead lakers to the promise land. Westbrook will fold in playoffs and Lebron is 37 and looked 50% in the playoffs this year. But whatever makes lakers fell better
I agree that their roster looks worse than last year but Wayne Ellington was a quality signing. He‚Äôs lights out catch and shoot three. Better than any other current Laker.
"I doubted them in 2020 and they won the championship. They were my favorites to win it all last year and they lost in the first round. I see Wayne Ellington and Marc Gasol in this lineup and I reeeeeally wanna doubt them, which means they'll win it all."
"He‚Äôs not playing both sides.  He will say LeBron had a great roster and got carried if they win, he‚Äôll say it‚Äôs an embarrassing collapse by LeBron if they lose.  Basically he‚Äôs building up the Lakers teammates so he can shit on LeBron.  Pretending like Wayne Ellington is anything but a bench role player, like Ariza isn‚Äôt 2+ years past making a meaningful contribution, and like Dwight Howard will do anything but get 5 boards, 2 lobs and 3 fouls per game."
"Seriously lol, this is how superteams work. 90% of your cap goes to three guys and then you fill out the rest with veteran role players willing to play for cheap to win a ring. People are really trotting out dumbass takes like ‚ÄúLeBron is recruiting on nostalgia‚Äù like he has a bunch of nostalgia for Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington"
Well we can make an educated guess‚Ä¶  Maybe Lebron preferred Wayne Ellington over Caruso. That must be it.
I wonder why the most valuable team in the world didn‚Äôt match? I guess they prefer Wayne Ellington?
"If getting Trevor ariza‚Äôs corpse, old dwight howard, wayne EllingtonüòÇ and steph curry‚Äôs best friend are ur definition of stacked you are on sum.üòÇ"
"Oh, ok you're right.  Dwight and Ariza will be 36 this season.  Wayne Ellington 34.   Bazemore 32.  They still haven't peaked yet!"
"Bandwagons and Bron stans who joined in 2018 can finally answer ""Yes"" to the question ""Were you a fan when Wayne Ellington was on the team, though?!?"" üòÜüòÜüòÜ"
"If Bazemore resigned with the Warriors he wouldn‚Äôt have nearly as large a role as he could get in LA, he‚Äôs competing with Wayne Ellington to be a starter"
Dude we left that train after Wayne Ellington this is full blown fucking hilarious
Unironically better than Wayne Ellington
Wayne Ellington will probably start.
Wayne Ellington sucks
Kent bazemore and Wayne Ellington? I‚Äôm getting ptsd from the dark years
He was not a very good shooter lol. I say that as a big Caruso fan. We also signed Wayne Ellington. We need another 3 and D PG.
THT and Wayne Ellington as of like 2 hours ago
Wayne Ellington can't play defense and Ariza is washed. Couldn't care less.   The one time I actually feared the Lakers was in 2020 and they won the championship.   I didn't fear last year's team and don't fear this year's iteration. Enjoy the Westbrick experience.
wayne ellington shot over 40% from three the past 3 seasons and we resigned ariza and not done LMAO ur just mad your team is ass
Those are some sweet ass rose tinted glasses you're wearing.   Wayne Ellington? Trevor Ariza? They're career mid 30% shooters on the backside of their careers. Unless you mean Dwight. But I don't think you mean Dwight.
Wayne Ellington
"Bro it‚Äôs the rest of the league telling Lakers fans that, not Lakers fans crying about it.  And they still dont. They have Wayne Ellington. That‚Äôs one."
What other shooter do they have? Wayne Ellington? Lol
Wayne Ellington?
Former Cavs great Wayne Ellington.
Wayne Ellington signed with the lakers for 1 year
Wayne Ellington 1 yr to Lakers
Truly the Wayne Ellington of our times
Laker fans were too busy with the Warriors to notice Wayne Ellington back then.
Wayne Ellington was on the lakers before
Matt Thomas and Wayne Ellington come on down! Dipo on a minimum maybe?  They are gonna fill out the roster with as many minimum contract shooters they can now.
More like Wayne Ellington or something.
"Melo, Wayne Ellington, OPJ"
You‚Äôd take Wayne Ellington over Ben Simmons?
"Lakers got Bazemore, Wayne Ellington, Melo, Nunn, Monk now and LeBron will also be shooting 3s at a good clip. AD when he gets hot can also shoot from 3.  LeBron being PF size will help them play that lineup a lot more often than you think they won't...  And they def are high level compared to the 04 Lakers.. Who did they have to shoot from outside? Kobe kept jacking it up cause their bad offense couldn't get Shaq the ball in the post properly...   If they had good role players like before and didn't have chemistry issues that season, then they'd be better than this Lakers but that 04 team had those and thats why they were worse.."
Okay.  Now tell me why coveted FA‚Äôs like Wayne Ellington &amp; DeAndre Jordan decided to go to the Lakers on a minimum when almost every team in the league wanted to sign them for the max.
There‚Äôs nothing to cope about with wayne Ellington lmao cmon now
1. Hayes 2. Wayne Ellington 3. Pokusevski 4. PJ Tucker 5. Roby
"What is Vogels defensive system? As far as I can tell the system is to have young athletic players with large wingspans. I'm sure he'll turn 35 year old Melo into a 24 year old KCP. Rondo will be as good a defender as Caruso... Because Vogels there? Wayne Ellington who's on the wrong side of 30 and has never played great defense will suddenly have a defensive resurgence 15 years into his career because Vogel?  I'll implore you to go look at his Magic teams before he coached the Lakers; it's much less having a good defensive scheme, and more having 5 positive defenders on the court at a time. You're not going to scheme out Booker or Mitchell or Curry on defense."
"If you add LeBron, Melo, Dwight, AD and Russ that‚Äôs already 117k points or so. Then add DeAndre, Ariza, Rondo, thats another 28k. Then Wayne Ellington, Bazemore, Nunn, THT all sprinkle some in. I believe it."
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
"I don‚Äôt disagree with you. I just don‚Äôt like how the previous comment was phrased. Harden and Curry took advantage of the rules set during their time and dominated with their skillset the same way Bird and Magic did. Steph is still the shooting GOAT but to say Bird ain‚Äôt in the discussion of greatest is naive to say the least. If volume and percentage takes precedence over context then the likes of pure marksmen (really good in their own right) like wayne ellington, joe harris, duncan robinson, and jj redick will get the nod over Bird? But he was able to defeat all the ‚Äúshooters‚Äù back in his day in three straight three point contests whilst being around 8% better than league average for his 3pt shooting prime."
Wayne Ellington starts without a doubt.
The Lakers signed Wayne Ellington?
Do you really think Wayne Ellington and Malik Monk will be playing starter minutes and attacking Rudy Gobert at the rim in the playoffs?
lol fine then Wayne Ellington.  Same thing as monk. Over 40% from 3 60% from the restricted area.
"Lebron, Carmelo, Westbrook, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Trevor Ariza, DeAndre Jordan, Wayne Ellington. That's a very deep playoff team and it's not losing to anyone. Miles better than that Heat team."
Wayne Ellington gonna save the day
"Lakers also got Malik Monk, Dwight Howard, and Wayne Ellington, also has Aldridge even signed?"
Wayne Ellington and Malik Monk
"Shooting better from 3 this year is a really disingenuous way to say Jokic shot .1% higher on nearly half the attempts. If you apply that reasoning, Steph‚Äôs a worse 3 point shooter than Wayne Ellington and Grayson Allen is as good a shooter as Dame. Clearly that‚Äôs not true both because of the difficulty of their shots but also because volume matters in evaluating scoring.  Unless you rank 3 point shooters purely on percentage, 38.7% on 6.3 attempts per game is just better than 38.8% on 3.3 attempts per game. If one player is taking drastically more difficult 3s than the other, that‚Äôs a different argument but not one I think is relevant here."
Kemba Walker   Wayne Ellington   Oubre   KLove  Serge
Wayne Ellington actually has
"The Ryan Kelly, Robert Sacre, Wayne Ellington days for the Lakers. I was in middle school when we won in 09 and 10 and pretty much everyone living In LA was so sure we‚Äôd be in the finals for a long time to come, so it was freaking awful when we were in those dark days."
Dwayne Casey‚Äôs the main reason why he didn‚Äôt develop. Giving minutes to Cory Joseph and Wayne Ellington instead of developing Sekou. They were a crap team last season ‚Äî and still a crap team next season
but the big three are the ones who will win or lose the title not Wayne fucking Ellington
"No one calling the Lakers old is saying they're old cause of their big 3 average age, lol.  It's the fact they signed...  Melo who is 37.  Trevor Ariza who is 36.  Marc Gasol who is 35.  Dwight who is 35.  Wayne Ellington who is 33.   Kent Bazemore who is 32.   LeBron who is 36.   Westbrook who is 32."
Wayne Ellington went to UNC. What is UNC known for? Offensive rebounds. Smash him in the paint too.  That‚Äôs the best part of this strategy. You can put 6 or 7 guys on the court and the refs won‚Äôt be able to count because they‚Äôre all so close together.
The obvious disrespect to Wayne Ellington gives it away.
"For the regular season?? You have to understand there still signing melo, wayne Ellington, bazemore, ariza and rondo and keeping some players from late year if they took the hield route im not saying they win but they look more like a team"
"For the haters out there Tyler Herro had a better +/- than AD and outscored all of Lebron, Melo, and Wayne Ellington (two olympians and an NCAA champion) by 14 in only 27 minutes of play"
We calling Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington important now?
A bit of Wayne Ellington too. But less of that than the others
"I think we also miss talen horton tucker, kendrick nunn, and wayne ellington, but meh. Right now we are digging deep into our 10and 11th guys.   Im meh about the season, but optimistic about the playoffs"
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
Nunn averaged near 50/40/90. Wayne Ellington is actually a beast at 3s. Ariza plays ok defense still
"The Knicks already had a max cap spot. That‚Äôs enough for Morris and Randle as is. So the cap you cleared from the trade turned into Bobby Portis, Wayne Ellington, Elfrid payton and co.   Your last point has nothing to do with the trade either. I don‚Äôt care about your hypotheticals, especially since you clearly have some bias towards the Knicks. The fact of the matter is KP and hardaway played large offensive roles in one of the leagues best offences. And as much as I love Luka, it wasn‚Äôt even close to a carry job on his part at least in the regular season. The team proved more than capable with him benched and injured   And the reason for KP‚Äôs ejection is irrelevant. The fact is as a result of the trade the Mavs have been a highly competitive mid tier playoff team."
"The cap space you already have was enough for Randle and Morris. So the cap space you acquired from the trade went to Elfrid payton and Bobby Portis and Wayne Ellington. So was that worth it? No. The picks could be but they haven‚Äôt conveyed yet. To be worth it those two picks, likely in the 20-30 range will have to be as good or better than the players lost in KP and THJ.  And saying Randle is a top 20 player is a stretch to everybody that‚Äôs not a Knicks fan. All NBA doesn‚Äôt determine where a player ranks, it‚Äôs influenced by record, injuries and other basketball politics factors. By that logic Deandre Jordan and Ben Simmons and the like were top 15 players when they got the nods"
Not when they had a max spot in the first place that would‚Äôve allowed them to sign Randle and Morris who became quickly. So basically the cap they freed up from the trade got them Bobby Portis Elfrid payton and Wayne Ellington
Casey is so damn weird with his matchups. I‚Äôll never forget when he decided to put Wayne Ellington on Julius Randle as the Knicks destroyed us by 20. Shit doesn‚Äôt make any sense!!
If Vogel was smart he'd know that Wayne Ellington is a career 41% 3P shooter and held the Miami Heat record for 3's in a season before Duncan came to Miami.   &amp;#x200B;  Vogel can't figure out how to play half the Laker's roster and its showing. Lebron and AD are the only players who scored more than 9 points.
"Why kendrick nunn, wayne ellington and trevor specifically though? They didnt even play ü§£. Feel like Russ would have been more appropriate if we're shitting on Lakers front office decisions"
Was that Wayne Ellington in your dms haha. Why would a fan care so much
"Wayne ellington, nunn, ariza werent playing unfortunately"
I feel like the equivalent today is a guy who can shoot 3s (or could at one point shoot 3s). Wayne Ellington will get contract offers til he‚Äôs 50.
"Garrett Temple, Wayne Ellington"
As their Sixth man once they start Wayne Ellington.
"No surprise with Lakers missing 4 rotation players. No Nunn, THT, Ariza or Wayne Ellington ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Why does that matter? LeBron is a superstar, obviously he‚Äôll have more attempts than a role player.  Do you think he‚Äôs a better shooter than KD? Or Joe Harris? Or Bryn Forbes? Or he‚Äôll, even Wayne Ellington?"
"I'm not even saying I think we're incredibly good, I'd argue we have produced more starter caliber players over the last say 5 years, but not trying to big us up too much.  I'm just saying I don't really see the heat that way. Herro and Nunn are both really solid but are only entering their 3rd years, I think Tyler Johnson is fine, Max Strus is not even close to a success story yet, Wayne Ellington is not a Heat Development success, he was a vet that upped his PPG .7 with the Heat and Hassan Whiteside has almost played himself out of the league cause hes the definition of an empty stats centre.  Bam, Robinson and maybe Herro/Nunn (lets see how this year goes) are players you can hang your hat on developing but I'd argue your org is best known for having veteran players buy into coaching and system, not finding coal and shaping them into diamonds.  While we're not supernatural I'd stack FVV, OG, Siakam &amp; Norm Powell against any players developed by the Heat."
Tyler Johnson/Kendrick Nunn/Duncan Robinson/Tyler Herro/Bam Adebayo/Hassan Whiteside/Max Struss/Wayne Ellington. All these guys are good or had career years with the Heat. Raptor fans are either bitter or ignorant. Either way I don‚Äôt care. Super excited for next season.
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
What? You mean Wayne Ellington and a 2nd round pick won‚Äôt be enough for the Lakers to nab him?
Knicks legend Wayne Ellington
"DeAndre Jordan on Wayne Ellington: ""We are twins. We're just different colors"""
"Next time someone signs for the minimum, I‚Äôm calling it the Wayne Ellington max."
"He also won a ring in college on a pretty stacked UNC team with Ty Lawson, Tyler Hansbrough, and Wayne Ellington"
"Lebron was 35 for that chip, he'll be 37 for this one.  Acting like he will never regress is asinine.  Even crazier to not be able to acknowledge he's not the same player he was 3-5 years ago, doesn't have the motor and is losing quickness.  He's on the down trend and it was apparent last year watching him play.  You guys act like he's a comic book hero.  Westbrook will be 33 but honestly his age doesn't even matter.  He's just a negative on the floor, bad decision maker, low BBIQ, does not contribute to winning.  And you'll notice Wayne Ellington and Melo aren't going to be shooting 40%+ from 3 this year because no one needs to guard Westbrook on the perimeter.  That nursing home lineup has so many clear playoff weaknesses there's no reason to think they'll get past any of the top west teams."
"&gt;	Lakers didn't have 4 40% shooters last year  Technically you‚Äôre wrong, but yeah McKinne shouldn‚Äôt really count. So ‚Äújust‚Äù KCP, Caruso, and Gasol. KCP and Caruso are better than any of the ‚Äúshooters‚Äù you added  &gt;	And those guys you mentioned, Kuz, Matthews, McLemore, were all genuinely more negatives than they were positives   If Kuzma was more negative than positive wait till you watch Wayne Ellington and Carmelo Anthony lol"
I don't mean this in a mean way but the fact that you think KCP and Caruso are significantly better shooters than Wayne Ellington shows that you don't know what you're talking about lol they arent even close
&gt;	Only ones that played any significant time were Caruso and KCP.  So two guys that are significantly better than any of the shooters you added?   &gt;	Are we acting like Wayne Ellington and Melo aren't shooters now?  No I‚Äôm acting like those are not guys you want to have on the floor so you have any shooting
"&gt;And you lost 4  Only ones that played any significant time were Caruso and KCP. The other guys you mentioned production is replaced with Nunn and Ariza.   &gt;Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol  Are we acting like Wayne Ellington and Melo aren't shooters now?"
"And you lost 4. Plus McLemore and Wesley Matthews who can both shoot.   Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol"
I mean that‚Äôs what I was talking about when I said dysfunctional. The best shooters on their roster are nunn monk and Wayne Ellington  And Russ just compounds the problem
"Wow, first Jordan Poole making WAYNE ELLINGTON look like a bad defender gets top-3 on r/NBA and now Jordan Poole making CHAUNDEE BROWN JR. look like he's 22 years old and never played a regular season game in the NBA.  What's next? Jordan Poole with a clutch 1st quarter steal against Carmelo? Jordan Poole scoring 30 against the Orlando Magic?"
"Lebron James, Wayne Ellington*, and Anthony Davis"
"poole will be starting until klay is up to starting again.  but THT apparently is the second option for SG _and_ SF, behind wayne ellington and kent bazemore.  i feel like he should have a lot of opportunities to steal a starting spot.  there's a reason they gave him a real mid-level contract and (i'm not familiar with ellington but) bazemore would be a min even if he weren't on the lakers."

Wayne Ellington is literally the best shooter on the Lakers. They‚Äôre gonna need him.  Poole is literally the second best offensive player on the Warriors. They‚Äôre gonna need him.
He‚Äôs been cooking better defenders than Wayne Ellington since about halfway through last year.
Jordan poole and wayne ellington are the names you expect to hear in preseason.
Wayne Ellington is still in the NBA!?
"Many players shoot 50% from 2. I‚Äôll use the lineup for the Pistons which were the worst team in the league last year.  Mason Plumlee: 63% 2pt / 0% 3pt  Jerami Grant: 47% 2pt / 35% 3pt  Saddiq Bey: 45% 2pt / 38% 3pt  Wayne Ellington: 52% 2pt/ 42% 3pt  Delon Wright: 52% 2pt/ 35% 3pt  Josh Jackson: 49% 2pt/ 30% 3pt  From the Pistons, we see that half the starting lineup shot 50% for 2 pointers. When you factor in drawing fouls, 50% 2 pointers is worth more than 33% 3 pointers as well."
"...okay?  He's also been starting or one of the first wings off the bench for about a decade in the NBA.  He was in the 3 Point Contest a couple years ago.  He was one of the best 3 point shooters in the league when he was in Miami.  Like anyone who has been paying much attention to the NBA in the past decade would've at least heard of Wayne Ellington.  He's also been in the NBA for over a decade.  What do you mean ""couldn't keep a job,"" he has literally been on a team every single year for many many years.  Basically you not hearing of him is an indication that you just don't pay much attention to the NBA, not any indictment of him as a player."
"Wayne Ellington?  Nah, you just don't pay much attention to the NBA.  He's been a solid role player for years now."
"Unless they want to totally compromise their defense, they will be much worse shooting the ball. That championship team had role players that could defend and shoot at a decent clip. (Danny Green, KCP, Bradley, Morris).   Their shooters now are Malik Monk, Nunn, Melo, Ariza, and Wayne Ellington. Monk is a terrible defender, Nunn is bad, and the other 3 are either old as shit, terrible at defending or both."
2k would have a more realistic sim than Basketballgm lol. I‚Äôve had Wayne Ellington make All Nba. 2k would never.
Wayne Ellington is supposed to start for the Lakers. Y‚Äôall will be fine.
Wayne Ellington getting cooked
"Eras could have overlapped if Lebron stayed and if Bosh didn‚Äôt get blood clots. You‚Äôd be looking at a 2017 team that had those 3 with and at least Dragic, Whiteside when he was good, Joe Johnson, Tyler Johnson, DJJ, Wayne Ellington. It could have been very entertaining."
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
Fav: Wayne Ellington Least Fav: Dillon Brooks
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
I was 2 years older but I played ball most of my childhood with Wayne Ellington.  His sister was in my grade before she transferred to the hill school.  Wayne eventually left our high school to transfer to episcopal academy.
"Wayne Ellington, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Whiteside, Josh Richardson, DJJ, Winslow, Dion Waiters.  All of them either peaked, had some of their best years or had a resurgence and disappeared when they left the Heat.  Spo is a role player whisper, he gets exactly what he wants out of every player regardless of talent.  this is just in the last couple years."
"1. Wayne Ellington, because we use to play ball together           in Pottstown 2. Boban, he is just so much fun."
"I mean yeah for star players, sure. LeBron, AD, Westbrook individually have an incentive to play for it. How the hell are you going to convince Wayne Ellington and Trevor Ariza to play hard so that another younger guy gets a shot at replacing them?"
"- LeBrOptimus 6th Prime James,  - Carmelo Anthony,  - Wayne Ellington,  - Kent Bazemore, - Trevor Ariza,  - Malik Monk,  - Talen Horton-Tucker,   Lakers wing depth those wondering."
I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say Wayne Ellington isn‚Äôt a starting quality player in the NBA. Maybe it‚Äôs just a minutes drainer kind of thing.
"I got lucky‚Ä¶ court-side clippers tickets when they were **really** bad (early 2000s), and ~5th row lakers tickets during the dark days (Kendall Marshall/Ryan Kelly/Robert scare/Wayne Ellington)   I just bought some Lakers-Sixers tix, and im paying nearly as much but am damn near in the nosebleeds üòÖ"
Wayne Ellington but I still despise the Lakers
"Like Bertans (maybe even like Hardaway), I hate paying big money for pretty one dimensional pure shooters, like you can get Wayne Ellington on the minimum, and he'll give you 80% of what they do. Especially because those guys become such huge targets on defense in the playoffs"
LeBron should become the 5th option and Wayne Ellington should become the first option.   I want to see what a game with 35% usage Wayne Ellington looks like.
Ray Allen was replaced by Wayne Ellington
"To the Lakers for Wayne Ellington, Malik monk, Kent Bazemore, and a 2035 protected 3rd rounder."
"I'm guessing by the username: LeBron, AD, Westbrook, Carmelo, THT, Austin Reaves, Trevor Ariza and Kendrick Nunn (when they come back), Wayne Ellington, and LeBron again."
"There have been 4 players in the rotation that might not play at all on 20 other teams, including 2 starting (DJ, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington) The NBA is a star centric league but it doesn't mean the other guys aren't important, especially on the defensive side. What makes matters worse is that the team in general just doesn't really fit together, the lack of complimentary pieces means no one is really in their ideal role. Even LeBron and AD have to play outside of themselves to make up for the teams deficiencies"
"Besides the obvious problems (DJ is complete ass, Russ is a terrible fit with this roster, Melo and Monk can't defend anyone in the league) they have other big-time issues.  Avery Bradley, Rondo, Kent Bazemore, and Wayne Ellington have played a ton of minutes and all of them look totally cooked.  LeBron looks older than he ever has. AD looks disinterested for stretches. THT looks overmatched in his role more often than not.   This is not a roster that's going to win 4 playoff series. And I have no idea how to fix it."
"The season is over a quarter of the way through with a losing record despite having the easiest schedule thus far and being led by a man who is at worst the 3rd greatest basketball player in the history of the sport. Wayne Ellington, the 12th man on the 17 win 2018-2019 david fizdale-coached knickerbockers, is averaging 20 minutes a game. The team is a sieve on defense and wear and tear is only gonna make it even harder for this historically old team to keep games close"
Just Wayne Ellington &amp; Carmelo although they ain‚Äôt real reliable
Wayne Ellington +20 in a 8 point win
"Wayne can't defend and THT can't shoot.  I can't imagine playing Russ, THT, LeBron, AD and a centre. Or even with Ellington as an elite shooter. That's a massive concern. That's 1 guy who provides spacing. 3 guys who provide negative spacing and LeBron who can't athletically finish at the rim anymore so a crowded paint bothers him more."
"THT is the guy they‚Äôre depending on to be the wing next to LeBron and they‚Äôll add Bazemore or Bradley in when they start small. But I don‚Äôt think either one is actually in the plans for important springtime minutes. The 7 or 8 they‚Äôre depending on to play well are Russ, Nunn, THT, LeBron, AD, Melo, Ariza, Ellington and  hopefully Monk for shooting. Reaves, Baze and especially Bradley are guys they‚Äôre hoping just dont tank the team when they play their 10 minutes. Bazemore is already almost out of the rotation because of THT and Wayne returning. Bradley will start when they start small but will likely be getting the Keith Bogans once Nunn comes back."
Deciding who should take the last shot based on career percentages is incredibly moronic. Should Wayne Ellington be the only one to take a game winning 3 as he has the highest career 3 point percentage on the lakers. Should DeAndre Jordan be the only one to take a game winning 2 because he has the highest career 2 point percentage?
"‚ÄúMalik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, THT and Dwight Howard combined for 28 points tonight against the Knicks. Evan Fournier scored 26 points tonight against the Lakers.‚Äù"
"George hill,Wayne Ellington, Blake griffin, joe ingles,bismack biyombo"
How many people do you think LeBron had to message? I mean his teammate Wayne Ellington literally played with Isaiah Stewart last season lol it wouldn‚Äôt have needed to reach Shams when he coulda just asked Ellington in the dressing room for his number. Unless Ellington told Shams‚Ä¶
You telling me 12th man for David Fizdale's league-worst 2018 new york knicks wayne ellington wasnt a good use of a vet min?
"What's weird is you guys had a lot of good role player shooters just a few seasons ago (Luke Kennard, Tony Snell, Reggie Bullock, Wayne Ellington) and now all of them are gone"
"I mean, Wayne Ellington was penciled in as opening day starter with DJ, Melo, Bazemore, Ariza and Monk as key rotation prices.   This roster is shambles, I‚Äôm genuinely surprised people thought this was some sort of super team. Most of these guys wouldn‚Äôt even crack a  playoff rotation.  Maybe LeBron has one more year of being the best player in the league, if he doesn‚Äôt this roster is garbage and there is no saving it."
Ahh so Blake‚Äôs best player to pass to was Wayne Ellington? That seems fair and accurate
Draymond shot 38.8% while Griffin shot 36.2%. Draymond had 8.9 assist while Griffin had 6.2. Draymond can pass to Steph for those 9 assist while Griffin had wayne ellington. Yes Dray is elite at passing but hes not ‚Äúwayyyyyyyy better‚Äù. Its funny because Draymond is a wayyyy better defender at any point of their career tho.
"Did anyone think their defence was going to be good giving rotation minutes to Melo, Monk, Wayne Ellington, Westbrook and DJ?"
"Prime Blake dragged a horrendous Pistons team to the playoffs. His supporting cast was Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Wayne Ellington.   Throw prime Draymond on that 2019 Pistons roster and it‚Äôs a lottery team"
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
Not Wayne Ellington the gawd tho
"That is true! Vogel confirmed this too:  &gt; Frank says that it was THT returning and how good Malik Monk and Wayne Ellington are playing that knocked Kent Bazemore out of the rotation.  &gt; Frank told @jovanbuha that Kent Bazemore will still be ""a big part of what we do.""  https://twitter.com/hmfaigen/status/1460020165777637376"
"you really forgetting the 3 week stretch with Wayne ellington, Mo Speights, and Shaun Livingston from the dead?   what a time that was"
These clowns let go of KCP and Caruso just so they could start Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore lmao
You know you're fucker when Wayne Ellington is getting minutes in 2021. Lakeshowwwwwww
My boy Wayne Ellington is also a shooter
Pat Riley fucked up not signing Monk in the offseason just for the sake of not having to play against this fucker. It's the same thing we had to do with Wayne Ellington.
I love Wayne Ellington.  He reminds me if the days when the Lakers were terrible.
Man I miss Wayne Ellington
Rondo +20 with 8 assts on 12 min  Wayne Ellington +21 in 24 min and 8 points   Melo really took up the load though 36 min
"Wayne Ellington with the +21, the real carry of this team"
"What shooters did we trade you better not say KCP dude is a streaky shooter at best. We've improved in terms of shooting with Melo, Monk, and Wayne Ellington."
Like what players would they be taking minutes from? Weren‚Äôt you saying the same about Wayne Ellington?
"We actually had to sit a lot of guys near the end of last season in order to be really bad. Unless Mason Plumlee and Wayne Ellington were the secret sauce, we basically have the same roster with Olynyk replacing Plumdog's role and Cade swapping in for Ellington."
Wayne Ellington
"Thank God i fell asleep at the end of the third quarter. This team sucks.  Also, Wayne Ellington is a scrub."
Wait are we gonna see Wayne Ellington this game?
"Kendrick Nunn, Trevor Ariza, and Wayne Ellington."
Out for tonight:  Wayne Ellington (knee)  Trevor Ariza (knee)  Lebron James (old)
"This is so true. As a heat fan I wished good things for him for a long time. There was a time when I thought he‚Äôd be one of the best wing defenders in the league under the instruction of dwyane Wade but his offense has NEVER been anything good. Like yeah he‚Äôs a baseline NBA player on offense and it feels like he WANTS to be a good defender but after awhile it felt like we were just kidding ourselves. Heat fans are good at hyping up dudes who don‚Äôt really get better. Whiteside, dion, Winslow, J rich, Wayne Ellington, DJJ. Some of those guys are really fun to watch and even good, but not really usually as good as we want them to be. We wanted Wayne Ellington to be Duncan Robinson, we wanted whiteside to be what bam is now, we hoped J Rich would be like Jimmy. Hoped dion would be like herro seems. This season really seems different though. Shit they got me to buy team pass‚Ä¶"
"Facts. Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Whiteside, Mcgruder, Derrick Jones Jr.  We got all those dudes a nice pay above the league minimum because they actually deserved it"
"&gt; I yearn for the return of Ellington, THT, and Nunn  Wayne has been available for a week now, Frank just isnt playing him"
Buddy hield is just a very good Wayne Ellington. I don‚Äôt think he changes the team much. Obviously better shooting helps but he costs them a good defender.
"Well duh. You‚Äôre just stating the obvious. Brown and tatum have tried passing over the years and their supporting cast miss shot after shot. They still need to do less iso and pass more however.  The bigger problem is Smart saying this to the press is like the umpteenth time he‚Äôs gotten too loud in the locker room when he‚Äôs nowhere near the level of player brown and smart are. He‚Äôs brazenness is a big part of the perceived locker room dysfunction and the team not gelling.  If Wayne Ellington started shouting comments to Lebron and AD that they need to play differently and was the loudest guy in the locker room over multiple seasons, it wouldn‚Äôt go so well"
"Wayne Ellington, our presumptive best shooter."
Wayne Ellington
"&gt; We get Ellington back soon  Wayne has been back, Vogel just isnt playing him"
"Also, the main nuance people are missing in all this piling on with the Lakers is that a huge portion of their lineup is out injured, and has been all year. Maybe that's just people willingly ignoring that fact because it's fun to pile on the Lakers, or maybe they're not even aware of it, I don't know. But the last two games the Lakers have had half their rotation out injured, which obviously puts a huge burden on the guys who are still there, which isn't ideal in a back to back on the road following an overtime game for an older team.   Someone like Melo playing 31 minutes on the second night of a b2b on the road at 37 years of age is definitely not what the Lakers were envisioning this year, but they've been forced into stuff like that (and playing Westbrook and Rondo together, or big minutes for Avery Bradley or unsigned rookie Austin Reaves, etc) simply because they're so thin on bodies right now. Missing LeBron obviously has an impact, but so does missing Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the Lakers only have one wing who's playing (Melo).   It's just a lot for a team that right now is exclusively minimum players outside of AD and Russ. And of course they're also trying to figure out playing together as they don't have any experience doing that. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Lakers are off to a rough start."
"The most asinine part of it for me is that it's not like anyone needs help figuring out what kind of players to put around LeBron at this point; the formula of shooters + LeBron has been established for over a decade.  Instead the Lakers are relying on Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, and when healthy Wayne Ellington, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor ariza to space the floor because they brought in two non-shooting guards in Russ and Rondo."
"It‚Äôs not about age, it‚Äôs about ability. You can be 150 years old, but if you‚Äôre not washed, you‚Äôre not washed. Langston Galloway, Sterling Brown, Wayne Ellington are all better options than Melo, Iggy, and Dwight."
I want my Heats to resign Dewayne Dedmon and bring back Wayne Ellington if we gotta trade Duncan Robinson away.
Well at least it paves the way for picking up Wayne Ellington
"Yeah but damn it‚Äôs gonna be a big contract eating up a lot of space to not really have much impact on wins or morale.   Might as well keep rolling with guys like Wayne Ellington tbh, at least for this current year."
"Wayne Ellington and Patty Mills are great ideas. Pure shooters. The rest are a bit old, good on end of bench roles but I want my rotation filled out more first."
Wayne Ellington??  Surely they can‚Äôt be serious
"Lakers will be picking up a lot of vets that will eat up his minutes. Specifically shooters and with THT‚Äôs biggest weakness being his shooting, guys like Carmelo, Wayne Ellington, Patty Mills, and all the other vets the Lakers will sign will eat his minutes."
In general you don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're eyeing Wayne Ellington to give your team shooting.
I‚Äôm still waiting for Danny Green and Wayne Ellington UNC legends to get the respect they deserve.
Wayne Ellington for a year too lol
Same story as Tyler Johnson and Wayne Ellington. Spo knows how to get the most out of players.
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
Wayne Ellington has been unconscious from 3 for every team he played for except the David Fizdale one
"Yeah I‚Äôd say he still is. He has his limitations. He can‚Äôt shoot well and his defense isn‚Äôt great. But he‚Äôs still has one of the best drive to the basket. He‚Äôs also still a positive playmaker. And he‚Äôs still lethal in transition. We desperately need a secondary playmaker and someone to carry the offense for heavy minutes to give Lebron a break.   That‚Äôs why I think this trade will benefit us this year assuming we sign some veteran shooters. IDK if Danny Green wants to return, or if Kyle Korver, Wayne Ellington, and Jodie Meeks want to ring chase. We have McLemore and Kief and Caruso while not licks may want to return."
"There were times we started fucking Ryan Kelly, Tariq Black and Wayne Ellington. Clarkson was legit our best player for like a season or 2."
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
Reggie Bullock or Wayne Ellington would be great additions as well
"Honestly if they can sign someone like Danny Green, Otto Porter Jr to start, and then sign guys like Wayne Ellington, Batum, Mathews, along with THT and Caruso.  Maybe try to entice Dwight to come back or even possibly Noel."
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
"Wayne ellington, jodie meeks, jason kapono still available? Bring in the machine &amp; space cadet as well"
Wayne Ellington is still kicking around
"Good shooters *are* widely available every offseason. But good shooters, on cheap deals, who aren't total liabilities at everything else, are not. Teams could have guys like Lou Williams, IT, Wayne Ellington etc for dirt cheap. Ellington just played for a 20 win Detroit team for $1m salary shooting 42% from deep on 6 attempts per game. But guys like that just don't offer anything else on the court."
"To me that doesn't make sense. How do Russ and LeBron work together?  Both of them need the ball to be effective, and neither of them can shoot that well (esp. Russ). Who's bringing the  ball up the court? Even if they split those posessions, what's the idea behind that offense? Suddenly LeBron starts shooting 40% from 3, and Russ keeps feeding everyone?  I just don't get how this trade makes the Lakers better. Russ is going to be the starting PG 100%, but he needs the ball to be effective, like LeBron. IMO, the Lakers needed to swing for Duncan Robinson and Reggie Jackson. Add another big that can hold the fort while AD is gone, or not playing centre, and trade Kuzma plus some picks for someone that will actually contribute to the team. Get a Wayne Ellington, try to sign Nerlens Noel (don't leave the Knicks baby), couple of players that complement the team structure.  With just LeBron and AD healthy, and a decent backup team, they can win the title. Russ, to me, doesn't push them over the edge like a superteam."
"Reggie Bullock, Patty Mills, Wayne Ellington? Hell even Danny Green could be in contention if he really wants. We resign Caruso and Wes. Solid 3&amp;D players in that list"
"Could get some garbage minimum SG who can shoot, like Wayne Ellington, and go Russ-Ellington-Melo-Bron-AD. That‚Äôs not so bad. A lot riding on Bron and AD‚Äôs defense, but that could be a winner if healthy."
"Good shooting vets are available:Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, Wayne Ellington, Jeff Green, Doug McDermott, Patty Mills, etc. I‚Äôm not sure it would be hard to convince them to come to LA and play with 3 All-NBA players. Especially when 2 of them have averaged 10+ assists"
"jordan clarkson,wayne ellington, ryan kelly,tarik black, robert sacre. Motherfucking sacre."
"You liked this team less than Robert Sacre, Ryan Kelly, and Wayne Ellington?"
If stars want to sign with us are we supposed to be like ‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äù?  Lebron signed with us and the Lakers FUCKING SUCKED üòÇ I‚Äôve been with them through the days we had Ryan Kelly and Wayne Ellington in our starting line up. I‚Äôm not a fan just because of our storied history. Tho I do understand the point you‚Äôre trying to make. Honestly if you‚Äôre a fan what does it matter about cheering for anything else besides the name on the front? Players come and go.
