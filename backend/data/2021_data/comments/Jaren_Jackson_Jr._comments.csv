"Yup. The only loser in the top 5 was Sacramento. Memphis didn’t even have a hand in the pot and they still walked away with Jaren Jackson Jr., who is a hell of a player and a great modern big."
"Neither Jaren Jackson Jr nor Justise Winslow have played yet this season. Both Ja and Jonas Valanciunas missed 3 games of the 7 game winning streak. And of course they've been without young, end-of-bench players like Killian Tillie and Jontay Porter for the entire season."
"&gt;big gap from august to november, i'm going to assume it was clarified to the writer via some other means  Your quote is from August and is from a different writer. Your quote is referencing the press conference I linked.   Your quote in August: https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2020/08/19/memphis-grizzlies-jaren-jackson-jr-justise-winslow-injury-updates/5607775002/  Press conference in August being referenced by your quote which does not mention Jaren being ready:https://youtu.be/H1pt-_ektiM?t=1148  Different writer, different quote in November saying he wouldn't play at the start of the season: https://twitter.com/ChrisHerrington/status/1329305181280985088"
"I can’t tell you how much these wins mean for this team and its fans. The Spurs for years have been Grizz killers, and finally we’ve begun to figure them out. But they spoil Ja’s career high 44 points in our season opener, which started off our season sour and we began 2-6. We took a five game winning streak into a two week park. Then we got SAS twice in a row to see if we got rest or got rust. Short-handed.  Injuries for Grizz: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valanciunas, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Jontay Porter, Killian Tillie, Sean McDermott  Spurs: None  First game: Grizz W by 17  Second game: Grizz W by fuckin’ 31  Grizz Next Gen, YOU HEAR ME?!?"
And this is with Ja missing two weeks and Jaren Jackson Jr hasn't even played yet!
"What other fours except Simmons are like him though?  The modern 4 is more like a Anthony Davis, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kristaps Porzingis, etc"
"Jaren Jackson Jr is top 3, so this list is at least a little bit wack. Hes been hurt so far but he shoots like 40% on 6ish a game."
The only thing I know about Jontay Porter is that he’s Michael Porter Jr.’s brother and his ESPN profile picture used to be Jaren Jackson Jr.
"Jaren Jackson Jr  Been in this train since the draft, I still think he can be a multiple time all star"
"we blew a 23 point lead to detroit with everyone healthy.  we were down 33 to the washington wizards with everyone healthy.  we failed to execute in the clutch despite multiple opportunities against the memphis grizzlies who did not have valanciunas or Jaren Jackson Jr only missing saric.  we failed to execute in the clutch twice against denver, first game having a double digit lead going into the half, second game having a lead with a minute left before murray forces overtime.  oh, and we're dead last in 4th quarter scoring and i think bottom 4, probably now bottom 3 in scoring in the clutch.  If, by some miracle, we make the playoffs, by god will we fail to execute then.  i am a suns fan, but i am rocking this spurs flair until they prove they deserve my fandom. it's been one of those weeks."
I raise you Jaren Jackson Jr.
"Jaren Jackson Jr  Plays defense, chucks up the 3 ball well, loves a good foul, young as   No he's not up for trade"
"Pick the Grizzlies bruv, one of our mods is bri'ish. We also have two people from your commonwealth of Canada in Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks. Jaren Jackson Jr is also very fashionable like royalty."
bro where is jaren jackson jr?
"&gt; The number of long rebounds due to three point shots has expanded the need for guards who can rebound, not bigs.  I am sure you know how to look this stat up but look how much a guard that gets a lot of rebounding improves their teams rebounding like Russel Westbrook and Luka Doncic than look at a bigman who is a good rebounding center does. Guard rebounding has zero correlation with winning.  &gt;I'd love to see the stats that show us being significantly worse on defense, any and every number I've seen has us being better, as does the eye test.  Last year Jaren Jackson Jr actually made the Grizzlies worse on defense and on offense whenever [he was on the court](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4439/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). He made the defense pretty significantly worse at a rate of 2.5 more points per 100 possession, good for bottom third in the NBA.  &gt;Look, we aren't going to see eye to eye. You clearly don't value Jaren and that is fine.  Agreed, I'll stop now."
Mo Bamba and Jaren Jackson Jr for me. I’d tell my friends ‘Rememebr the name Jaren Jackson’ while he was at MSU and now I barely even remember him
Triple J tore his meniscus in the bubble. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29597640/grizzlies-rule-jaren-jackson-jr-season-due-meniscus-tear
"Jaren Jackson Jr. is also out. That's the Grizzlies top 2 players. Justise Winslow is expected to start for them, I think, and he's out too. Not to mention they're missing so many bench players that they were recently granted a ""hardship exception"" to allow them to sign another warm body."
"It's insane in a such a loaded 2018 draft class with Luka, Ayton, Trae, Jaren Jackson, Collin Sexton, SGA, Michael Porter Jr, etc., the Kings ended up with Marvin Bagley. He looks terrible. He's getting bullied by Draymond when he's playing offense and bullied by Steph and Wiseman when he's playing defense. He has no feel for the game, no touch, doesn't make decisions quickly. He honestly doesn't do anything well. Is this just the injuries or is he just not learning?"
"He was actually very good.  16/9 and 2 steals in 20 minutes.  No Jaren Jackson Jr or Ja, so his defense didn't stick out like a sore thumb."
Whenever i see JJJ i have to look up JJJ nba to find out its jaren jackson JR. why include jr in the initals?
Jaren Jackson Jr. is the next Sam Perkins 😎
After Bagley.  3. Luka Dongcic  4. Jaren Jackson Jr.  5. Trés Young  He's the Darko Milicic of this draft.
"A few weeks is 12-18 games. Without Jaren Jackson jr and Jah, their odds off winning more than 5 of those are pretty low. They would have to be unstoppable to crawl out of that hole when Jah returns. Especially with the the plethora of other playoff hopefuls in the west"
"I’d say it’s Kristaps and then Jaren Jackson Jr, I don’t know where I’d place him specifically but my boy Jae Crowder has definitely gotta be in the top 5-7 for PF’s in the west"
There really isn't much to compare. They're both really good prospects but I think ayton is a better prospect. If Jaren Jackson Jr can cut down on the injuries and stop fouling then yeah you take him
"I have a feeling he has rushed his return. Jaren Jackson Jr tore his meniscus earlier in the bubble than Porzingis, but he still hasn't returned. Porzingis is expected to make a full recovery, that is why I don't want to give up on Porzingis.   Powell has been rough. Love his hustle, but he clearly lost quite a bit of his athleticism. Watching him attack the rim is a rollercoaster. He just goes at it without brakes and chucks up a layup. The torn achilles really hurts him and I don't think he will ever come back to his old self."
"Mavs fans are fucking toxic. It's gotten to the point whre Porziņģis and Rick Carlisle and now Josh Richardson (formerly Tim Hardaway Jr.) get hate and are diminished in their value/impact as a means of propping Luka up.   Luka is incredible. Very likely he goes down as the Mavs GOAT if he stays here long enough. He for sure has the skillset. But you don't need to blame everyone else to make him look better. That sub has just basically become a Luka hivemind and then a ""no we shouldn't fire Rick Carlisle, or trade Kristaps Porziņģis and a first round pick for Andre Drummond"" minority.   The amount of hate Kristaps gets on there is unreal. He's our 3rd player to average 20+ ppg since Michael Finley in 2002, but you'd think he was Erick Dampier the way folks complain about him. He's barely removed from knee surgery and is still averaging 21 &amp; 8 on 47/36/84. Jaren Jackson Jr. had the same surgery 2 months before him and still isn't even back on the court.   It's just super reactionary over there."
"He didn’t look this bad at defense last year but he had been bad this year but you gotta remember that he came back early from his injury, Jaren Jackson Jr had the same injury before him and he’s still not back, so I’m personally hoping that his legs getter in the defensive side but this year his defense has been bad"
will there still be cool jerseys? I bought a rising stars jaren jackson jr jersey last year and it's really cool
A lot of you won't read the article but they are talking about Jaren Jackson Jr being the next AD. Not AD leaving
"Grizzlies are not shit, they have if I'm not mistaken one of the youngest core and they play hard as fuck , and thats without Jaren Jackson Jr."
"This whole post is based on an incorrect premise. Grizzlies all healthy clearly beat the Warriors to get the 8 seed via the play in.   Then we activate sleeper agent Conley to easily sweep the Jazz by playing 6 on 4 when he is in the game. Don't ask me why they don't bench him, I'm not an NBA coach.  After that stunning defeat of the Jazz they get a second round matchup with the Suns. Thankfully, they'd been preparing for the Suns. After proving they could easily handle the Suns with thier first win, they tanked the rest of the Suns games, like the one last Friday, using them as scrimmages so Winslow can get up as many in game shots as he can. Another easy sweep for the young cubs lead by Ja and a well rested Jaren Jackson Jr.  On to the conference finals and guess what, if it worked in round one you better believe we are running it back. Agent Gasol is activated and the Lakers are done for. All according to keikaku. Keikaku means plan.  And so the plucky Grizzlies are in the finals. On the other side an offensive juggernaut, the Brooklyn Nets. The Grizzlies have exhausted all their bag of tricks and will need to actually win this series on their own merit.  And thus the finals ends in a clean sweep for the Nets who become the 2021 NBA champions. Congratulations Brooklyn!"
"Sat down to watch this game and it was over halfway through the first quarter. Damn, was expecting a decent game.  Whens jaren jackson jr back for Memphis anyways?"
What about Jaren Jackson Jr?
&gt; jaren jackson jr?  ?

"Jaren Jackson, Jr. also has a case if he continues on the track of his early career. Embiid doesn't belong in this conversation for a long time, though. His shooting numbers this year are very much outliers for his careers. He's a very good shooter, but KAT and Jokic are better. Embiid would have to shoot like he is currently for the rest of the season and beyond to have a legitimate case for best shooting C of all time."
i miss Jaren Jackson Jr...kid was having a great season last year
MFs forgetting Jaren Jackson jr exists I guess
"Xavier Tillman, Jaren Jackson Jr"
Karma because he doesn't want to be drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies. And good thing because Jaren Jackson Jr. is way better than Mo Bambi
Grizzlies Injury Report  Jaren Jackson Jr OUT  Brandon Clarke OUT  De'Anthony Melton OUT  Justise Winslow OUT  Desmond Bane OUT  Lovely.
"Not in order (just numbered so I can keep count):  1. Davis 2. Embiid 3. Jokic 4. Nurkic  5. Sabonis 6. Bam 7. B.Lopez 8. Allen 9. Ibaka 10. Wood 11. Adams 12. Porzingis 13. Jaren Jackson Jr 14. Theis 15. Ayton 16. KAT 17. Capela 18. Vucevic 19. Holmes 20. Rudy 21. Ibaka 22. Favors  *(sorry if I missed anyone)*   Pretty much any decent starting 4-5 is an improvement. Drummond is empty stats, when the Cavs wanted to Fade for Cade ^TM they just gave Drummond the ball and let him do his thing.   He's the clear best rebounder in the league, but it's not even clear that teams rebound better when he's on the floor."
Chris Paul  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  Jaren Jackson Jr  Kristaps Porzingis
Citing True Shooting as if it an all-encompassing stats lets me know someone doesn't hoop/actually like the sport;  Jaren Jackson Jr. plays like Klay Thompson
"Everybody is beatable outside of the top three. I'm not saying you're great but I'm saying the whole point of getting vucevic is to try to compete. If y'all missed the playoffs, that would be a major disappointment. I don't think it's inconceivable that show beat another mediocre team if y'all get the 4 or 5 seed.  Obviously I know most non free agent destination teams are built through the draft. I'm not criticizing you for warning high draft picks. I'm saying it's stupid to think that you're only solution. Have you not been tanking since the Rose/Butler era? What happens if you decide to try to tank and you drop and you end up with Mitchell instead of Suggs or Green?  We sucked with injuries and we got Jaren Jackson Jr. We still missed a generational player by one tho. We couldn't trade because of our boneheaded front office decisions of prior years. The year we got Ja is the year we didn't really care and we actually won games down the stretch. Ours yrs of mediocrity and minor success got us good deals for our franchise Legends. We finally got a good coach. I love Ja but right now this team is more than just Ja. This team is a collection of undervalued players. Only Ja Jaren, Justice and Jonas were top 10 picks. This team did not live in the lottery."
"And the Grizzlies are without Jaren Jackson Jr and Justise Winslow? Tonight we also didn’t have Deanthony Melton or Brandon Clarke, super important Rotation players"
We beat y’all twice without Jaren Jackson Jr.
We were without Jaren Jackson Jr and Justine Winslow I believe
"I've only seen Memphis once, and it was preceded by the word quietly, but that's what we get for being a small market. Jaren Jackson Jr. is an absolute stud, as a rim protecting big that shoots 40% from three. Ja just won ROY. They were both top four picks? No problem! Dillon Brooks was a late second round pick, and we developed him into a two way stud, at least for where he was drafted (although he doesn't shoot the best %, he certainly isn't afraid to keep shooting... hopefully the % goes up). We traded for Melton, another second round pick, and he is getting minutes in the rotation, looking like a future 3nD contributor. BClarke had an incredible rookie year for us, and this year he is having another very good year. Bane is looking like a great value pick from the end of this past first round too. I'm not necessarily arguing that Memphis is better than someone like San Antonio or Toronto, but the organization knows how to both draft the right guys, and develop them properly."
"Jaren Jackson Jr. Sorry, I should have specified haha. I'm used to using the abbreviation in the Grizzlies sub."
"Chill. Embiid just returned from injury. Also, he faced KAT last night. We'll probably do something similar when Jaren Jackson Jr. returns."
"If you don't have any affiliation with the University you root for then I can't say I'd understand why you'd watch other than for the love of the game.   I wasn't that into CBB before I went to MSU, but I attended every home game from 2016-2020 and that changed things to say the least. Pretty cool to see Miles Bridges, Jaren Jackson Jr, Xavier Tillman, and Cassius Winston up close and share a little community with my fellow students."
"My Grizz would be fun  PG Mike Conley, Ja Morant,  Jason Williams SG Tony Allen, Mike Miller, Bonzi Wells SF Rudy Gay, Shane Battier, James Posey PF Pau Gasol, Zbo, Shareef Abdur-Rahim C Marc Gasol, Jaren Jackson Jr, Big Country Reeves"
I'd say Jaren Jackson Jr can do that but I am starting to question if he really exists or if he was just a fever dream I had
"I'm waiting patiently for the big name free agents to flock to Memphis to join some promising young players in Ja Morant e Jaren Jackson Jr. and a front office that not only drafted really well in the past few years, but also had great and prolonged success the entire last decade, all while playing in the western conference.  Come on man, we all agree that the Nets did a really good job recovering from a terrible situation, but KD+Kyrie (or even just one of them) isn't happening if the team isn't in Brooklyn."
"We got Jaren Jackson Jr. as a result. Bagley doesn't seem to be working out well. Had we gotten Luka, we may have never gotten Ja. Not sure how we'd be had we gotten Ayton."
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"
Jaren Jackson Jr is a myth
"sabonis, zion, randle, jaren jackson jr, john collins are all natural power forwards imo"
*Cries in Jaren Jackson Jr.*
"Kevin Porter Jr. and Otto Porter Jr.  Also, Wendell Carter jr, Jaren Jackson jr, and for some reason, Miles Bridges."
"Appreciate the post, it's quality content!  One thing I have to point out is the years you have used to get your figures. It would have been better to use the years 1990-2010, so these players had their whole career, providing a true indication of frequency. As an example, most of the following players will be a top 2 player on a playoff team before their career finishes: Trae Young, Brendan Ingram, De'Aaron Fox, Kristaps and Jaren Jackson Jr. I'm sure their are others, these were just the first few that came to mind  Again, awesome post, I really enjoyed it, and would love to see how it looks decade by decade."
We’re sitting at .500 after the all star break after playing without Jaren Jackson Jr for the whole season so far and playing a quarter of the games so far without Ja.   I’d be willing to say once we’re fully healthy we’re a guaranteed playoff team.
"The Grizzlies VP said he’s going to be “out a minute” on [November 19th] (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30347396/memphis-grizzlies-forwards-jaren-jackson-jr-justise-winslow-miss-start-season), and the beat writers said he might be back on MLK day.      This is getting to the point where you have to wonder if he’s had a setback."
I think Jaren Jackson Jr from 2018 Draft also has MVP potential and a chance of becoming one under certain circumstances!
"after watching other top lottery bigs like Jaren Jackson Jr and James Wiseman miss time with prolonged lower body injuries, maybe his finesse style of play is a good thing for his long term health?"
"Memphis Grizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Ja Morant and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Tuesday night. Injured forward Jaren Jackson Jr. yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Desmond Bane gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard DeAnthony Melton yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Ja hit the locker room door, former Memphis great Tony Allen hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Jaren Jackson Jr.

I searched up 2018 draft big board and already found several boards with luka on top:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2781782-final-2018-nba-draft-big-board-who-will-take-our-top-prospect-luka-doncic  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-draft-2018-big-board-prospect-rankings-order-deandre-ayton-trae-young-jaren-jackson-jr/1ux40dxe8oh2z179oyxpcn7sqw  https://nbadraft.theringer.com/2018/  https://theathletic.com/400985/2018/06/21/the-athletic-philadelphia-nba-draft-big-board/
"THEY WON 4 GAMES IN A ROW 2 TIMES BC THEIR SECOND BEST PLAYER DIDNT PLAY ALL SEASON! If Jaren Jackson Jr were playing all season they would solidly be in the playoffs, Maybe even as high as a 4 seed. Jaren Jackson Jr is the second best player in the Luka draft, he’s a huge difference maker. Like you keep saying we’re an average team like no shit our fucking 7 foot 4 god man has been out all season. Like you base your claim to them being average on them having a four game win streak but don’t even take any of that into consideration. And we’re gonna continue to be an average team if the coaching staff and FO wants to keep holding him out and experimenting. This team has the ability to be spectacular it’s just up to the front office and coaching staff if they wanna make it happen. If I were in charge Ja and JJJ would be playing 40+ min a night, but FO won’t do that Bc “the future.” They need to wake the fuck up and realize the future is now and our players don’t need another year of development. They’re ready to win now."
Yes they are that good. Jaren Jackson jr hasn’t played a minute until last week this season and they’re sitting pretty above .500. That’s unfathomable. So yea maybe there have been some growing pains since he’s gotten back but and for some reason coach has this infatuation with justise winslow but hopefully next game he’ll figure out how much he sucks and they’ll start clicking. 10-2 totally within the realm of possibilities and have every reason to expect it when you considers what they already accomplished without JJJ.
"1. Beaten blazers twice already, one with JJJ one without 2. We were a Ja Morant game winner away from beating knicks in MSG 3. I will concede that I do think the mavs are better but even still we were a luka game winner away from beating them last time, an absolutely demoralizing lost that I don’t think the grizz will let them beat them again.   You also forget that until last week, we were playing without Jaren Jackson Jr. Hes back now and he’s a force to be reckoned with. I think in the west, only the Lakers, jazz, mavs, Clippers, nuggets, and suns are better than the grizzlies and I still think we can get lucky and have dallas drop one more game than us to get us the 6th seed."
Jaren Jackson Jr or Jaylen Brown
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5.

"Grizzlies are one of the youngest teams in the league and have 2 budding superstars in Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. We're 3 games above .500 despite our youth and are on the way up. Ja is 6'3"" but is an explosive dunker and playmaker while JJJ is a big man who can shoot really well. Look up some highlight vids of Ja and JJJ, you won't regret it"
"He hasn't played with Jaren Jackson Jr until this past week. Ja Morant has been injured part of the season as well. The Grizzlies play by committee, so yes his shooting has been off, but they're the eighth seed in a hypercompetitive Western Conference. They have gone over my expectations to be in the playoff bubble this year."
"I went to preschool with Jaren Jackson Jr., he towered over everyone too."
And Jaren Jackson Jr. and Ja Mornat
"For the grizzlies Id say that Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. are 100% untouchable, but everyone else could go at any time."
"They werent referring to Jaren Jackson Jr, lol. Whoops, sorry. Laugh Out Loud."
Also why does every fucking player need a stupid abbreviation or nickname? Jaren jackson jr is a third year big who averages less than 5 rebounds. Nobody knows what his situation is.
Jaren Jackson Jr. “beef” with Morant
Grizzlies have a full roster of legitimate NBA Players. Jaren Jackson Jr is just coming back from his injury AND they’re going to have another pick this year in a strong draft
Tommorrow:  [Grizzlies] Jaren Jackson Jr. has been upgraded from questionable to MAYYBEEEE?? for today's contest against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Jaren Jackson Jr.
Yea Jaren Jackson Jr needs to come back asap
"True but the question was about a young CORE. Not who had the best young player. Our 1st round pick this year, Desmond Bane, is on pace to break the rookie 3pt% record. He's at 45.9% right now. Brandon Clarke was the summer league MVP last year, Tillman out of Michigan St was a 2nd round steal this year. Grayson Allen has been a 40+% shooter, Ja Morant was Rookie of the Year, and that's all without Jaren Jackson Jr. The whole CORE"
"I think it’ll come down to everyone around Steph. Steph on his own can take care of business and I think the Grizz will have a hard time containing him, it just depends on whether or not Oubre or Wiggins can play up to par imo. Just right now? I’d give the edge to the Grizz, about 60/40. Jaren Jackson Jr is coming back from his injury and could make it more lopsided though."
"Griz rookies Bane and Tillman are older than Jaren Jackson, Jr."
Hopefully he doesn’t miss as much time as Jaren Jackson Jr has with his meniscus surgery.
Kris Dunn (0.0)  Stephen Curry (30.4)  LeBron James (25.4)  Jaren Jackson Jr (0.0)  Ban Adebayo (19.0)  74.8... you can keep the change.
"Honestly, Ben Simmons is a slightly better version of Michael Jordan. The difference is, Jordan had Scottie Pippen to carry him to 6 championships. If the 76ers are serious about contending, they should see if they can trade Embiid and a couple picks for Julius Randle or maybe Jaren Jackson Jr."
"Zion is still 2 years away, same class as Ja.  Luka is in the same class as Trae and Jaren Jackson, Jr."
"DeAndre Ayton, Luka Doncic , Jaren Jackson Jr, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Brides, Michael Porter Jr   Which one of these players is he better than?"
"Royce O'Neale, Anthony Edwards, Jaren Jackson Jr"
"Among the top 10ish players major injuries are way up. If you compare 2020 star injuries vs 2021 for example, in 2020 we had Kd, Klay, Steph, Embid, and Simmons as the main guys with injuries. In 2021 we had Kd, Klay, Harden, Lebron, Embid, Davis, Murray, and Butler injuries. Perhaps Kyrie now too.  Way more top level players missing a lot of games this year than usual. Then if you go down a level you have guys like Jaylen Brown, CJ McCollum, and Jaren Jackson Jr. missing a ton of games too which really hurt their respective teams."
"Jaren Jackson Jr, or Mikal Bridges."
Don’t forget Jaren Jackson Jr was a part of that draft as well.
"Which of the following players are you taking Bagley over?  Jaren Jackson, Wendell Carter, Collin Sexton, Kevin Knox, Mikal Bridges, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Miles Briges, Michael Porter JR"
"It's very early, for example you wouldn't pick 96 to be what it turned into back then  look at what this class has done in the playoffs this year though  Luka: 36/8/10 (22 years old)  Trae: 29/3/10 (22 years old)  Ayton: 16/11 78% shooting (22 years old)  Porter Jr: 18/7 66 TS% (22 years old)  then theres also SGA, Robinson, Jaren Jackson Jr, Sexton and Bridges  there's insane potential there, we can't know exactly where these guys end up but theres a chance Luka isn't the only all timer/MVP potential type when its all said and done"
Spider-man cannot be stopped! Somebody call J. Jonah Jameson or Jaren Jackson Jr. asap!
What about Jaren Jackson sr and jr
"Got me interested thinking of what this class would have to do to top them  Luka gotta win like 8 championships? Maybe he gets bored and takes a couple seasons off to focus on streaming and lets Ayton pick up one or two?   If you think those two can stack up with MJ and Hakeem at the end of the day then I think it’s a question of do you think two of Trae Young, MPJ, Mikal Bridges, SGA, and/or Jaren Jackson Jr can stack up against John Stockton and Charles Barkley..?  It sounds crazy now but I’d give them a chance, I think.  Looking at it I think it’s more likely that the best four players in the 84 draft will all be considered better than whatever contemporary player you compare them to in 18 but 18 will be deeper class that produces more “average” starting level players and it will devolve into a weird argument of whether a draft class is better because of a few amazing players or of one amazing player, a few great ones, and a solid few really good ones. Most people will prolly lean with the draft that has a few amazing players I think"
I do hope Jaren Jackson Jr and WCJ are able to evolve in the years to come.
Jaren Jackson Jr. is the good Rasheed Wallace

"&gt; Kat was gonna be a defensive monster in the NBA as his main skill set, as did most evaluators  As flawed as analytics are, especially defensive, I still think it is interesting to look at and try to find patterns and in hindsight I think people should have been a lot more skeptical of KAT's defensive stats in college. He averaged a ton of blocks, but he also averaged a ton of fouls. Another player like that is Jaren Jackson Jr, and I wonder how he will develop defensively. I think he is still living off his predraft reputation as a good defender."
I don’t think the grizzlies would be a whole lot higher but it’s easy to imagine them as a 7 or maybe 8 seed considering Jaren Jackson Jr. who is a really important player for them was injured the whole season and only played 14 games with them. If he was around they definitely would be above the warriors and maybe above the lakers too.
Jaren Jackson Jr = Andrea Bargnani/Steve Novak hybrid.
"Watching him play was tantalizing, especially the mobility and the fluid jumper, combined with his length and shot-blocking potential. Unless Minnesota wants to move KAT or Memphis decides they want to move on from Jaren Jackson Jr, the Warriors ought to keep him around to grow in their culture."
"Personally I feel that Jaren Jackson Jr could have been the difference maker in the series. He's averaging 5.5 3 pointers attempted and only making 27%, just feels like a black hole. He shot 39% from 3 last season and I don't think he had quite enough time to recover from his injury. Big dudes that can shoot can be so lethal but he's not quite there yet."
I thought Mo Bamba and Jaren Jackson Jr would be two of the best defensive players in the League by now.
"how do some of y'all goons comment on players that you never even watch? like, i know three players on the jazz well enough to say anything. mitchell is a star, rudy is beast, and mike is a the best human being in the world. other than that, i don't know enough to say anything...so i don't. some of y'all should take notes. ""WhY  iS JAreN JacKsoN jR SuCKY??"" fuck out of here. man's younger than ja and off an injury."
"Jaren Jackson Jr., but he hasn't looked great since coming back from injury last month. Trying to withhold judgment until I see him after a healthy offseason.  I also mostly disagree with your point about Booker. He's been solid despite getting lots of attention from a great defensive team. He hasn't been excellent but I also wouldn't call his performance ""disappointing"" either."
"Oh man, if only Jaren Jackson Jr could rediscover his shooting form, and if Dillon Brooks would not commit insane fouls, it could've been a different game.  I hope Ja eventually is more consistent spotting up from 3 as well, the guy will be absolutely unstoppable once players don't sag off him and dare him to shoot.  Still, Memphis grinded it out to compete with the number 1 seed, and that is impressive considering how much shooting the Jazz have in comparison.  I hope Memphis can come back and grind out a win in game 4, but I think this will be Jazz in five guys :("
Jaren Jackson Jr is literally in the same game lol
nothing gets me going more in life than seeing Jaren jackson jr switch into guards and hold his own.
Jaren jackson jr is in there until he learns the rebound
A cautionary tale for Jaren Jackson Jr.
"Marc and Mike\*  They were ready for a full rebuild. Lucked out and got the 2nd pick instead of giving it to the Celtics. Managed to get a steal from OKC for Clarke. If they didn't luck out, it would have been Valenciunas moved for more picks and a longer rebuild with an injury-prone Jaren Jackson Jr as the centrepiece."
"KP is not a bad comparison, maybe a little bit like Myles Turner but he really is like a unicorn because I really don't think there is a super similar player. He has a real funky release but it is very fast and effective and he's not just a spot up shooter. He shows flashes of driving/ball handling but has not been able to polish that yet. He's a skinny/gangly 7'0 (he grew an inch after the bubble), a little bit like young Giannis in that regard. He is an excellent shot blocker and shows flashes of being a defensive anchor, but he gets too jumpy and commits too many fouls. He's a poor rebounder and he struggles with true centers because of his lack of strength.  He really is a player who the sky is the limit for because if he gets stronger, gets better at defensive positioning/not fouling and works on his ball handling, he could look a lot like Giannis tbh but that is obviously a huge if. And this injury/setback has obviously affected his growth this year and he has played some real putrid minutes and gets frustrated because he's still rusty and will do stupid fouls.   This is a good article from the around midseason of 2020 that kinda showcased how versatile/talented he is https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn"
Jaren Jackson jr isn’t that good
Kristop or Jaren Jackson Jr.?
Jaren Jackson Jr is younger than Ja Morant.
"Jaren Jackson Jr ain’t a starter Reggie? Lmao, he clearly never watched a Grizzlies game."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors’ execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip…](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6’9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV’s threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday’s game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that’s always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the “Curry experience”](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph’s 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don’t have Draymond’s help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV’s gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can’t switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ———————————————————————   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven’t mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray’s drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant’s shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an “so wide open its practice” 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond’s drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn’t make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn’t capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
"Melton, Bane, and Grayson Allen are all elite shooters. Jaren Jackson Jr. is playing injured and was a 40% shooter on 6 attempts last season. They have enough shooting. This isn't 2k where you can just draft and trade for elite shooters to surround one player."
Jaren Jackson Jr?
The unfortunate reality of this game for Warriors fans is that their second and third best players  (Draymond and Wiggins) are probably worse than Ja and Jaren Jackson Jr. Then when you compare benches you sorta understand why the Warriors are struggling.
I've only really watched Grizz during these play-ins. Is Jaren Jackson Jr. supposed to be the greatest three point shooter on Earth?
#Prediction: Jaren Jackson Jr boutta go off for 30+ 👀
idk if it’s a glitch but whenever I do Jaren Jackson JR to Frank Ntilinka it says no players found
Jaren Jackson Jr
"I am here just in time to watch Jaren Jackson Jr. attack Poeltl all game long, score 30, and Pop do nothing about it."
Bill Simmons thinks the Warriors should trade the Minny pick and Wiseman for Jaren Jackson Jr. Am I crazy or is that actually a fair trade? Warriors get a player who fits and can help win now. Grizzlies reset the rookie contract on their big man and get a very high value pick.
Terrible defense by Jaren Jackson Jr.
[live footage of Jaren Jackson Jr defense](https://i.imgur.com/36F53pg.png)
"Jonas Valanciunas, Jaren Jackson Jr., Brandon Clarke, Xavier Tillman"
Jaren Jackson Jr is a name you should know
Jaren Jackson jr is great what are you talking about
"Mobley first of all can run the floor like he's a guard. He's 7 feet and moves like he's 6'5"". He's one of the smartest 19 year old prospects I've ever seen, rarely makes bad decisions with the ball, can find the open man and make backdoor passes to cutters, pass out of doubles to the man in the corner and throw oops to other bigs. He scores efficiently from basically everywhere outside of 3's however he only took about one a game and his free throw numbers are good and his form looks fine so I believe he will be a decent 3 point shooter in the league. Defensively he is everywhere, unbelievable rim protector and has the size and fluidity to move around on the perimeter and stick with smaller faster players because of his own speed and athleticism. There really isnt much he cant do on the court and is a far better prospect than Bamba ever was. His floor to me is someone like Jaren Jackson Jr but he has potential for superstardom"
Jaren Jackson Jr
"EAST  - Giannis wins a Championship with the Bucks - Bulls eventually trade Lavine - Cavaliers make the playoffs once - Ime Udoka doesn't last as Celtics coach  - Capela is still a Hawk  - The Heat never make the finals again - LaMelo gets 3rd team All NBA honors - The Knicks never win a playoff series  - Jonathan Isaac never gets healthy  - KD wins 2 titles with the Nets - Goga Bitadze is the next Gobert - Isaiah Stewart leads the league in rebounds at least once - Vanvleet will be the only Raptor still with the team - Sixers sign Kyle Lowry - Somehow someway Bradley Beal never leaves the Wizards   WEST  - Lillard never leaves Portland - Paul George is still a Clipper - Jaren Jackson Jr is a bust - Gordon Hayward returns to Utah - The Kings still haven't made the playoffs, Fox gets traded to the East - Lebron surpasses Kareem as all time leading scorer and retires as a Cavalier - Luka and Mavs never makes it past the 2nd round  - Michael Porter Jr leads his team in points - Zion never participates in dunk contest, Pelicans make it to the playoffs twice - Rockets never make it to the playoffs - Gregg Popovich retires in 2 years - Mikal Bridges wins MIP - SGA demands trade from the Thunder - The Wolves finally make the playoffs at least once - Steph Curry leads the Warriors to the finals but loses"
&gt;Teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Jaren Jackson Jr in ~~Orlando~~ San Antonio
Teaming up with Donovan Mitchell and Jaren Jackson Jr in Orlando?
Give me Jaren Jackson Jr over both of these two.
Julius Randle or Jaren Jackson Jr. would work too.
Jaren Jackson jr
"I’d go with AD, Tatum, PG, Butler, and Kawhi even if Kawhi can’t defend at the same level as before in no particular order.  Klay needs to come back before I add him.  KD is just below those guys.  Jaylen is not there yet defensively (he’s great at 1 on 1 defense though).  I’d put Pascal Siakam, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jaren Jackson Jr (assuming he comes back to what he was in the 2019-2020 season), and Dejounte Murray over Tobias."
"But if they did trade down with Dallas, they still might had a chance at Bagley at the 5, or most likely would've ended up with Jaren Jackson Jr or Michael Porter Jr. I know the Kings FO is trash, but if they knew how much Dallas wanted Luka, they could've bluffed and gotten more than what the Hawks got. Vlade somehow picked the worst timeline possible."

"Of course Ive watched him play, I watch lots of college ball every season. Mobley has potential for sure, but he still has glaring issues: every time he’s gone against a defender his size or bigger, he’s dominated completely. Like he put up only 3 points against Utah’s 7 footer. He doesn’t have a big offensive skillset - it’s just run &amp; power to the rim. His jumper isn’t consistent at all to be a threat right now.   I’m high on Mobley, I’m just saying he’s got question marks, he’s not a flawless prospect. Guys like Jaren Jackson Jr were better prospects than him"
"I really don't know how this guy continues to get a job in scouting of all departments lol.  Here are a list of examples that made absolutely no sense:      The Grizzlies shipped out a first-rounder, Tayshaun Prince and Quincy Pondexter for Jeff Green, Russ Smith and a 2015 second-rounder.      Drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 ahead of Harden, Curry, DeRozan.      Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night in a 8 player trade.      Signed Parsons to that god awful max contract.      Sitting a 20/5/5/ Tyreke Evans on a team that wasn't good, in which he also defended his stance on the team slowly picking it back up, even if they weren't tanking.      **Draft results:**      2007: Mike Conley      2008: Love for Mayo swap      2008: Donte Greene      2009: Hasheem Thabeet      2009: DeMarre Carroll      2010: Xavier Henry      2010: Dominique Jones      2010: Greivis Vasquez      2012: Tony Wroten      2014: Jordan Adams      2015: Jarrell Martin      2016: Wade Baldwin IV      2018: Jaren Jackson Jr.      Looking pretty pretty bad....

"Covington, Powell, and Jones Jr. come off the books after next season. That’s $32 million in room to sign a swingman over 6’6” to play the 3, and a weak side defending, 3-ball shooting PF.   Jimmy Butler, KD, and Julius Randle, JaMychal Green, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bamba, Okongwu, and others will be available.  Dame should be patient and wait a year, and if they don’t make moves at the deadline next year, then consider asking for a trade."
Jaren Jackson Jr. is very solid pick though. I dont think you can hope for a better pick. Also Im sure they arent missing out on Trae when they now have Ja Morant.
"Truth be told, I really wanted Jaren Jackson Jr that draft. I am obsessed with bigs that can shoot. Always have been. Dating back to NBA live games in my dorm room running spread offenses with the 2003 Mavs. Nash, Dirk, Lafrentz, Finely. Loved that team and that's where my obsession with shooting bigs stemmed from. Glad we didn't take him and clearly the reason I am not a GM."
Jaren Jackson Jr
**Deandre Ayton** is a **Young Star**  **Marvin Bagley** is **Salvageable** (lol)  **Luka Doncic** is an **All-Time Great**  **Jaren Jackson Jr** is a **Future Star**  **Trae Young** is a **Playoff Stud**  mo bamba  **Wendell Carter** is **So Talented**
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"mikal makes more sense as a starter than porter jr  it should be trae/shai/luka/mikal/ayton  stagger the 3 ballhandlers with the bench lineups  use divicenzo, porter jr and jaren Jackson aa your main backups"
Still too early to say too but if Jaren Jackson Jr can get healthy and take a leap too then holy shit. That Top 5 is absolutely loaded (RIP Kangz fans).
PG: Fred VanVleet SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander SF: Ben Simmons PF: OG Anunoby C: Jaren Jackson Jr

"Kings fan here, ask me about having the second overall pick in the 2018 draft and managing to not get one of Ayton, Luka or Trae (or even Jaren Jackson Jr)."
There’s a move to a more perimeter oriented game. Big men want to be more Kevin Durant than a traditional big men. Heavy emphasis on the 3PT shot and being “versatile” with your ball handling and perimeter scoring.  “Most” teams are captivated by big men like Jaren Jackson Jr. that can spread the floor offensively and still have the size/length to block shots. The league in general has really devalued rebounding and “dumping the ball into the post”. It’s really all P&amp;R looking for mismatches and dribble penetration kick-outs for 3s.
"Forgot about Myles, I think he was on the World Cup team in 2019. Jaren Jackson Jr. would be a nice player in the tourney too, can stretch the floor and play some solid D"
Probably Bam. Myles Turner or Jaren Jackson Jr seem  good for the international game too.
Where does Jaren Jackson Jr fit in all of this?
Jaren Jackson Jr (no cap) (on god)
Next five years are Jaren Jackson Jr.’s
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
To be fair Memphis has had the bad habit of making our guys' nicknames basically just their initials for a while. TA -Tony Allen Zbo - Zach Randolph DB - Dillon Brooks JJJ - Jaren Jackson Jr JV - Jonas Valanciunas  etc etc etc

"As a MSU fan, I want this for Miles so badly. Loved his game and have always casually rooted for the Hornets since he went there. Same with Jaren Jackson Jr and the Grizz"
No. Ja is now on the trade market. This is due to the arrival of elite point guards Patrick Beverly and Ramon Rondo.   Ja Morant’s time in Memphis is finished and with this end comes the promise of new beginnings. What type of trade package can the Grizzlies net for Ja Morant? Will they have to buy the young guard out? How will Rajon and young big man Jaren Jackson Jr. mesh on the court? How many star players can Beverly maim and mutilate during his time in Memphis?

"Jaren Jackson Jr. 40% 3P shooter who can create his own shot off the dribble and he’s a decent slasher as well. His foul rate is a problem, but he was arguably the best defender in college and he’s shown flashes that he can be a great rim protector and switch defender. If he stays healthy i believe he’ll be a top 10 player"
Jaren Jackson Jr
Jaren Jackson Jr. Has real skills defensively and offensively as well as crazy length and athleticism  Just needs to stay on the court.
MVP: Jayson Tatum  DPOY: Bam Adebayo  ROY: Cade Cunningham  6MOY: Cam Reddish  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr  COY: Nate McMillan
"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."
"Well, last season did turn out to be his best pro year. It turns out that playing as a small-ball 4 is probably his best role. With Jaren Jackson Jr assuredly healthy, I'm not sure whether the Grizzlies intend to push Anderson down to th 3 again."
Jaren Jackson Jr will be a top ten big this season
For rookies I don't think those two have out and out comparisons unless you are joking..I see a comparison for Sharife cooper with Trae with same defensive flaws and a considerably weaker jumper similarly Evan Mobley and Jaren jackson jr
"Mobley i feel is a lot like Jaren Jackson Jr..Sengun Is prolly has a ceiling of sabonis prolly with more densive upside...Cade not being the best player is definitely a probabilty, There are player with immense potential in this draft Imo...Barnes,Giddey both could fit the Giannis prototype lead ball handler on breaks while being swiss army knifes defensively. Jalen Green could  be a perennial all star but tbh.. I don't see a face of the league level talent in this class"

"Peak Klay. Not sure if we will see it again though  Right now, Mikal Bridges, Covington, OG, Jaren Jackson Jr. Best value is definitely Dort now though."
Jaren Jackson Jr is younger than the following 2021 1st round draft picks:  * Davion Mitchell * Chris Duarte * Corey Kispert
"Malcolm Brogdon  Jamal Murray  Jonathan Isaac  Jaren Jackson Jr  Myles Turner   An Isaac, Jackson, Turner lineup is my dream. OG and VanVleet coming off the bench."
Are the odds for this up in Vegas yet. I could see Malik Monk. Jaren Jackson Jr. Zach Collins. Time Lord. Kris Dunn.
Ja Morant is the most likely but Jaren Jackson Jr could also ball out too
LaMelo Ball  Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Mikal Bridges  Jaren Jackson Jr  DeAndre Ayton
"What free agent class?  f Brooklyn's big three extends this off-season, Zach Lavine will be the only top tier free agent available and Chicago can offer more money, a better market and a comparable winning situation.  The next tier sucks. It's pretty much Aaron Gordon, TJ Warren, Jusuf Nurkic and Marcus Smart with Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton and Jaren Jackson Jr. as restricted free agents that would almost certainly get matched."
"Valenciunas has been a major liability on defense throughout the season last year. While he was amazing on offense, part of the reason why he was great at it was because he had to. Jaren Jackson Jr was recovering from his injury. This season would be his contract extension and he will ask for a lot. The man deserves to be paid nicely but we need the cap space when we give Ja and JJJ big contracts. Maybe even Dillon Brooks too.   Trading for Adams should theoretically means our young core will get more looks. They should take the reigns. It also works financially as his contract is for the next 2 seasons. Also, Adams won't get as easily picked off in defense. There's also the nice bonus that he's a calm vet."
https://youtu.be/Q20_eIvvXXg  white dude who blocked Dwight Howard as a rookie. He's also a ridiculous rebounder for a guard. So good I want him in the starting lineup at times solely to make up for Jaren Jackson Jr
The Warriors could try and trade for Jaren Jackson Jr. Three Js  &gt; Two Js
"Mobley reminds me of a more aggressive Jaren Jackson Jr., so they should be a solid fit with their smaller backcourt."
Trae - Luka - Mikal Bridges - Jaren Jackson Jr - Ayton  Sexton - SGA - MPJ - Miles Bridges - Mitchell Robinson  These two 5s are from the 2018 draft. So many great players and none of them have hit their prime yet. Imo it will go down as one of the best ever.
"Oh it’s definitely the Memphis Grizzlies. Super young team that beat Golden State in the play in game and then lost to Utah in the second round. Memphis is building the team through the draft, they’ve got star power in Ja Morant, the perfect freak athlete that slashes and pulls off amazing plays every night, destined for greatness. Jaren Jackson Jr is the 6’11 unicorn big that can stretch the floor: every team would kill to have him. Dillon Brooks is the dawg defender and has amazing offensive skills but super streaky. We got a new rookie that has tons of potential but could also be a dud, have to wait and see. A very sharp front office that doesn’t make too many mistakes. They nailed on almost all draft pics and trades the last three years."
"Ja Morant - Explosively athletic guard who can dunk well (fun to watch)  Jaren Jackson Jr - Big man who can shoot threes - due for a breakout season  Dillon Brooks - Lockdown defender but an extremely streaky shooter  Those are our 3 best players right now. We have one of the youngest teams in the league if not the youngest. We went 38-34 last season and made the playoffs as an 8th seed, so yes we are underdogs for now at least. Grit n Grind"
"They’re a pretty young team but they made the playoffs for the first time in a few years and have some serious young talent—including Ja Morant, who is basically on his way to becoming a superstar (averaged 30 points per game in his 1st playoff series), Dillon Brooks, who averaged 25 in the same series, and Jaren Jackson Jr. , affectionately known as “Unicorn” for his offensive and defensive potential. They’re definitely a rising team.  Their fanbase is very loyal and tight, they’re well-coached, and usually produce a lot of fan favorite players that get great favor in the NBA world. Very hardworking, not too showoffy or flashy either. I hardly hear anything negative about the Grizzlies, maybe nothing negative at all it seems."
Jaren Jackson Jr.   It's going to be his 4th year but it's hard to count last season as he only  played 11 games with limited minutes
"I don't know about ""given up on,"" but everyone seems to have forgotten that Jaren Jackson Jr exists."
Jaren Jackson Jr
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
"Well we have Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr, so... like way better.  In theory anyway depends on how they implement it"
Jaren Jackson Jr
&gt; Memphis trade Jaren Jackson Jr + 10th Pick for 3rd Pick from Cleveland  If I'm Cleveland I do this. So fast.
Jaren Jackson Jr
"Jaren Jackson Jr.   The guy was breaking out in year 2, only to be hampered by injuries in year 3.   I think with a full off-season being healthy, he should be primed for a big year 4."

The Grizzlies could really use a player like Jaren Jackson Jr
"I went to MSU. I’ll just name a few.  Brynn Forbes(transfer from Cleveland state): championship w bucks  Denzel Valentine: chillin on the bulls roster I think lol  Gary Harris: solid player.  Draymond Green: I saw his penis once. Oh yeah, he’s won a championship or two or three  Miles Bridges: probably my favorite  Jaren Jackson jr: injured all the time but really good."
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"How does no illegal defense favor 1 on 1 play? Having illegal defense forces teams to respect isolations despite non shooters spacing the court.  And you say international teams get to play a full zone as if the NBA can’t? Removing the illegal defense rules is specifically what allows zone defense. The effectiveness of that zone defense is what led to the increase in 3s to combat the paint denial. The def 3 second really is NOT pulling that much weight here. If a big is parked in the paint in this coveted “full zone” of yours, and a team calls for a high ball screen, and the big just stays there because it’s zone, it still functions the same as drop coverage, and the ball handler shoots a three or a pull up mid range off of the screen. His defender can fight over it all he wants, he still gets caught enough times that with no help, it’s a losing proposition.  This zone praise doesn’t account for when a team can run 5 out like the Clippers did to the Jazz either. Your favorite international center can sit in the paint for the whole shot clock if they so please, and that won’t stop Terrence Mann or whoever from shooting open corner 3s if they keep swinging the ball and penetrate with space.  Blaming it ALL on the rules and acting as if player skill sets haven’t changed is a bit shortsighted. Especially since you treat it as if this other rule set is objectively better.  Lastly, why would the NBA “take a long hard look at itself” over this? If you could measure one playstyle vs the other in terms of revenue, I promise some Olympic result isn’t going to make the nba choose the one making the less money. It matters 0. The same goes for the players. Sure, they’d love to win for their country, but they’d also prefer 100 million dollars to that gold medal, so whatever increases the value of the next CBA they are okay with. It is a business.  Also, America has “reaped what it’s sown” lmao, as if Anthony Davis, Jaren Jackson Jr, Marvin Bagley, James Wiseman, and Evan Mobley haven’t all been quality big men in the pipeline. That’s not to mention all of the quality international big men that have become so good and are considered superstars because they’re thriving AS big men…..in the current NBA ruleset lmao. Not sure what you’re on about. The USA Team lost this last game because it couldn’t hit its shots to close the game out, but make no mistake, they were open shots. The defense wasn’t so special that it stopped the goal of the offense."
We will take you in Grizz nation. Young strong core of Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. (trip J) small market could always use more fans! Ja went to a small college Murray State and wasn’t a big recruit coming out of high school and is a future hall of fame player. Beale st welcomes you! Hop on the Grizz Reddit and enjoy!
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
"This team is so poorly constructed it’s ridiculous. We literally threw out a bunch of iso scorers and said “lets play Moreyball” without any of the chance creations from a Harden or CP. Dame, KD, and Tatum are a great foundation and core to build the squad around. Now you’d need to invite guys who complement their abilities. Draymond is a good pick up. Jrue is a good pick up. But having Lavine, Book, and KLove for that stint would never fit. None of those guys are positives on the defensive side. None of them are great off ball guys. Hell Book and Lavine need the ball in order to look as good as they do. And as good as they are they aren’t in the same tier as Dame, KD, or Tatum. Adebayo is undersized yes but his defense and athleticism should translate well. Myles Turner being hurt didn’t help with the back up big pick. Just thinking outside the box, would Evan Mobley be a plus contributor? His role would be small and all he’d have to do is play hard for the minutes he’d get. Although he may not have wanted to play out of fear of ruining his draft stock maybe. Jaren Jackson Jr.? Im spit balling but you get the point. We’ll probably win gold but looking into 2024, we might not be fielding the best team in the world anymore"
Is jaren Jackson jr injured? How the hell is javale on the team over him
If the sixers called the grizzlies and offered Ben Simmons for Jaren Jackson Jr the grizzlies would throw the phone out of the window
2020 - Patrick Williams - Bulls   2019 De’Andre Hunter – Hawks   2018 Jaren Jackson Jr - Grizzlies   2017 Josh Jackson  – Suns   2016 Dragan Bender - Suns   2015 Kristaps Porzingis - Knicks   2014 Aaron Gordon  – Magic   2013 Cody Zeller - Bobcats   2012 Dion Waiters - Cavaliers   2011 Tristan Thompson - Cavaliers   2010 Wesley Johnson - Timberwolves   I wouldn’t trade Ben for a decade of number four picks now that the unicorn has vanished.
Jaren Jackson Jr is younger than Ja.
Jaren Jackson Jr. Sulks in a corner
"Not necessarily as good, but Memphis definitely have a promising young core:   Ja Morant (21)  Desmond Bane (23)  Jaren Jackson Jr (21)  Brandon Clarke (24)  Xavier Tillman (22)"
"That's a fair point, but I just feel with Jaren Jackson coming back that might be enough for y'all to get a pretty cozy 8th seed spot. Also Desmond Bane was getting busy in summer league so I think he's another plus for the Grizzlies along with Dillon Brooks.  I am high on Dame time, however judging from the Trailblazers off season moves...or lack thereof, I don't think they're that high on Dame time anymore. Dame and McCollum will give us what they normally do (until McCollum gets injured again), Norman Powell is good too. I also like that they added a bit more depth at the PF/C position in Larry Nance Jr and Cody Zeller since that seems to be where there injuries always tend to happen. However I feel like the Western Conference teams that are worth a damn made worthwhile moves/improvements while the Trailblazers kinda just put on a band-aid on a boo-boo that's getting infected now.  Spurs I completely forgot about them trading Derozan so yeah lemme get them outta there lmao"
* The Rockets have a better record than the Pelicans. * The Lakers don't make the WCF. * The Celtics fall to the play-in despite having Tatum &amp; Brown healthy for most of the season. * The Hawks become a top 3 seed and stay in contention for the #1 seed for 3/4th of the season. * The Grizzlies trade Jaren Jackson Jr. by trade deadline after not signing him to an extension. * The Raptors become an immense disappointment and blow it up by the trade deadline.

"Exactly, since not only is he showing signs, but already producing at extremely high level on defense. Arguably best for his defensive role last season. With Thybulle it's more of question if Point of Attack defender can ever be considered for DPOY.  Also I feel like the original commenter misses the point of the word ""potential"" as I don't think it implies expectation of immediate success. I'm not even quite convinced that it would have been that incorrect to even call someone like Jaren Jackson Jr. DPOY potential when he came out even though his impact was much weaker than Thybulle's for example. After all Jackson did show plenty of positive signs of attributes that tend to be hardest to develop defensively while struggling most at things that often would improve with more NBA experience."
"Talen Horton Tucker, Jaden McDaniels, or Jaren Jackson Jr."
Everyone always talks about Jaren Jackson Jr but he never plays anytime I watch a Memphis game
I think the grizzlies season as a whole is gonna hinge on how well Jaren Jackson Jr plays. JJJ can lift Ja’s game and Vice versa. And having them play well together helps all the role players. JJJ is gonna be the biggest factor in the grizzlies overall improvement
"Forced to play a 5? He’s been a 5 his whole life, including for Team USA and in high school lol. His best skill is his rim protection ability.   He’s not Jaren Jackson Jr or Bosh, he’s more of shorter Ralph Sampson. I just feel his best position is the 5 long term, although I understand if the Cavs want to protect him from the bigger C’s by having him guard 4s for his younger years. I just don’t know how well this team fits together"

"Since we drafted Jaren Jackson Jr and Ja, some fans like to call us the Jizzlies"
Or jaren Jackson Jr If he could stay out of shopping malls long enough to  workout and practice basketball
"&gt;I had him 3rd in my draft ***after*** Ayton and Doncic  After Ayton and Doncic. I think my top 5 were Ayton, Doncic, Bagley, Trae Young, Michael Porter Jr /Jaren Jackson Jr in that order. I was really high on Luka since early on for the same reason I was really high on Sengun this draft. Also really liked MPJ despite his back problems, I wanted the Mavs to take him at 5 and was really surprised to see him fall that low."
"Jackson isn't bad, but definitely lacks a clear superstar. You'd probably end up with:  Marc Jackson Jaren Jackson Jr.  Stephen Jackson Jim Jackson Mark Jackson  Bobby Jackson is definitely better than Marc, but defensively having him and Mark together in the backcourt would be challenging."
Jaren Jackson Jr is still only 21. Dude is going to be a star.
"looking at you, jaren Jackson jr"
Anthony Edwards will finish as Top 15 in 3PM and Top 15 in Pts  &amp;#x200B;  Jaren Jackson Jr will develop to a player better than Morant.
Evan Mobley Jaren Jackson Jr. AD
"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we’re trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don’t think that’s like a tile team but that team would “maximize” ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
38 games in a 72 game season.  Jaren Jackson Jr also basically missed 3/4 of the season and Ja still got them to the playoffs but nce try.
"Definitely agree, no way he's worth the 5/175 but the other contract would put him around 27.5 AAV which is right around John Collins, Julius Randle, and Jaren Jackson Jr, so that is somewhat more reasonable."
"&gt;Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Steven Adams on the all-star team  subscribe"

"The Grizzlies are hoping this will be a stepping-stone season between the back of the playoff hunt and title contention in the near future. In other words, they hope to be a solidly above average team in the Western Conference. The big question on the team is the recently extended Jaren Jackson Jr. If he is what the Basketbears hope, they could compete for the 6th seed and avoid the Play-In tournament. Other players to watch include De’anthony Melton, who will see his role increased after the departure of Grayson Allen, and Steven Adams, who looks to improve on a dreary last season in New Orleans. If he looks better than his last campaign, it could be a sign that Morant has genuine ability in making players around him better, something very exiting for the Grizzlies from their third-year star."
"Jaren Jackson Jr and Melton made 5 consecutive 3s and add in shots from Adams, Jones, and Bane."

"Lotta people talking about Sarver being cheap, etc etc, but the Suns have competed in a dominant conference many, many times in the last 20 years. They're nothing like the T-Wolves, Kings, or Magic (among others) organizations who have not seriously competed this millennium. I get it, he's awful (not as bad as Dolan), but Suns have always been competitive. I don't think Ayton is worth more than Jaren Jackson, Jr."
"Much less than Luka and Trey, but slightly more than Jaren Jackson Jr &amp; Sexton.  Very close to MPJ and SGA but much more than Bagley and Mobamba."

"Yes, I remember this happened for a hot minute with Jaren Jackson Jr. when he was being considered here until Bickerstaff talked to him. It's a bit of a slap in the face and I just remember thinking, can they really do that?? If they want to be a part of this league, they need to submit their medical.  &gt;In the days leading up to the draft, there were reports that Jackson Jr. did not want to come to Memphis, or at least that his representatives had discouraged it and withheld medical information from the Grizzlies’ front office  https://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2018/jun/22/grizzlies-use-no-4-overall-pick-on-michigan-states-jaren-jackson-jr/"

Less talked about but Jaren Jackson Jr.
"Look at Jaren Jackson Jr, awful form but he knocks them down at a good rate"
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"His three is no joke for sure, but from what I've seen that's basically his only effective offensive tool. It feels like the rebounding could be bad enough to force him to the 4. Which would hurt his value but might help him adapt to the game while he's putting on weight/building muscle.  I'm not a huge Memphis guy so I'm definitely ready to get owned by guys who have watched way more Jaren Jackson Jr. than I have."
"Jaren Jackson Jr. The idea of a defensive rim protecting presence raining in 3s and finishing PnRs with Morant is amazing.   The reality is he's extremely foul prone, a terrible post defender, not a good rebounder, and not a good post/interior scorer. The guy cannot stay on the court in any sense, be it fouls or injury.   Hopefully a healthy year really helps turn him around but I'm pretty skeptical of him as a player. I was suprised to see a lot of people discussing him for a breakout year. But I guess if he played a full season that'd really give us a real idea of him. He's just been on the court for so little time it's hard to get a read on him, but I lean towards him not panning out."
1. Darius Garland 2. Jaren Jackson Jr 3. KPJ 4. Tyler Herro 5. Rui Hachimura 6. James Wiseman  7. Bol Bol
"I think if the Simmons drama plays out into the regular season and the 76'ers don't have a trade,  Tyrese Maxey could have a breakout year as well.  My top 4 are Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Porter Jr, Jordan Poole and  Tyrese Maxey"
"This is now the fourth year in a row that Jaren Jackson, Jr. has been overhyped."
"First - Its probably gotta be a forward that can potentially play as a C right that's bad enough? Since i don't think there are any straight C's who are going to be better than Embiid, and no pg/sg/sf combos that's going to be better than the best starting back courts.   If we look at lineups:  BKN has  Kyrie, Harden, Harris, KD, Blake  (Presumably we'd target Blake here as the replacement - maybe Harris)  DEN's got JM, WBarton, MPJ, AG, Jokic (We'd target Barton/AG?)  GSW: Curry, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Wiseman (Target Wiggins / Wiseman)   So basically I'm thinking you need someone like John Collins / Jaren Jackson / Sabonis level who can slot in at C, and/or potentially play SF/PF or allow your current PF to move to SF/C  So my guess is: Jaren Jackson jr"
Jaren Jackson Jr. is a year younger than Ja
Jaren Jackson Jr has this shot form where it looks like he's like jumping *into* his shot.  Like he will catch the ball and then his whole body just moves forward a foot in the air.  I don't know how else to describe it but it's just really weird but it works
"Jaren Jackson Jr. Needs to prove he can make it a season injury free, needs to prove his shooting percentages from 3 a couple years ago wasn’t a fluke, and needs to prove he can defend without fouling"
We can get verbal evidence from nba players scrimming with him too. Heard Jaren jackson jr regularly plays with Ben.
Pick any good player on a not often talked about team and say their underrated or had a good season. For example: jaren Jackson Jr. is really underrated
"Luka, Giannis and Jaren Jackson Jr on the Bucks"
"Jaren Jackson, Jr., hopefully."
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
you dont know jaren jackson jr?
"I read this as Jaren Jackson Jr and I got flash-backs. I don't know how much of a run Jalen Johnson was going to get behind the Hawks' disgusting amount of young forwards, but hope it's not serious."
"I’d throw in Porzingis as well, and Jaren Jackson jr. looks like he could be that guy in the future if he stays healthy and continues to improve"
"okay so Jaren Jackson Jr has some of the worst body control in the NBA and one of the ugliest jumpers in the league. Combined, it makes him look like he is one of those inflating dudes at a used car dealership. Its fucking wild bro. Love him and hope he can keep healthy but man he looks weird out there"
"Alright I underrated his perimeter defense . I still don’t think he’s better than a healthy jaren Jackson jr. You don’t deserve a max rookie extension when your offense is extremely limited, just because you can guard a little on the perimeter."
There’s still time for my boys Jaren Jackson Jr and Jonathan Issac. Injuries have prevented their stardom up to this point
"I’m optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
bro all i'm asking is for jaren jackson jr to be all-nba 1st team  is that so much?
Jaren Jackson Jr is a scary dude jfc. Almost 5 blks and 5 treys in one game wtf
"yeah I think jaren jackson jr has all the physical skills, size, talent to literally be kevin garnett 2.0, but it sure seems like with his willpower and effort he’s never gonna get remotely close. it’s super frustrating as a fan.  feels idiotic to question the effort of a very good NBA player, he must work unbelievably hard to be where he is, but I look at what he can do when everything is clicking and i just know if that was the result all the time he’d be an mvp candidate making all defense teams.  he might play in an all star game one day or something, but JJJ is never gonna be half the player i think he could be, and that feels like such a waste"
"I was having trouble filling up that spot. I wanted to preserve size and defense but other than putting another small forward at the 4, I don't know who to put there. It's either Marcus Morris (ew), Jaren Jackson Jr, or Hachimura maybe?"
"Adams was on a two year deal, and JV had a year remaining with a desire to be extended (NO gave him two more years). The Grizz are thought to planning to eventually move Jaren Jackson Jr. to the starting center.  Currently the point is to move more of the frontcourt offensive load to Jackson. Adams was supposed to provide defense and rebounding, and some protection for Jackson. In exchange for taking Adams and Eric Bledsoe, the Grizz moved up seven slots in this year’s draft, publicly saying they had intel that their target Ziaire Williams would be drafted before their pick. They also received the Lakers 2022 first round pick.   Eric Bledsoe lead to a domino effect of trades.   JV was a fan favorite in Memphis, but the org had no long term plans for him (just as they have none with Adams). JV played most of last season without Jackson, just like so far he’s been playing without Zion Williamson.   The true measure of the trade isn’t now; neither team was in the championship hunt. The measure for the Grizz will be years from now and how Williams does and what happens with that Lakers pick. One of the key rotation players for the Grizz, Desmond Bane was the 30th pick in the 2020 draft."
"Who's filling out the SF, PF, and C spots? If it's just role players, then they're a non-playoff team. If you put a good All-Star next to them (i.e Paul George, healthy Zion, Butler, etc.), I'd say 2nd round exit.   A good, fun, contending lineup for the Ball bros would be:  Lamelo, Lonzo, Paul George, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bam Adebayo  LiAngelo is your 11th/12th man"
Rasheed - Jaren Jackson Jr or C Wood with defence   Randolph - Montrezl Harrell
"I have a really sick Jaren Jackson Jr. Rising Stars game jersey, and this thread has me thinking about just how obscure a Rising Stars game jersey could get. Pretty much all your favorite players have been in a Rising Stars game at some point. I’m gonna buy a Desmond Bane one this year probably."
Jaren Jackson Jr. I’ve never seen a 7-foot athletic guy so allergic to playing around the rim.
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"??? Not understanding why so many people are putting Maxey up here over guys like Jaren Jackson Jr, RJ Barrett and Jarrett Allen"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"What a game man. Down Dillon and Melton and we pull it out in the Jazz home crib. Babe goes nuclear, Ja shakes off a slow start to do what superstars do and carry the load when it is time to win, and Jaren MFin Jackson Jr daggers the shit out of the Jazz. Sweet sweet win.  Remain undefeated on Mondays.  GG Jazz bros, thought it was over on that second Bojan prayer."
"Surprised so many here are putting it on triple J. He wasn’t amazing to start the year, but he’s really started to put it together in the last few games.   Zach Lowe hit it on the Lowe post- he and his guest said JJJ has taken a defensive leap this year. It’s true.   He’s fouling less. He’s rebounding more. And he’s not swiping for steals like a guard, which always kept him in foul trouble.   Really great article here from a respected Memphis dude, Chris Herrington: https://dailymemphian.com/article/25377/herrington-jaren-jackson-jr-skeleton-key-unlock-grizzlies  Eye test wise, and covered in this article, Steven Adams misses a lot of defensive rotations. It might just be because he’s new to the team. And Ja is the worst defender in the league this year, so it’s a bit of a struggle with them on the floor together."

Jaren Jackson Jr
I think 2nd &amp; 3rd tier guys sgould realistically be on here too.   Like if i could get Jaren Jackson Jr for Ben at this point im going for it.
Just for fun I've thought about what Michgan State's team would be:  G: Bryn Forbes  G: Denzel Valentine  F: Miles Bridges  F: Draymond Green  C: Jaren Jackson Jr.

what is up with jaren jackson jr? he is so meh for a guy that just got the bag.
"I don’t watch HS hoops, so all I know about his HS hoops career is that he was teammates with Ayton. I 1st saw him when Duke played Michigan St. I thought he looked like the 3rd best big in that game. To me, Jaren Jackson Jr. easily looked like the best big in that game and Wendell Carter Jr. looked a little better than Bagley."
They weren’t possibilities due to Vlade’s outdated view that the PG (Fox) needed to be the only playmaker (that was baffling since Vlade and CWebb were important playmakers on the best Kings teams of the Sacramento era). I thought Jaren Jackson Jr. was the best prospect who had a realistic chance of being drafted by the Kings.

How is anything that Jaren Jackson Jr does ugly? The man exudes top 5 sexiest player in the league energy.
"Jaren Jackson Jr, ladies and gentlemen. Breakout game for the big man, threes, blocks, and the stop to seal the game!"
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
"Completely agreed, Scottie is a really good example of that. Also the same with Jaren Jackson jr. his rookie year, he came out being a scorer and legit threat from 3 but he didn’t do any of that in college. The potential was there, but the amount that these guys grow once they hit the nba is astounding a lot of the time."
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
"Saw a lot of this with the Warriors vs. Grizzlies game last night. Jaren Jackson Jr. (and others) were fouled so many times in the paint, and the refs let it go. They were Obvious fouls, especially the times when Draymond was guarding the perimeter, anyone with a brain can spot these fouls.  &amp;nbsp;  Other than the turnovers, these non-calls were the reason why we hung in the 4th and overtime.   It made the game pretty entertaining having it so close. I like it so far, even if it's not going our way. Overall it's just more fun to watch."
