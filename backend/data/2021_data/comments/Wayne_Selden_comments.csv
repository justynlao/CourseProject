"Bulls won a game with Walt Lemon, Wayne Selden, Shaq Harrison, Timonthe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Robin Lopez"
A couple of seasons ago the Bulls started a lineup of:  PG- Walt Lemon Jr  SG- Rawle Alkins  SF- Wayne Selden  PF- Shaq Harrison  C- Robin Lopez  Who ya got?
"We have almost never had talent to give away or misuse.   Andrew Harrison, Wade Baldwin, Deyonta Davis, Ivan Rabb, Wayne Selden, Jarell Martin, Kobi Simmons, Bruno Caboclo, Tyler Dorsey, all those guys are no longer in the league."
I'm still not convinced this dude isn't Wayne Selden Jr. in disguise.
Justin Holiday (Bulls) for MarShon Brooks and Wayne Selden (Grizzlies)
Wayne Selden Jr
We had Wayne Selden on our team
Wayne Selden. I saw highlight reels of him in high school and I was sure that he was the second coming of Dwyane Wade. Don't know what happened to him in Kansas alongside Embiid and Wiggins.
Must have been revenge for getting baptized by Wayne Selden https://youtu.be/rflacrKP_4g
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
Wayne Selden from Kansas bruh was colddddd
"Actually... Chalmers.   The twins weren’t that bad (just don’t mess with them lol).   Also, Paul Pierce, Wayne Selden, Frank Mason, and Devonte Graham were all SUPER nice.  Lastly, old man Perry Ellis was QUIET af lol"
"Frank Mason, wayne selden, tarik black, perry Ellis, jamari traylor. For a college team, basically stacked at every position. Really dropped the ball that year."
"yep, to the knicks for wayne selden"
F**k it then throw my dawg Wayne Selden out there.
"We always find something to be positive about. Young players, the draft, that one player who shot well despite the loss.   The rosters that we got ourselves excited about makes me sad in hindsight.   Lauri is Dirk. Kris Dunn vs. Zach Lavine was a real discussion. I thought Wayne Selden Jr. and Jabari Parker could be real contributors.   We're a hopeful bunch."
Wayne Selden is hella pretty though
Imagine dreaming about this kinda shit when only a few years back we were watching Brazilian Shrek and Wayne Selden get off the bench regularly.
Bust trade him to us for Wayne Selden
