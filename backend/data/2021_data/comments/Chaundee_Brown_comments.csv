"Still nowhere near prime Bron, ad, Russ, Dwight, melo, gasol and chaundee brown"
Did anyone else see Chaundee Brown pull a Zion through his shoes? And notice that he was wearing Zions signature shoe??
I loved Chaundee Brown at Michigan he was a hard nose on ball defender. I‚Äôm not to sure about him as far as NBA skill goes but I am rooting for him.
I‚Äôd love to see my man Chaundee Brown get a chance to shine.
Add Chaundee Brown to that list.
"They got Chaundee Brown to a small deal, he was a 43% three point shooter in college.  Perfect 3 and D guy that will fit right in."

Somebody please draft Chaundee Brown
We were super well rounded and semi-loaded. I'm disappointed Chaundee Brown probably won't get drafted because he can easily become a high-end 3&amp;D guy. He was so gritty. And Hunter Dickenson was the best player on the floor multiple times. It was a real strong team.
Yup but if we got both we probably don‚Äôt get Chaundee brown so I am cool with it
"Lakers actually have 6 guys that meet the criteria of this post.   THT, Monk, Austin Reaves, Joel Ayayi, Chaundee Brown, and Mac McClung."
"Yeah, that‚Äôs the double-edged sword of the Lakers: the location and winning tradition means player development takes a back seat to FA and trades to win now.  The scouting department is outstanding, but player development needs THT to have a big year and Kuzma to be great for Washington in order to look as good. Caruso is a success story and HBK looks promising, but Chaundee Brown could have been a real helpful/worthwhile project for them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Chaundee brown is a baller, that‚Äôs too bad"
"Wow, first Jordan Poole making WAYNE ELLINGTON look like a bad defender gets top-3 on r/NBA and now Jordan Poole making CHAUNDEE BROWN JR. look like he's 22 years old and never played a regular season game in the NBA.  What's next? Jordan Poole with a clutch 1st quarter steal against Carmelo? Jordan Poole scoring 30 against the Orlando Magic?"
Man got outplayed by the GOAT Chaundee Brown
"&gt;Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown chose numbers 37 and 38, most likely in an attempt to make Dwight Howard not look so fucking stupid by wearing number 39. Conclusion: Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown are AMAZING teammates.  Rofl but for real what did Dwight bribe them with?"
Mac McClung and Chaundee Brown
Chaundee Brown is awesome so this tracks
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
2nd 2 way gotta be for Chaundee Brown I imagine  I like this move  We had to get a young player some time and I wasn‚Äôt too hot on any vets still out there today  I wonder if Reaves was getting attention from other teams that motivated lakers to do this today  I can‚Äôt imagine Reaves will play much with Rondo Nunn Monk all on the roster but I always love rooting for young players with less hype around them
"Damn just when everyone counted them out, they land Chaundee Brown"
DAJ makes no sense I thought we were gonna play chaundee brown in that last spot since he looked good but instead we play DAJ???
