"&gt;The trade would include a package consisting of guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder, forward Kyle Kuzma, and a first-round selection each from the 2022 and 2027 drafts.  So in this hypothetical, the Lakers roster would turn into:  James/Beal/Matthews/Davis/Gasol  Caruso/THT/Dudley/Morris/Harrell  With just Cook left as a reserve point guard, that guard depth is looking pretty thin."

Fate of the universe on the line... I WANT KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL POPE SHOOTING
And he's head over heels in love with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope which is weird.  Or at least he was...idk I just remember multiple times hearing him gush over KCP.
"imagine thinking this is how Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Markieff Morris, Montrez Harrell, and Anthony davis feel lmao    “oh poor lebron, please don’t make me perform on the highest level! i’ve only dedicated my entire life to this moment!”   what Rondo is talking about is how LeBron pouting and throwing his arms up in the air is condescending and doesn’t elevate the team and that makes the guys more scared to play    it’s not because the passes are literally so perfect they whisper “forgive me senpai” after every miss   there’s one thing to display negative body language to undermine confidence, but throwing perfect passes is just lunacy"
"&gt;The 3 pt% for Ingram doesn’t matter much on so few attempts.  Yes, it does.  A percentage is a percentage, and it is not easier to shoot less frequently.  In fact, it's way easier to shoot when you are the unquestioned number one option on a team, and cannot be benched -- both luxuries Ingram never had in Los Angeles.  &gt;Ft% is the best indicator of shooting and he jumped from high 60s in la to 85% in no.   Not if the player still misses from the field at the same rate.  The best indicator of shooting is the percentage the player shoots -- Ingram's effective FG% rose less between his 3rd and 4th seasons than between his 2nd and 3rd.  &gt;They be deeper but not better offensively. Ball and hart don’t add that much offensive value and are taking away minutes from others.   Ball ( 12/7 on 55% effective ) is an upgrade over Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, and Dion Waiters.  Hart ( 10/2 on 53% effective plus 7 rebounds ) is better than a couple of those guys, too.  &gt; New Orleans but he didn’t have great help most years outside jrue   Anderson/Evans/Gordon/Holiday should be enough for Davis to reliably make the playoffs.  It was not.  Most years, they weren't even close.  &gt;  If ad misses a buzzer beater it’s 3-2.   And if he shoots better than 11 for 23, a buzzer beater isn't necessary.  More to the point, there's no reason Ingram, Ball, Hart, or some other Laker could not have hit those shots.  It's not like Davis is a good three-point shooter -- he's worse than all those guys.  &gt;There is nothing to outbid for Miami, butler got a max contract with them.   There was still a trade that required matching or beating.  The point is, Butler would've been a Laker if Davis wasn't.  And no one was beating James + Butler + Ingram + the deepest team in the league.  They might've swept the playoffs.  And that team would be even more unbeatable this season, and for years to come, and would still have most of their draft picks.  &gt; traded is irrelevant, brogdon wanted to go there.   Apart from a few years of the Kobe Bryant era, no player has ever not wanted to be a Laker.  In the unlikely event that Brogdon did not, the Lakers still had tons of depth and assets to trade for a litany of other players."

"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
"Most Detroit Pistons from the last six years or so.   We've been churning out solid role players for winning teams for some time now. Usually how it works is they become overwhelmed in a role too big for their skillset, get sent away for peanuts, then that player finds a niche with their new club.  It's the Kentavious Caldwell-Pope approach."
"The most-recently-drafted Top 10 draft pick to even play in the Finals is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- drafted #8 overall by the Pistons in 2013.  The most-recently-drafted Top 10 pick to play in the Finals with his draft team was Harrison Barnes -- #7 overall by the Warriors in 2012.  Of the past 100 top 10 picks -- 2009 through 2019 -- only Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry have even played in the Finals with their draft team.  &amp;#x200B;  This idea that a team just needs a first-round pick to win is not well supported."
"So, this is a testament to both the Pistons' ineptitude and Andre's but it was basically, ""Anyone but Andre"".   In the 2017 postseason, it was Reggie Jackson (who actually had a great season that year, with some all-star buzz even), then a mix of Tobias Harris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Marcus Morris.  In 2019, Blake Griffin still played half of that series, so he was still the No. 1 option, even with a bum leg. For the rest of the series, it was Reggie Jackson then whoever else could run off a screen - Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Langston Gallaway, etc.   Looking at Andre's field goal attempts can be odd when trying to find out where he stood as an option because a number of those shots were from offensive rebounds and put-back attempts. Without those putbacks, he was generally shooting 10 times a game or less, with many of *those* shots coming via pick &amp; roll lob and the others often coming from Andre trying to iso off the dribble or attempt one his awful hooks (or god forbid, a 3-pointer)."
"As an NBA fan, this rings very true. There’s obviously an issue, but the facts are there.  As a Lakers fan, some of these dudes are clutching pearls, and also ignoring the facts about money. Everyone is trying to make their money. They themselves are trying to make their cut. A lot of these organizations have been run like dogshit and have made stupid mistakes that don’t invest in the team (OKC Harden trade, Nets trade a few years ago, Saver and the Suns). Meanwhile, others have had questionable fanbases, e.g. Utah and Boston.   It’s not to disrespect true NBA fans in the small markets, but the solution to this problem is complex.  During LAs championship, you hear Kobe’s name being chanted in Downtown Los Angeles (a very strict city during the pandemic) and even a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope jersey is hard to come by online, how does that compare to possibly winning in Denver.  I don’t mean that to disrespect other fan bases, but at the end of the day, this is America, and it’s all about the fame and fortune."
"None of them are ""stars"", but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is wearing #1 for the Lakers -- which is Wesley Matthews' father's old Laker number.  I wonder if they had a discussion about that, when Matthews signed.  I know Matthews said one of the reason he wanted to be a Laker was to follow in his dad's footsteps."
What about someone clearly and demonstrably better like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope or PJ Tucker?

Kentavious Caldwell Pope
Kentavious Caldwell Pope
"For the Lakers I would say  Lebron James  Anthony Davis  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  &amp;#x200B;  I have multiple favorite teams, don’t judge"
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is? Here's the last 10 #8th overall picks   Obi Toppin  Jaxson Hayes  Collin Sexton   Frank Ntilikina  Marquese Chriss  Stanley Johnson  Nik Stauskas   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   Terrance Ross   Brandon Knight    Look at this list. Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
"yeah thats why actual reputable sources after the deadline continue to report it   &gt; Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.   &gt; The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers in his second season.   &gt; The Lakers’ willingness to include Schröder and Caldwell-Pope is revealing."
"The Lakers looked good with him on the court this year, and the stats bear it out. If you clicked the article you would have seen that:  &gt;&gt; The statistical case in Gasol's favor is overwhelming. He is the only center on the team with a positive plus-minus since Drummond arrived at plus-13. The Lakers have been outscored by six points with Drummond on the floor, and more distressingly, they've lost Montrezl Harrell's minutes by 61 points. Before Anthony Davis got hurt, the starting lineup featuring him, Gasol, LeBron James, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder destroyed teams by 13.9 points per 100 possessions. The sample is small, but so far, Drummond and Davis have played 133 minutes together and the Lakers have lost those minutes by 26 points. The two have struggled to find any chemistry on defense, and offensively, Drummond's presence as a non-shooter has clogged the paint for Davis.   &gt;&gt; Gasol's shooting makes it easier for teammates to get to the basket, and his passing is infectious. The Lakers have a 64 percent assist rate with him on the floor and a 59.1 percent assist rate when he's on the bench. He is by no means Drummond's equal as an athlete, but remains an effective defender, thanks to his high basketball IQ.   At the very least he is clearly better than Drummond, and Harrell in most cases as well."
"[Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. The sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mdbxw2/buha_multiple_sources_told_the_athletic_that_the/)  maybe the Lakers were just being used for leverage but The Athletic is a very reliable source 🤷‍♂️. What's done is done, but if that report is true it was a major fuck up."
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
I'm still not sure the Lakers realize Kentavious Caldwell Pope is as good as Lebron James
"fine. kentavious caldwell pope should be no. 1 here. Runner up kyle kuzma. Does that sound more realistic?  Frank Vogel deserves dpoy more than any of them llol - it's clearly a coaching scheme doing the work, not individuals, given they've performed well even without lebron.

"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players. The only example of a caucasian player being disliked in r/NBA that I could find in my research was Grayson Allen. People love players like Alex Caruso, and say he’s a top 20 shooting guard in the league, while his teammates who are also shooting guards are ignored or hated, like Avery Bradley and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope respectively. I would rank both of those players above Caruso in terms of talent and impact for the Lakers, but only one of those three players is given universal praise on r/NBA."
KP - Kristaps Porzingis   KCP - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   CP3 - Chris Paul   PG13 - Paul George   People only use the abbreviations for well recognized players on r/nba. Team subs differ. Using something like JK for John Konchar here is ridiculous as not many will recognize it.

&gt;Maybe that’s why — even without a de-facto no-trade clause like he’s had    in past years by virtue of re-signing on a three-year deal last summer —    Caldwell-Pope says he isn’t too stressed.  Nope  Source: [https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/3/24/22348453/lakers-trade-rumors-kentavious-caldwell-pope-not-worried](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/3/24/22348453/lakers-trade-rumors-kentavious-caldwell-pope-not-worried)
"&gt; If the Blazers are a believer, the Lakers could have some traction. Horton-Tucker can earn up to about $33-$46 million over three or four years via sign-and-trade. Portland would have a team salary limit at roughly $143 million for the 2021-22 season, which should not be an issue. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers would need to include additional salary, starting with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma. Others, like Montrezl Harrell (if he opts into his final year at $9.7 million) and Alfonzo McKinnie ($1.9 million, some of which would need to be guaranteed) could round out a deal, especially if the Blazers were willing to include center Jusuf Nurkic, who notably told a Bosnian media outlet if Lillard is out, he's out. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers also have the No. 22 pick, which can be dealt in August when Horton-Tucker is eligible for a sign-and-trade (legally, Los Angeles would not be able to select a player at Portland's direction). The Lakers can also send one of their 2027 or 2028 first-rounders and five of their next seven second-rounders (through 2028).  Imagine trading Dame and Nurkic for pricy rotation players, the 22nd pick, and a future 1st.  That's basically what the Raptors were requesting for a couple months of Lowry."
"That whole ""every run has some luck"" thing starts to run thin when literally every team they face is injured. Especially when it's the top players injured. Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Will Barton, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris. Probably missing more, but that's all I can remember"

If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.

"Yeah, but before he got hurt he was really good for a long time.

"He got a dui and practiced during probation, it's just a joke.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/12/21/lakers-kentavious-caldwell-pope-serving-25-day-jail-sentence-while-practicing-and-playing/975020001/"
"Especially when you consider they turned a completely washed up Wall and a protected 2023 pick into Westbrook which will become Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, and the 22nd overall pick of the 2021 Draft."
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is a pretty big name
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Moses Moody sounds like someone who’s gonna be Kentavious Caldwell-Pope type of player. Remind me in 3 years.
"The Los Angeles Lakers are nearing a deal with the Washington Wizards to acquire Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski."
He is smoking Kentavious Caldwell-Pope?
"Woj Tweeted Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN.  That feels like so little for Westbrook, why would the wizards do this? Are they going to move Beal too and go full rebuild?"
"My assumption is that the Spurs sign-and-trade Demar DeRozan (let's say... $66m over 3 years?) to the Lakers for Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Once they fill out the other parts of the roster, Ellington is an extremely savvy option."
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"They did an incredible job.  Wall hadn't played in 2 years, reached his max already as a player, and they got that for a guy who was coming off an injury but is always at least a force and a draw and you never have to worry about him mentally competing.  Then they essentially took Wall and a protected first into  Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' No. 22    The only losers in this are the Rockets. Which under the new owner slowly disengrated a team he inherited in the first place to now chasing off a team President, GM, Ass Gms, Coach, Ass Coach, STars and Role players and ended last year in the bottom of the seeds and almost set a record for multiple losses in a row.   They at least have a yougn direction now, but wow Houston fans got Dollar Value Dolan.  Same Bullshit and Ego, but the reality show version with all talk and no action."
"He got a future first round pick, a 2021 first round pick (Isaiah Jackson), a couple of seconds, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Montrezl Harrell (on an expiring contract). It may not be a massive haul but it’s a pretty damn good one for one of the worst contracts in sports."
"Reserved for the Pope himself. Kentavious Caldwell, that is."
"Do you like their chances? They finished one game above 10th last season. Currently projecting to be 11th in the East, 21st overall.

"The '' He urged Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to turn down Detroit's five-year, $80 million extension. Marcus Morris fired Paul after they declined a three-year, $41 million offer from the Clippers in free agency. '' Sounds just as fishy. Guess where they played and prevented from playing."

Yeah maybe trade him for somebody like Danny Green or Kentavious Caldwell-Pope might help their championship odds.
"Again, take it with a grain of salt like most trade rumours because we’re not actually there. But according to the reports the opposite of what you’re saying is true.  “Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.  The same sources said that, Rob Pelinka, the Lakers’ vice president of basketball operations, insisted that price was too high for the 35-year-old Lowry, and that he was not willing to trade Horton-Tucker, the 20-year-old combo guard who has emerged as a valuable rotation player for the Lakers”  They were fine with letting KCP and Dennis go. THT is the one they were intent on holding on to."
"Well they turned Westbrook, Troy Brown Jr, Moe Wagner, and Chandler Hutchison into Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Aaron Holiday, Isaiah Todd, Daniel Gafford."
"[Lakers were looking at Lowry at last years trade deadline and we’re in serious talks.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/26/report-lakers-refused-to-trade-talen-horton-tucker-for-kyle-lowry/) per reports they were looking at making this trade:  &gt; Multiple sources told The Athletic that the Lakers and Raptors discussed a trade that would have sent both members of Los Angeles’ starting backcourt, Dennis Schröder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and likely some draft compensation to Toronto for Lowry. Throughout Thursday morning, sources said, the sticking point was the inclusion of Talen Horton-Tucker.

If Lowry wanted to go to the Lakers, the Lakers could have put a package together since teams that have the bird rights FA (Toronto) do not have an insane amount of leverage. Toronto got Dragic from the Heat who isn’t really playing for the Raps right now. Lakers were able to put a package together for Westbrook where they had to off load both Caruso and KCP. If Lakers were reported by Shamas as serious suitors you know they at least had a chat with Lowrys agent and Bobby Webster"

"Something I copied real quick:  The trade will send Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' No. 22 pick in Thursday's NBA Draft in exchange for Westbrook, a 2024 second-round pick and a 2028 second-round pick"
Alex Caruso and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope
"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."
