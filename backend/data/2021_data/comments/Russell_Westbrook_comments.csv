I think we will look back at Russell Westbrook as one of the most under-appreciated talents in NBA history
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal
"When Kenny the Jet said tonight in regards to people not throwing it down....JRich ALWAYS threw em down with power. Dude was always looking down the rim. Nice to see him up there.   My favorite dunkers of all time- MJ, VC, Gerald Green.  Honorable mention to Russell Westbrook for his in game beastmode dunks."
"People tend to lose sight of how damn athletic he is because of his otherworldly shooting ability. He's obviously not going to measure up to the prime LeBron/Giannis/Russell Westbrook level athletes in that regard, but he's a good athlete even by NBA standards."
“The most 3’s in a half: 7 by Russell Westbrook...”   Russ stan nostalgia at an all time high right now
Russell westbrook
if I was a multimillionaire athlete i'd be Tim Duncan one day and Russell Westbrook the next
This was the James harden vs Russell westbrook mvp debate to me.   Two less rebounds vs 6% better true shooting and more wins
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
"I liked how in 2K, if Dlo was guarding Russ, they’d say it was “Russell on Westbrook”"
"I have no clue where to even access this.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28763166/russell-westbrook-scores-34-points-being-guarded-rudy-gobert%3fplatform=amp  Here's a good example in a n=2 scenario. The defensive player of the year TO ME, should be able to play good defense on most people. A la, Kawhi. A la, prime draymond, a la, prime Dennis Rodman.  The rockets were essentially hunting for the Gobert matchup with their perimeter players."
"You've previously said that ""you will always defend russell westbrook"", as Westbrook fan nothing brought me greater joy.   Do you still hold this opinion even after his moves to Houston and Washington???"
My bad it was just as racist tho https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2019/3/12/18261550/russell-westbrook-jazz-fan-video-story-utah
russell westbrook makes everyone around him better
"You're telling me this swole ass battletoad looking mother fucker brought the ball up court, drove and pulled a hesi to poster dunk like he baron davis/Derrick rose/Russell Westbrook?"
"Pretty sure you don't even know what are you talking about at this point.  I never said high statistics directly translate into how valuable a player is for a team. Russell Westbrook was never a great shooter, so his scoring numbers are not impressive at all. On top of that, his usage was 42% for his MVP season. Jokic is not exactly hogging the ball like Westbrook was doing. AD never played enough games during the regular season to be a serious MVP candidate, also you do realize MVP is a regular season award right?  Curry is not the best facilitator lmao, actually very delusional to think he is better than Draymond on dishing out dimes.   NBA didn't start in 2015 son, Curry had multiple disappointing seasons before Kerr."
"Russell Westbrook did not shoot 65.5% TS in his prime, like.. what is it so hard to understand?  Here is the basketball 101, if a player is dishing out dimes, grabbing rebounds, putting the ball into the basket with high efficient rate, this player is contributing a lot for the team. This guy is leading the whole team in every single statistic category except for blocks, HOW IN THE FUCK is he producing on his teammates expense? While his usage rate is not even 30%. Like, you want him to grab less rebounds? Shoot less while he is obviously the most efficient shooter on the team? Or share less balls? wtf are you even thinking?  Curry doesnt have any fancy assist number because he is not even the best facilitator on his own team. How is this hard to understand at all? I don't get it. Like, Jokic is shooting more efficient than Curry, and you are here crying about him basically stat padding on his teammates expense? Kiddo, sit down."
"Here's one: the competition to the Finals was WEAK.  First round: 5 games  Second round: 5 games, injured Russell Westbrook  WCF: yet another 5 games where Jamal Murry ended up getting injured. And the Lakers ended up facing the Nuggets instead of the Clippers, who supposedly could have given them the real problems.  Finals: A Heat team that was undermanned (with Adebayo injured for the first few games) still took them to 6 GAMES.  So it's completely understandable that people feel that way."
"Unless, of course, you're Russell Westbrook and you're out there doing things on the court that require two digits to explain instead of one"
" ""By Nov. 11, Harden indicated to Russell Westbrook he wanted to be traded to Brooklyn. As a result, Westbrook [asked out](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1326678884226658311). Not because of Harden's [partying tendencies](https://twitter.com/AlexKennedyNBA/status/1350233947360415745) or the Rockets' culture issues, but simply because he knew Harden wanted out, according to multiple sources close to the Rockets. ""        I always had a feeling but good to know thats why westbrook requested a trade first"
&gt; He also had the better statistical case. He had basically the same performance without being anywhere near as ball dominant. Russell Westbrook had 50% usage that year. &gt;  &gt;   Russel's usage % was 41.7 to Harden's 34.2  Russel's PER was 30.6 to Harden's 27.4.   Russel's +/- was 11.1 to Harden's 8.7  Russel's VORP was 9.3 to Harden's 8.0
Russell Westbrook exists lol.
Russell Westbrook would like a word
"Well first of all that's a totally fair argument because the Rockets had basically the same level of talent as the Thunder that year.  It's not like they were better because Harden had another superstar, he was the reason they were good.  He also had the better statistical case.  He had basically the same performance without being anywhere near as ball dominant.  Russell Westbrook had 50% usage that year.  I'm fine with Westbrook winning it because I'm fine with the tiebreaker for MVP being  ""who is more exciting to watch"" every once in a while, but if you think Westbrook was clearly better than Harden that year you need your head checked."
Russell Westbrook is that line.

Russell Westbrook
"the best timeline: after he wins one in brooklyn, old man harden goes back to houston (when tilman isn't owner anymore) to pair up with cade cunningham and chris paul, with russell westbrook coming off the bench(still averaging 10/10/10 on 10 turnovers) wins a ring."
whys jokic introducing russell westbrook? didnt he have a game today?
Nikola “Russell Westbrook” Jokic  (For legal reasons this is a joke)
2016 - Russell Westbrook (blew 3-1 lead)  2015 - Westbrook (lost in the first round in 2019)  2014 Kyrie (Thinks the world is flat)  2013 - Chris Paul (Got injured in 2011)
"He should thank, dwight howard, chris paul , russell westbrook, trevor ariza, eric gordon , clint capela , pj tucker  and the refs/ adam silver when the rockets retire his jersey"
"Meet James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Dirk and Derrick Rose!"
"Actually they go after mpj. I think ppl just choke when he’s defending or something?? He’s held ppl like Jason tatum to like 5/18 shooting or something, Colin Sexton to 1/9, Russell Westbrook to like 5/15."
"do ppl just choke when he’s defending or something?? He’s held ppl like Jason tatum to like 5/18 shooting or something, Colin Sexton to 1/9, Russell Westbrook to like 5/15."
UCLA hasn't been to a final four since Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook were there. A few Sweet 16 bertha are nice for a lot of schools but not one of UCLA's stature.
"Worst fan take:  *After 1-3 bad games that an all star/MVP level player is trash/overhated/washed/exposed (aka those weird Facebook people that create accounts just to hate on like one player)  Worst YouTube Take: Lonzo Ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical  Worst Media/NBA Award: 2016 All NBA  Deandre Jordan being voted 1st team All NBA tied with James Harden not making any All NBA team (Kyle Lowry, CP3, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook and Damien Lillard) being guards who made it over him"
I still love the Russell Westbrook comp. idk if his strength is there but his pass or drive with no 3s is exact
Does this mean if a fellow asian calls you “deceptively athletic” it’s still “racist”? Russell Westbrook is deceptively athletic too he just doesn’t have a jump shot.
"When Lynn was drafted/undrafted/came into the NBA, he had a better lateral, 3/4 quart sprint, and benchpress then Derrick Rose John Wall and Russell Westbrook. The man was incredibly athletic but… He lacked a vertical wingspan and skin melanin  By the way… Jimmy Butler is probably the most athletic player drafted in the last 10 years off his combine statistics don’t @ me"
Reggie is balls. He Thought he shoulda been a starter over Westbrook when russ was beginning his prime. Lol I’d take Russell Westbrook on the downside over Reggie in his prime.
"You are spot on with your analysis. Russ is at his best when he’s either attacking or making a clear balance between scoring/passing.  He is healthy now but it looks like he is picking and choosing because he knows he can’t go 110% the entire night like he did when he was younger because he could potentially injure his quad.  I don’t think he should be deferring to Beal as much either. Although when he deferred to PG it looked so awkward but now with Beal it looks more ‘natural’. But by deferring to Beal and letting him score more the offence does look more dynamic. Beal is more of a natural scorer so he can shoot the 3, pull up from the mid range or attack the rim. If Russ starts to take over you know he’s either taking a mid range or attacking the rim. It’s still pretty damn hard to stop Russ from scoring when you know what’s going to happen.  Scott Brooks is probably one of the worst coaches in the NBA, so Russ can’t be Russ because Brooks is holding him back. He isn’t playing Russ to his strengths by clearing the paint and letting him attack the rim.  But we have to remember though that Russ is getting older so eventually he has to change his game to be more of a facilitator and the second guy. He needs to work on his turnovers because at times when he is being more passive he does tend to switch off and cause stupid mistakes.  For some reason I have a feeling that Russ is going to go into full out attack mode himself in another 5 or so games and start to put up insane numbers. I don’t think he can go an entire season taking a back seat to Beal, there will be a stretch of games where he puts up big numbers. This is all apart of the Russell Westbrook show, you really don’t know what Russ you will get on any given night."

"How can a guy who scores high 20’s on above average efficiency be a stat padder? Stat padder is someone like Russell Westbrook. Stuffs the stat sheet in every category, scores inefficiently, and who purposely seeks that extra assist and rebound. Just cause he was a good player surrounded by bad talent doesn’t mean he was a stat padder u moron"

"They are required by the NBA to do those interviews. A lot of players dislike the sports media, and some (Russell Westbrook being a prime example) hate sports reporters with a passion.  The league understands that the media is vital, but players see it as an annoyance.  I think this is especially true now that these talks happen remotely due to COVID, rather than the classic locker room interviews."
"I don’t think it’s necessarily a drop.  He dropped 40 on the nets with ease like 2 weeks because he was in full on attack mode. Yes, statically he has dropped in scoring although you can see that he’s passing the ball more, looking to set up his teammates to score and he’s legitimately taking a back seat to Beal throughout the game and especially during the clutch. Last year he was in attack mode because the Rockets had no centre and their spacing was elite. This year he is playing with Len, Lopez and Wagner who clog up the paint (especially Len and Lopez, no 3pt shot). Then you have Hachimura who also likes to play in the paint. It’s only logical that Russ changes his game to facilitating more. Scott Brooks is also not unleashing Russell’s full blown attack mode as he doesn’t let Russ dunk. People think Russ has lost his athleticism but that’s far from the truth, you can see when he rebounds the ball that his bounce is still crazy or when he’s running the fast break you see that he is still insanely quick but it’s like he’s not exerting himself 100% because he’s picking when to exert himself fully. I think that he is trying to play like CP3 now that he is getting older, so he’s not worried about scoring as much, he is looking more to be a floor general and control the game. It looks like he has trouble scoring but it’s just his game style has changed which is hard to agree with because we are talking about Russell Westbrook, the dude that is going 100% on every possession no matter what."
"Do you actually need me to break it down for you?   When Russell Westbrook is in the game, the Wizards have the 27th ranked offense and 27th ranked defense in the league. They are significantly better when he is not on the floor. Thus, he is not having a positive impact on the team."
Being a Russell Westbrook hater is such a sad past time
Presti his haul by giving up an exponentially worse player.  Do you really think Harden isn’t worth more than Russell Westbrook?
"I mean Harden has played with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. Those are some pretty big names."
"I love how Russell Westbrook won the Player's vote for MVP, the media's vote for MVP, r/nba's vote for MVP, and had literally more than 3 times the first place votes that James Harden had, but Harden was somehow robbed."

"You know what I really dislike about Laker fans? Way before I visited this sub I was in an FB group called LakerGang because one of my friends invited me over there and holy shit they really put Laker jerseys on every Free Agent Star they could find. Dirk, Klay, LeBron, Duncan, Wade, Butler, KD you name it. Shit was blasphemous as hell. But of course, they end up unsuccessful and try to play GM or even worse, convince themselves that they drafted a steal. Jordan Clarkson = Russell Westbrook or Julius Randle = mobile Shaq and the worst comparison yet Ryan Kelly = white KD."

Those lean post-Shaq years weren't great, but it actually looks like his last 3 seasons sunk him the most. Same story for Pierce, although for him it actually looks more like his early Celtics years sunk him."
"Basketball is fun, I watch my team play every game. This sub changes who the MVP should be on a nightly basis and thinks X team will be in the conference finals this year because of their regular season record despite them not getting out of the first round since Russell Westbrook was on the Thunder.   You have to prove it to me first,when the games actually matter."
It was the full Russell Westbrook experience.
So...two years?  Take out every year except 2017-19 and Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for his entire career.
Russell Westbrook easy
Russell Westbrook achieved far more in an OKC jersey than Kevin Durant did.

DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"Russell Westbrook &amp; KD were both MVPs, but I’d argue, Gary Payton was the best in Franchise history. He revolutionized the PG position, and is one of the best defenders in NBA history. People underestimate how amazing he was in the playoffs too. There was a game against the Suns where his stat line was ridiculous: 28/9/14 and 5 steals. He’d probably have been MVP if Hakeem, MJ, Malone or Barkley all missed a season at the same time. He was always the 4th or 5th best player in his best seasons. But that’s how legendary those other guys were.  There’d be no Russell Westbrook if Payton hadn’t played, and if Payton played in today’s league(cause he was an outside threat too,) he’d a be a top 20 player easily, and maybe even an MVP candidate as often as KD &amp; Russ were."
"""Russell Westbrook"" lol fans"
Russell Westbrook in shambles.
"How are you gonna stan Russell Westbrook from OKC, to Houston, to the ducking wizards?!?!! NOW that’s some funny shit"
Unless your name is Russell Westbrook
"You know what gets lots of guys into the hall? Winning championships.  Harden, in case you forgot, was on a team with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka - they even made it to the finals (the only time Harden's ever been).  The guys Harden keeps losing to? Yeah, it's the Warriors - including the Warriors beating him last season when Curry and Klay were out and Draymond led a team that was mostly rookies, two-ways, and 10-days past him on national television.  Harden played on teams good enough to win. If only Harden had actually won."
Yeah okay by your logic why is russell westbrook not in the game
"In other words, you can’t be Russell Westbrook in 2021 and make it"
"I wonder if Russell Westbrook would be a more efficient player if he hadn't had Scott Brooks as a coach during his start in the league. Seems like Westbrook is a straightforward guy, which I see reflected in his play. He is always very committed to whatever he is trying to do. Whether it is score, pass, rebound, or end an interview."
Is there any plays who name get meme'd more beautifully than Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook is now the defacto coach of the Wizards.
"""KNOW YOUR ROLE AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH!""  -Russell Westbrook, probably"
"Ah yes, the player notorious for not knowing how to pass the ball: Russell Westbrook"
"im not necessarily putting the best defenders lol. russell westbrook also might not be the second best finisher, and lillard might not be the second best shooter."
"2 guards that can’t shoot. Ish Smith and Russell Westbrook. They both get heavy minutes but ish is hurt right now. I mentioned them earlier, show me some evidence of Bertans ineffectiveness please."
Collin Sexton and Russell Westbrook
"ESPN: Russell Westbrook called out Lopez in front of the whole team and asked, “what do you even *do*?”"
"The whole 1 year rental point aside, did we not go for it with the Kyrie trade and the Hayward signing? That didn’t exactly work out. It’s not like you can simply trade for a top 5 player every single year and automatically win a chip. If it were that easy every team would go for it every single year.  Also what about the Clippers selling the farm and being a 2nd round exit last year? Or the Rockets going after Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and not making the finals? There are plenty of teams that make trades and it doesn’t work in the first year, or at all, and if all the Celtics were getting were likely 1 year rentals why would you do that and have to start rebuilding as Tatum is getting around to that start-of-prime-years range?  The reference of the Heat going for it with Jimmy Butler was also kind of strange, since didn’t Philadelphia do the exact same thing with him and they didn’t make the finals? It’s all just painting a picture to fit this narrative.  These media nephews need to chill on the Boston slander and leave that to fans and redditors."
Every Russell Westbrook trade was a lopsided win for the team trading away Russell Westbrook
This is Russell Westbrook.
Rockets media slanders the fuck out of their players when they leave/want to leave. It’s a great smokescreen over Tillman’s fuckery as owner.  Remember the “Harden throws ball at teammate” article? Or “Harden annoyed as Russell Westbrook” article...As if it is unusual to be annoyed at Westbrook.
"Does it matter? You said Giannis can’t score against elite big men but yet he scored 27 in a half 😭  I’m assuming LeBrons 31 points (in 44 minutes) last night means he can’t score against defensive Juggernauts like Russell Westbrook, right?"
Because he’s Russell Westbrook.
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."

Did you seriously compare LeBron James to Russell Westbrook
Maybe Russell Westbrook isn't the worst player in the league after all guys?? Who would have thought it...

"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"In 2013-14 Russell Westbrook only played 46 games for the season, leaving Kevin Durant to play as the only dynamic scorer on his team for 36 games. This is the closest we've seen to Durant being the only capable scorer on his team (without a Curry, Klay, Harden, Russ type).      In those 36 games he averaged 21.2 FGA per game and averaged 32.9 PPG on 51/39/88 shooting splits. If he got the chance to take an extra 3.8 shots per game I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see an average around 37-40 PPG."
James Harden fans 🤝 Russell Westbrook fans 🤝 Paul George fans 🤝 Giannis Antetokounmpo fans     Finding a new player for r/NBA to slander
There this guy.... his name is Russell Westbrook. He is quite possibly the GOAT.
"Just find one player you dislike and spend all your time repeating the same things about them.  Right now, the popular pick is actually a spectator who was ejected from a game.  Also, Russell Westbrook is the greatest player of all time."
Russell Westbrook is the greatest player of all time
Like Russell Westbrook?
"he's been giving us a chance for 8 years.  we put some really good teams around him, including at least 3 (2015/2018/2019) that were better than this team.  but he usually ran into some combination of a 67 or 73 win warriors teams or superteams where stars joined up like the KD warriors and lebron/AD lakers.  after 11 years in the league i'm sure he was done with ""just give them a chance, and by chance we mean we can win 53 games if you score 35 ppg and drag them to the 2nd or 3rd round and then lose to a team where multiple prime hall of famers joined together while you hope russell westbrook doesn't forget how to play basketball or chris paul doesn't have the worst-timed injury of all time.""   it would be nice if we didn't live in a superteam world, but at some point you get tired of hearing ""just give them a chance"" when everyone else is forming superteams."
"Westbrook has shot 46 for 164 (28%) in the final 5 minutes of playoff games that were within 5 points, including 8 for 52 on threes.  Westbrook's 30.5 EFG% in these situations is easily the worst among high volume shooters during his career:  |Rk|Player|G|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|LeBron James|86|98|250|.392|30|79|.380|.452| |2|Kevin Durant|55|71|171|.415|13|52|.250|.453| |3|Russell Westbrook|45|46|164|.280|8|52|.154|.305| |4|Stephen Curry|38|49|131|.374|26|66|.394|.473| |5|James Harden|43|49|126|.389|13|57|.228|.440| |6|Paul Pierce|44|51|118|.432|13|33|.394|.487| |7|Dwyane Wade|47|55|115|.478|5|19|.263|.500| |8|Kobe Bryant|29|37|102|.363|6|30|.200|.392| |9|Kawhi Leonard|38|45|101|.446|14|37|.378|.515| |10|Tony Parker|34|40|92|.435|4|13|.308|.457| |11|Rajon Rondo|35|37|84|.440|2|10|.200|.452| |12|Chris Paul|35|38|82|.463|8|22|.364|.512| |13|Damian Lillard|22|30|80|.375|10|31|.323|.438| |14|Joe Johnson|31|31|79|.392|7|27|.259|.437| |15|Ray Allen|35|26|75|.347|18|54|.333|.467|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 2/2/2021."
"I disagree - Tommy was always an interim guy and has had to fight to secure his status for the future. While he has done a lot right, the Russell Westbrook trade was going to make or break his future with the team-- even though we could connect a lot of it to Scott Brooks."
"Did you ever hear the tragedy of James Harden The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Nets would tell you. It’s a Rockets legend. James Harden was an MVP, so powerful and so wise he could use the ISO to influence teammates to give up on life… He had such a thirst for dribbling that he could even keep Russell Westbrook from contributing. The dark side of the ISO is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught John Wall everything he knew, then Wall killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could give others the keys to a title, but not himself."
Russell Westbrook turns into Tony Allen on the defensive end when he’s playing against Big Brother.
"Russell Westbrook is, and people slander him all the time."
"Exactly. If a player like Russell Westbrook or Draymond Green was caught telling a female fan ""bitch shut the fuck up and sit down"", there would be numerous people calling for a suspension/fine. But because it's LeBron everyone just finds it hilarious..."
I blame James Harden for that  Russell Westbrook is the exact OPPOSITE of a Morey Player
What the fuck does that mean Russell Westbrook?
Does this include Russell Westbrook against the Nets?

"&gt; He’ll have more rings because he sacrificed for the team? No, he’ll have more rings because he played with KD and steph.  You just said the same thing two different ways.   &gt; As for his numbers going up on a bad team, maybe because he will look to shoot more. But his percentages would go way down, and he would probably be looked at the same way someone like Russell Westbrook is looked at  Yep, great analogy. Klay would be a bonafided ""Superstar"" like Russ and be fucking about trying for an 8 seed somewhere. He's too smart for that."
"He’ll have more rings because he sacrificed for the team? No, he’ll have more rings because he played with KD and steph. If he had tried to ever be the guy they would have gotten rid of him without a second though, because steph is much better.

"&gt; Russell Westbrook is now shooting 36.5% from 3 for the season, a Career high!  &gt; Well I hate Westbrook’s guts but he did ball out tonight and he deserves props  This is the textbook definition of karma whoring lmao"
"Westbrook does have a certain flavor of showmanship and dominating presence, that ONLY he brings, and those of us who appreciate it are really going to miss it. I don't care about the numbers. It's always been impossible for me to be upset about Russell Westbrook doing Westbrook things"
*Also: Bradley Beal gives a sideways glance to Russell Westbrook!!*              This dude is literally ESPN....
As is the true Russell Westbrook way. A terrible shot that makes you bang your head on a wall followed by a magical shot to win the game.

"Why does this sub hate Russell Westbrook so much? He’s an MVP, 2x scoring champ, 2x assist champ, been to multiple WCF’s, been to the nba finals, dropped 41 in a finals game, he’s an Olympic gold medalist and a Fiba gold medalist. Seriously, why does this dude get so much hate? I get that he has horrible IQ at times and he is a brick machine, but no teammate has ever said anything bad about Russell. He’s seen as an amazing teammate, a ferocious player (MJ and Kobe literally said they love watching Westbrook) and he gives it his all every game. Dude was injured and it was pretty clear that his quad was limiting his play. Ever year he starts off slow and then finds his feet.  I’m gobsmacked at how much this sub hates Russell. He has a few bad games and he is ‘washed’, he has a few good games it’s brushed off like it’s nothing. Dude is an amazing player and like any player he has his flaws, which this sub LOVE to hate on.  This sub really needs to stop the Russ slander, love him or hate him, he is a legend of the game and the second best PG of the 2010s behind Curry."
russell westbrook at brand new team with brand new star in brand new system: plays shaky.  russell westbrook settled in: plays as top 10 player in the league.  russell westbrook injured + covid: plays bad.  russell westbrook injured + new system + new superstar: plays shaky.  russell westbrook healthy: plays very well.  seems more like it’s just a pretty natural thing based on the situation and you get off on him doing badly
"Never forget that Russ signed his extension on KD’s birthday, thus making 29th of September Russell Westbrook Day"
"&gt;but is there a star on this sub more disproportionately scrutinized than Russell Westbrook?  No. Injuries get brought up on the most useless 10th guy on any squad if they play bad but for Russ anything that's explaining some of his early-season shortcomings are _excuses_. Matter of fact Westbrook needed a lot of treatment during the off-season for like 4 or 5 seasons straight now. He always starts slow and gets back into his groove eventually. But fuck it this sub finds 1000 ways of pretending his amazing MVP season on league average TS was utterly worthless shit, too."
Happy Russell Westbrook Day
If Russell Westbrook isnt the sidebar tomorrow...
Russell Westbrook when he’s playing KD
"It's not about being good, he will not make thatmany jumpers, he'll be less efficient, we know it.  But he LOOKED like Russell Westbrook, he tried to go to the rim at least. Idk if you watched a lot of his games this year, but basically in the halfcourt he didn't even really try to blow by guys at the start of the season"
Russell Westbrook always tries his hardest against Big Brother. He will never win a championship unless he accepts a role to come off the bench for the Brooklyn Nets in 2023.  The next 3-5 years are Brooklyns. Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot makes me sick.

"Ask Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and Paul George about the playoffs"
"LeBron’s won the last 6 game 7’s he’s played, unless you’re taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition? He’s played Tony Parker 3x, Manu Ginobili 3x, Tim Duncan 3x, Ray Allen 4x, Paul Pierce 5x, Kevin Garnett 5x, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose 3x, Andre Iguodala 5x, Dirk Nowtizki, Carmelo Anthony 2x, Paul George 4x, Russell Westbrook 2x, James Harden 2x, Kevin Durant 3x, Kawhi Leonard 2x, Stephen Curry 4x, Klay Thompson 4x, Draymond Green 4x, Damian Lillard, Nikola Jokic, and Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.  And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."
"Ik he won mostly b/c of triple doubles, but they weren't the only reason.   Like I said recency bias is a thing, and he finished the season strong w/ multiple clutch performances and Harden finished it relatively quiet.  [He dominated the ball in 4ths b/c it was effective, no different than the amount of isos Harden has, it's okay b/c it's effective.](https://imgur.com/a/3VzOynN)  [As for his supporting cast, the stats definitely support him having the worst - even accounting for coaches](https://imgur.com/a/6h57BI1)  Houston's offensive rating w/o Harden went from 2nd to 5th, whereas w/o Westbrook OKC's offensive rating went from 15th to 29th.

*Russell Westbrook in shambles*  It’s actually funny though how two of the most turnover prone guards of all-time were on the same team at one point.
Russell Westbrook for point guard
 Kermit Washington injuring Rudy Tomjanovich.   Pat Beverley injuring Russell Westbrook.
"Never forget how quickly Tillman brought down this franchise fast enough to give you whiplash. He overruled Morey, made our team significantly worse, which ultimately factored in driving both Daryl and Harden out of town.   ""My basketball ops got maybe a little weak at the end [of the trade discussions]. And I just said, 'We're doing this.'"" -this quote reads in retrospect as if he's jumping on the grenade to save Morey the ignominy  “We’re so excited to have Russell Westbrook. I would watch him play for Oklahoma City and he’s so athletic."" - Fertitta, billionaire owner who understands basketball good, got fined for commenting before the trade was finalized   ""That CP3/Westbrook trade was made because Tilman Fertitta wanted it made. He thought Chris Paul’s contract was the worst he’d ever seen in business or sports.” - McMahon"
"Russell Westbrook is almost averaging a triple double so he’s good, Conley only averaging 16 pts per game, so he sucks. Yes I’m a football fan"
"This post displays a rudimentary understanding of the game. Box score provides only a vague idea of what a player actually brings to the table. For example, what about those seasons that Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double? Those box scores made him look superior to such players as LeBron, Curry, and Durant. Was he better than any of them? Not even close. Using box score as a means of determining a player’s “goodness” is fallacious."
"ok so like i know this isnt the right place  ok  but pls listen   im high af but i think Wiggins could do well playing with a player like russell westbrook, especially personality wise  i got a pack of mnm's infront of me and i just smoked 0.8G, lifes good  take care bros"
"in a perfect world he'd be an awesome 2nd unit leader I think , but it's russell  fuckin westbrook and as long as he has the mega contract nobody is gonna pay him astronomical amounts of money to ride the pine"
"To get the details right on the WB-Paul trade, per Shams: https://mobile.twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1149478200994459651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1149478200994459651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2845267-nba-trade-rumors-latest-details-on-russell-westbrook-chris-paul-trade  Sources: Pick protections in Thunder/Rockets, Russell Westbrook/Chris Paul trade:  2024 first round pick, protected 1-4 2026 first round pick, protected 1-4 2025 swap, 1-20 protected 2021 swap, protected 1-4 -- OKC can swap Clippers pick or Heat pick.  What was confusing to me at the time was why Rockets paid so much - ignoring the merits of the players at the time, if Westbrook had just wanted to go to the Rockets, this is the one player where Thunder would have respected that wish (instead of trying to do the best deal) - all indications then were that Thunder would have only traded him somewhere that he wanted to go. Perhaps WB just gave a big list of teams he wanted to go to, but he had some say here."
russell westbrook no longer good   upvotes please
the holy duo of dudes that /r/nba loves to shit on: Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook
Imagine if russell westbrook is bought out somehow. Okc 2021 edition.
"Its not that they couldnt have won with Westbrook. Maybe they could have, maybe they couldnt have.  The argument will always be that his style of play and lack of recognition of how much better Kevin Durant was than him eventually drove KD to look for greener pastures. In fact it was so bad that KD chose Golden State and talked about how their style of basketball is what drew him to them.  The other argument that will eventually develop is that OKC essentially chose Westbrook (and Ibaka) over Harden.  While the common theory is that OKC should have amnestied Kendrick Perkins, the real lucrative dynasty would have come from trading a young, budding Russell Westbrook.   It's revisionist history for most of the league's fans, but the potential of a team built around Harden and KD, combined with the assets they could have gotten had they (purely theoretically) chosen to trade Russ instead of Harden, is a hypothetical of equivalent potential to the story that Houston almost had Jordan, Drexler and Hakeem."
"&gt;Additionally, Russell Westbrook (3631 13 seasons) will likely move from #9 to #10 bypassing Hakeem Olajuwon (3667 18 seasons)    DOnt you mean #10 to #9?"
"Today I learned I could be an NBA executive.  But for real, anyone who who thinks an athletic reliant player will have a good back end career is a fool.  Please see how that turned out for drose, Dwight, Blake griffin, John wall...Russell Westbrook to name a few.  All these players were phenomenal but without having the basic fundamentals of the game, you’re bound to burn in a flame. These players are simply not meant to last."
"What kind of contracts are DeAngelo Russell, John Wall, and Russell Westbrook on?"
"&gt;because people around here hate Russell Westbrook  Lol, the guy has more fanboys who defend his every move than just about anyone on this sub."
because people around here hate Russell Westbrook  but make excuses for their overweight savior in Dallas
Can I just answer Russell Westbrook ?
"Yup. The whole point of going small ball last year was to clear the paint for Westbrook. Morey saw the opportunity and jumped on it. Problem is...in February/March 2020, Russell was killing it, but by the time the bubble happened he was a whole different player."

Russell Westbrook and Ibaka would fit perfectly...
KD couldn't win with RUSSELL WESTBROOK as his second option and then he went to Curry's team to get his ring does this mean that KD is a bad first option? Ask your question when Dame has another top 20 player as his second option

"Russell Westbrook is the greatest streetball player ever, but his style does not lead to NBA championship level success"
ROFL. This is hilarious. The Thunder were projected to be terrible last year...except people forgot that Chris Paul is a much better player than Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;Yes, let's take one year of 32-year-old Russell Westbrook out of his prime to say whether or not he is a winning player. Dame has been bounced in the first round in 3 of the last 4 years and in those three years his teams have won 1 game, ONE and he is in his PRIME.  I'm sorry, I thought this post was bringing up 32 year old Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double.  And my post was about how soft Russ fans are, bringing up Dame for no reason at all to deflect valid Russ criticism. Soft shit.  &gt;Russell Westbrook was the 2nd best player on a team that went to the NBA Finals in 2012 and was the best player for the Thunder in their 2016 WCF run where they lost in 7 games to the 73-9 Warriors (he was, just look up the stats and how he outperformed KD in that run), but yall are here saying that he isn't a winning player, yeah ok.  That was then and this is now. And again, why are we talking about the Blazers at all? Soft.  &gt;Let's praise the guy that looks like JJ Barea everytime he faces Steph Curry, but shit on the guy that won an MVP and was up 3-1 on Steph in the WCF. 10/10 reddit logic  Bringing up Russ's stats while his team is 18-32. Sure man great take your triple double and your L's."

"Whatever one might think of his style of play and it's ability to win, there is no denying that he is not washed up.   Only two players have ever averaged a triple double in the regular season: Westy and the Big O.   The Big O did it once.   Westy is doing it for the FOURTH TIME.  How on Earth could a person who is washed up achieve a sustained level of play that had only been done by one other person?   And at the age of 32 with under 36 minutes a game (when Oscar did it, he got 44 minutes a game, and his per36 stats were under a triple double).   So in essence, outside of Russell Westbrook, nobody in the history of the game has been able to do in under 36 minutes what he is doing this season.   You'd have to be an idiot to see Westbrook play and think he's washed up."
"Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Steven Adams?  Seriously though they have something like 17 or 18 FRP over the next 7 years right? I think given they have the contracts and good young players in Shai, Dort, etc they could realistically get 3 all star/2 superstar caliber players pretty easily."
"Not sure that 2019 series can really be taken as an example, this one of the biggest tank job by a star I've ever seen, the dude was just picking up Giannis and Middleton full court for no reason and on offense yeah Kyrie is a tough shot maker but the shots he was taking were just some of the most ridiculous I've ever seen, let's put it that way : Kyrie's shot selection at the end of that series is the worst I've ever seen and I say that as someone who has watched a lot of Russell Westbrook games in my life lol"
Russell Westbrook supports the BDS movement (bitch do shoot).
"Russell Westbrook carried his 2016-17 team to the 6th seed. He will have carried them farther than Steph is carrying his team right now, but Steph has the worse supporting cast. Do you understand now?"
"It still counts towards your usage when you score after an off-ball action, so it is not a great measure of ball-dominance  I pulled the play-type data from nba.com for Beal, Luka, Trae, and Dame  | | Cut | Spot-up | Handoff | Off Screen | Total off-ball | PnR handler | Iso | Total on-ball | |-|-----|---------|--------|------------|--------------|------------|----|-------------| | Beal  | 6.7% | 8.6%  | 9.5%    |   13.4%     |    38.2%       |  31.1%       | 8% | 39%           | | Luka | 0%    | 5.8%  |  4.7%   |   2.1%       |   12.6%        | 48.7%        | 17.1% | 65.8% | | Trae | 0%    | 9%     |  4.9%   |  .8%         | 14.7%           | 55.1%       |  7.9%  | 63%    | | Dame| 2.1% | 5.3%  |  7.5%    |  3.5%       | 18.4%           | 48.8%       | 18.3% | 67.1%  |  As you can see the other three guys spend a lot more time on-ball than Beal. Now, part of this is because their rosters are better-constructed for them to do that - no Russell Westbrook needing the ball on Dallas / Atlanta / Portland. However Beal legitimately has a bunch of off-ball scoring in his game, which is part of the reason he's such a big deal in all these trade rumors - he pairs really well with another ball-dominant guy.  Beal is one of the best guys in the league at stuff like scoring off a give-and-go, so I could definitely see Deni feeding him some buckets once he gets comfortable with the actions.  Westbrook on the other hand..."
"I think Russell Westbrook is ridiculously good but also think it's fair to point out he had his bigs actively avoiding rebounds so he could get them including free ones off of missed free throws.  Not really anything wrong with it, they liked him getting the ball as soon as possible for obvious reasons, but most teams don't play that way.   Looks like he's averaging another one this season which is legit but I'm with Stan Van Gundy, it's an arbitrary cutoff and I will be much happier without them and a first round playoff series win which Russell couldn't achieve in OKC.   Perhaps because he needed more help? I don't follow okc, but the Suns finally put good players around Book and the results speak for themselves. I will be disappointed if they can't get out of the first round."
I will die on the Hill that James Harden should be AT LEAST a 2 time MVP and arguably a 3 time MVP.  Russell Westbrook won MVP for the novelty factor of averaging a Triple Double.  Westbrook got the Thunder to a 6 seed. But Harden took the Rockets to 55 wins and a 3 seed with the most used lineup including Beverly and Ryan Anderson.  He also had 11 games with over 40 points and 22 triple doubles which obviously wasnt Westbrook's amount but was still crazy high at the time

"Russell Westbrook will go down as an underrated player when its all said and done.  Sure he might be stat padding a bit, but if your favorite player could do that, then he would have done that.   Westbrook isn't the first guy to try to get triple doubles, there have been countless number of ""me"" guys in the leagues history. None of them achieved a Triple-Double for a season, forget 3, and possibly a 4th.   The fact that he can even pull this off is a feat, I hope he gets the record and averages a TB for the season again."
"If deni advija didn't had to be a spot up shooter for Russell Westbrook that want assist so bad, he would have better statistical season and wizard is likely be around 20 games win if Russell realize he's trash    Also fire the coach, ruining Rui and advija future by making them a spot up shooter for westbrick and Bradley ( can't be mad at Bradley even thought he's trash at defence, he need to be on the court, I mean half of the court )"

"Hmm I’m curious, I’m a big Russ fan, but does he make the top 10? Let’s see... I like:  Magic Johnson Steph Curry John Stockton Oscar Robertson Chris Paul Isiah Thomas   ... clearly above Russ, but that’s it tbh. After that it becomes preference and a bit of a grey area. At that point we get into the Steve Nash, Walt Frazier, Jason Kidd conversation, and I personally think Russ is equal/better than these guys. Kind of shocking to say, but upon my analysis, I would agree, Russell Westbrook is a top 10 all-time point guard.  Huh"
"You can’t in the same breathe call someone a chucker and say their averages are good. I’m not saying the guy is Steph curry, but he is asked to do a lot for the jazz on offense and as a result is not as efficient as he could be. He’s just not Russell Westbrook like everyone pretends."
Russell Westbrook gets more hate. Even from KD himself so.....it is what it is.
Fun Fact: Russell Westbrook currently ranks 301st in the league in win shares.
When Oscar Robertson got his last triple double he had 15 more triple doubles then Russell Westbrook has triple doubles after a triple double is what he achieved tonight when he got a triple double putting him 1 triple double away from being 6 triple doubles away from being 4 triple doubles away from being 3 triple doubles away from needing just one triple double away from as many triple doubles as Oscar Robertson had triple doubles when he got his last triple double putting him at 15 more triple doubles then Westbrook has triple doubles after tonight’s triple double.
Friendly reminder that Westbrook has the *only* “Perfect” Triple Double ever.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18981152/russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-first-triple-double-perfect-field-free-throw-line
Russell Westbrook stocks going up lately
"In the playoffs everybody not named Russell Westbrook fucks Dame up, people just like his loyalty to much to see it.  Dame has played in 11 playoff series in his career, 4 of those he shot under 40% from the field and twice he shot under 20% from 3. The argument that he gets double teamed is also so stupid it doesn't make any sense, James Harden and Steph get doubled in 99% of the possessions they play, they still don't shoot 18% from 3.  Portland fans on this sub love them some CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic until they have to defend Dame's struggles, then they hate them and say that Dame doesn't have enough help."
Basically what we need is another guy to come in and save this team. We need Russell Westbrook get Russell Westbrook on the phone. If we [somehow impossibly] landed a guy like that we could make a deep run

"I’m not a hockey-watcher so this is definitely ignorant, but I would think it would dilute the product yeah?

Plus has there ever been incidents where fighting has shortened the career of really talented players? My mind immediately goes to Rudy Tomjanovich as a Rockets fan and I sure as hell don’t want that happening to like, Embiid or Giannis or Russell Westbrook or somebody."

So you've literally never watched a single NBA game involving lebron, Harden, trez (dude is constantly yelling at refs and isn't even a star), pg13, cp3, durant, luka, gobert, kyrie, AD, Russell Westbrook, or like any other star player?   They all work the refs, constantly."
Russell Westbrook
"I agree, surely some guys are more athletic than others, I'll be crazy to define D'Angelo Russell, Justin Holiday or Bogdanovic as athletic for example, it's just that the word *athleticism* in general encompasses more than just speed and explosiveness. Just as very few players (if any) could match Jordan's first step or Rose's speed, I don't know how many can run around like Curry does all the time (while having his usage rate). I think we can all agree that long distance runners are athletic and you always hear people criticize Harden, Westbrook, LeBron or whoever, for standing around a lot to preserve energy, then why shouldn't we consider *athletic* players that maybe need less rest?  I think other aspects, like strength, could also be more discussed when talking athleticism, without even disturbing things like hand-eye coordination, deceleration or processing speed."
"No order:  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  John Wall   Russell Westbrook  Derrick Rose  Tony Parker  Kyrie Irving  Rajon Rondo  Kyle Lowry  Damian Lillard  Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas and Kemba Walker are very close"
"You're clearly beyond emotionally invested in this. Are you KD's Reddit burner account?  Why did you go straight to Caron Butler and just glance over Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka? Westbrook was hurt for part of the year, but still played in 65 games that year including the playoffs. Ibaka averaged 15/9 and was first-team All-Defense. They also had Caron Butler, Steven Adams, Kendrick Perkins, Thabo Sefalosha, Derek Fisher, and Nick Collison who are all 10+ year NBA players. That team wasn't the 2017 Warriors, but they weren't even close to those crappy Lakers teams."

"i was exaggerating, but his jump shot is really his only glaring problem, your comment pokes holes in mine rightfully but it doesn’t dismiss the point, Ben Simmons is an elite defender, elite playmaker, and an above average finisher, he’s 6”10 and in the action a lot so rebounding isn’t a problem, and in all honesty his form looks fine when he takes them. i’m not saying lacking the most common skill in the league isnt a bad thing but even everything you said wouldn’t be too bad of a criticism if he played Power Forward or Center. him starting at the 1 is the only reason he gets singled out for it   shit if Russell Westbrook was 6”10 he’d probably get a pass entirely because at least he could make them at one point"
"I mean Diego Costa looked massive playing for Chelsea but he's both shorter and lighter than Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook who aren't terribly big by NBA standards. They're all different types of athletes that excel at different things. From a raw explosive athleticism standpoint NFL players are the most athletic men on earth. Are sprinters faster? yes. Are Basketball/Volleyball players better leapers? yes. Are soccer players more balanced and agile? yes. The thing about them though is they're close seconds in every category and they're physically more powerful. They can get away with that because the play between breaks lasts on average no more than 6 seconds. You can't train to be as strong heavy or explosive short distance as football players in soccer, you won't have the endurance to play the whole match."

You mean the guy that outplayed Russell Westbrook one on one in the playoffs

"Was it a push-off?  Yes.  Will ANY NBA ref call that with 2.3 secs left on the clock?  NO.  In every game, they ""swallow the whistle"" every time at the buzzer.  On top of that the Wizards have Russell Westbrook that would have a 2000% chance of getting that call over Neto.  Not to mention that Russell Westbrook is 100 times better on defense.  This was a stupid coaching decision."

"Sticking with a serial killer and going with Carl Panzram. 6’0 200 but this man bent metal bars to escape from prison and then beat a guard to death with them. Just a freak athlete. Russell Westbrook play-style.   fun fact about him is that he robbed President Taft and took his gun, used the money to buy a boat, then he would trick sailors to coming aboard and shoot them with a former presidents gun all as revenge and Taft for sending him to prison"
When I think of athleticism in the NBA I think of explosiveness and agility. Russell Westbrook is about as explosive as you can get. Kyrie is about as agile as you can get. Any blend of the two and you have god tier athleticism.
"&gt;Uh, that isn't true because you say so. It wasn't controversial at the time. annnnnd I'm pretty sure I addressed it in the very first comment I wrote to you goofy. You're judging the award based on the semantics of how it looks to give it to a losing player. A losing player has won it before, and as you mentioned the original finals MVP went to somebody who lost the series. So what are you doing? Using a made up criteria for an award to discredit his case for the award.  Buddy.... That isn't what semantics means... I think you mean optics, lmao. Semantics does not work in that context. The criteria isn't made up. That's like saying seeding is a made up criteria because Russell Westbrook won mvp as the 6th seed. I'm not sure what else to tell you. I've repeated this multiple times now. The first and only ever instance of the loser winning fmvp was the first ever fmvp. You can clearly see that they regret the decision, since they never did it again. People who lost don't get fmvp. There is no precedence. The first try was an experiment of sorts.  &gt; You aren't judging the award based on anything that happened on the court besides the end result in the series, which was addressed before you ever brought it up. Losing doesn't disqualify a player from winning that award. In nowhere is there a criteria that says the winner of the award must come from the winning team. If that is all you have, you don't have anything at all.   Lmao. This is pathetic. We won't be talking anymore. Like I said, you have to win. Thats how its been for 60 years. ""In nowhere is there a critera"" r/nba at it's finest. Lakers flairs throwing out logic so Lebron looks better. And now I'm guessing you'll turn this into a ""Shut up lebron hater!"" thing.     &gt;I'm not sure how you read my first comment and decided to write a book on how Lebron didn't win the series. I'm well aware. He was still the best player in the series, as you yourself said, and easily the most valuable when using your own metric for determining it (take him off the team!)   &gt;   &gt;What do you want me to contest? That a finals MVP can come from a losing team? We both know they can. We both know they didn't add criteria to the award. Do you want me to say he won the series?   &gt;   &gt;You have nothing other than saying he lost the series. He was CLEARLY the best, and most valuable player. You agree with that so what are you arguing?   I'm not even arguing. I'm just stating things at this point. The finals mvp can't come from a losing team, we both know that. It's happened once, over half a century ago and it was the first ever fmvp. That hasn't happened since, and it won't happen unless something I can't reasonably predict happens. I can't believe how dumb your argument is. Lebron played better than Iggy, and losing doesn't disqualify the player according to you. So why didn't he win? It's such bad logic.   Again, not sure what you want. This discussion is meaningless. You won't listen to logic."
Howd you source this? I want to see Russell Westbrook on/off
So Russell Westbrook? He's a good anchor lolol
"The narrative about him deserving MIP is a joke too.  Nothing about what Jerami Grant is doing this season should be surprising or impressive to anyone that's watched him the last couple years.  He is a decent scorer who can give you above average defense.  He moved from a western conference finals team where he was an efficient 12ppg scorer to the second worst team in the league where he's soring 22ppg on 42% from the field.  He has the worst shooting numbers of anyone &gt;20ppg player outside of Russell Westbrook.  I don't call that improvement, I call that getting more shots."
"Unironically using 'advanced stats' to use their arguments, including older, more flawed ones like WS. Next you'll tell me he's in the GOAT argument because of his PER  VORP/BPM is better than WS &amp; PER but I take what BPM spits out with a grain of salt considering **Russell Westbrook at the time of his prime (2017) had the highest BPM in a season ever (15.6), blowing MJ and LeBron out of the fucking water due to his insane box score stats... similar to Jokic.** Since his overall BPM was insane it had an impact on his DBPM to the point where Westbrook was one of the best defenders ever, so the creators of BPM had to revise it because of how bad of an indicator that stat was. Jokic's defensive advanced stats overstate his defensive impact like a mfer (because he's a bad defender, no ifs ands or buts) and are thus why defensive advanced stats are especially dogshit  BPM rewards accumulative rebounds &amp; assists, so a player with 8 rebounds and assists is worth waaaay more than a player with 5 &amp; 5 even though those players could be not *that* far off. I remember reading that it especially rewards guards who snag disproportionate amounts of boards **but also big men who rack up a lot of assist numbers, so Jokic's assists are valued way more than Harden's assists even though Harden is just as good/arguably better as a playmaker**  Not to disparage Jokic, but I take advanced stats with a grain of salt when it comes to grading players, like most reasonable people do who watch basketball games who understand Jokic is not a Top 5 All time center."
"Alright when you’re a top 3 player in the world you go live in Oklahoma and play with Russell Westbrook. I would assume that’s not what most people would want to do. They can be upset for a while, that’s understandable, but get over it. The snake shit has gone on way too long."
Russell Westbrook is a wholesome redditor
LeBron got carried by Ray Allen and Allen deserved the 2013 FMVP  LeBron can average a 35 point triple-double but chooses not to   Giannis Antetokounmpo is a bust(This was said in 2019 after his loss to Miami) because he can’t cut it in the playoffs   Dame Lillard could have taken Curry’s place on the Warriors dynasty and they still would have won  Steve Nash was an average Point Guard but got hyped up because he’s white  The Worst: Russell Westbrook is autistic and struggles with social interaction
"Harden is head and shoulders above Westbrook as a scorer lol.  To answer your question, yeah, Russell Westbrook lol, he’s the outlier much like his MVP is a significant historical outlier.  A single accolade isn’t enough for me to put a dude with a career 52.8% TS averaging 23.2ppg in a list with all-time great scorers.  Unless your list includes hundreds of players, including those that never won scoring champion."
"The fact that Russell Westbrook, after only being on the team for like a month, had to be the one to tell the role players what their roles was, should tell you everything you need to know about Brooks as a coach."
Yeah I wouldn't compare DSJ's ability to get to the hoop and score to Russell Westbrook. Russell Westbrook is one of the greatest driving guards of all time. John Wall is one of the fastest most athletic PGs since AI
"I agree I thought he looked great in college. Goes to show the talent level difference between college and the pros. DSJ looked like Russell Westbrook Jr when he was driving to the rim in college but that doesn't work in the pros, unless you are Russell Westbrook. His shooting is not at the caliber of NBA starters and until he improves his shot, defenses will dare him to shoot and he'll brick."

"I'm just saying when I said ""big"" it basically means centers and does not include Giannis.  Obviously if the guy is basically a 6'11"" Russell Westbrook then sure you can take him at any spot."
I think Russell Westbrook (especially MVP Westbrook) is one of the rare cases where his scoring efficiency doesn’t really reflect his on-court impact. He was never once even a league average scorer but was always one of the best offensive players in the league. In his MVP season in particular he was a monster.   This is coming from a dude who absolutely detests his shot selection and how inefficient he is now.
"I am picking Westbrook for my team. Reasons:  1. I fucking love Russell Westbrook  2. I don’t like KD that much  3. Russ/Jrue/Khris/Giannis/Brook is scary af, we would legit average the most dunks in the league and we all know MVP Russ is clutch as hell. He would also light the fire inside Giannis and teach him how to land after crazy dunks to improve his longevity"
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
&gt; you people  who?  &gt; praised ... Russell Westbrook  lol
You don't think it's weird that you people praised Jeremi Grant and Russell Westbrook for having league average efficiency but it's terrible when Schroder does it?
Depends what the elite guard/big is. Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook? Dwight Howard or Nikola Jokic?
there were quite a few between 2009 and 2012 but I think Stephen Graham takes the cake. his foul at the end of [this game](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/stephen-graham-foul-dooms-nets-123-120-triple-overtime-loss-thunder-russell-westbrook-article-1.473823) still sticks with me as quite a low point.
"My guy Joel Embiid went from Russell Westbrook to Kevin Durant in terms of percentages, th doubt is warranted"
"Yeah, it is an old tweet - and my point is that even when it got press [back in 2016](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/10/30/old-tweets-kevin-durant-uses-gay-slurs-including-at-russell-westbrook-damian-lillard-rips-lebron-james/) thanks to r/nba's very own /u/jewishdoggy [posting it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2kq2z4/i_dug_deep_and_found_tweets_from_nba_players/), he still didn't delete it. Dude's thin skinned and emotionally immature."
"There hasn't been a whole lot of parity in the league like there was in the 70s. Instead you have teams that go to multiple finals, back to back championships, even three-peats. We've got dinasties and the greatest teams (and players) in nba history dominating.  Chuck, Karl Malone, John Stockton had to face Michael Fucking Jordan and the Bulls, a team that three-peated on two separate occasions.  AI ended up having to face the dominant Kobe-Shaq Lakers who'll end up three-peating. That decade, in the west, ended up being dominated by the Lakers and Spurs. Also why Steve Nash doesn't have a ring.  And then you have the Big Three Celtics, the Big Three Miami. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant weren't going to beat *that* Miami team.   And then the later half of the decade, you got a team that just broke the record for the best ever regular season record. And then the next year they add one of the greatest scorers ever to their roster. So it's not exactly crazy that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Damian Lillard weren't going to get to the finals having to go through them  And of course you've got LeBron going to the finals every year, Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan's biggest obstacle in the east.  The point is only one team gets the chip. Out of 30. And we've been seeing the same all-time great teams stopping so many MVP-caliber players from getting a ring.   The NBA community's gotten to a cancerous point where players aren't appreciated for their greatness. Instead all we wanna talk about is all time rankings, which is why the media and fans have put so much value on rings.   And then the media wanna complain why these superteams are formed? And then they're gonna talk about how great players like Brodie don't have a ring?? Like damn. Look at the competition they're facing."
"Players can be great without winning championships, but I'm quite reluctant to accept this line of reasoning for Russell Westbrook.   Allen Iverson was a 5'10 underdog who did all of the heavy lifting on middling rosters in Philadelphia, and Charles Barkley spent the peak of his career losing to Michael Jordan's Bulls before succumbing to unlucky injuries in Houston. The Stockton/Malone duo didn't benefit from a stellar supporting cast on the Utah Jazz, and the 1998 NBA lockout was merely insult to injury after the Game 6 loss to MJ's Bulls. (Karl Malone is a despicable human being off the court - would hold off from including him amongst ""the greatest"" of anything except sexual offenders.)  Russell Westbrook has been beset by injury, and he had the misfortune of playing versus LeBron/stacked Warriors rosters during his prime. Other than his time with Kevin Durant, Westbrook doesn't have a history of finals appearances or deep runs in playoffs despite having decent rosters.   Westbrook's stats look impressive because they are artificially inflated by his high usage rate and penchant for stealing rebounds from teammates. Triple-doubles are more commonplace in today's NBA than in prior eras - a fact worth noting when discussing this achievement. He has no difficulty with offensive production, but most people would critique his playmaking and 3-point shooting (especially given the sheer volume of attempted shots).   If you define ""greatest point guards"" as players who masterfully facilitated their team's offense, then I wouldn't place Westbrook on that list - in spite of his Hall of Fame-tier stats in certain categories."
"As time grows my admiration for Kyle and D wade grows. I’ll never forget after the Russell Westbrook incident with the racist fan out guys sat and had a conversation about this kind of stuff. And shortly after korver released his players tribune article about white privilege. And then a few years later after George Floyd Donovan wrote a wonderful piece on his experience with racial inequality. With the MLB news today about the all star game in Atlanta I saw a lot of people say “keep politics out of sports” again. And it makes me sad because I’ve personally learned a lot listening to these athletes talk about their experiences. I’d love to hear about Jeremy Lin, or rui hachimura experiences as Asian nba players since there’s been so few of them and they’d probably share a really unique perspective"
It’s kind of the Russell Westbrook tunnel vision disease. But I don’t consider either of them stupid players. They just... get too excited. I dunno. Smart can’t be that dumb basketball-wise since he could never be the defensive player he is.   I consider low BBIQ players to be guys who generally have no idea what’s going on on the floor in general. I don’t think that describes either Smart or Russ.
"Rings don't matter as much if you play a winning style of basketball. Russ doesn't. He overexerts himself at the cost of his team. He's the guy who sprints at the start of a marathon. Seriously, how did he not win a single playoff series with OKC post-KD? If he's this MVP-level player, how did he not at least get one in three years?  I don't think you can win a championship with Russell Westbrook as your best player. He has refused to alter his game to be more conducive to winning, whereas guys like Nash and Baylor and Barkley did."
Russell Westbrook would be a better coach than both of them
It's a joke about James Harden (and Russell Westbrook) being ballhogs.
Russell Westbrook and OKC.
"Yes and no. The rockets got Harden Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. The Pelicans didn’t seem like they were willing to spend. I mean they don’t even have their own medical staff"
"Yeah. You'll probably run into some issues with how you create your ""uncovered baseline"", because most players don't have enough shots everywhere to create a good baseline for them, which means that you probably need to rely on a league average in some way, which would mean that it's as bad for the defense to not defend a Ben Simmons or Russell Westbrook 3 as not defending a Steph Curry 3."
"Multiple articles state that CP3 was traded due to tension between the two players.  &gt; per Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill, who relayed the following quote from a league source: ""James made this [expletive] happen. He wanted Chris up out of there.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845241-report-james-harden-was-behind-rockets-trading-chris-paul-to-thunder  &gt; the Houston Rockets decided to trade Chris Paul to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for a package that included Russell Westbrook, in part due to behind-the-scenes issues between Paul and Rockets superstar James Harden.  https://hoopshype.com/2020/12/03/chris-paul-rockets-return-on-investment-rumors-trade/"
"Draymond, demarcus cousins &amp; Russell Westbrook"
"Bro, Harden played with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Westbrook again. CP3 got hurt at a bad time but come the fuck on. Stop pretending like he's never had quality teammates. His style of play just doesn't work in the playoffs. Selfish basketball doesn't win playoffs."
"I mean, CP3 is still pretty much killing it, he was All-NBA 2nd team last year.  And Harden got to play with his best buddy Russell Westbrook, former MVP, that he pushed the Rockets to trade for because he didn't like that CP3 wanted him to do literally anything but stand around at half-court on possessions where Harden didn't have the ball.  harden also had Dwight Howard, MVP runner up and All-NBA 2nd team player while he was in Houston.  Let's stop with this nonsense trope that Harden has never had quality teammates, he's had tons of help and has run all of them out of town.  Also D-Wade was young &amp; not nearly at his peak when the Heat won in 2006, Shaq was a legit MVP candidate that year."

"&gt; Have you ever been to either city?  yep, I've traveled frequently to both and I actually hate Houston and love nyc.   I agree Houston is no match in terms of opportunity and significance, which a lot of commenters have mentioned.  However, the context here is different because Harden is a bonafide star and has been the face of a competitive franchise for more than half a decade. Do you think Adidas is gonna pay him more now that he is with the Nets? At this point the difference in sponsorship is marginal because he already has celebrity status.   Russell Westbrook is top 5 in endorsements and he was leading a team in fucking Oklahoma."
Kobe Bryant 0 games played. Eli Manning 0 games played.  Other successful trade demands: Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Paul George  Kyrie Irving  You can go to whichever team you want after your rookie deal.

"Actually it was just lack of accountability. https://www.thedreamshake.com/2020/11/13/21562905/russell-westbrook-wants-out-of-houston-rockets-but-the-two-parties-could-be-stuck#:~:text=According%20to%20reports%2C%20Westbrook%20no,Energy%20Arena%20in%20Oklahoma%20City."
"He kinda did lmao.   &gt;	As a result of the 2019 Chris Paul–for–Russell Westbrook swap, the Thunder own the right to swap either their first-round pick or the Heat’s first pick (which they also own) in the 2021 draft for Houston’s, as long as the Rockets’ pick doesn’t land in the top four.  So the value of that swap just increased"
"They'll be on TV, seen from the bench. A rookie who doesn't play is not going to get huge endorsement money.  Very few rookies are good enough to make the rotation of a contending team, and if they are, they are good enough to get a huge contract somewhere else AND endorsement money regardless of where they end up. Kyrie and LeBron had plenty of endorsements in Cleveland.  Do you know who the top 10 endorsement earners in the NBA are?  LeBron, Curry, Durant, Giannis, Westbrook, Zion, Harden, Irving, Lillard, Thompson.  &gt; The attraction of large media markets for free agents is a common point made by talking heads in sports media, as large markets presumably open doors for athletes to earn more endorsement opportunities.  &gt; However, three of the NBA’s top 10 endorsement earners — Giannis Antetokounmpo, Zion Williamson, and Damian Lillard — all currently play in small-to-medium NBA markets. Additionally, Russell Westbrook had spent his career in Oklahoma City, the NBA’s smallest market, prior to joining the Houston Rockets this season.   &gt; While massive media markets may offer an advantage for off-court earning potential, this list shows that on-court success and personal brand building impact player endorsement value far more than the size of their market alone.   https://opendorse.com/blog/nba-top-10-endorsement-earners/  Zion would've got a near max equivalent and huge endorsements no matter where he went, he is not signing a minimum to ring chase as a 20 year old.  The idea that players go to New York or LA and immediately get big endorsements is based on pre-internet logic where you could only watch players on local tv. Knicks are the biggest market and have no players on that list. The only NY/LA players there were already superstars before joining. Giannis is doing just fine."
That is the dumbest thing said today.  Could r/nba just accept the reality that Russell Westbrook is not a GOOD basketball player?
Dwight Howard was the problem  Clint capella was the problem Chris Paul was the problem  Russell Westbrook was the problem  The whole team is the problem so they reformatted and PJ fucking tucker was the center...PJ tucker?? He was always the problem
"I mean an impressive stat is Russell Westbrook was the only player since no one to have 300 pts, 90 reb, and 100 assists in the first 10 games of the season.  He scored 14 points in the 7th game, so that’s why..."
I think I would rather have a 10 percent chance that Kyrie screws his head on straight than Russell Westbrook.
Add Russell Westbrook too and they're still not winning a championship. It's not  about compiling talent it's about coordination.
"The Houston Rockets turned James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Covington into Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Christian Wood 7 first round picks and 4 pick swaps"
*sad Russell Westbrook noises*
AD and Boogie didn't have Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook either.
"Next up, Kyrie to Washington for a first round draft pick and Russell Westbrook."
"How do you mean completely reactionary?  Everyone knew when they signed the Chris Paul and Dwight Howard contracts that they were going for high risk high reward win now moves that required spending large amounts of money.  Those were proactive attempts to bolster the roster around James Harden, and in no way reactions.  If anything, they reacted quickly by trying to retool to actually take advantage of James Harden's prime.  They sign a contract for Dwight Howard to get a great player for James Harden to play with.  BUT, James Harden can't play with him. So they ship him out.  BUT, James Harden wants to win now. So they sign a massive contract with aging and injury prone Chris Paul to win now cause he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, James can't win with Chris Paul his first year. So they try to retool the team. They get the hottest 3-D guy on the market in RoCo and hope for a runback.  BUT, james can't win with Chris again and starts to dislike him. So the team ships him out and further leverages their future for Russell Westbrook because he is James Harden's friend and James wants to win.  BUT, this style doesn't work very well. So they retool the team. They ship out capela and go true small ball.  BUT, they still don't win. James gets grumpy and wants his new friend shipped out again.  And, now, the rockets have a very grim future and James Harden blames the Rockets.  And its not like they havent had competent players on their team throughout James Harden's tenure. PJ Tucker has been a shining example of an amazing contract in the league and Eric Gordon outside this past year was a fantastic second/third option.  They had their chances and blew it. Whether that was bad performances, bad luck, bad timing or a mixture of all three is beyond me, but I don't think its fair to say the Rockets weren't trying and spending for it too.  Rockets fans like to point to not resigning Trevor Ariza after the 17/18 season as an example of the poor management of the Rockets and their refusal to pay up.  But I just don't think Trevor Ariza is the difference maker between a winning team and a losing team.  I think the rockets could have spent more. But I dont think its fair to say they needed to.  In 2018-19, the Raptors spent $11 million more than the Rockets and won the NBA championship.  In 2019-20, the Lakers spent $13 million less than the rockets and won the NBA championship."
They just need to acquire Russell Westbrook to bring the whole gang back together again.
"&gt;literally lebron, shaq, and durant are the only players of their caliber to team hop. Bird, Jordan, Magic, Russell, Kobe all stayed on their team.   okay and who does Harden see around him in the league? not bird, jordan or magic lmao. why is the old league relevant to him when he sees the current champs all teamed up? plus let's actually count the superstars around his age that has teamed up - lebron, AD, durant, curry, kyrie, kawhi, PG, westbrook... literally outside of Dame, which of top guys around Harden's age and skill level stayed loyal to their team? only the younger ones have **so far** like Giannis, Luka, etc, but we'll see what happens in a few years.  fact of the matter is, he and we all know if you put him together with someone similarly skilled, he'd win championships. so what's wrong with wanting the same opportunity other players had? if i was top 3 in the league i wouldn't want to carry bums either. it's a waste of my talents.   &gt;some go down swinging and remain loyal  loyalty doesn't mean shit when the teams only care about what's best for them. what do you think would happen if harden remained loyal, played his hardest for the rockets, did everything the franchise and the fans want him to do... and the lakers offers lebron + AD for him in a trade? they'd still fucking trade him in a heartbeat. so what's wrong with a player wanting what's best for him then?"
"Let's not act like Houston didn't try to give Harden everything, as well.     Houston's front office tried giving this man **everything.**     Dwight Howard   Mike D'Antoni   Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   etc.  Swishout goes into detail about this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ffUJy1sJxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ffUJy1sJxY)"
We will take one Lonzo and one Steven Adams for Russell Westbrook.
"Yeah, the writing was on the wall when dantoni and morey left. Ironically, didn't that have something to do with james harden demanding the rockets trade for russell westbrook?"
"True, but how often has Harden decided, ""this isn't a good team"" and pulled stuff?  I'm sure Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and John Wall all feel like Harden gave it his full effort. /s"
"Depends on position and skill set.  A point guard that thrives on athleticism like John Wall, Russell Westbrook, or D'Aaron Fox will decline quicker.  Then you have players like Shaun Livingston, Grant Hill, George Hill, Vince Carter, and Kobe Bryant who increases their longevity in the league by focusing on strengthening skills that can help them succeed despite declining athleticism. Fancy footwork, positioning, expanding shooting range, etc."
"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5AjNBpRKkmne2GNQIGupAC  &gt; ""James Harden got to dictate the Russell Westbrook trade last summer. Tillman liked it too at the time, don't get me wrong, but that trade was-James Harden was the driving force behind that trade""   Idk maybe I'm naive but I always felt like it was more he doesn't want to be in luxury for a minor increase, he wanted a significant improvement type player. But its hard for me to separate what was Morey's good moves and what was forced moves that Morey salvaged. To me, they always felt aggressive in improving their team and looking for replacements."
"No thanks, not even sure that works with the numbers but keep Russell Westbrook as far away from Jokic as possible."
"He doesn't gamble for steals and blocks enough, should watch film of an extremely high IQ defensive player like Russell Westbrook"
"Russell Westbrook Does Everything Fast, For Better or For Worse.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-does-everything-fast-for-better-and-for-worse/"
Would be cool if they trade him for russell westbrook.  Then trade for James Harden
Based on the stat lines below which player had the better performance in a random playoff game?  A: 45/15/7  B: 45/15/5   One is Russell Westbrook vs Utah and the other is LeBron James in what is regarded as maybe *the* best playoff game ever (game 6 vs Boston).   Don’t let PTS/RBS/AST influence you people.
Ok Russell Westbrook
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"Russell Westbrook is far from being the guy who plays the hardest in the NBA, maybe he was 5/6 years ago when he was erratic, gambled too much but mostly tried on defense. But in recent years he's either been really inconsistent in his effort defensively (2018, 2019) or frankly doesn't even try (2020, 2017)"
"&gt; Russell Westbrook is portrayed as an arrogant egotistical Selfish player on the court and a sulky, rude, and brazen personality by the media. This is far from the truth.  *proceeds to make a post that has nothing to do with how he acts on the court*"
"&gt;Westbrook isn't very good at basketball anymore.  He's averaging a 20 point triple double in the NBA (admittedly on awful percentages, but that will most likely progress back to normal). Clearly, he's not as good as he used to be, but Russell is still a top 40 player in the world who's had a bad start to his season. He was All-NBA just last season.   I'm just saying, ""he's not very good at basketball"" is a term that should be reserved for Stanley Johnson, not a dude averaging a triple fucking double."
"Ezekiel Elliot, Russell Westbrook, etc.   And those issues even minor look huge for professional athletes"
Love Russell Westbrook.
"I don't think so. A 10 second google has a BR report. That's without digging. I remember clearly because I was sad about it, but accepted it as being fair enough.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2845296-russell-westbrook-reportedly-talked-thunder-trade-after-2019-playoff-loss"
"I get what you’re attempting to do here, and I commend it. There’s nothing wrong with someone sticking up for a guy they love watching and believe is unfairly criticized. But this is how the world works, it’s not always fair. I can’t tell you why I like Steph more than Westbrook. I can’t tell you why I like Russell Wilson better than Aaron Rodgers. I just do. Those guys have great personalities and get the benefit of the doubt more often than not. Guys like Westbrook and Rodgers just rub people the wrong way, he might be a way better dude than Curry or any of the other guys highly praised but he’s just not that like able to me. And that’s okay, who gives a shit what me or any of the other people on this sub think? He’s going to the HoF as soon as he’s eligible and will be mentioned countless times throughout history when discussing the NBA. I’m sure he doesn’t give a shit what we think anyways."

"I think Neto is a very capable back up guard. But yeah, worst take of the year potential here. And there have been some as bad as Russell Westbrook....wait"
"Russell Westbrook looks and plays taller than his listed 6'3"".  LeBron being listed at 6'9"" *after* they recalibrated player heights is interesting."
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
Did you just say Raul Neto is better than Russell Westbrook
"Man what the fuck is this question lol  Russell Westbrook is a starting PG on pretty much every team in the league, stop thinking the way that you do"
Not top 25 and after that who gives a shit.  Active point guards that are better  - Chris Paul - Kyle Lowry - Russell Westbrook - Damian Lillard - Mike Conley (iffy) - Steph Curry - D-Rose  At least that wouldn’t surprise me If I’m missing some
"According to [Basketball-Reference HOF probability](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html), Kevin Love has a higher chance of making it right now.  Grant Hill had an amazing college career with 2 championships on top of his great NBA career, where people debated if he would have been better than MJ without his ankle injuries.  Yao Ming is in the Hall more for his cultural and international impact than his NBA career.  Tracy McGrady was one the best scorers the league has ever seen and was debated as the best SG with Kobe for most of a decade.  The defining guards of this generation, the 2010s decade, are:  Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Damian Lillard.  Kyrie gets an honorable mention, but he's closer to a DeRozan than he is to that list."
"Kyrie is a significantly more important and better player than Kevin love though lol. Like its not just the accomplishments its the overall impact on the actual game. That's why guys like Grant Hill, Yao Ming and Tracy Mcgrady are in. They are apart of the very fabric of the game and quintessential parts of their generation of basketball. Kyrie is very much that. Him, Steph, CP3 and Russell Westbrook all are defining guards of this generation. He 100000 percent makes the hall of fame. For you guys to argue against that is so fucking lame and I am not even a Kyrie fan at all. Reddit hivemind bullshit at its very best."
"Russell Westbrook will miss a week with left quad injury, Wizards say."
"James Harden is the better player. But I’ll actually go with Russell Westbrook on this one. Only Oscar Robinson had averaged a triple double in history before Westbrook came along, and then he did it 3 times. Now, that’s historic."
"&gt; he makes a living off of running into defenders, standing around ball watching when he gives up the ball, and playing absolutely no defense at all.  Russell Westbrook does 2 of these, and borders on the third"
"No goal posts moved...Trae will never win MVP or ever be considered a generational talent like Luka because he's one dimensional and clearly the NBA agrees (third team all NBA last year while Luka was first and 4th in MVP votes..gonna always remind you cause you're bias is showing and its funny)  Elite scoring, passing, middle of the road defense and elite rebounding is better than being a one dimensional scorer.  Luka averaged 9.3 rebounds per game last season. That was 18th in the NBA. His 8.0 defensive rebounds a night ranked tenth. Doncic, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook are the only three players classified as guards by Basketball-Reference that finished inside the top 25.  Luka also averaged 1.1 steals per game for the second straight season.The advanced metrics are favorable too. Doncic was 44th in NBA in defensive win shares at 2.3. Defensive box score plus-minus had him 41st.  He's a far better defender, far better player and arguing without any stats is just silly.  At least Hawks fans will get a ton of high scoring games. Sucks they won't get to see the playoffs any...but hey, thats what happens with almost every atlanta team...right?"
Russell Westbrook chilling with the only player to have 300 pts 100 assists and 90 rebounds in the first 10 games.
"It makes sense for Talen Horton Tucker.   Abbreviating to THT makes more sense than those examples.   Shake Milton abbreviated to SM isn't the same.  And Russell Westbrook abbreviated isn't either.  Announcers say ""THT"" all of the time, so do talking heads, journalists and everyone in the basketball world that's talking about him, whereas no one calls Russell Westbrook RW when announcing him, or writing about him. ""Yet here we are"" to two totally different things.   If a player is referred to by an abbreviation all of the time, that's what he's known by. Just look it up. Other than that I do agree if someone is abbreviating dudes like Russ, etc. That never makes sense."
"Westbrook has the 2nd highest salary in the league.  He was traded for #3 then #4.  It's only natural that he'd be traded for #5 next.    * Stephen Curry $43,006,362					 * **Russell Westbrook $41,358,814** * **Chris Paul $41,358,814** * **John Wall $41,254,920** * James Harden $40,824,000	 * LeBron James $39,219,565	 * Kevin Durant $39,058,950	  ^^/s"
Russell westbrook might be the worst. He looks markedly different from even last year.  Does anyone know how to fix his shot?
"Wiggins and Harris have both shown marked improvement, so neither of them are the biggest albatrosses of the NBA.  That honor might go to Russell Westbrook or Al Horford."
"This list just tells me that Russell Westbrook very frequently gets teams to within 5 points more than other players, and takes shots in these crucial moments way more than any other players.  As usual with Russel Westbrook stats, this just seems like another case of quantity over quality."
Because he was 2nd up lol. How would you feel if I just gave you the stat Russell Westbrook takes 10 threes a game. What are you supposed to do with that. I was just providing Lebron so people could properly gauge Russ’s stat. I wasn’t speaking about Lebron doing anything... it was for context...
I see he’s using the Russell Westbrook method of “it’s ok if my team is terrible as long as I do what I can to get a triple double”.

Russell westbrook?
"Okay, Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, and KAT aren't all stars either then"
In 18 years in the league Jason Kidd averaged over 15ppg in 5 seasons total despite being a consistently high caliber player. In those 5 seasons he never averaged more than 18. He was a great player and had a lot of triple doubles (#4 all time with 107) but they weren't gonna be 30+ ppg Russell Westbrook (#2 all time with 146 triple doubles) performances.
"2015, he has pat Bev, Trevor Ariza and Capela  2018-19, he had Carmelo Anthony and Clint Capela  19-20 he had Russell Westbrook"
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, and Kyrie Irving. Doesn't support your point."
"&gt;The 17 playoffs aren’t why harden deserved the award  I wonder why you even  brought it up, if that's the case. Also, why you're not addressing any of the counterarguments I made.   &gt;TS% isn’t an end all be all stat but when you compare a guy who averaged 29/8/11 on 61% TS with the third seed and a guy who averaged 31/10/10 on 55% TS on the 6th seed you can clearly choose the better player  If you're judging MVP by who has traditionally won the award then, yes, I agree that Harden should have won. The thing is that that's never been how the MVP award has worked. It's coorelation does not equal causation. The MVP award has mostly happened to be won by players who put up great stats on highly seeded teams, but this has never been a requirement. In an unusual year where a guy is making history by doing something that hasn't been done in long ass time, while also pulling win-after-win out of his ass with clutch performances, along with having a non-ideak supporting cast, it's not ridiculous that Russell Westbrook won that award. For the record, I think Harden deserved the 14-15 award.."

"You gave a strawman argument. OP said, ""aka he can't carry a team to the playoffs like LeBron, Westbrook, Harden."" What does that mean to you? To me, it's pretty clear he's equating what Kerr said as to the reason Steph would be unable to carry like any of the aforementioned players. OP wasn't arguing that carrying was a viable way to get titles.   Like I said before, comparing Dray and Roberson because of their defensive prowess is a surface-level observation. I'm aware that they were both on an all-defense team, you don't need to point that out. I was aware of that when I made my previous assertion that Russell Westbrook in 2017 had an inferior cast to this Warriors team.   If that OKC team warranted being called an ""elite defense"" then so does this warriors team. It has a former DPOY, Oubre (who's not a 1v1 guy, but an athletic slasher and shooter) and Wiggins who provides length and athleticism. Compare that to OKC who had Roberson, an elite perimeter defender all-defense second team; pre-breakout Oladipo, who was a solid defender in his own right; Grant who provided athleticism and length."
Winning is not needed if you're Russell Westbrook.  He has triple doubles and as long as it looks good on highlights it can sell jerseys.
Ah the Russell Westbrook trademark
Because he’s Russell Westbrook lmao   Love and hate him at the same time

""The theme isn't that he's pushing them out every time, its that there is a chemistry issue every time.""    I'm saying that in that case specifically, Harden didn't push him out. However, they don't want to play together anymore. Which leads right back to my ORIGINAL POINT.. Harden asks for his childhood friend to come to Houston, and the rockets grant his request.  \-  [https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/basketball-news/russell-westbrook-and-james-harden-dont-want-to-play-together-rockets-in-crisis.html](https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/basketball-news/russell-westbrook-and-james-harden-dont-want-to-play-together-rockets-in-crisis.html)   "" he realizes that playing with them means he doesn't get the ball as much """
"Thats definitely part of it..   But i'm just going to piggyback off of my other comment. The theme isn't that he's pushing them out every time (that was 2 of 3 lol), its that there is a chemistry issue every time, (either on or off the court) when he's the one HAND PICKING guys to play with.  Here's another. I'm sure you remember this exchange: [https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/11/12/russell-westbrook-wanted-more-accountability-from-harden-rockets/](https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/11/12/russell-westbrook-wanted-more-accountability-from-harden-rockets/)  And we don't even have to go into Harden's cancelling practice to go on Strip Club ventures when he had multi-day breaks between games."
I just read the weatbrook one because that’s what I’m talking about. That article had only one actual thing tied to westbrook and the rest was “anonymous staffers”. And that one thing was being late to film room... one time. Not much evidence there of Harden pushing westbrook out or vice versa tbh  &gt; I wonder who created that casual culture that caused Westbrook to leave.  do I get to post receipts to? because this https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30296437/sources-james-harden-russell-westbrook-concerned-direction-houston-rockets seems to tell a different story about what actually caused him to leave

See the common theme here? There's always a lack of chemistry or disagreement. On the court or off... And Harden always gets his way.  The ""1 year"" portion was not literal.. but to make a point.  Lmk if you want more receipts"
Bradley Beal missed the playoffs in the East last year. Then they added Russell Westbrook and are an astonishing 2-6 so far this year. Steph is a 2-time MVP and was the best player on the winningest team in NBA history. Is it really a surprise that his 62 points in a W get more coverage than Bradley's 60 points (3 in the 4th) in an L?
So you want Russell Westbrook to win his second MVP.

"Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook are ahead of him in my book as far as deserving and honestly there’s probably more that i’m not thinking of or am on the fence about. Beal is a stud though and he deserves more success"
Russell Westbrook is a bad defender
[Westbrook](https://www.gettyimages.dk/detail/news-photo/russell-westbrook-of-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-signs-news-photo/1075164100) is also the same way. Maybe he just doesn’t want to tomahawk his poor pencil tip.
This guy literally lives on Reddit all day long commenting about Russell Westbrook
"Thank you for the Sixers Player of the Game, Russell Westbrook for icing Beal."
"“Russell Westbrook needs to go look in the mirror to see what the problem is, just like I did when my wife divorced me.”"
There pretty much is one. Best player on a top 2 seed. Russell Westbrook was the exception to this because he broke a 50 year record that no one thought would happen again.
He's not. It's basically Russell Westbrook 2.0 but who can actually make a 3pt shot if you sag off too much.
"As noted in the article, no other player on the team can score. Over the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons, Russell Westbrook is Beal’s only teammate to average more than 15 PPG. And that comes at an effective field goal percentage of just 41.1%."
"It's not mutually exclusive. The Wizards are trash, the coaching is terrible, and Russell Westbrook has been *awful* for most of this season despite some pretty counting stats here and there. He was *not* a good pickup for this team in any way."
"The organization is willing to compete at a higher level. They fell for the Russell Westbrook thing, and are paying the price.  They should blow it up. Trade him and let Russ command the tank as he is meant to."
2021: The Russell Westbrook Trashtalk Tour

"Russell Westbrook should be the teams social media manager, don't let him touch the hardwood. You are right sir."
Here's a table of the seasons I'm sampling. Let me know if you can observe any specific anomalies from it.        |Year|Player|Wins|Conference rank|League Rank| :--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|63|1st|1st| |2018-19|Giannis Antetokounmpo|60|1st|1st| |2017-18|James Harden|65|1st|1st| |2016-17|Russell Westbrook|47|6th|10th| |2015-16|Stephen Curry|73|1st|1st| |2014-15|Stephen Curry|67|1st|1st|
&gt;Trade for Russell Westbrook  Let me stop you right there.
"I don't think it's too flawed. I think fans have historically put too much weight into the All-Star game when discussing careers, which has caused athletes to care about it like Conley does.  In reality, it's meant to be a rest weekend for 90% of the league while a select few get brand exposure and help get more eyes on basketball.  Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul are just more exciting All-Star game players than Mike Conley would ever be. They draw in more eyes with their name value, too. So when one of them missed like 15 games in a 50-game stretch, people would complain ""he's missed X% of the season! Conley's Grizzlies are the 5 seed and the Clippers are the 6 seed right now!"", it was actually they who missed the point of the game."
"Since I followed the NBA in the 2001-02 season, none of them.  Let's take a list in order: Tim Duncan 2 straight years, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash 2 straight years, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James 2 straight years, Derrick Rose, Lebron James 2 straight years, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry 2 straight years, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis Antetokuompo 2 straight years.  Not one time did I feel anyone else should have been MVP over them."
"So who's equivalent to Russell w Westbrook???  I never said hes a 1 man team, but if you tell me that Westbrook was equal to Middleton then you are lieing to yourself.  And even so, you just proved my point again.  Since you say they are similar, tell me how many Championships OKC and Milwaukee won recently?   You saying you're done just even further proves me right"
What's the differences between Oscar Robertson &amp; Russell Westbrook? Except winning a championship beside Kareem?
"As I am watching GSW - PS game right now.  Worst players of the year so far ?   1) Kelly Oubre JR. - man watching this guy killing me this season.   Thanks to Korean national tv everytime they show GSW game.   Also for me ,  2) Russell Westbrook  3) Melo"
Russell Westbrook
"* Blake Griffin: 2 years, $75.6M * Russell Westbrook: 3 years, $132.9M * John Wall: 3 years, $132.6M * Kevin Love: 3 years, $91.5M  I'd rather have Blake's contract than Westbrook, Wall, or Love. None of them are helping you win but at least Blake comes off the books 1 year earlier. If you're bad, you might as well be bad and get a good draft pick.  Also, I really really hope not, but Klay Thompson's 5 year, $190M definitely has the potential to be the worst contract in the league..."
"PER is bad because it rewards attempts, regardless of whether or not they were efficient. It's why Russell Westbrook was considered a top tier player above like a Kawhi or a LeBron for several years. If you just shoot a lot, you will have historically high PER."
1. I haven’t heard Beal say one thing on the level of what James Harden has said about the rockets  2. we all know signing a long term deal in the nba doesn’t mean anything in terms of staying with that team   3. imagine you’re busting your heart to win and no one around you can carry your jock. Meanwhile you have delusional Russell Westbrook next to you who thinks and plays like he’s a top 5 player. Is the guy not allowed to be frustrated?   4. He could have signed the max not only For the money but to actually build something in Washington. They could’ve sold him on their vision and Washington was frisky with him and John wall for a couple seasons there.
"Tbf this is true and thats why you also need the memories of the old generation to complete the analysis of a player. From what ive read, almost every older generation viewers were writing that Wilt was the best basketball player ever, with most of this writing coming in the 90s when the jordan wilt discussion was as its peak. Most of the players in the wilt era were shitting on him though, thats also why he ""only"" got 4 mvps when he could have way more than that and at this point a player like Big O or Jerry with better handles were considered better in an era where dribbling was inexistent. The thing that these players couldn't recognize is that the best player of their era was just stronger and jumping higher than all of them.  His passing is underrated in one aspect : he was one of the first primary passer/playmaking center in the nba and his coach knew he was a good enough passer to do that. We most likely will never know how good he was really cz their is a severe lack of footage but we can speculate that he was at least a good passer. I don't think he is nearly as good as jokic or even Sabonis. Even CWebb though he isn't a center.  The Pace and Usage% criticism is fair and unfair at the same time. During his 50 ppg season, yes he most likely could have pass some of his shots, though he was still crazy efficient. But during his 76erd/Lakers years thats where i don't understand the criticism. At this point in his career, he was slower, shot less, passed more and he was playing ""winning basketball"". I would say this term is also false cz he had to face peak Celtics before but lets just say it didn't matter. When he was actually winning with the 76ers and Lakers, he was still putting some insane numbers that even the best passers and scorers in the league were struggling to get. Wilt (and russell) rebounding were also very underrated, as other all time greats centers (Bellamy, Thurmond, Lucas) couldn't put that much rebounds too.  When wilt led the league in assist, the most impressive isn't the number, it is the fact that he lead the league in the first place. Because we can't put footage with those numbers, we can only speculate he was one of the best passer in his era, and as a center, would certainly make him on eof the best passing center ever.  Ps : Not necessary only responding to you but im lazy and don't want to separate this comment into multiple reply. In 20 years im sure there will be some dumbass that will push the narrative that Westbrook was better than curry, though we most likely still have footage."
"Russ doesn't care about winning at this point. All he wants are his triple doubles, so 20 years from now, kids can be like omg look at how many triple doubles this russell westbrook guy has"
"Can’t pin these losses on Beal. Of course his numbers are going to be inflated if you’re missing Rui Hachimura, Troy Brown Jr, Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Russell Westbrook and Ish Smith"
"I mean, he has been playing well for a few years now but it hasn't translated to wins. Trading for what looks like 50% of Russell Westbrook didn't solve the problem.   Not really sure how they are filling out their roster. Were they expecting more out of hachimara?  Beals stats are fantastic, but maybe he needs to try to get someone else going? Not that the roster isnt trash, but who knows? Maybe they have a sabonis or oladipo hiding on the bench somewhere?"
russell westbrook fucking sucks
"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Isn't this the same player who got everything he wanted in Houston, mortgaged their future for Russell Westbrook, then woke up one day and decided he wanted out? And by ""wanting out,"" I mean that he demanded a trade to one specific championship contender, while ditching practice to go to strip clubs in the middle of a pandemic.  The hive mind on Reddit has the memory of a goldfish."
"""As Bradley Beal stands with his former teammate, in John Wall, against the hellish fiend that forcefully tore them apart, Russell Westbrook. It was clear Beal despised his new teammate."""
"If we're including salary, then no one. I would not want Russell Westbrook on my team at all."
"Why does Beal not get a pass but other NBA stars do?  Anthony Davis, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, etc.  All these guys demanded trades out of their organization.  It's quite obvious the Wizards have done little to put their team in a position to contend.  I mean John Wall comes back and they make a pretty lateral move to trade him for Russ.  If I was Beal, I'd be upset with the organization, and the Wizards should absolutely trade him before they lose him for nothing."
Former MVP Russell Westbrook is shooting 44.4% TS FOR THE SEASON.  So I'd say that is worse. At least Beal has a strong 3 first quarters.
That may have been true at one point but it’s gone now. [Shot about league average in 2020.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-shot-chart-2020)
"Russell Westbrook  That's right, he's overrated because people acknowledge that he's bad and yet that's still an understatement because he's been *horrific*, like legit one of the worst players in the league-level bad."
"Carrying a team gets you MVP votes but that doesn’t mean that you’re a better player than another guy. Russell Westbrook is not better than Stephen Curry even though he can carry an average team farther than Steph. Giannis is just too limited man. Forget the numbers, they can’t win big games because Giannis can’t do anything in the final minutes of a game. I want AD over Giannis because AD can do everything on the court, Giannis can’t. Giannis has lost his confidence too man. He’s just not what he should be right now."
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
"I mean you sign a deal with John wall as your point guard, he goes down and is eventually traded for a Russell Westbrook, who isn’t bad, but does need to play hero ball and every opportunity, a Front office who doesn’t make bad or good signings &amp; has average drafts.... Yeah free Beal"
"This thread is about Russell Westbrook, not Blake Griffin."
Russell Westbrook. ^^^Please ^^^take ^^^Russell ^^^Westbrook ^^^off ^^^our ^^^hands
"Why would he stay at all? Dude scores like 35 a game and his team gets blown out still. They barely compete every game. Westbrook looks ok on the stat sheet until you look deeper...he's only shooting 40% if you round up. That's brutal for a guy who goes to the rim as much as he does, and his PPG are way down on top of it. So it's Beal, a hollow shell of Russell Westbrook, and a bunch of guys that are more useful as trade pieces than they are as building blocks for the future, going out and not competing every night.   Beal as a player himself has improved tremendously over the past year or two, he'd be beyond stupid to stay with a team that's a sinking ship with no end in sight, at age 27. It's just gonna be interesting to see where he ends up, somebody is gonna get a very motivated elite player when he does move."

Who was the first player to average a triple double for a season since Russell Westbrook in 2016
But Russell Westbrook averages triple doubles.
KAT - all star  D'Lo - all star  Edwards - 1st overall pick  Beasley - fucked Scottie Pippen's wife  Rubio - father of Russell Westbrook  How is this team so trash lmao
He’s the goat mascot. Him and the nuggets mascot that did the karate move to Russell Westbrook
"Trae, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Bam, Sabionis, Randle, Kyrie People, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, Vucevic, Lowry, Spicy P, Ben Simmons. Would Seth be better than any of these guys?"
"I remember in his mvp season, a team used it in Russell Westbrook"
"Russell Westbrook.  Triple doubles are his bread and butter, and if he's also getting a lot of steals you know he'll go for ten.  My runner up would be Giannis based on blocks and steals.  Heck, he could have a quintuple double one day.  But he's not as stat conscious as Westbrook and is liable to rest just short of the quadruple double."
"If the Wizards trade Beal, appeasing Russell Westbrook is not their concern. Simmons would immediately be their cornerstone and the only plan would be to surround him with shooting and mitigate the rest of Russell's contract as painlessly as possible."
Imagine passing up on Ben Simmons because of Russell Westbrook. Westbrook would be shipped out of DC ASAP if Simmons was coming into town.
How about 8 first round picks and young players for Harden? How about 4 first round picks and Chris Paul for aging Russell Westbrook? How about 5 first round picks and a young stud for Paul George?
"&gt;hi, noticed you have Kevin garnett next to your team, how do i get russell westbrook like that?"
"hi, noticed you have eric snow next to your team, how do i get russell westbrook like that?"
Idk why they are obsessed with rebounds and assists   The russell westbrook mvp season is in full effect.  Made fans Triple Double junkies
Probably Russell westbrook
100% agree. Only ones that should be in the GOAT argument should be Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook. And maybe then Luka
"Russell Westbrook himself wouldn't get a double double, let alone a triple double in the Jazz system. It's just not how Quin runs his team."
Julius “Russell Westbrook” Randle
Russell Westbrook. Hes the worst player ever according to this sub too.
"Barnes, Harrison. Westbrook, Russel. Russell, D'Angelo."
"They used to be best buds. Just sounds like a perfect scenario where Adams pops out from under the bed and something like ""It's gonna be alright mate"" ""let's facetime Russell Westbrook and bag on how trash the wizards are!"" Lolol"
"The question wasn't if 9-7 is a bad record. The question was if KD should be MVP. Historically speaking, if you're putting up good numbers but your team is #5 seed, you're not winning MVP unless your name is Russell Westbrook."
"D’Angelo Russell comes to mind, even Julius Randle and westbrook"
Russ averaged 27/8/7 on *better* efficiency than his previous years. Y'all had more problems than *rostering Russell Westbrook*.

"Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Jerry West and Rick Barry all come to mind. Good shooters, good passers, those guys were phenomenal, they would excel in any form of basketball in any decade, but would be even better now.   Magic Johnson would be akin to Russell Westbrook, only 6'9. He'd be a menace in today's game and compared to Zion and Lebron with his athletic abilities, size and skill.   Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic would've been even more frightening in 90s Isoball era. Nikola Jokic especially, it takes a whole team to stop his passing and shooting.   Shaquille O' Neal in todays game would score 45 points a game. Early 90s Shaq, before he ate/lifted to be so heavy was a damn freak. And there wouldn't be anyone who could stop it.   And finally AD, put that guy in any era of basketball, and he's amazing. But late 70s ball? he'd be equal to Walton, Moses, Kareem, McAdoo, Lanier and be on teams whose sole business would be to let him unleash havoc on D."
"This exactly. From 2010-2020 overall, lebron had the best teammate and roster combo comparing to other stars. Yet people still shit on them like if they were some sort of scrub. Maybe only KD can be included here if you argue peak&gt;longevity. But only 2 year run with Warriors roster and 50%TS Russell Westbrook."
&gt;Russell Westbrook is no doubt still an all-star caliber player  Ok I'm going to stop you right there..there is plenty of doubt in that statement you just made.
"Harden said it himself.   &gt; ""We were young,"" Harden said, reminiscing of his time with Durant (and Russell Westbrook) in Oklahoma City. ""We are grown men now. We know what we want. We really know the game of basketball. We are not those young guys that want to run around and just shoot and dunk all day. I sit back, and I know what a player Kevin Durant is. He's one of the best to ever touch a basketball.""    We wouldn't know if Harden would become the player he is now, if he wasn't developed by D'Antoni to become a number 1 option. We don't know if Harden will continue to accept attempting 10 shots per game, while playing off the bench. Because he wouldn't get as much shots attempts, while starting with Russ and KD.   If the three of them stick together up to this point. I don't believe they'll end up being the players they are now."
"what ?  this is about Westbrook, not Blake. That’s not moving the goalpost, that’s you arguing something that wasn’t relevant lmao.   The likelihood of Blake Griffin being washed is 100x more likely than Westbrook being washed. One is multiple seasons removed from being elite. The other is a few months away from being elite. One has missed 14 games since injury, the other has missed nearly 60. One has suffered a lot more injuries as of late that has kept that sidelined for a lot more games. One visually looks much worse compared to their former self than the other. One has actually been reported to be playing through injuries for SHORT bursts.  If Blake has been missing games and playing through injuries for over 80 games ...  why the fuck would he get the same evaluation as Westbrook?   If you’re entire point this whole time has been “well Blakes just been hurt this whole time for a whole season and some change” then you can’t possibly be trying to compare it Russell Westbrook ... right? Right???"

&gt; 2019-20 Pre-Bubble Russell Westbrook was a beast too. Averaging nearly 30PPG on 50% from the field.  Not close to KD by a long shot. They're not in the same tier.
&gt; 2019-20 Pre-Bubble Russell Westbrook was a beast too. Averaging nearly 30PPG on 50% from the field.  TS% is what matters. Russ is a loser.
"The SF equivalent of Tilman Fertitta buys the Warriors, fires all of Kerr's assistant coaches, is an asshole to Bob Meyers and makes him quit by forcing him to base all his moves around staying under the luxury tax even though they could contend, makes his 25 year old son a major decision maker in the franchise's front office, trades Klay Thompson for Russell Westbrook and gives up all their picks for the next 5 years in the process, and releases a book ironically named ""Shut Up and Listen"". I think that might do it."
"OKC got 5 first round picks out of Paul George,  4 from Russell Westbrook, and an additional pick from trading away Chris Paul. Ridiculous haul even if they didn't get a really great player in return (other than Shai)"
&gt;would you take Russell Westbrook   Nah
"He clashed with Dwight because D12 wanted to post up instead of running pnr when he has no post moves. Him and CP3 won 67 games together and took the KD Warriors to 7. The trio of Harden, CP3, and Capela went like 55-3. Westbrook and him played well together when Russell was healthy, and he got injured come playoff time. Look up their regular season stretch when Westbrook was 100%. Also, Westbrook and him are still good friends so the issue wasn’t off the court. The Rockets are just a sinking franchise."
"From my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/khpv2o/official_rnba_power_rankings_0_tis_the_season/ggmifdg/) on the pre-season rankings:   &gt; Could we get some explanations for (I don't want to criticize/roast, just seeking some rationale):  &gt; Nets at 15 and Wizards at 27? /u/ BigEarl139  &gt; Could two teams with two all-star level talents and solid supporting casts be as low as they are? Russell Westbrook is one of the biggest floor-raisers in the NBA. Surely they're better than more than three teams. Nets have a team mostly intact from last year and they're adding KD/Kyrie. If either gets injured, then 15 is very natural, but with both they should be at least slightly better, no?  I have to owe /u/BigEarl139 a retroactive apology, because Wizards at 27 is nearly spot-on with how they look this season. Nets at 15 was ambitiously low though, even before Harden's arrival (though if Kyrie missed more games due to being Kyrie, maybe?).   &gt; Thunder at 15? /u/ S9lo  &gt; EDIT: I see you put Wizards at 14, Thunder at 15, and Jazz at 16. Can I have what you're smoking?  &gt; EDIT2: Also, you ranked, in order, Lakers, Clippers, six Eastern teams (Boston, Milwaukee, Miami, Brooklyn, Philly, Toronto), then Denver, Phoenix, Portland, Houston, Dallas. First, is the gap that wide between Clippers and the rest of the West that all six Eastern teams fit? Second, do you really believe Dallas is worse than Phoenix, Portland, and Houston?  &gt; They lost Chris Paul, Steven Adams, and Danilo Gallinari. They're starting SGA/Dort/Bazley/Ariza/Horford with an uninspiring bench. That's not a terrible team (a la process Sixers or some expansion Hornets teams), but it sounds like you're expecting major overperformances from their players.   Wizards at 14, Thunder 15, and Jazz at 16 is still ludicrous. I'm homer-ing here, but the sheer ordering of those teams caused me indignation.  Also, though the Mavs remain worse than Phoenix and Portland on the power rankings, I expect that to change. They should at least pass Portland (Blazers bros, I feel for you and losing Nurkic to injury is super painful). However, I do acknowledge that would be difficult to predict.  &gt; Pacers at 24 and Warriors at 29? /u/ Bird_and_Dog  &gt; No comment.  Still no comment. (The Warriors did start off slow, but 29th in the league slow? That was a stretch for sure. And the Pacers were at least mediocre and a solid playoff last season and lost practically no one. To slot them at 24 was disrespecting their core players, not to mention they're now missing LeVert and Lamb.)"
"2002: Lost in 1st round to Boston Celtics who made the ECF that year.  Celtics had apex Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker who was still kinda good back then.  It was a 5 game series (they only went 5 back then).  Iverson averaged 30 PPG during that series.   2003: Lost in 2nd round to Pistons, who went to ECF that year.  Pistons won the title the next year with largely the same core they had in 2003.  Iverson averaged 28.5 PPG in that series.   2005: Lost in 1st round to Pistons, they went to the Finals that year and almost beat the Spurs (lost in 7 games).  That Pistons squad was ELITE.  Iverson averaged 31.2 PPG in that series.   2007: Lost in 1st round to the Spurs, eventual champions.  Iverson averaged 22.8 as a 2nd option to Melo.   2008: Lost in 1st round to Lakers, who made the Finals that year.  That Lakers squad was extremely talented, Kobe was the MVP that year.   Iverson averaged 24.5 PPG in that series as a 2nd option.   Iverson ran into better players &amp; teams for much of his postseason career, every team he ran into in the 1st round either went to the conference finals or finals, and they lost to the eventual champion once. It's really hard to have postseason success in the NBA. If you listed players that struggle to make a conference finals, that list would be really long.  For instance, Russell Westbrook has only been out of the 1st round once since KD left OKC in 2016, and never as the #1 option on his team."
"Russell Westbrook has never sniffed the level of Simmons defense even at his peak. Simmons, for all his faults, does not shoot his team out of a game like Russ can. They’re not even remotely similar.   And with Simmons, he didn’t even play in the pandemic playoffs, considering he needed knee surgery after 3 bubble games."
I would not take Russell Westbrook on a league minimum contract if it means having to play him 30 mins/night
"Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka, Maybe throw in a side of Kendrick Perkins and Derek Fisher  Then Nash has to draw up Sekrit plays."
"&gt;	How high somebody jumps and how quick they move has zero to do with how athletic the people around them are.  I mean, it absolutely affects their ability to take advantage of their quickness/vertical lol. You’re not making the same plays against AD that you would’ve made against Boston College Power Forward Jimmy Smith.   &gt;	He has barely even jumped off one foot in the NBA whereas he did it all the time in college.  This is kind of a weird thing to point out. One-foot-jumps usually come in transition when there’s momentum. Zion gets less transition looks because he has less transition opportunities against NBA players. Watch his highlights, he goes off 2 feet 90% of the time, and that 10% is when he’s completely wide open.   &gt;	If you just watch him by himself, completely alone on a fast break dunk opportunity, he is very obviously not as explosive as he was in college.  He’s barely gotten *any* fast break dunk opportunities. Most of his fast break dunks come from full court passes from Lonzo. He doesn’t have the same opportunity he had in college to leak out and cherry pick.   &gt;	I don’t understand why everyone is in such a rush to explain away a very simple eye test.  The eye test is almost *always* going to prove that a player isn’t as dominant in the NBA as they were in college. That’s kinda the point...  &gt;	Did Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, or Donovan Mitchell look less athletic in the NBA? No; because they were just as athletic (or more) in the nba. Zion simply is not...  You just named a few explosive *guards* who can still play exactly how they played in HS/college regardless of what kind of defense they face. PFs and Cs notoriously have it harder at the next level, because facing a 7’0 brick wall in the NBA is a much bigger step-up from college than facing a 6’5 guard instead of a 6’2 guard.   Zion averaged 22/9 in college. He’s currently averaging 22/7 in the NBA. He’s adjusting fine, and the “eye-test” bullshit only works if you don’t account for literally every difference between college and the NBA."
lool isn't this same guy who made the Russell Westbrook is the most misunderstood NBA Superstar in history post?
FWIW Bballreference stats for each of them 0-3ft    Kyrie: 60.7%   Tony Parker: 64.5%     Russell Westbrook: 59.3%    Someone correct me if I'm wrong or am misunderstanding the stats
"This is such a lazy take. How high somebody jumps and how quick they move has zero to do with how athletic the people around them are. He has barely even jumped off one foot in the NBA whereas he did it all the time in college. Sure, he will look less athletic in comparison to NBA players and won’t be able to get away with as much, but he also has been noticeably heavier and stiffer. If you just watch him by himself, completely alone on a fast break dunk opportunity, he is very obviously not as explosive as he was in college.   I don’t understand why everyone is in such a rush to explain away a very simple eye test. Did Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, or Donovan Mitchell look less athletic in the NBA?

"Who can say for certain who will win the next few championships. What we do know is that the league is going through a lot of very unique events in a very short amount of time. COVID has forced the league to radically change how they operate - sometimes for the worse, but sometimes for the better. What changes might stick around beyond COVID?  It has been widely speculated that the 2022 draft will be a double draft as the age restriction lowers from 19 to 18, which will presumably create a doubly talented draft class. This draft class will also contain a lot of people who grew up and became basketball players entirely during the 3-pt era. It's possible that we see numbers start to trend upwards league-wide from behind the 3pt line.  Somewhere in the next few years the CBA will be renegotiated. With big stars like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and more demanding trades and making them happen, owners may want the new agreement to help keep stars in one place.   Not to mention Space Jam: A New Legacy coming out this summer. ^(/s)  By the time LeBron retires, the league will be completely different."
I didn’t watch the game but looking at the stat line can somebody tell me if this was more of a “Get Luka some help” game or a “Get Luka to stop trying to be Russell Westbrook” game?
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
You don’t think Russell Westbrook has 31 more triple doubles in him? That record could fall this season.
Russell Westbrook plays for the fucking Washington Wizards if you hadn’t forgotten. Or when he won the mvp was leading a bunch of youngsters to the playoffs. He is suddenly selfish stat ladder when he does the same thing. As you said “Who else is gonna take those shots?!”
"Heroic Luka tries valiantly tries to keep an understaffed Mavericks team in the game with a 13-30 triple double. What a star!  Versus....  Ball-hog Russell Westbrook pathetically tries to lead the Washington Wizards(?!) out of the doldrums, stat-pads his way to a 13-30 triple double. Villain!  What am I missing?"
Russell Westbrook deserves to be there
Russell Westbrook for the vet minimum.
Basically Reddit with Russell Westbrook.
"I didn't agree with you you're acting like those rosters weren't pretty bad. Russell Westbrook had his issues, but the level of play around him was not great"
"Mostly because he wanted them to bring in superstar teammates like Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook and he ran each of them out of town in succession while the Rockets gave away all their future picks and took on bad contracts. Then he demonstrates he wants out by breaking COVID protocol and not showing up, instead, is filmed partying strippers and is clearly out of shape now.   For him to say he gave it everything he had is disingenuous. Its like a spouse that runs up credit card bills, cheats, gets drunk all the time and then says ""I've done everything but this marriage just isn't going to work"", all the while flirting with someone very attractive (the Nets)."
"Career numbers make no difference when we are talking about who is the best player right now. Otherwise Derrick Rose, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook would be ranked better than Kyrie too.  He is solidly in the 15-20 range with those other guys I mentioned. There's nothing wrong with that."
Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook...now that's a scary site...for Wizards fans
"Just because you have AD and LeBron and good players, that doesn't make you a super team.  Westbrook / Harden Rockets wasn't a super team  CP3 / Harden wasn't a super team  CP3 / peak Griffin / Peak DeAndre / Reddick/Crawford wasn't a super team   Kyrie / Tatum /Brown / Hayward wasn't a super team  Giannis / Middleton / Jrue isn't a super team  Shaq / Kobe Lakers wasn't a superteam  AD/LeBron Lakers aren't a super team  The 73 win Warriors wasn't a super team.

"He's not wrong. KD is far superior to an older CP3 and any Russell Westbrook. That said, if he doesn't win a ring he's gonna get shit on so hard."
"When Russell Westbrook does well I am happy  When Russell Westbrook does poorly, I think ""It's OK Russ, I still like you""  I like Russell Westbrook"
"When Russell Westbrook stops doing thing he is terrible at, he wins games"
Yeah it looks like the team has finally found itself or at least just gotten healthy. Still some mishaps but this is the type of ball I expected from them before the season started.   A team with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook is too good for the start these guys had
A 4 TS drop-off is huge lmao the difference between 4 TS is the same as Russell Westbrook and LeBron James TS in 2019-20
"Russell ""GODDAMN"" Westbrook"
"Ah yes, 5’9” Russell Westbrook"
Aren't you the same dude who said Russell Westbrook is clearly higher than John Stockton all time?
"They screwed around with the box score prior too much, incorporating stuff they shouldnt have. And theyve done stuff like remove height as part of the box score prior which has helped lead to alot of guards being excessively inflated in DRPM. A good lithmus test in general for any model is Conley has basically shared all his minutes with Gobert this year. It's obvious who is far more influential defensively. If a model is having Conley rated similarly to Gobert defensively this year(which ones like RAPTOR do) that's a pretty big red flag. The better ones like LEBRON dont  Offensively the model seems to be built with a questionable assumption of giving guards additional weight on the offensive end. Box score prior is also clearly being built towards favoring volume stat accumulation, Russell Westbrook is top 30 in ORPM this year again.   Bottom line is nobody in the analytics community really uses RPM anymore, it's obvious why OP is bringing it up."
"https://youtu.be/kwAu7evxI-M  https://youtu.be/Ga-P_7QQgA8 (this is literally garbage time which explains why he was in)   And we’ve all seen the plays with russell Westbrook and going for his knees. The dude just plays recklessly and violently. Pair that with little to no offensive productivity and it makes for a dangerous situation- a reckless player who’s goal is to prove himself and his dominance but has no offensive capabilities to do so, so he resorts to emotional and often times violent “defensive” efforts poorly disguised as passion and hustle"
So Russell Westbrook?
I wouldn't bet on a team that has Russell Westbrook on it.
It's very much like when he injured Russell Westbrook. [He just cheap shotted him and kept on running without ever looking back to see if Russ was OK.](https://youtu.be/qsiWcK4ahcs) Such a dead giveaway when someone does a cheap shot: they don't show even a second's ounce of concern or remorse.
"i think it finally hit me - this team is basically the houston rockets except better in literally *every single way*.  Especially where the old team was flawed especially in this small ball lineup.  Better shooters, spacers, ball handlers, one-on-one defending,  bigs (still shit but better),  role players, like damn.  No wonder Mike said hell yeah ill come over and be assistant coach.  Harden plays the PJ role but is multitudes better on offense.   KD shouldn´t even be compared to anyone on the Rockets but you could say he plays the Jeff Green role in this offense (and they also have actual Jeff Green).   Kyrie is a better fit than either Chris Paul / Russell Westbrook.   DJ is a better Capela and then you top that off with a 3 point shooter on a level that Houston never had in Joe Harris? JEsus christ"

"I wasn't the one comparing him to Zion. I don't think Zion is in the running for best start of career.  &gt; Luka gets a lot of his boards himself.  He has high uncontested rebounding just like any other guard or backcourt player. &gt;75% of his boards aren't even contested.  &gt;However you can’t get multiple 20 rebound games from just “Russell Westbrook” style rebounds.  Russel Westbrook has had high rebounding games as well. Russel Westbrook, Lebron James, Luka Doncic and pretty much any high rebounding backcourt player all pretty much have uncontested rebounding rate in the 70's or low 80's most years."
"Fun fact. Kevin Durant, James Harden, AND Russell Westbrook have actually played together before, on the 2012 USA Basketball team."
"The thing is, Luka is playing in the exact same era as Zion. I was referring to his stats compared to Zion’s. If you actually watched Mavericks games, you would notice Luka gets a lot of his boards himself. He uses his size, weight, and positioning to get them. It’s not really his fault that he gets rebounds to start the break, because he is his teams lead ball handler. However you can’t get multiple 20 rebound games from just “Russell Westbrook” style rebounds."

"Simmons takes the 4th most shots on the Sixers.  He is their 2nd best player, but he is their 4th option to take a shot.     It would be amazing if he could develop a jump shot and become confident with it.  But, in the mean time, I think people should appreciate that he knows his limitations and does what he is best at (passing, rebounding and defending) instead of forcing up shots like a Russell Westbrook."
Those are usually the two I see the most and some Russell Westbrook

"because Russell Westbrook didn't play defense, and often took ill-advised shots. He did a lot of great things on the court, but people like Lebron and CP3 have an all-around game that includes defense and constantly making the right play. Much of Westbrook's numbers are boosted by volume. He was a great player in his prime, but he wasn't a ""complete"" player just because he scored a lot and stacked assists."
"Probably because Westbrook’s most efficient scoring year is only better than like LeBron’s least efficient scoring year (his rookie year)  LeBron is like if you combined Russell Westbrook with Kevin Durant and averaged them out  From like 12-13 onward, KD is so efficient that just giving him the ball and letting him score is much more efficient for your team than even peak Westbrook"

Lmao you’re talking about turnovers when Russell Westbrook is on this list. Just say you’re an old fart who doesn’t like curry
I prefer the Russell Westbrook version
"Russell Westbrook? I love the dude and at his best he was one of the most dominant player I’ve seen. I’m not one of those people who keep saying that he doesn’t have skills but he’s shown poor decision making in the clutch over and over and I would argue that this is due to poor bbal IQ.   For instance in the loss against Portland two years ago, he rushed the last possessions and of the final one he tried to obtain a foul with quite some time on the clock, while all his teammates were shooting pretty well. Not looking for a hot hand when you’re shooting 30%, not using full clock down the stretch in my opinion shows low bball IQ."
"Just wondering, how do OKC fans feel about KD now? I never blamed him for leaving the Thunder because if somehow I was an NBA player, Russell Westbrook would be the player I would least like to play with."
watch some actual games instead checking box scores russell westbrook also one of the biggest statpadder ever lived and Simmons is dpoy caliber player and an elite playmaker and simmons playing with better efficency

I think everybody but Lakers fans and Russell Westbrook agree with you.
I fucking love Russell Westbrook

He’s the best. I hereby indoctrinate you into loving Russell Westbrook for the rest of your life. 😳
I’ve never been a bigger fan of Russell Westbrook than I am at this moment.
They can dump him without giving up any picks. Instead they have to take back one Russell Westbrook.
" &gt;These players find success by being loyal and placing faith in their teams  You have this backwards. Everyone there besides maybe Dirk found success, which make it easy for them to stay.  &gt;Even beyond actual basketball, players that are loyal are almost universally beloved while players that ditch their teams tend to be hated. Russell Westbrook is still beloved by OKC fans even though he never won anything while KD is universally despised  So?"
"&gt; He has to have the worst stats to impact ratio in the league.  Something, something, Russell Westbrook..."
"Yeah sure, your best player right now has played for 3 different teams and a lot of Lakers fans are historically known as bandwagon fans (Yankees/Lakers/Cowboys fans).  Here's an argument against the statement: Loyalty isn't meaningless. Franchises that commit to players for long periods of time into the future tend to be more successful in building dynasties. Steph Curry. Tim Duncan. Dirk. These players find success by being loyal and placing faith in their teams and the teams find success by not screwing the player over and trusting that the mutual loyalty between them will lead to greatness. Even beyond actual basketball, players that are loyal are almost universally beloved while players that ditch their teams tend to be hated. Russell Westbrook is still beloved by OKC fans even though he never won anything while KD is universally despised. Dame is beloved by a lot of people even though he's never won anything while Kyrie is constantly slandered even though he's won more.   Even historically, Tim Duncan/Dirk/Kobe tend to be elevated above similar level superstars that left their teams like Shaq."
There's two things that r/nba posters agree on: Russell Westbrook and Andre Drummond are trash. Two things.
"Yeah except that's not true at all lmao.  How many playoff series has westbrook won as the best player?  Same as Dame's jersey number.  Could westbrook beat a team led by rookie Donovan Mitchell?  Or could he help KD win a title?  Could be beat a Blazers team in a series everyone thought OKC would win?    My point is, Lillard had one really bad playoff loss against the pelicans.  He got shut down, and he responded by improving his game and going to the WCF the next year.  Westbrook got left by KD, then he lost in the first round to Houston (which is fine, Houston was better) got another star but still lost to the Jazz in the first round, then lost to the blazers in the first round, and then got carried by Harden to a first round win, where he only played 3 games and was absolutely horrendous in those games.  He then followed that performance up by helping the Lakers win the next series while shooting 42/26/54 (no that's not a typo) and this year he's doing his best to help the wizards get a good pick.  Lillards shooting percentages in his awful pelicans series were about the same as westbrooks 2017 series when he won mvp.  Turns out when 3/5 of the last playoff series you've played in fall under the category of ""absolutely and inarguably horrendous"" you get criticism.  Russell westbrook is no longer a good basketball player, and he hasn't been good enough to win in the playoffs in years.  Even mentioning him in the same breath as lillard is mind numbingly moronic.  If we had Russ instead of lillard, we would be in dead last.  The wizards would be a top 5 team in the East with Lillard."
from a bit over two years ago  &gt; Thunder have won 100 of 122 games wherein Russell Westbrook has notched a triple-double
"Id rather have Baynes, he isn't getting paid 28 million to be Big Man Quad Injury Russell Westbrook."

He's the center version of Russell Westbrook
It was a travel. Lebron James is as notorious a traveler as James Harden is a cheat for hooking arms to get free throws and Russell Westbrook is at taking easy rebounds in meaningless minutes to pad triple double stats.
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30439266/sources-houston-rockets-washington-wizards-agree-russell-westbrook-john-wall-deal   The 2023 first-round pick is lottery protected for the Wizards. If it doesn't convey in that year, it has a succession of protections that include picks Nos. 1-12 in 2024, picks 1-10 in 2025 and picks 1-8 in 2026, sources said. If it hasn't conveyed as a first-round pick to Houston by 2026, it becomes a second-round pick in each of 2026 and 2027, sources told ESPN.   So yes, if wizards stay bad through out the next five years, it becomes two 2nds.  Also note, this means wizards can not trade their frp picks until 2026.... which is pretty crazy if you think about it."
"Russell Westbrook.  His draft was the first draft I really followed, and I was 100% he'd be a worse player than Jerryd Bayless and DJ Augustin. Then he became my favourite non Piston ever.  &amp;#x200B;  Dennis Smith Jr. is kinda the opposite, I saw the athletism and I was sure he would overcome his flaws because of the Westbrook example, turns out I overrated his athletism and underrated how crazy the Westbrook developpment was (from back up shooting guard to all star point guard in 4 years)"
"Celebrities athletes rappers are worshipped in America , its fucking wierd if you ask me . ESPN will show a clip a of Russell Westbrook dancing pregame warm up followed by a 10 minute analysis of it, and everyone's like i love Russell Westbrook.

Melo was never that efficient. He was basically a less athletic Russell Westbrook
If you're getting schooled by russell fucking westbrook you need to rethink life
"Let’s run it back.  &gt; lmao, russ was not the reason the rockets lost the playoffs  This implies he had nothing to do with it when he literally had the **most** to do with it.  And lmao, “simply isn’t true”. Teams were hard doubling harden and forcing westbrook to beat them 4 on 3 and with capella teams got away with it because they know westbrook isnt and even worth guarding past 10 feet at most. They thought that making it 5 out would increase our chances and russ would be able to beat 4 on 3s that way (like any other REAL star guard would have done) but unfortunately, he couldn’t.  And actually, I agree with you. The teams shit construction *is* why we lost. And that construction is really russ. I don’t know why the fuck they thought he was going to be a new player at age 32. So yeah, the rockets are pretty dumb for that in hindsight.  &gt; westbrook has been on teams more successful  Like the 2012 thunder? Yeah, they had better players and westbrook was better back then. The NBA also wasnt as advanced as it is now so players like westbrook did better. Not sure why that’s relevant. Russ and steven adams got shitted on in the first round 4 seasons in a row even with Paul George on his side.   My point is there are about a 100 players who would have produced better then westbrook did for us in those playoffs and I’d a ton of them make the series a toss up too. You’re ignoring that even with westbrook the swries was really close to being 2-0, it legit was winnable a good chunk into the 4th.   But guess what? Russell Westbrook shot 4-15, had 10 points, dished out 4 assists along with 7 turnovers. That’s 15 shots to 10 points, 4 assists to 7 TO. There are 200 players who would have impacted the game enough for us to win. Lakers fans sighed relief when he checked back in after we made a run while he was sitting. I can’t believe you don’t remember this lmao  That is absolutely g league fucking level of basketball, I don’t care if he averaged 19/5 a bunch of low end players would do that if the other team refuses to guard them and they said fuck efficiency.  His TS was in the 40s.  Half our team was not worse then westbrook, you think just because he put up 19 PPG he was somehow good? Our players who stood still and shot open threes at a respectable clip and At least tried on defense had way more of an impact.  So what the fuck is so hard for you to understand? Westbrook wasn’t good, he held the team down, he was the main reason we lost and tons and tons of players would have done way better and I’m willing to say a large number of players would have won us that series since we’d be up 2-0 if not for that G League performance by Westbrook.  I don’t need to digest shit, **you** do. You’ve yet to produce a single valid point lmao and you’re acting like you have"
"I get liking Westbrook, but I don't understand why people defend this. He objectively stat pads by stealing rebounds: check youtube and you can find dozens of compilations of him doing it.  [Here's just one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StQ0ormf_Lo). His teammates even say he does it: [here's Carmelo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Aro_laSnrs) saying that Westbrook steals rebounds and all his teammates know it. [This excellent statistical analysis](https://greekgodofstats.com/2019/12/26/can-you-give-me-some-stats-to-prove-that-russell-westbrook-steals-rebounds/) provides some evidence for both sides, but pairing that with the endless clips of him stealing rebounds and his teammates' acknowledgement of it, it's obvious that he does.  And it's not just rebounding: check out this highlight clip of him stat padding assists to get a triple double in a game, [it's absolutely hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8erK7T_LIQ). He passes up so many wide open shots while they're losing but the game is still on the line.  Like Russ or dont, but there's no argument that he doesnt put his numbers ahead of the game and winning. He's an elite rebounder and passer and he'd have great numbers regardless, but his triple doubles come from prioritizing his numbers."
Does he know that he’s Russell Westbrook?

All of this is as accurate as a Russell Westbrook 3 pointer.
"Draft classes since 1980 w/ multiple MVPs.  1984: Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon  1996: Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant  2008: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook  2009: Steph Curry, James Harden"
"Notice no response  Curry stans have literally no logical consistency to any of the arguments they're spewing on here.   There are people arguing Harden playing with Russell Westbrook, CP3, and Dwight Howard at different points in their career while they were all outta their primes, often injured and bad at the most important times (Dwight hurt and mediocre in 15 &amp; 16 playoffs, CP3 hurt in 18 playoffs, mediocre in 19 Playoffs, Russ hurt mediocre in 2020 playoffs).....  is somehow equivalent to Steph playing with Klay, KD, Draymond and Iggy all relatively in their primes for years. Bullshit. Then there's people claiming Steph has to play with Juan Toscano Anderson while implying Harden's worst role players were guys like Eric Gordon when in reality they were guys like this:  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html)  Notice his only season with Harden was his last season in the NBA. Harden had to play 70 games with a guy who was so bad he dropped out of the league forever afterwards.  Jesus, the lengths people go to defend Curry at all costs. You can still acknowledge Curry is better and all without lying about objective facts"
"Harden has played with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook.  He played on a lot of quality teams."
"Don't even mention us, please. But you people that keep talking and talking and talking about the jazz, as if they have shown the ability to consistently get out of the first round. And the people that keep talking and talking about the bucks, as if they've played a single finals game with Giannis. Just shut up until these teams *actually* do something relevant in the playoffs. Just please.   Like this is just embarrassing. Omg Giannis is the greatest player of all time.....gets sent home two years in a row before the finals.   Omg the Utah Jazz have won 50 straight games and Gobert is the greatest defensive center ever....Jokic drops 57 on him...their most relevant playoff moments of the last 5 years are losing to the Nuggets and beating Russell Westbrook in a series.....  Talk about someone else man. Talk about the clippers for god sakes, those guys are on fire and they actually have a team that can win s championship.  Being bombarded by jazz and bucks conversations on a weekly basis is just laughable because we know exactly what will happen to both in May.....they won't be playing."

"Russell ""Quicksilver"" Westbrook"
"Kevin Durant: The rookie who became a hero. The hero who became an MVP. The MVP who defied a Champion. Striking story! But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Champion himself in the great arena?    Russell Westbrook: You would fight me?    Kevin Durant: Why not? Do you think I am afraid?    Russell Westbrook: I think you've been afraid all your life.     *Wizards sweep the Nets in the ECF*"
"Below average starter implies:  The Washington Wizards are not a meaningfully different team if they replaced Russell Westbrook with Eric Bledsoe or Patrick Beverley. Not only that, but they might be a *better* team.  They could make up for:  1st in the league in assists  Top 10 in rebounding  Top 20 points per game  By getting Bledsoe? Getting the third 30/20/10 game in history didn't help them beat the pacers?  Sheesh. Westbrook is worse than I thought I guess. Here I was thinking he was some kind of Hall of Famer!"
"Ah yes, the Rockets big 3: James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Eric Gordon"

"Also, Russell westbrook is the poster child of the play-in. The Wizards and Russ struggled to find a groove the majority of the season. Things finally came together recently, and now they’re firing on all cylinders. I don’t think the wizards are any team’s first choice for a playoff series.

russell westbrook flair talking about playoff series' lol

Because y'all have Russell Westbrook making crunch time decisions.
Also we saw how Russell Westbrook got owned today by the young Hawks squad. Man can drop triple Doubles but he ain't a winning player lmao
"This website has different statistics from either - https://www.google.ca/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/russell-westbrook-amazing-response-asked-032831937.html  and the NBA has their own eval: https://www.nba.com/stats/players/clutch-traditional/?sort=FG_PCT  Which puts Westbrook at 49.5% and Doncic at 47.5%. All in all, no sources give the same answers for ""clutch shooting percentage"". Either way, if Westbrook leads the league in clutch shots *made* there's no way Luka's clutchness accounts for OP's perception of their triple doubles lol"
Russell Westbrook leads the league in clutch shooting success. Luka Doncic is 32nd.  https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnPlayerSplit.php
But still don’t let this distract you from the fact that Russell Westbrook has a TS of **50%**
Dont let this distract you from the fact that Russell Westbrook has a TS of 50%
"1) They are not different. A triple double occurs when a player achieves 10+ points, 10+ rebounds, and 10+ assists in a single game. There is no other factor going into a triple double.  2) Doncic's are not more consistent. Russell Westbrook has achieved a triple double in 57% of his games this season. Luka Doncic has achieved a triple double in 16% of his games this season. Russell Westbrook has more triple doubles this season than Luka Doncic has over all three of his seasons combined.  3) The reason why they appear more impressive to you is likely that you like Luka Doncic as a player more than you like Russell Westbrook."

"If you had been following at all you’d know that westbrook was ass earlier in the year cause of his injury. It’s been pretty well covered. It’s like people saying “towns and Russell suck because the Timberwolves have a terrible record” like they weren’t playing, do people on this sub actually follow the nba or nah"
"Scott Brooks has single handedly lost us close to 10 games this season.   1. He doesn't like calling timeouts ( leading to bad shots, and turnovers)  2. He doesn't like drawing up plays. Go Beal and Go Westbrook are his options.  3. He thinks playing Ish Smith with Russell Westbrook is good.  4. Adding on to that, he really likes 3 guard line ups including Westbrook, Smith, and Neto  5. He doesn't like playing Daniel Gafford who is our third best player."
"I don't think anyone understands that this is an example of the Russell Westbrook problem, not a sign of healthy sustainable team basketball."
Wtf I love Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook ain’t being denied All-NBA nephews lmao
He’s stupid good. I don’t think people are entirely aware of the unprecedented greatness that is Russell Westbrook. Enjoy him while it lasts.
"""This is not a Russell Westbrook salute all game.""    It isn't??"
"That was 5 and 6 years ago though. Russell Westbrook was a top 5 player back then, but he isn’t anymore. The league changes a lot in 5 years. Nowadays you’re not gonna be that good if he’s your second best player, as seen this season."
You don’t know anything about me or why I made this account. If you even bothered to ask id tell you that I made the username after having an argument about Russell Westbrook and deciding to see what people on reddit had to say about him. After making the username I realized I couldn’t ever change it.
I assume you’re angry that your team is led by the most unwatchable player in the nba aside from Russell Westbrook
"You missed the point of his argument with Draymond. Russell Westbrook getting a rebound as his center boxes out is a valuable rebound because he can throw outlet passes, run the ball up the floor, etc. Especially in OKC that was the whole game plan. They wanted the wings to run the floor while Russ could get the ball and run the break. It was way faster than him half way running up the floor then coming back to Steven Adam's to get the rebound."
Russell Westbrook with the Rockets will be forgotten but it was a great season that culminated in getting All-NBA 3rd team.

"Okay let's do this! Hahah  First of all, this stat has nothing to do with how many passes he receives. Literally nothing to do with it.   Secondly, let's use Westbrook to compare.   Russ has passed the ball 4,053 times this season. DeMar has passed 1964 times.   Now let's look at potential assists. Russ has 1340. DeMar has 731.  Do the math there and you can see the potential assist ratios. Russ is 33%. DeMar is 37%.  Looking at these numbers, Russell Westbrook who is one of the most ball dominant players in the league makes more passes that are not potential assists than DeRozan.  Think about that. Westbrook passes more without expecting a shot than DeRozan..  Last point, Reggie Jackson has more hockey assists this season than DeMar and he's only thrown 1500 passes total..  EDIT: TJ McConnell has more hockey assists than DeRozan"
Russell Westbrook   be honest with yourself how many of you want this man on your team for a max contract
Is the only reason you are asking this because of Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook   Yeah I said it.
I DISAGREE I ADD RUSSELL WESTBROOK
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook
They got Russell Westbrook tho. The real we believe 2.0 are the Knicks
"Who is everyone? Random people on the internet isnt everyone. If they are saying it, it's because of his elite playmaking. Something he learned from his time leading The Rockets. He can playmake and have the role players get easy looks and of course help facilitate the 2 other stars while also scoring himself. Russell Westbrook is a great player, but he is not on the level of KD or Kyrie."
"Next 3 active are Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
"I don't give a fuck who you are, which team you support, what gets you up in the morning, how good your dad is at fighting, how big your cock is, how much you love going for long walks or any other bullshit. You're on this subreddit because you love basketball. And if you love basketball then you owe it to yourself to give up every other thing you give a flying fuck about and watch ""my balls"". And you know why:  Russell Westbrook."
"I always respected Melo, even as a fan of opposing teams cuz Melo never cheats the game and you know he's the real deal. A lot of younger fans don't realize how special he is. Only reason he has a lot of hate to his name is cuz he was also really great. Another great example is Russell Westbrook"
"This is how I feel. The narrative he has no playoff success is also bullshit IMO.   Nick Wright had an amazing example today comparing the total career playoff success of Stockton, CP3, Nash and Westbrook. Russell after 12 seasons has more or equal success in the post season as those other 3 and yet we don't knock them for it. Most people are quick to defend the other 3."
"Dr J meant more to basketball than James Harden, Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook, probably combined, ever will. That's not a hot take, read some history on the Dr.   Man might be the reason most of us had the chance to even care about basketball."
"Is it   \&gt; Russell I cannot be ranked against Harden because of era.   or   \&gt; Harden should also be in top 15 over Russel     You clearly think they can be ranked, you just don't like that he's ranked higher. If you can't rank Russell against Harden than you couldn't realisticly rank Kareem or Wilt either, and if we're being honest you couldn't rank against Bird or Magic either. If that's the case you're not making an all-time list, you're making a ""of recent history"" list.  If you want to say that Harden is a top 15 player of recent history I can see the logic, but having him All Time top 15 is utter lunacy. You say KG didn't win anything except as a Celtic but Harden hasn't won anything at all. Bird has some serious letdowns in the playoffs, but to use that as points against him in a Harden comparison implies that Harden hasn't and no one is blind enough to think that's true.  The closest thing you have to an argument is ""Harden has more top MVP finishes"" which is completely true, but is also era-dependant. KG's prime MVP years matched up with guys like Tim Duncan, Shaq, Nash and Kobe. Harden was up against Westbrook, Giannis and LeCoast, there's a little bit of a difference in level of competition there. There's also that minor hurdle where defense exists and Harden has been mediocre at best while KG has a strong case for being one of the best ever.  There are legitimate arguments to be made for Harden, but you just so happened to pick the ones that actively work against you. You can't deride players for not winning without help when the guy you're supporting hasn't won, and you can't deride them for having bad playoff performances when that is literally the single largest argument against Harden."
"Yup im repeating. And ill go again. How can you put sabbonis as an honorable mention. To Russell Westbrook? Talk about delusional, they’re not even in the same ballpark rofl. After i seen that no way to take anything you say seriously. Sabbonis roflll😂😂"
"MY freshman year at San Francisco State was also the year the warriors won 73 games. So through the regular season I was nominally a warriors fan, but I only watched the nationally televised games and didn't really love the team, it was just kind of to be part of it. Then I watched one game of the Thunder Spurs series, and that was it. One game of Russell Westbrook was all it took to make me a thunder fan. Obviously I switched sides to the thunder and away from the warriors at exactly the wrong time, but then my first full regular season watching every game was Russ's MVP year so it was worth it."
"I think we throw around the word “decline” a lot. Before last years championship people said Lebron was in decline. And despite my hopes and dreams that didn’t prove to be true.   People said the same about CP3 and here he is leading the Suns to water after a 10 year drought.   There’s always a lot of talk about stuff like that. Realistically I think we should shift focus to talking about teams development programs. How many times have we thought someone was washed, then they got traded, got a new crew of physical therapists and development specialists and worked their way back up inside of a year.   Hell, Russell Westbrook just broke the triple double record while in “decline”. Just saying we may need to reframe how we look at some of this stuff.   To answer your question, if worst came to worst, and cp3 left the Suns this off-season, I wouldn’t mind if we picked up kemba if we had the resources and patience to properly rehab him and that knee. When he feels good he’s still a force and an absolute beast. Regardless I hope he ends up someplace good; I’ve always really liked his game. Having said that, on paper the value might not be too high and the return for the Celtics might not be great. But that hasn’t stopped Ainge before 🤣"
"Found this which I believe is the same type of stuff I heard Billy Donovan reference in an interview after a game or something like that:     ""When he does, the Thunder win. In Westbrook's 48 career triple-doubles, the Thunder are 42-6. In his 11 this season, they're 9-2. The two losses were a two-point loss to the Orlando Magic on a buzzer-beater and an overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers.  There's also this: Via Nylon Calculus, there's evidence to suggest the Thunder's best offense comes from a Westbrook defensive rebound.  When Westbrook hauls in a rebound, the Thunder's pace cranks up, and the team shoots a higher effective field goal percentage (55.3 percent) than when he doesn't grab the board (50.3). One of the Thunder's primary struggles this season is in the half court, but they remain lethal in transition. The Thunder's best path to transition is getting the ball in Westbrook's hands as quickly as possible.""  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18240823/how-russell-westbrook-chasing-triple-doubles-helps-oklahoma-city-thunder"
"The guy I responded to specifically mentioned that Russell Westbrook has been crazy durable *since* 2016, so what else was I supposed to compare? I already hinted at the issue with comparing Luka’s first 3 years with WB’s first 3 years in the league which is that the game has changed a bunch since then and practically every star gets load managed now."
"Honestly - Harden is an amazing passer, one of the best in the league - but he's 2300 behind Russell and is only a year younger. Harden would have to out-assist Westbrook by a stupid amount, or have a significantly longer career/assist peak than Westbrook. I can't see either of those happening"
"Allen Iverson was overrated.  The NBA wanted LeBron to win a championship with the Cavs, and systematically screwed the Warriors(although game 7 was fairly officiated, and the Warriors essentially choked)  Russell Westbrook should not have a MVP.  Mark Price was underrated and his play/teams were never optimized to utilize his talent. He would have been a way bigger deal now.  The Kings would have been better off not drafting DeMarcus Cousins.  Jabari Parker was never used right and could have been a star player if he was drafted by someone else."
"Russell Westbrook is chaotic bad on both sides of the court. Not good, not neutral, just bad. That said, congrats on breaking Robertson's record."
"Nick Wright has always been a huge Russell Westbrook supporter, obviously he's going to say this"
"From 1961-1966, Oscar had 60% of the league's triple doubles (148 of 247).  From 2016-2021, Westbrook had 24.9% of the league's triple doubles (163 of 655).  Oscar had 148 triple doubles in his first 6 seasons. No one else had more than 17.   Oscar averaged 30/10/11 during those 6 seasons.

The point of offense is to score efficiently. Otherwise Russell Westbrook is the greatest player of all time and Steph Curry is just a chucker.  Seriously if you dont think efficiency matter you have a fundamental misunderstanding of basketball. Look of Dean Oliver's four factors and thats old school.
"I believe that according to advanced stats, Russell Westbrook is ranked DEAD LAST in % of rebounds that are contested. His teammates have to give him uncontested rebounds, and he’s always leaving his assignment on the perimeter so he can get a rebound. He’s always forcing assists if he hasn’t reached 10 late game. The wizards have a very good team around Westbrook that can bail him out when he’s leading the league in turnovers and among the lowest shooting efficiency in the league.  He’s a talented player but I would absolutely hate to play on his team."
I want to preface this by saying Russell Westbrook is very good at basketball. He is a very bad team defender. He’s can lock people down on individual possessions occasionally. But he’s one of the least disciplined guards defensively that the league has.
"&gt;As does Westbrook when he's surrounded by good players  No, Westbrook is a loser who goes out to stat hunt. Which is why he was knocked out the playoffs 3 straight seasons in the first round when KD left and had to run to Harden just to get to the second. But of course, he didn't have any good players then..despite playing with two other all stars in that time span and a Top 3 MVP candidate  &gt;Sure he never got a ring, but he's been on deep playoff runs  Only with Kevin carrying the way...which is really a boost to Kevin's legacy that he was able to drag this dude to deep playoff runs...considering Russell hasn't done anything worth a damn ever since Kevin left  &gt;To say Westbrook isn't a winner is being an ignorant fan who knows literally nothing about basketball.  No, it's ignorant to suggest that he is...when he's the most obvious statpadder ever. And why he'll never do anything in the playoffs and retire with nothing but triple doubles"
"He's the only one who's admitted to it. LeBron has taken three in the last ten years. Russell ""Never Gives Up On A Play"" Westbrook hasn't taken one since 2018, and hasn't taken more than 2 in a season ever.  Durant took five in Golden State."
The two-time scoring champion Russell Westbrook to be exact. 2015 and in his MVP season in 2017.
"I was at the game last night. Life long Hawks fan, and we all know the away fans can take over the arena in Atlanta.  The Westbrook fans were LOUD! And he was givin an ovation after the triple double and a “Russell, Russell, Russell!” chant started.  It was also a little weird being in an arena for the first time in a while, there’s real crowd noise now, but also some pumped in noise still."

If Russell Westbrook makes the ATO plays what is  Scott Brooks good for?
What does that have to do with Russell Westbrook
"   &gt;Russell Westbrook has been accused over the years of ""padding"" stats by grabbing rebounds from teammates. Offensive rebounds are much harder to fake. This year he is averaging 11.6 total rebounds, vs last years 7.9. But the rub is that his offensive rebounds have dropped from 1.8 to 1.7.  Fantastic analysis and point. Russell Westbrook, 6'3 point guard does not have the 2nd most rebounds in the league. He is tragically being beaten by the likes of 6'10 Jonas Valanciunas and 7'1 Rudy Gobert. It'd be a shame if someone realized that RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS 6'3. Easier to fake? It's ridiculous for a 6'3 Guard to be top 50 in ORebounding, DRebounding is much easier and height is less of a factor."
John Wall (2016-17) and James Harden (2018-19) have both led the league in steals.   Russell Westbrook (2015-16) and Monta Ellis (2012-13) have both come in second.
You can't erase his Thunder history especially on Russell Westbrook day damnit
"Russell Westbrook is amazing. He is one of the most athletic players in the history of the game, and green really knows how to use his body to the fullest. He is a hustle god who is always putting 120% effort. Congrats to him for being #1 for all time triple doubles."
"Russ is the third Russell Westbrook. So his Grandpa is Russ Sr, his dad Russ jr, and he’s Russell Westbrook III"
Russell Westbrook can average a triple double and still find a way to keep his PER under 20 (19.0 as of yesterday) for the season.
"no Russell Westbrook slander will be allowed, enjoyed, or tolerated. at all"

Russell Westbrook is good at basketball.
They should create the Russell Westbrook award for the player who gets the most triple doubles each season.
Russell 'how many rebounds do I have right now' Westbrook
I heard Russell Westbrook was washed this year. Hmm
Russell Westbrook and I'm fucking sick of ya'll acting like it's close. Dude is posting Oscar and Wilt numbers every damn game. Making history every damn game.  And ya'll wanna say Chris Paul cuz you fucking like him and his dumb ass commercials.  It's Russell fucking Westbrook!!

"Respect! Even if some consider him a stat padder, this is still an incredible accomplishment. Congrats to Russell Westbrook!"
This record is summed up by Westbrook missing the go-ahead 3 at the end of the game and eating the L. That's Russell Westbrook's career in a nutshell: empty stats and real L's. First round exit coming right up!
Russell Westbrook is now the ALL-TIME NBA Leader in empty stats
WASHINGTON WIZARDS LEGEND RUSSELL WESTBROOK!!!
Would people still rather have Russ over Reggie in the playoffs now.  Shooting &gt; triple doubles and no shooting.  Both equally bad on defense but one is clutch and the other is Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook smiling right now
All I know is Reggie Jackson is doing things that Russell Westbrook hasn't done in a significant game since 2017.  If we are going back to that thread where 60 idiots downvoted me for saying I'd much rather have Reggie Jackson on the Clippers over Westbrook.  Eat crow idiots.  Playoff Reggie Jackson&gt;Playoff Russ
"The roster couldn’t really compete night in and night out. The spacing was always going to be bad even though they got an uncharacteristically efficient 3P season out of a couple of their young guys.   There was never a world where Bledsoe would return to the bench, and extra tidbit since he’s paid and not competing for a championship he gives even less of a shit then he arguably ever has. Bledsoe was legitimately the least efficient guard playing 26 mpg or more in the whole league this year. Eric Bledsoe is who NBA Twitter thinks Russell Westbrook is.   Pair that with an otherwise fast and loose young team and Adams, who even though he’s still playing really good defense doesn’t fit well with this squad at all, and I don’t get how anything was supposed to fit with this team unless you were expecting Zion to go full Charles Barkley or Ingram to go full KD this year"
"It's seared into my brain because of how much I used to watch the Bill and Jalen stuff, but he also said KD was going to Houston and Russell Westbrook would leave for LA. I think I'm still a little skittish on his predictions because of how wrong that was"
Jason Williams Vince Carter Allen Iverson Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook as the first option. Amazing second option. Even worse than guys like Dame and Giannis as the first option despite having better teammates than those guys.
Westbrook has said he had a 3.9 GPA (good for 6th or 7th in his class) and wanted to go to Stanford but they didn't recruit him for basketball. As far as I can find he's never discussed his SAT scores publicly.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9114915/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-unique-style-the-court-espn-magazine

"Based on their listed positions, you have Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, and Jrue Holiday contending for the two spots in a hypothetical 5th team. One of those players is going to be relegated to the 8th team All-NBA. The guard talent in the NBA is insane right now."
"At first I thought you meant Russell Westbrook and I was about to be mad. I forgot about Bill Russell for a sec, way before my time."
Greek Russell Westbrook
Who's Russell? Westbrook or DLo? If it's Westbrook the he obviously he serves more then booker and Donovan. Westbrook was singlehandedly carrying the Wizards
"Russell Westbrook quite literally made third team all-nba last season and aside from this season and his injury season, has made at least third team every year since 2011."
Giannis shot selection just screams Russell Westbrook. They both take such questionable shots at the worst times.
&gt; Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn’t make the cut:  &gt; Russell Westbrook  the Wizards went 34-38
He has the same number of 1st team selections as Russell Westbrook... let that sink in.
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn’t make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would’ve definitely made it on if he didn’t get injured, maybe he’d have replaced Beal"
"Nah man Westbrook is one of the best playmakers and passers ever, his creation stats are historically great and he did this for a 7 year prime stretch. I think he moreso has troubles to control his explosiveness and momentum at times but when it comes to controlling an offense and increasing his teams efficiency Russell has been elite for a long time.   The only part that's ""low IQ"" is his shot selection and even then you could very well argue that his shot selection was completely fine during his prime because the midrangers and occasional 3s forced the opponents to keep defending him tightly, enabling his lethal drive and kick plays. He has an insanely good feeling for positioning on both ends of the floor which makes him one of the 10 best passers ever and the greatest rebounding guard of all time.   Father time has been creeping up on Westbrook and he's not as consistent anymore, especially when it comes to his midrange shots and 3s. But he's still as great of a passer as anyone in the league. So you may give him the dumb shot selection schtick but Russ is far from being a low IQ player."
"Every aspect of Russell Westbrook coming to, playing in, and leaving Houston has been horrendous. I still remember exactly where I was when I saw the CP3 Russ trade news, a dark day."
"hey, I absolutely loved it when William Rondo was yelling shit at Russell Westbrook in the bubble"
"Imagine if you threw in, say, Russell Westbrook"
"They can make an exception for MVP being “the best player on one of the best teams” so Russell Westbrook can win one, but won’t make an exception for “Finals MVP is the best player on the winning team” for Lebron. Smh."
"[This was the first result when I googled Pat Bev Westbrook’s knees. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2018/10/31/patrick-beverley-crashes-into-russell-westbrooks-knees-again-westbrook-was-hot/amp/) Crazy how he happens to collide with the same player’s knees multiple times after already ending his season once. It’s one thing to go for the ball and having it happen once, it’s another to have it happen multiple times. Defense is one thing but you can’t be recklessly diving after the ball like that without regard for other players."
"I do watch the games and in their entirety. I think this criticism against Westbrook has been a bit harsh. He's done things no one in the NBA has ever done:[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n6odv0/russell\_westbrook\_is\_the\_first\_player\_in\_nba/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n6odv0/russell_westbrook_is_the_first_player_in_nba/)  Along with that he's had plenty of efficient games this season: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mxaoof/russell\_westbrook\_tonight\_371111\_on\_1423\_shooting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mxaoof/russell_westbrook_tonight_371111_on_1423_shooting/)  I watched that game and he completely took over\^. In that game he was responsible for 60 points(through his own points and assists) on great efficiency. That was a game where the stat line doesn't represent how good Westbrook was. Westbrook's problem is that he's probably the most hot and cold player in the league. He can play a very efficient game and take over with minimal turnovers, but then he completely goes the opposite direction. I don't know why he's like that and it could be due to injuries this season.  Either way I don't think it's absurd to think him at his best was top 10 this season and many people were complimenting Westbrook this season. Granted that's all sports, there's always a pendulum swing when someone does bad, and his performance in the playoffs was bad, but not his overall season"

No no it's all Knicks bias and much worse than Russell Westbrook getting a vote
"Not saying give up just know your fucking role. This is Russell Westbrook we talking about here, and at his peak."
"Nah lol Reggie really thought he was good 😂. Good to have confidence but don't oversell come on now Russell Westbrook here, I can see if it's ish Smith or somebody starting."
I hate CJ after these 2021 playoffs but he must be really good to be above Jamal and Russell Westbrook. So I must have missed his season with triple doubles and 3-1 comebacks.
Mike James about to do his best Russell Westbrook impersonation and steal shots from KD LMAO  \#cantwinwiththesecats
He will forever be lucky that Russell Westbrook exists
Not just big guys. Russell Westbrook regularly intentionally fouls after not getting a call so that he can continue to dress down the refs for their foolishness. I've never seen anything like it.
Lead the team like what an MVP does. Russell westbrook took a game of the rockets in 2017 despite having an  arguably worst roster than jokic right now.
1. Herro  2. Luka  3. Pritchard  4. Marcus Smart  5. Melrose Place  6. Jokic  7. 87-year old Bill Russell  8. KD  9. Lebron  10. Curry  11. Harden  ---  t-last. Westbrook   t-last. Peak Chamberlain
They give Chris Paul the same shot. That ain't Russell Westbrook. Blitz him.
"Lets do another Russell since you didnt like the first.  Russell Westbrook.  I dont need to deflect anything, though I appreciate the fact that you admitted you were doing it."
"KD, PJ Tucker, and Russell Westbrook in Washington"
Durant only made it as far as he did in OKC because he had Alpha Russell Westbrook
The Sixers wont survive when Russell Westbrook runs down the tunnel in the 3rd of the next game and puts Seth Curry in a DDP Diamond Cutter
"I did, and I certainly wouldn’t call him a great defender, that he’s had playoff success, or that he takes good shots. Yes, he shoots open threes. Every player does.   Youre batshit insane if you think Reggie Jackson &gt; Russell Westbrook lmao   I’m one of Reggie’s biggest fans by the way. I truly believe he’d have been an all-star PG if not for his injury. Now he has the same balls-to-the-wall extreme confidence without the same skill to match it."
"Forreal. Bad owners don't  deserve blind loyalty  from players. I'd feel bad if organizations actually tried to win and their guys left, but Houston wasted so many years of Harden because he was a guaranteed playoff berth no matter what.  &amp;#x200B;  People love to act like they did him a favor by getting him Dwight fucking Howard and Russell Westbrook, but the only championship team they put around him was 2018 and even then they had moves to make with the Ryan Anderson contract. They could've attached the picks they used to get WB to that contract in 2018 and gotten a legitimately good player to play alongside him and CP3. Instead, they kept it all and Ryan Anderson collected DNPs against the Warriors.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd rather see elite players go deep in the playoffs than be stuck with shitty orgs."
"&gt;	Giannis had insane traditional and advanced stats.   And maybe the stats are wrong if they’re attaining value to a limited player.   Russell Westbrook broke VORP until they changed it once they realized that they had value wrong.   If he flames out again in the playoffs, he’d have to dramatically improve one facet of his game to win another MVP(free throws, 3p%, post up)."
"It's a good thing you aren't a GM of a winning team like the Celtics, Sixers, Nuggets, etc. If you legitimately believe that a GM would prefer Russell Westbrook over Danny Green on any team above a .600 winning rate, you're delusional."
"You’re going to have to cite what you’re claiming. Nowhere have I seen that Kawhi wanted to sign with PG right off the bat and that he even talked to the Raptors about trading for PG.  This is all I’ve found:   &gt;	Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reported the Thunder ""asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""  Toronto was not trying to trade for PG, and Kawhi did not ask them to. Sam Presti was attempting to start a bidding war to get more from the Clippers. Source: https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html  I just gave you a source directly from Doc Rivers mouth that the timeline goes 1) the Clippers wanted to sign Kawhi, 2) Kawhi tells them they have to make roster changes for him to sign, 3) the Clips give him a list, 4) Kawhi chooses PG, 5) they trade for PG, and then 6) Kawhi signs. That *is* Kawhi forcing them to trade for PG. Forcing someone to do something can just mean to coerce them. It’s not necessarily through violent means."
"Ok I’ll give u my top 15 so u can see how.  1. MJ 2. KAJ 3. Lebron  4. Magic 5. Russell 6. Bird 7. Wilt 8. Duncan 9. Shaq 10. Kobe 11. Olajuwon 12. Durant 13. Moses Malone 14. Curry 15. Pettit  So in reality he’s not over Hakeem or KD. So let’s go through it. Pettit, 11 years 10 all NBA first team, second team once. Averaged 26 and 16 for his career. He won 2 MVPs in an era where Bill Russell was by far the best in the world and won 5 MVPs. He beat the Celtics in the 58 finals dropping a record 50 in a close out game 6 and winning finals MVP in the finals. Then the Celtics went on to win every title from 1959 to 1966, 8 in a row, in fact from 1957 to 1969 a 13 year stretch only 2 teams ever beat the Celtics. Pettit with the Hawks and Wilt with the sixers that’s how good Pettit was.   Now let’s talk about some guys u mentioned. West never won an MVP, and only got 1 ring despite playing with the likes of Baylor, Wilt etc. He didn’t win finals MVP that year either. Karl Malone, never won a ring but matched Bob with 2 MVPs he also played with Stockton tho and didn’t average as good numbers, nor was he making all NBA first teams as consistently as Pettit. Although Malone is a beast and he’s only barely behind Pettit on my all time list.   I suppose the way I’d sum it up is. Give me 15 players who can boast a better resume than: 11 seasons, 10 all NBA first team, 2 MVPs, 1 FMVP and 26 and 16 for their career and acc won a ring, 1 of only 2 teams, in the Celtics era which is the most dominant dynasty in American team sports.   Also for the point guards this is my list:  1. Magic 2. Curry 3. Big O 4. IT 5. CP3 6. Stockton 7. Nash 8. Frazier 9. Westbrook 10. Payton/Cousy   Also I agree with your opinion. KD is already on the precipice imo. If he wins this year with a finals MVP, he will have won more titles as “the man” than Kobe did. Kobe won 2. But I think KD could do with an MVP or 2 to really separate from Kobe and enter that discussion with the Larry bird for number 2 SF ever  Then Kidd would be 12th but after Stockton from 7th till 12th it’s super super close for me could have either guy 7th or 12th just depends what u prefer."
"Yeah I would have agreed with this but as someone else pointed out Melo exists, as does Russell Westbrook."
"The only other team you mentioned, aside from the Warriors (who were much deeper and defined than suggested here, both through the draft and trades/free agency (Igoudala/Livingston) alike) would have been the Lob City crew in LA. They did use a traditional 1-5 approach and they were not successful. To try and understand why would merely result in conjecture, but there were always conversations of the lack of buy in all around, which ultimately led to their lack of championship level success. So, yes, in the context of Lob City, you are correct.  I never faulted the pre-KD Warriors, and in fact applaud their success of building a winning franchise without purchasing the championship. The KD era Warriors, however, are a much different story. We all know the why there. I was simply trying to give the Warriors more credit. They are the reason why the vast majority of teams left the traditional 1-5 positional approach, and why the game now focuses so heavily on the perimeter. Everyone wants to be the next Steph Curry (see Trae Young/Dame Lillard).   My statement was that for teams who are looking to rebuild, the 1-5 model would be an ideal start. More often than not, we get the idea that teams should draft the best available players and hope they work. That is a very backwards approach to building a team. OKC has SGA as their primary athlete, and they will build their roster around him. My concern as a Thunder fan is that it creates Russell Westbrook era part two."
Adding Russell Westbrook will discredit your list
"throw Gary Payton, Russell Westbrook, and Jerry West and that's honestly a fairly compelling argument."
"Listen, you are probably a great fan and there are lots of great Philly fans out there, but Philly has the reputation it does for very good reasons. There are so many stories even just within the past 15-20 years not even going back to the old ""they booed Santa"" story.   Most Philly fans aren't in denial about how bad it is. It's not ""national media,"" [the local media knows it too.](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/russell-westbrook-popcorn-philly-fans-76ers-wizards-game-2-20210527.html) And the way you're reacting is **exactly** how every Philly fan denier I've ever seen has reacted to it, ""look, all fans are bad it's not just us!"" Which isn't true, sure there are cases all around the world where fans have been terrible, but Philadelphia earned it's reputation and hit has nothing to do with superiority."

Russell Westbrook: “Hold my beer...”

Jesus.  If you are basing your coaching decisions on what Russell Westbrook wants you might as well not own a team.
If Russell Westbrook is the difference between firing your inept coach or not you need to completely reevaluate your organization
"Yea, if only they had a real center to neutralize Gobert like P.J. Tucker or Russell Westbrook."
"“Wrecking their future”…. I don’t mean to be negative man. I love watching Damian Lillard play, but if his best achievement is causing a 1st round exit for the Thunder only to lose in the 2nd round then that sucks… I know you guys love him, but from an outsiders perspective it seems like he’s your Russell Westbrook. Like it might be time to let him go and rebuild if you guys want a ring and he wants a ring. Again, that’s an outsiders POV, so I could be wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️"

"You do realize he was the first rookie ever to lead his team in scoring and win a playoff series right?  And he did it over MVP Russell Westbrook and Paul George (jazz own Paul George and I love it but that's a whole other thing, I just like pooping on him)  He's always been this good (unless he's playing the rockets lol)  And bro wade is literally over there in-game coaching Mitchell. No reason for you not to be happy,as a heat fan, that he's passing on what he can to someone else. Donno's wade plus a 3 pt shot (miles to go to catch up to wade on D though)"

No one telling him to stop shooting 3s so he became Russell Westbrook
Is Giannis approaching Russell Westbrook attempts in 3 pointers?
"Serious question, not trying to dog you. How can you so casually say that in a league with Lebron, Westbrook, Giannis, Zion, LaVine, etc. that Russell would ""immediately be the best athlete in the league?"""
"Logan's All-NBA Second Team ballot from last year:  * Leonard, Kawhi  * Ingram, Brandon (only 2nd team vote) * Drummond, Andre  (only vote)  * Westbrook Russell (one of 9 2nd team votes) * Young, Trae (only second team vote)  He had Booker and Beal on his Third Team, leaving Lillard and CP3 entirely off his ballot. He also gave LaVine his only vote, leaving off Tatum and Butler."

"what does that have to do with you saying he carried a team alone? Im not dismissing his MVP, but dude said he’s never seen him carry a team and you chimed in saying he had Reggie Jackson as his number 2 and lead OKC to 50 wins.   That’s disingenuous.  I simply pointed out Russell Westbrook was available for 46 of the games that season.  and he played that postseason"
"He was on a team that started Kendrick Perkins, Thabo Sefolosha, Russell Westbrook and Ibaka before he started shooting 3's.  Tobi Harris, Josh Richardson and Horford are basically the Curry brothers compared to that. When Westbrook and KD go into the HOF we should talk about those line ups before any other accomplishments lol"
"Russell Westbrook, dude gives his all no matter what, whether he puts up 40 or puts up 14, efficient or not, he never stops going. Most athletic player I've ever seen"
If Oscar is up there shouldn’t Russell Westbrook be there too?

We traded this motherfucker and four freaking picks for goddamn Russell Westbrook.   &amp;#x200B;  The Lillard and Stockton shots are the only times I've ever been more upset with this team.

"I'm curious, why?   The league enforced dress code in order to improve the professional image of the League, but things are different now, for example Russell Westbrook. Coaches during practice or team meetings aren't in suits, but its not like they're wearing tanktops during gametime either."
"“I guess after 60 we probably could have made the change. We liked what Ben was doing as a roamer tonight, off of (Russell) Westbrook. They’ve been able to run. We thought it would allow him to get a lot of rebounds and push the break. We felt strongly that we can get a lot of easy baskets. So that part of it worked. The other part didn’t.”....Doc's GP was busted that game. Ben always shuts down his assignment.  Praying for a sixers/jazz finals matchup so we see who gets exposed."
"Blake Griffin is definitely the type of dude to pick her up, but Lana Rhoades said the guy is a libra. KD is the only libra on the Nets  Anyways, why did you reply this to someone talking about Russell Westbrook? Makes people think Westbrook has something to do with her"

Steve Nash and Baron Davis need to get back to film making the together and document this.

"$24m is a fucking bargain for a guy who still the best help defender in the league, one of the best overall defenders in the league, a guy who isn't just a great individual defender but tells his whole team where to be, calls out sets and coverages, etc.   It's a fucking bargain when that guy is also one of the best passing/play-making bigs in the league, not that far from LeBron in assist percentage (i.e. he's the guy racking up most of the assists while on the floor, helped by some Curry gravity of course).   Would you rather be paying...  $27.5m for Al Horford?  $31m for Kevin Love?  $28.5m for Otto Porter?  $19.2 for Gary Harris?  $36.6m for Blake Griffin (his salary this season before being bought out)  $15m for Andre Iguodala?  $17m for Rickey Rubio?  $24m for LMA, his salary before his heart issues forced him into early retirement?  Here, I'll even get controversial, is Russell Westbrook at $41m really more valuable than Draymond at $24m?  Draymond's extension was 100% team friendly."
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings.

Your argument is that Scott Brooks &amp; Russell Westbrook were responsible for KD’s early successes?
I'm just going to go ahead and blame a lot of that on Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;KD never disrespectful of other baller.  When asked to list the top 5 players he's ever played with he picked Serge Ibaka over Russell Westbrook.  Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Serge Ibaka  Serge was on the team when he roasted it with the burner account saying him and Russ were the only good players and ""he couldn't win with those cats.""   KD has absolutely disrespected other ballers."
"Russell Westbrook deserves 3rd team all nba this year, Porzingis is a lot better than how he is treated in this sub, and Andre Drummond is a good center and the idea that he clogs the paint is vastly overstated. You do not need a floor spacing center either.  Edit: Also there is not a single person in this sub that is able to evaluate coaching effectively."
"Just out of curiosity, how much did you watch Iverson in the late 90s/early 2000s? Honest question.   I think a lot of people look back at those shooting percentages and wince, but the league-wide eFG% in 2001 was 47% and this year it was 54% (hence why Iverson’s career eFG relative to league average is actually higher than Westbrook’s)  I’m not sure if fans have really internalized the fact that teams average 17 more points game than they did 20 years ago. Iverson’s 31.4 ppg in 2001 would be ~ 37 ppg adjusted for 2020.  I’m biased, since the Iverson era in Philly is what got me into watching basketball. I love watching Russell Westbrook too — big fan, I think he’s terrific. Maybe I just have a soft spot for feisty and inefficient chuckers.  I think they’re actually not that dissimilar as players, considering how idiosyncratic their games are."

"Man yall REALLY hate Russell Westbrook, wow"
He got trapped/double almost every single play in the 4th quarters. Would've been so many open shots that would've been generated from Harden if it wasn't Russell Westbrook there to brick the shots.
"And i said ""has to share the court with russell westbrook"" i know your heated about last night but at least take your time and read it lmaoooo"
Yep lmaooo it only gets worse for your team when lebron comes back and he has to share the court with Russell westbrook i know your a fan of the team so i won't throw any stats at you when they share the court you'll just say im ignorant but maybe i am wrong maybe russ will start shooting average at 33 maybe he'll stop running into 4 defenders and passing it to the crowd i dont know maybe he'll play some defense who knows lmaooo
Depends. Some guys are pretty good like k love and others are just too weird like Russell Westbrook.
I'ma be real if you don't take russ i think you bring back dennis for a 1 year and they were bringing back rondo anyway and im guessing they keep kcp nunn and malik i don't know... But even when it gets to the preseason you still have to play russell westbrook
Turns out Russell Westbrook is a little bitch then.
Why can’t Russell Westbrook just play normal?
That means Russell Westbrook should *NOT* come off the bench. Case closed.

Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons are just the different sides of the same coin. Both can’t be counted on to win or play good in the playoffs at this point in time.
Russell Westbrook. Some of his fans seem completely unwilling to admit he has any shortcoming whatsoever.

"Lol, bro it’s a trash stat  It tries to take stuff out the box score and combine it all w some arbitrary weights  The correlation doesn’t mean it’s good. Good players will naturally have good PERs because they….fill the box score up.   Russell Westbrook has a higher career PER than KG. David Robinson has a higher career PER than Kareem. What am i supposed to do with that ?   PER is just something to look at."
"Who tf is Russell Westbrook, of all the players in the NBA, to get mad at someone for showboating? His entire career is one big showboat act. And that’s okay because it’s still the entertainment business at the end of the day.   But for real dude, you guys half assed that inbound pass and you deserve to have it thrown in your face. It’s basketball ffs."

"Apparently he does want to bring them to basketball:  [""In the game of basketball, there's certain things you just don't do. Like in baseball, you don't flip the bat""](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32492565/russell-westbrook-ejection-caps-los-angeles-lakers-loss-oklahoma-city-thunder-blowing-26-point-lead)"
"Russell Westbrook has a 136 to 45 win loss record when recording a triple double (I don't think this include this year, so give or take one or two losses). Meaning his team wins over 70% of the time he has a triple double. I don't think you can make the argument that Russ getting a tri dub does not correlate to winning because the sample size is huge. In a given season if the static holds and Russ gets 82 triple doubles his team would win roughly 56 games. Obviously he will not get one every game, but the idea is that the more games he has one the higher chance that his team wins. Heck the Lakers barely lost last night. It was a 3 point game with 4 seconds left, so Russ even though he is an inefficient scorer and a TO machine he still kept the Lakers in the game."
People who agree with Russell Westbrook’s take: Russell Westbrook. People who agree with Thompson’s take: the rest of the world

Russell Westbrook wouldn’t seeing as he’s done it before
"I know Russell Westbrook like I know myself. All of the flaws turned up to 11 and the positives are dwarfed by an eternal echo of the worst moments imaginable. But sometimes, the victories are too great to toss into the shadow called luck."
"“There he goes.” Carmelo Anthony gave a look of absolute disinterest. Dwight Howard yelled “Is it still the preseason?” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Laker star Russell Westbrook put on skinny jeans and Urkel suspenders &amp; said, “Did I do that?.”"
Russell Westbrook on $44m a year (more than LeBron lol) is daylight fraud
People love the *concept* of Russell Westbrook.
"John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love and at a stretch Kristaps Porzingis are some of the worst contracts today."
"Russell Westbrook is only 14 games away (at the current rate) from passing 4000 career turnovers and moving into the 5th spot above Jason Kidd. He sits with 3,893 after tonights game.  1 more game and he overtakes Kobe Bryant for the 4th spot on the all time leader-board for turnovers.  He still trails, John Stockton with 4,244, Karl Malone with 4,524, and Lebron James with 4,592.  Although of course Lebron is still playing... so who knows if he'll actually catch up. LBJ is averaging 4.0 TOV per game and Russ averaging 6.0, it depends on how many games these guys play in the remainder of their careers."
Carmelo Anthony shot worst than Russell Westbrook from 3. Think about that.
Russell Westbrook will never be an NBA champion.
Russell Westbrook makes Josh Smith look like Ben Simmons
" [Spears] LeBron James yelled, “What the fuck?!” Carmelo Anthony gave a look of expected disappointment. Russell Westbrook belted, “I’ve got an [expletive] ejection now.” And before Anthony Davis hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star and living human being Kobe Bryant hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all disrespect my franchise.”"
Why do people still defend Russell Westbrook?
Why is Russell Westbrook shooting the game tying 3?????
Allen Iverson has a career PPG of 26.7 on 51.8% TS (-1 rTS).  Russell Westbrook has a career PPG of 23.2 on 52.8% TS (-1.9 rTS).  Iverson &gt; Russ in efficiency lol  Worst MVP in NBA history. It completely undermined the value of the award + cheapened the league. No wonder ratings are down

"Lmao can’t believe Lakers gave up KCP, Trez, Kuz n picks for this scrub   Russell Westbrook did not belong on the Top 75. He’s not even a Top 25 PG lol  Magic, Steph, IT, Kidd, CP3, Nash, Frazier, GP, Big O, and Stockton . Cousy, AI, Archibald, D Rose, TP, Wilkens, Bing, Billups, Kyrie, Dame , Penny, FAT lever, KJ, Tim Hardaway, Moncrief"
"Honestly I think Westbrook has ADHD. As someone who has it, he reminds me a lot of how I play most sports. Not just basketball, like I'll make super smart and careful decisions when I'm playing pool, and next shot I go for some hero shot that is absolutely out of my skill level and it absolutely ruins my entire table. I notice this in a lot of aspects of my life.  No way he can make brilliant decisions one second and stupid ones the next. He's not like JR Smith or Nick Young, where it's constant stupidity. Russell ranges from one of the smartest basketball players to touch a ball one play to becoming JR Smith the very next.  And his stupidity is usually just not making the careful play and trying to go for the hero high risk play."
"No, his stats have been effected by him shooting like Russell Westbrook lol. You’re trying to talk shit but you clearly got no idea"
Russell Westbrook with the very rare +/- (-12) Triple Double!
The Russell Westbrook Quadruple Double tho
"Russell Westbrook had a quadruple double. 20 points, 13 assists, 14 rebounds AND 10 turnovers!"
Why do people like Russell Westbrook?  He's a self centered asshole
"Thunder sleeper agent, Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook with his patented Triple Double while +/- (-12)
"We were up 26 at one point. Up 26, and we blew the lead. I can’t wait to watch Skip Bayless absolutely crucify us (and Westbrook), but he’ll be right to do so…sigh. Russell Westbrook finishes with 20, 14, 13, and 10 TO. How the fuck do you have 10 turnovers in a game?  I’ve got nothing else to add. What a fucking disgrace."
did you know governor newsom signed an emergency law into effect saying that russell westbrook is not allowed to have consecutive good games  if only that recall had gone through the lakers might have had a chance this season
*russell westbrook
"Russell Westbrook triple double and a loss, name a more iconic duo."
This is such a Russell Westbrook game.
Russell Westbrook gets mad at taller Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook with the quadruple double!
"Oh for sure, he’s sitting in his office rn like “man this russell westbrook dude always fucking me.”"
Russell Westbrook recorded a historic quadruple double.  20/14/13 with 10 turnovers.
Sam Presti about as mad as Russell Westbrook rn lmao
Sam Presti about as pissed off as Russell Westbrook right now
How does Russell Westbrook not understand that he can't shoot? Him bricking 5 threes in the 4Q is what lost this game
Russell Westbrook is just Smush Parker with an adderall prescription
Russell Westbrook with a Quadruple Double!
Can't believe we witnessed history today  Russell Westbrook quadruple double

"THE RUSSELL WESTBROOK EXPERIENCE, he’s so bad LMAOOOOO"
I’m curious what this sub thinks.  Would you guys rather have Jason Kidd or Russell Westbrook?
"Russell Westbrook had **33 points** last night too  Idk if you heard, was expecting a post"
"You know someone lost an argument when they're being a douchebag for no reason. I was just trying to objectively talk to you about the differences between Wade and Westbrook and you obviously took it so personally because you're a Russell Westbrook Dick Rider.  Hey dumbass how about you actually look at the percentages I provided you? I know you are dense but it really is not that hard to look at the percentages. Again I am not comparing Wade and Westbrook career shooting percentage. I am comparing Wade's shooting percentages in the years that he played with LeBron, because that is the most relevant years to this discussion. Second off you are using entirely different shooting ranges than the ones I provided you. The ranges you provided have a bigger reference range of distance.  I know you have a hard time with comprehension but it really is not a few percentage points. I literally just explain to my post above the difference and percentage points and you can see the difference in shooting efficiency. They are close and two shot ranges but at 5 to 9 ft and 20 to 24 ft Dwyane Wade is a much better shooter than Russell Westbrook.  Hey dumbass again I am bringing up defense because it is relevant to the overall fit of one player to another. My point was that Wade was a much better overall player and that is why despite him not being the best shooter in the NBA, he could still make it work with LeBron because he's better on offense, defense, off-ball movement, ball security, etc.   Bro that is the entire point of me responding to you. I am just telling you my personal opinion of how I don't think Westbrook is 100% the best comparison to Wade, despite them being / heavy guards who aren't the best shooters. Miami LeBron was much better back then and despite Westbrook and Wade sharing some similarities"
There was literally a post on front page before we played the warriors about how Jordan Poole &gt; Russell Westbrook
Russell “Pat Beverly” Westbrook
"How good Russell was in his 2012-2017 prime is a reasonable discussion. He was very good.   But he hasn't posted all-NBA-type numbers in many years now. If you look at current max guys by salary, I'd say they only people in the top 30 who are probably lower value on the court than Westbrook, right now, are John Wall,  Wiggins, Love. Maybe Simmons, but there's no way PHI would trade Simmons for Westbrook right now."
Russell Westbrook shooting 3’s better than Dame.
"&gt; Why get Russell Westbrook on the team if you’re not going to do what he does best, which is push the pace and play-make/score in transition?  I agree man"
"Russell Westbrook got me into basketball. Him playing well is good for the league imo. Go get it, Brodie."
"No one needs to. Someone just needs to convince the geezers on the Lakers to actually run when Russ pushes in transition. This was the first game where the rest of the team played at Russ’s pace, and they looked so much better offensively. Before Russ was pushing, no one would run, then they would go into some super slow, very little ball movement ISO ball and take a bad shot. It got a little better during the Suns game, and then much better in this game.  Why get Russell Westbrook on the team if you’re not going to do what he does best, which is push the pace and play-make/score in transition? I don’t know how many times I had to watch Melo, Lebron, and even AD jog back while they could have had a fast break situation with only one or two defenders back, only for Russ to get to the other end of the court with no help during the Warriors game."
"Russell Westbrook over his career is a net positive playoff player,and his most recent playoff series for the Wizards was a good performance from him even if his FG% was mediocre"

Russell Westbrook is not a good basketball player. Any team would improve by replacing him with an average replacement player.
Russell Westbrook
"To be fair, most ""haters"" basically said that LeBron was the reason Russ was doing horrible and you can't deny they were right.  Russell Westbrook can't be a third wheel and can't be a role players, he has to be the focal point. It will go back to what it was when LeGM returns."
"Yeah but he didn't really start that nor make it popular tho because many players did that before him? Shit Russell Westbrook use to or still do that ""I want to kill you"" mug after a mean dunk but I cant call it iconic"
Russell Westbrook lol
RUSSELL WESTBROOK SLANDER IS NOT ALLOWED!!!
"I actually think [this article](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-pick-and-roll-shows-promise-in-lakers-crunch-time-win-over-grizzlies/) did a pretty good job of breaking down how they can potentially make the 'big 3' all work together on the floor.   Main idea was using different variations of the Russ/Lebron PnR (which they used for the first time end of last game). Taking advantage of their passing ability inside, with having AD in the dunker's spot + an outside shootert. Difficult to pull off, but definitely better than Russ aimlessly standing around because his outside shot isn't respected"
"Great win, we didn’t quit, and kept the intensity.  **Positives**: Russell Westbrook (33,10,8) and Anthony Davis (35 and 17) had big games. R. Westbrook especially made a couple of important baskets down the stretch. Malik Monk was solid also. We didn’t give up mentally overall down the stretch.  **Negatives**: We have clear defensive issues. We were making Jakob Peotl look like the second coming of George Mikan out there, it was ridiculous. We gotta defend the pick and roll a bit better. Also, we need to do a better job rebounding. We need to go back to the fundamental point of boxing out. We have been giving up too many offensive rebounds, which lead to second chance points (16 to 9 for SAS today), and with the size we have, we have no excuses for this to happen. Finally, we struggled from 3 (26%). LeBron has been our best shooter from 3, and his absence was felt in this area today."
"if they let Andre Drummond start, they're not going to ask Russell Westbrook to come off the bench that's absurd"
"That sounds nice in theory but in practice the super maxed guy is now untradeable. And I’m sure that sounds nice at first too but what happens when you’re left holding the bag with John Wall or Russell Westbrook? Those deals might not even be moveable for each other under current cap rules, and NBA cap rules are already pretty Byzantine."
"Enjoy the Russell Westbrook Experience, Laker fans"
"Welcome to the roller coaster that is Russell Westbrook, Lakers fans"
this is just verifiably wrong  [Brandley Beal on/off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/231/onoff#tab-team_efficiency)  [Russell Westbrook on/off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/3914/onoff#tab-team_efficiency)  the wiz were 4.1 points better per 100 possessions with Beal on the floor. they were 0.6 points better with russ on the floor - and that's even with his strong finish. it's really not even close.
Russell Westbrook had 33-10-8 and people in the Lakers sub were still shitting on him and calling him Westbrick. Sometimes I am embarassed to be associated with other Laker fans
"Russell Westbrook best game in a Lakers uniform, but that one guy who keeps posting Westbrook negative stat posts:  Russell Westbrook: 40 minutes, 3 turnovers, 5 fouls, +1 +/-"
WELCOME TO THE RUSSELL WESTBROOK SHOW
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12547769/russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-loses-triple-double  🤡🤡🤡
Russell Westbrook last year should have been an all star on the simple fact that he had built up enough street cred to get in despite the slow start. There was no benefit of the doubt given. It’s crazy that he averaged 22-12-12 last season  and didn’t make the all star game or all NBA. People in 20 years will look at that and think he’s on of the biggest snubs of all time.
Russell Westbrook is a all star this season
Russell Westbrook
HOU traded Chris Paul and a fountain of picks for Russell Westbrook
"Bullshit. Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, and Rajon Rondo are all on the active roster.  That right there is more star power than the entire Kings team, meanwhile we're missing Harrison Barnes and (much less importantly) Marvin Bagley."
Very lame of the league to take away a cool moment because a clip went around on social media. How many bullshit rebounds have been given to Russell Westbrook over the years.
Russell Westbrook masterclass incoming
Right now it’s probably at the level of the John Wall/Russell Westbrook contracts.
"When they faced the Raptors, Celtics and Hawks. The top 2 teams in the west are on pace for 70 wins each atm. Also, none of his previous teams had the fantastic playoff performer of Russell Westbrook."
Imagine a team with Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis only favored by 1 against the Kings.
"Isaiah steward vs lebron to settle it once and for all. Knowing Adam silver, Russell Westbrook will be special ref"
"If anything it's his most underrated problem. He averaged 3.3-3.4 turnovers per game throughout the last 2 seasons, which may not seem like a lot, but it's safe to assume his time with the ball is much lower than, say, Russell Westbrook.  Last year his turnovers were a huge reason his team got booted out of the playoffs despite him putting up 39 points in the playin. 39 points is a lot, but he was very, very inefficient in his production that game, with 7 turnovers.  Considering his ball with time is so low, and if you watched the game, Steph is a really sloppy and careless passer at times, like against the grizzlies. I just can't call him elite when that means putting him in the same category as Jokic and CP3 (LeBron and Harden too, but they're having down years)"
Jordan Poole was close with 4.6 attempts and 27.8% his rookie campaign.  Also Russell Westbrook was at 25.8% and 3.7 attempts with Houston 19-20.  Unfortunately Play Index on Bref has a pay wall so that's the best I can do to figure out why they are somewhat arbitrarily using 4 3pta and 26%
"Russell Westbrook. Would have had Hield instead, and by not paying him $40+ million we would have been able to keep Caruso"
Avery Bradley is who Russell Westbrook thinks Patrick Beverly is
Russell Westbrook calling his agent to see how he can get on the rockets
"Anything about Russell Westbrook.   I love Russ but it's impossible to debate around him in this sub, worst stans and worst haters in basketball, there is no great area with him here it's really tiring, no context, nothing he's either some misunderstood hero or basically a demon sent to earth to destroy basketball"
This is the type of article you expect to see after 2 good games. All kidding aside he’s on a great contract. Lakers would solve a lot of issues with Woods spacing too if rockets were interested in the young Russell Westbrook THT
Just checked. WOW. That's Rookie Russell Westbrook tier
“ White Russell Westbrook “ Lmfaoo what?
I certainly don't love him but I definitely don't hate Russell Westbrook and James Harden like I used to
"That is true, but all things being equal, anyone who is good enough to become an all star would want to win a championship over being an all star.   Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, AD before he joined the Lakers, Russell Westbrook, Karl Malone, etc. These guys are known as all time greats who have never won a championship."
Russell Westbrook
"I don’t think so tbh.  The Jay’s are literally the two arms of Brickexodia, alongside elites such as Jimmy Butler, Pre-ASB Russell Westbrook, and wide open Steph Curry.  They’re still great shooters, but just literally prone to the most streaky and inefficient shot jacking I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching. What other duo could combine for like 7/33 we’ve seen the Celtics manage."
"When you add Russell Westbrook to the mix, the chances of leading drastic go down"
[Not my observation](https://www.si.com/nba/rockets/features/russell-westbrook-reformation-changed-rockets-season)
Be better than prime Russell Westbrook
Dejounte Murray and Russell Westbrook maybe
"He's also not top 2 in APG. He's 5th in PPG and 3rd in APG. You used totals purely to be misleading.  &gt; how often do players do that?  All the time? Luka was 5th and 5th in points and assists last year, for example. Jokic was 12th, 9th, and 6th in points, rebs, and assists.  The prior year Luka was 6th and 3rd in pts and assists. Damian Lillard was 3rd and 5th in the same categories.  Every year you have a top point guard end up near the top in both points and assists. In 2014, Russell Westbrook was 1st in points and 4th in assists. In 1972, Tiny Archibald led the league in both points and assists."
"I know, but we shouldn't be struggling to beat lottery teams when we have Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.   Hell, even with Bron we struggle against them lol."
I LOVE RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"a team with lebron james, anthony davis, and russell westbrook just scored 23 points against the worst team in basketball...  what's even weirder is that the pistons shot 39% from the field while the lakers shot 49% and they're only up 2 wtf is going on lol"
"Just a weird way of phrasing that his athleticism won’t be enough to stay in front NBA point guards. At the time, point guard was arguably the most athletic position in the league, with prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Deron Williams, among others.   Curry definitely ended up being faster than anyone expected him to be, especially after putting a lot of work into his body. And the point guard position slowed down, with less of an emphasis on relentless slashing."
They have Russell Westbrook on their team. They’re not winning a title.
"The small markets usually have to over pay a little. Not surprised, but this.   Russell westbrook and dejounte Murray. 19 8 8. Westbrook 20.8.9.   41million westbrook and Murray 18 million.   Another one is pascal siakam. 17 7 3 for 31 million dollars. Kristaps gets cloned but averages better as a second option. Same contract    The raptors rookie is 2 points shy of their star player lol. Everything else better."
"&gt; You can’t run a successful offense out of the post every play without disengaging every other player and sterilizing the offense when Bron is off the floor since there’s no other creators.  Sounds like the solution was to get a good backup point guard and otherwise keep the team relatively similar, not trade the entire team for Russell Westbrook and then sign a bunch of geriatrics."
"Anthony Davis  yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Carmelo Anthony gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Russell Westbrook  yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
I can't judge anyone who had to play with Russell Westbrook his whole career.
"Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony. All examples of superstars who had declined heavily by 32. How good you were at your peak has nothing to do with how you'll age."
This is what Russell Westbrook would call a good game.
"I mean, if this was the Lakers, and Russell Westbrook said it, sure - but sadly, nobody expects or cares if the Wolves are good, so clowning them isn't worth it."
*Russell Westbrook has entered the chat*
"text:  #Is Harden finished?  KD left okc because of Russell Westbrook and now finds himself in Brooklyn alongside a fatter Russell Westbrook. Scoring use to be so easy for harden, but now he struggles to get to the rim. He’s unable to get the separation he use too and looks bad from beyond the arc. I think the guy is finished."
"James ""Russell Westbrook"" Harden"
"Lowry may have played down to the competition in early playoff rounds due to  rust from late season injuries, but was quite good against the cavs  Demar on the other hand was his same old self against the cavs, running into traffic looking for a foul rather than a bucket, and then getting the russell Westbrook treatment off the ball  Demars way better as a spur and as a bull for sure, but this notion that demar= lowry is incorrect"
"Look, as a Thunder fan who watched him for around 5 years in OKC, if your jump shooting ability is worse than 33-year-old Russell Westbrook then something’s gone horribly, horribly wrong."
So you won’t mention Russell Westbrook being a turnover machine and just careless. I like how your being critical of Lebron when he hasn’t been playing as bad as anyone else.
"The Lakers went 4-6 in those 10 games, 1 less win than your team has the entire season so far. For context, the San Antonio Spurs went 3-7 in their last 10 with a big loss to the aforementioned Lakers and Russell Westbrook."
I was ironic about the working out with Russell Westbrook. Ironically considered an hardworker while never improving a single basketball skill I 13 years.
They decided Russell Westbrook was more valuable than having depth.
"&gt; And him not listing Serge as a teamate in an interview, which stirred up shit. I imagine there are quite a few of his fans who try to mirror that ""Fuck em"" affect.  I think you're actually referring to him not listing Russell Westbrook as one of his top 5 teammates. He said Serge before Russ and the interviewer had to remind him of Russ."
Russell Westbrook effect
Anthony Davis is the real Russell Westbrook
"Older/tired legs makes it harder to shoot consistently, especially for guys who always jump high on their jumpshots (ex: Russell Westbrook), it can tire you out overtime and cause u to miss more."
https://c.tenor.com/uMRYAV8Py9UAAAAC/russell-westbrook-nba.gif
It’s been like that his whole career lmao. Dude has Russell Westbrook syndrome.
"No he isn't. He dominated Wilt when their teams played even when Wilt had a team just as good. When Russell played Wilt, his scoring would go down by a significant amount and Wilt could compensate for that lost of scoring with superior play making.  Overall Wilt put up massive stats but his teams offenses were not actually very good. Wilt massive frustrated coaches by his black-hole style of play. And then he went assist hunting one year he was assist hunting 10x harder then Westbrook and his team still didn't perform very well. When he finally stopped playing like that (after many years of losing) and he stopped putting up insane numbers, his teams became much better.  In comparison, literally every year Russell was on the celtics they were a dominate defense, before and after he left they were average. Often they put up all time defense ratings, including in the playoffs including limiting Wilts teams considerably. Russell was the best rebounder and he was amazing at hit ahead passing leading to his teams scoring easy buckets in transition.  In comparison Wilt was once bench in the NBA finals because he played so slow and the Lakers were making a comeback with him on the bench and playing in transition.  There is a reason Russell teams always beat Wilts teams, and the reason is called Bill Russell."
While also playing alongside Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook lmao what a time to be alive.
two words for ya: Russell. Westbrook. Must See TV.

The effect of working hard with the historically hardworker Russell Westbrook on Lebron and Davis are starting to show up with the gran total of a combined 2/18 from 3s. Adding Russ contribution and you have a 4/22.   They are building new areas for the new Crypto.com Arena!
As a diehard Lakers fan since Lebron signed  I am disgusted and ashamed to associate with such a sad and pathetic franchise. I think it would be best if we traded Lebron James to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for some 2nd round picks and we should also offer Russell Westbrook and Talentless Horton Tucker 5 year extensions. As a result I will become a Los Angeles Clippers fan because they know how to win and they will always run the city of Los Angeles
that's odd.  Russell Westbrook never played for the Cavs.
Here it is Ive seen it all : a game where Russell Westbrook is the efficient guy who doesnt get enough shots because of his co-stars awful shot selection.
"We didn’t deserve to win that game.  LAL had them in a position of power late in the fourth quarter, and then LAL decided to go on a stretch where they were unable to score, causing the Kings to naturally come back and force the game to overtime.  Skip Bayless will rightly criticize LeBron for refusing to drive and attempt to draw a foul at the end of regulation, instead settling for a difficult three point shot. He did the exact same thing last game.  Positives: Russell Westbrook, Malik Monk  Negatives: Boxing Out, free throws"
Russell “Despite the Loss” Westbrook
Yep bro call me Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
LeBron has done well playing his best Russell Westbrook impression this game
Welcome to the Russell Westbrook experience  Bricked 3  Dunk  Assist  Turnover
"Then you have Russell Westbrook, lol. Nah, real talk, when a guy is emotional, he can lose control."
"There's no reason to write a bible to define something so simple, what these guys played was crude and underdeveloped, it was not basketball as we know, simple as it is. Russell admitted it, West, Oscar, etc.. there is plenty of interviews, go search for yourself (considering how much free time you have), West literally said they played a different sport, Oscar said his triple doubles can't be compared with WestBrook because he played a different sport. The own people of that period admitted it, but the media and fans forcefully wants their era to be recognized beyond the pioneer effect, which is something bizarre, a weird kinda of self validation from people who are literally detached with that reality (which is what you just did)  There's a huge contextual difference between Wilt grabbing 25 rebounds over construction workers and milkman in comparison to Dwight grabbing 15 rebounds over professionals, what is the logic of saying Wilt had a more dominant performance? Professionalism is not only about constant training, a steady income, etc.. the key point are the rules. If in 25, 50 years from now the NBA implements a 4pt line, the court gets stretched out to accommodate a 6 vs 6, etc.. any substantial change to the rules and parameters established ever since the mid to late 70s when the NBA and ABA merged and the sport was fully matured and professionalized, then we can talk. But at the current state, it's simply illogical to compare the achievements of amateurs like Mikan or Pettit in comparison to any player from the 70s and beyond. Also, I welcome people to try and watch playoffs series of those decades, see for yourselves how that... thing, it was not basketball"
"seriously. he's giving you pretty much Russell Westbrook on offense, but with half the turnovers and all-defense on the other end. lmao"
Volume stats lol  I guess you think Russell Westbrook is top 15 all time and Wilt is the GOAT
Russell Westbrook
"He also loved the idea of trading for Russell Westbrook, so...."
"Don't look now, but Reggie Jackson has the same TS as Russell Westbrook at 51%."
"Well, you’re forgetting about 1 thing in that 12 Finals run. James Harden was the primary decision maker and was the acting PG for that team. Once you let Russell make all the decisions on the court, yea it will lead to questionable plays. Talent can only get you so far. Donovan/Brooks ran a shit offense, that’s true but having Westbrook run your point will cost you a lot of games even in his prime."
"Ricky ""Russell Westbrook"" Rubio"
What do you think of Russell Westbrook?

"If it's the last possession, sure. But with a couple minutes left, gotta shoot it. Steph doesn't wanna turn into Russell 10-turnovers Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook will never win a title...
"This is an underrated comment, and not just because I’m a Kings fan.  People haven’t fully grasped what the playin has done to the trade deadline.  I blame the Magic for being entirely too sane last year.  You know who can make the playoffs at the deadline?  Everyone!  Except for the teams that decided to start up the tank at the beginning of the year, you know who’s going to try to make the playoffs at the deadline?  Almost everyone.  Will it be stupid?  Sure!  But because of the playin, now it is the way.  There might be one team that gets to the deadline, has been trying to make the playoffs, can still make the playoffs, and won’t try to.  But that’s not going to be true every year now.  There are not going to be multiple teams doing it.  And it’s definitely not going to be the team in the middle of a drought.  The players available at the 2021 deadline that can improve your team will be John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, and maybe a Spur."
Last year the wizards figured it out towards the end of the regular season and piled on wins with Russell Westbrook.   Having him added to your team is an adjustment that will take time
"I feel like Russell Westbrook could be one of the two. Serious dude, and keeps it real like Barkley."
"Only thing I hated about this, was Russell Westbrook inserting himself into the situation. LeRef whisperer doesn’t need you my dude. Go away."
"I get the NBA wanting to showcase zion and giving the pels all these marquee games, they had no idea he was gonna be hurt so long  But anthony edwards is a force of nature.  NBA should put him everywhere.  Dude is like prime russell westbrook except with a 3 point shot."
thanks for the daily Russell Westbrook stat update
Russell Westbrook cocking back for the slam up one and blowing it is LaMelo-quality
lol Russell Westbrook is hands down the most **entertaining** player to watch in the entire league.
"He was only ever like that when he had Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant getting all the attention, and Russ was feeding him easy shots at the rim."
Sorry nephew I don’t don’t have a daily routine talking about Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
The problem is AD’s insistence on playing PF and trying to recreate the 2019-20 Sixers with 2 centers and a non shooting point guard.  He needs to stop being soft and play center because playing DeAndre Jordan and Davis together will not work when your PG is Russell Westbrook

"Sir Russell Westbrook, much more respected by his peers than the newer youngest generation of casuals, same with draymond"
"Russell Westbrook. And has been for a long time now. No one can question the guys intensity, but he is not the calibre of player that people talk him up to be.   He ballhogs and forces a brand of basketball that is not conducive to winning. He can't shoot and his defence took a nosedive his MVP year (he had bottom 5 3pt defensive FG%, because he hedges of his man to get the rebound).  I am still annoyed he won MVP over Harden when he did. Harden was the better player with a better record. Westbrook just had a gimmicky statline that he forced his way to.   If Lebron, Luka, Giannis etc really really wanted to, they could average a triple double imo. But they aren't those types of players.  The othe guy is Gobert. For obvious reasons. Overpaid, wins a bunch if awards, but is a 0 on offence. Ayton would look better as third team all NBA than Gobert."
It's so obviously Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook emphatically blocking KD.
Russell Westbrook if you're a fan of individual performances regardless of how a team is doing. Watch his career highlights from 2013 to present.
"they been around for just over a decade. missed the playoffs like 3 times?  been to a finals, been to 4 WCFs, were a serious contender for half the decade. Had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and more play for them. Now they have promising young talent in Shai and a huge number of assets to work with. yeah they never won, but compared to other newer teams they’ve been spoiled."
"Maybe I'm just old enough to remember when they were stars, especially Hill. But I don't find them hard to tell apart, at all.   To me this is like comparing Devin Booker and Ben Simmons. Or Giannis and Russell Westbrook."
"Great topic IMO.  It seems like floor raisers are guys who play much harder then average player and also are physically gifted enough to be effective when people are playing each other in the regular season without large amounts of time to prepare. Allen Iverson and Russell Westbrook are good examples. They tend to win less when everyone is playing incredibly hard and has time to prepare for them and present more specific strategies and challenges.  Ceiling raisers seem to be guys who keep the locker room culture strong and unselfish. Who also are elite at gameplanning, complex team defense, and filling in the little roles like cutting, shotmaking etc that punish defenses for over-focusing on the superstars.  Just my thoughts as casual fan."
"Presti is a good GM, and has recently put the Thunder in a great spot asset wise for the future ... and he's made some good trades with Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Paul George, etc....  But goddamn, he could have had Durant, Westbrook and Harden in their primes on the same team had he just given Harden the contract he wanted.....  Instead he traded Harden, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two 1sts and one 2nd.   Oh and then KD left 4 years later.  ...... man, imagine if that core had stayed ...... the Warriors dynasty maybe wouldn't have even gotten 1 ring in the 2010s."
"They needed KD, stop fooling yourself. The 2017 Warriors also didn't only switch Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant, they also lost a lot of the depth that made them win 73 games in 2016 to begin with (Speights, Bogut, Barbosa, etc.). The Warriors went from one of the best second units in the league to one of the worst, so no, the didn't ""just traded Harrison Barnes for KD"".  The Warriors got exposed in those playoffs. They survived OKC because Russell Westbrook can sometimes be the actual worst and then got hammered three straight games by a team that had more talent in the top than them, they wouldn't have beaten the 2017 Cavs (a much better version of the team that actually won)."
"I almost think you should qualify this by saying ""excluding post players who couldn't do anything else and big guys with no skill.""  Allen Iverson wouldn't be MVP-caliber today. He'd be really good, of course; he'd draw a lot of fouls. He'd just be one of those guys who is recognized as a ""microwave scorer"" type that no one can stay in front of but that isn't efficient enough to build your offense around. He'd be kind of like the bad version of Russell Westbrook where everybody always says ""if he'd just stop taking those shots..."" but with less passing."
"Looked up the NBA rebounding leaders to see who could help  Unsurprisingly, 9 of the top 10 rebounders from last year were Non-Americans!  The only American in the top 10? .... Russell Westbrook"
While guys like Russell Westbrook and James Harden and Dame Lillard and I want to say John Wall kept getting the bag every single year they could none won a championship. While Giannis is going to get the bag every chance he has now and will have a ring to show for it.
Russell Westbrook
Giannis out there looking like seven foot Russell Westbrook sheesh
"I would imagine something like [this](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/ruh0qufmesm7bcvdynjd/russell-westbrook-what)"
CP3 in talks to be traded for Russell Westbrook - Woj probably
We can all agree Giannis Antekumpo is basically a tall version of Russell Westbrook. It's basically the same guy at different sizes.
"wtf do you mean lmao this comment has me laughing    when russell westbrook was first about to average a triple double, oscar “the grouch” was making incessant comments about how russ was overrated and such, and then the year before he was incredibly salty about Steph.    he changed his tone now because he looked incredibly ungracious and took quite a bit of criticism for being such a bad sport. it doesn’t take away from his long history of making snide and salty comments about players after him"
"Lol, Russell Westbrook would beg to differ.   Why are you still talking? Didn’t you blow a 3-1 lead last year?"
"Depends on how big a star you are. Definitely Steph, Lebron, KD are more well known than the biggest NFL stars. Established NBA superstars are more well known than an equally comparable NFL star. For example, more people know who Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony are compared to Aaron Donald and Julio Jones. But more people know some average QB like Andy Dalton compared to Devin Booker or Jokic in the US"
"Pretty easily a top ten player of all time, yet people hardly ever mention him outside of talking about Russell Westbrook. His off-court achievements are just icing on the cake too.  I don’t think there’s any other player who could get a pass for making a statement like that, but I’m more than willing to give it to him. Dude does not get his fair credit by most."
in 2018? russell westbrook or damian lillard
"Let’s be real. The contract is with the NBA, not an individual team. The various franchises can ship contracts around to other franchises at will. When you sign a deal, you have a guaranteed contract with the league, not with a team.   See: Griffin, Blake; Harden, James; Westbrook, Russell; etc etc etc."
"Huh? Oscar Robertson thinks he was great, but he's also a big enthusiast of many of today's players. He loves Lebron, Russell Westbrook, Giannis ...  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/sports/basketball/oscar-robertson-russell-westbrook-triple-double.html  The one player who can seem really ungracious about today's players is Shaq."
"Seems like no one is really doing a starting 5, so here we go:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: Terry Rozier  SF: Jerami Grant  PF: Eric Paschall  C: Jahlil Okafor"
Demarcus Cousins Isaiah Thomas Kevin Love Russell Westbrook Carmelo Anthony
None of these players are “trash” but they’re definitely not as good as advertised.   PG: D’Angelo Russell/Russell Westbrook  SG: Buddy Hield/Colin Sexton  SF: R.J Barrett/Andrew Wiggins  PF: Marvin Bagley/Julius Randle  C: Domantas Sabonis/Whiteside
"Every great shooter has gravity and gets doubled, that's the point. James Harden while healthy was getting doubled at half court by teams when he played alongside guys like Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, yet Steph stans in this sub wants to act like that only happens with Steph.  There's also a reason why you blitz Steph and not KD, KD is 7 ft tall, he can get into positions where doubling him is either impossible OR he can just pass over the double team, it has nothing to do with their shooting abilities or their skills as players, it's just easier to blitz Steph because he is smaller.  Curry's gravity exists and he gets doubled, but so does Harden, Dame, KD and Embiid. Acting like Steph gets doubled more or that his gravity is somehow bigger than any of these guys is just dumb."

Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.

The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
Russell Westbrook.
"The story that I think best sums up who James Harden is: We're at the entrance of a strip club in Houston, about to go in and his teammates are worried about the media. Russell Westbrook asks what he'll do if the Houston media sees this and demands that he be traded. ""I'll demand a trade first"". Then he goes in the strip club."
Well who else can they get that they'd want? John Wall? Russell Westbrook? No lol.
Russell Westbrook fans enter the chat…
"i choose to believe russell westbrook is the one that never does. russell, if you're out there, don't let me down."
"Yea that’s why I’m saying you’re taking it too literally. The way I like to describe it is skill vs will. Giannis is not the most “skilled” player but he’s an athletic freak with an insane amount of “will”. He doesn’t have the best handles, not the best passer, poor shooter but he’s faster, longer, stronger and more aggressive and fearless than almost every one on the court. He’s very much like Russell Westbrook but taller"
"**Dunks:**  Russell Westbrook  Michael Jordan  Julius Erving  Giannis Antetokounmpo (obligatory Kemp)  Shaquille O'Neal  **Threes:**  Stephen Curry (Duh)  Klay Thompson (Duh)  Peja Stojakovic (or KD)  Dirk Nowitzki  Karl-Antony Towns  ***If those teams went against each other, who would y'all pick?

"Giannis ""Russell Westbrook"" Antetokounmpo"
"brook helps rim protection but is not an enormous upgrade over bam at that and is worse than bam/draymond at post defense and switching.  unfortunately he may have the worst height-to-rebounding-skill ratio in the league, the guy has averaged *five* a game over the past five years, which is literally the same as 6'0 kyle lowry and chris paul have. Myles Turner is slightly better on the glass but is the same archetype, stretch rim protecting big, below aberage on the glass. If they need pure rebounds they need Allen.  Funnily enough, Russell Westbrook averages more offensive rebounds per game than both Lopez and Turner, which is insane. He averages more boards overall than anyone on team USA including Bam and is the nba assists leader, he might literally be able to play point center for this team lmao"
Nah Russell Westbrook broke my heart with that fucking shot; of all ppl on the court why him!?
"Semi-serious, but prime Russell Westbrook (back on OKC) would have been monstrous if he took less shots lol  Deferring more shots to KD, while he focused on the other elements of the game"
"Russell Westbrook has always felt the most like Kobe to me in terms of mentality, though their playstyles couldn't be more different"
Thoughts on Russell Westbrook?
"If Russell Westbrook pulled what CP3 just did tonight, we’d never hear the end of it. I love Paul, but this is a massive choke, even bigger than that Thunder series back in 2014."
"You're really not helping your argument when the first time around was before he was a superstar and the second time around KD missed half the season...  Nobody is saying Harden hasn't had good players on his team.  He just didn't have it for most of his run as the face of the Rockets, which is the time in his career where he would be comparable to Malone.  We're all aware that he played with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook on the same team, it's a pretty well known fun fact."
"Search “draymond green dirty plays” and “Russell Westbrook dirty plays” and see the difference.   I’m also referring to this specific series, I don’t have recollection of Westbrook kicking anybody in the head, and a quick search for it only has me seeing when he kicked the ball away from Damian lillard  Edit: in fact searching for draymond kicking someone in the head immediately brings up one on James harden, but the topic is on this series so let’s ignore that yeah?"
"Kevin Love yelled, “There you go!” Russell Westbrook gave a look of pleasant surprise. Bradley Beal belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"of course just not oklahoma city and the surrounding area, russell westbrook, draymond green, the warriors ownership group, steve kerr, cleveland ohio, lebron, the boston celtics, the city of boston and state of massachusetts, and anyone in houston texas.  other than that they’re good"
"&gt;but if he yelled Russ, was it really necessary to replace that with ""(Russell Westbrook)""?  Without the context casual readers may not get who was being talked about."
"As he was about to uncork his foul shot he heard something amongst the cacophony of cheers and jeers.  ""gotta trade (Russell Westbrook)""  His shooting hand flinched ever so slightly as memories of a man abundant in energy flooded through him, a man that keeps on trying but also kept on bricking, of a man of uncalled for rebounds and of a man with a sense in fashion of a blind mosaic artist. His form faltered as the he absorbed the truth in every word uttered by that soothsayer.  He missed the shot but never blamed the fan as the words of truth if it echoed enough would probably set his home free.    Edit: I tried, hard. Like how the headline tried."
"I asked more than a dozen people close to Kyrie about the flat-Earther thing, just to put it to rest. Some friends laughed it off, and I pushed back on them, pointing out that a celebrity who had more Instagram engagement than Donald Trump at the height of his powers of misinformation (and probably more than every high-school science teacher in America combined) is doing a disservice to fans by spouting lies that he came across going down an Instagram rabbit hole of his own.  Look: Kyrie likes to push buttons. He reads a lot of history books, and in some ways he'd like to re-write them. He recently filmed himself on location at the sites of The Tulsa Massacre and The Little Rock Nine, hoping to bring these overlooked part of America's very imperfect past to the forefront. He's apparently directing a documentary about himself, and he's worked with the WNBA star Jewell Loyd on getting critical race theory and REAL American history into classrooms in New Jersey and across the country.  And, I mean: This many years after the flat-Earther thing, as he's grown as a man and an ""influencer,"" more often than not Kyrie is RIGHT when he fucks with people or pushes buttons in public. I reported in my book that his side-eye toward the racial history of Boston fans dated back to at least the 2017-2018 season; flash-forward to 2021, and he's calling out ""subtle racism"" ahead of his return to TD Garden. Then this man gets a water bottle thrown at him, and Russell Westbrook gets popcorn dumped on him in Philly.  In many ways, Kyrie has — wait for it! — come full circle. (Sorry.)"
Can't really do much when you have to play with Russell Westbrook.  Back in OKC they tried to force Sabonis to be a stretch 4 for that exact reason lol.
"What did the fan really yell? Russ? Brodie? Brodie seems a little weird to me to yell in this situation, but if he yelled Russ, was it really necessary to replace that with ""(Russell Westbrook)""? Maybe the fan went with the ultra-vague ""him."""
"It's also difficult to see a 32 year-old Kawhi and a 33 year-old Paul George making noise in the 2023 playoffs together, without a significantly improved starting cast. The best they can do is focus on the team culture and talent until then. Maybe trade for an aging Russell Westbrook as a ball-handler. None of these situations are remotely ideal."
Well they might.  But not for russell westbrook lol
Lakers:  Russell Westbrook/Klay Thompson/James Harden/Kawhi Leonard/DeMar DeRozan  Clippers:  Dejounte Murray/Kevin Porter Jr./Zach LaVine/Joe Harris/Jaden McDaniels
"We're talking about *currently*, not a few years ago.  He doesn't even crack the top 10.  Most recent rankings:  1. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets  2. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  5. Russell Westbrook, Washington Wizards  6. Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks  7. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  8. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  9. Steven Adams, New Orleans Pelicans  10. Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics  He's behind *Jaylen fucking Brown*."
This sub is just hypersensitive to any Russ criticism (unless he recently had a bad game in which case he’s literally hitler). He is not a bad player but he is objectively a terrible fit on this team. I’d much rather Damian Lillard bring the ball up than Russell Westbrook
A ball dominant guard who can’t shoot or defend like Russell Westbrook might be the worst possible fit on this team. This team needs more guys that don’t need the ball to add value.
"I'm hoping the Wizards will. They'll be getting their starting center Thomas Bryant back who put up solid numbers before his acl injury and Rui Hachimura could be on track for a breakout season, and of course they have a great backcourt with Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal leading the way"
That was largely because they brought Sonics Kevin Durant and the just drafted Russell Westbrook with them to start the franchise. They haven't exactly been a magnet for high profile free agents since relocating to OKC.
"My breakout list is...  Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton, Johnathan Isaac.  &amp;#x200B;  My fall off list is...  Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic."

"Superstar is not simply a matter of who's best. Sports is an entertainment product. Superstar is a great player who also does spectacular things that draw viewers and add a unique buzz to games.  Russell is a superstar. Beal is not. A superstar is someone casual fans turn on the game for. That's Westbrook. Not Beal.  Another example: Gobert may be the most important player to the Jazz as a team, but Mitchell is the closest thing to a superstar on their roster.  A historical example: Payton was never a superstar. Kemp in his prime was."
I know he sucks at scoring but could Russell Westbrook have been good for getting boards?
I’d say Bradley Beal or Russell Westbrook if Washington decides to blow it up. But I could also see the Mavs parting ways with KP.
Lowering his efficiency is the entire point. You think Russell Westbrook has a good game if he takes 30 shots to score 30 points?
"Bucks will probably bring Budenholzer back next year and trade Jrue Holiday for Russell Westbrook, lol."
Yes. I look up to Russell Westbrook for fashion
Russell Westbrook
That's a weird way to spell Russell Westbrook
"because I watched rockets games that season and the last 2 as well as the series? teams began double teaming him at halfcourt when he brings the ball up to make other players make a play, people love doing this revisionist thing where we pretend the ball wasn’t literally forced out of hardens hands as soon as he hit halfcourt and everytime he got it back for a screen he go doubled as well as if he got a 1v1 iso especially at the end of the shot clock he was doubled. there were few times where they got the defender they wanted on him whether it was iggy or klay when he started his sizeup and they lit it rock but would bring late help when we stepped back. here’s multiple articles talking about when it started in the REGULAR SEASON before even the playoffs teams were picking him up on doubles at halfcourt with one of the articles providing video examples for you. I know you didn’t watch the series because one of the reasons they lost is because they would literally double harden feet behind the 3, capela would roll, harden would hit him around the freethrow line and once he caught it he didn’t know what to do after the defense collapsed. most people remember it as looney outplaying him. this is like pretending teams didn’t play defense behind harden for games as a way to try and defend him  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2869263-rockets-james-harden-says-double-teams-mean-im-pretty-good.amp.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/these-james-harden-double-teams-are-not-unprecedented-but-they-do-put-russell-westbrook-in-a-spotlight/amp/  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28243765/james-harden-vs-double-teams-winning  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/11/25/20981887/james-harden-houston-rockets-double-team-defense"
That's like saying Russell Westbrook is a better shooter than Simmons. Anyone is a better shooter than Simmons because he literally doesn't shoot. Murray is not a good shooter. This trade doesn't improve either team imo.
Russell Westbrook is a man that exists.
"TMac should not be a Hall of Famer. HoF in general should be more selective. Pierce better than Melo all time. Peak PG better than Melo. Would take Billups or Tony Parker over any version of Westbrook. Bill Russell ability-wise or stat wise is not a top 10 player of all time. Tmac, Melo, and AI are the most overrated players of all time."
"Yeah a lot of people would do it, which is why I think he picked them as a topic. If you like the nba, you most likely have a certain opinion on both of them.  You wouldn’t far about any of this if the book was about Russell Westbrook and Beal"
"You could tell Chris did not enjoy playing with James anymore in 2019. What's important note with that being Chris Paul's worst year in the league, 538 still rated his season higher than healthy Russell Westbrook, and projected his following season to bounce back as the season was a statistical irregularity whereas Russ was on a downward trajectory."
"“Tony Parker was the closest and I even think Ben is faster than that,” Brown said, via Michael Pina of SB Nation. “There are times when we all think ‘oh he’s really fast.’ What I do is count the steps from foul line to foul line and there aren’t many. Count the dribbles. There aren’t many. He covers ground quicker than anybody I think that I’ve ever coached and the closest would be Tony.  ”And you’d all go back and you’d look at Russell Westbrook, maybe early days Derrick Rose. John Wall. Like, those greyhounds that just take off. But really, forget your stopwatch, count the dribbles and count the steps. He is elite when it comes to that part of the game.”  According to private data provided to SB Nation by NBA Advanced Stats, Simmons’ top recorded speed this year was 19.7 miles per hour, which translates to him racing the length of a court in roughly 3.25 seconds.   Direct quote above  If the Raptors try to get Simmons for OG, the 76ers laugh and hang up.  I like OG a lot but he’s not the same level as Simmons.  Some stats might say OG is number 2 in defensive versatility but from the games I’ve seen, I’d say:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Giannis  3. Kawhi 4. Healthy Issac  5. OG  Paul George, Tatum, playoff LeBron (might be too old now), Covington, Gordon, Butler, Bam, Smart, and Jrue are very versatile defensively too"
Russell Westbrook could regress to Russell Westpuddle
1. Patrick Beverley  2. Draymond green  3. Matt Barnes   4. Cp3  5. Russell Westbrook  6. James harden  7. Kevin Durant   8. Paul George   9. Boban   10. Ben simmons
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"You’re not finding replacements to replace these guys, these new players don’t have the personalities &amp; humor to replace them. If you want similar comedy &amp; moments this crew I had the crew I would suggest is Russell Westbrook to replace Charles, Danny Green to replace Kenny &amp; Kevin Garnett to replace Shaq."
Russell Westbrook has left the chat
"you can make that argument about every single counting stat though  scoring - took too many shots, chucked your team out the game  offensive rebounds - andre drummond ass dudes, only getting boards cuz you missed a gimme  defensive rebounds - russell westbrook getting free boards from steven adams doing all the work  steals - gambling instead of playing fundamentally sound defense  blocks - goaltending ass dudes like hassan whiteside"
"This sub loves to hate on Kyrie… Kyrie is a hardcore philanthropist he just stays quiet about it.  LeBron James literally started a school, Jrue Holiday donated a ton of money this year. Russell Westbrook is constantly doing things for OKC.   Yeah the proverty in this word is extreme. It’s not on the NBA or sports to fix that.   Your  mindset is poisonous."
Everyday is still Russell Westbrook day in OKC
I'm rooting for TM. But his 3pt shooting is still suspect. Jazz gameplan was to leave him wide open. He had time to **bounce the ball once** before Gobert even attempted a close out.  If he can develop a faster catch and shoot (and avoid any injuries that reduce his Russell-Westbrook-like-coast-to-coast speed) he will be an amazing player.
"Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, Kevin Garnett on the TWolves, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony"
"Also [Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, Larry Bird and Bill Walton](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lebron-james-lefty-mixed-handed-11620954356)"
"That’s assuming he could have done it, with Russell Westbrook and his ”let’s trade Harden” ownership.  Heck, even if he did do it, you don’t think people wouldn’t be trying to take away his legacy and give it to Mr Triple double over “the most unselfish superstar” Steph curry?"
"No he wasn't. A candidate means you have an actual realistic chance of winning it. Coming 10th while getting 4 third place votes doesn't make you an actual candidate. Saying Brook Lopez was a DPOY candidate last year is like saying Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle and Derrick Rose were MVP candidates this year (all of whom received votes)"
"Love that you actually did a list.  A few places I disagree: I have Russell in the top group of 4 with MJ, Lebron, and KAJ. The winning and MVPs are just out of this world.  I would move Kobe down 6 spots (Wilt, Shaq, Russell, Olajuwon, Durant, Garnett)  I would move Garnett up like 12 spots to the top 10.  Westbrook is not better than Chris Paul."
Jordan  Lebron  Kareem  Magic  Bird  Duncan  Kobe  Wilt  Shaq  Russell  Olajuwon  Curry  Robertson  Durant  Moses Malone  Erving  Baylor  Dirk  Wade  West  Barkley  Karl Malone  Garnett  Harden  Kawhi  Westbrook  Chris Paul  Robinson   Nash  Ray Allen  Worthy  Stockton  Dwight Howard  Iverson
Trying to find the best combination of dope name and actual skill/talent. Here's my starting 5:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - Zach LaVine  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Zion Williamson  C - Bam Adebayo
"&gt; No way, he doesn't even watch basketball games off the court  I think he did say he didn't watch games at home but i've never heard him saying he doesn't watch games.  Even so, even Russell WEstbrook has said sometime that he doesn't watch games, he watches tape"
Wow and even predicted the Russell Westbrook MVP the next year
"https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/m3xfxk/_/gqskttu/?context=1  &gt;	not a popular op but i actually agree with him. Dude’s game is still the same as when he entered the league. And funny enough, he’s also got the ‘russell westbrook’ attitude to playing i.e. stubbornness. Philly should trade him while half the league still thinks he’s good.  https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/m3xfxk/_/gqs4298/?context=1  &gt;	He’s a super good defender , but he’s not wrong. He needs to shoot eventually and that always comes back come playoff time , In professional modern day basketball it’s a necessity to have 5 guys who can shoot. Rondo is the exception to the rule I suppose but even he could turn it on for some games and suddenly shoot 4/5 from three in a clutch game"

Russell WestBrook Wins the Scoring title
Lakers win the west and Russell Westbrook will be the best player on the team and finish top-5 in MVP.
the russell westbrook of politicians
Russell Westbrook will have his best year since 2017.
"Russell Westbrook.   Who gives it their all game after game? Who is more electrifying?  Russell Westbrook, because Why Not."
Russell Westbrook makes an All NBA team!
"&gt; They didn't just lose Murray. They lost Barton as well. That's your two top guards. The only decent guards they had left were Morris, campazzo, and rivers. And then Morris got hurt too. The on off splits for jokic in the playoffs were insane. He was their offense entirely, if you say that he had a better team around him then steph when their run ended (or even when the playoffs began), you simply don't realize the impact of what he was doing to get his team to that point.  Right, their teams were about equal *in the playoffs*, I'm addressing the fact that Curry's team wasn't healthy for the entire season, so using making the playoffs, like the guy I first responded to was, as a way to vault him over Curry is a terrible example.   &gt; Also, about the suns series Jokic isn't going to be guarding two of the best guards in the league 20 feet from the basket and recover to cover ayton by himself.   No one said he was responsible for guarding them on the perimeter, the fact of the matter is he can't even remotely cover them when they drive because his interior defense was non-existent leading to a 64% scoring under 9 feet.   &gt; Did you know jokic was 5th in defensive win shares last year? By no stretch of the imagination is he a bad defender.  Not only are defensive advanced stats practically useless, as admitted by their own creators, but using one single stat to label a player a good defender makes no sense. By this logic Russell Westbrook and Andre Drummond, who are also awful defenders, are also good defenders.   &gt; Steph lost in the play in game this year. Those two, really  As if Jokic is dragging that GSW team anywhere near the playoffs this year either  &gt; Did you miss that in all three of the years Jokic has been in the playoffs, he's made it past the first round?  Ya lol playing against cans, AD lost twice in the first round to GSW. 6th rank Portland, 7th rank SA, and 6th rank Utah aren't anywhere close to GSW in the years that AD lost so I'm not sure why this comparison is even being made.   &gt; The nuggets have been in the top half of defensive metrics for the last 3 years. The offense is incindeary, but the defense is really solid to very very good. Part of that js jokic being in the right spot and having good teammates to help.  Yet in the playoffs, their interior defense has been heavily exploited and one of the main reasons for their playoff losses. The Lakers and the Suns shot 72% and 66% at the rim vs the Nuggets in the past two playoff series'.   &gt; Saying ""the last time they were healthy"" is a huge caveat. AD hasn't played a full season ever. He had 3 months to rest before the bubble. Bron is 36. He's not going to be playing full seasons anymore either. If those are the stars you need to depend on, you are praying for a lot of good luck. And then we come back to Kawhi. He tore his ACL. That's a huge injury.  I've already said assuming health before I even made the argument and said Jokic would be top 5 without that assumption. I also never even put AD in the top 5 conversation. But even with what you wrote, load managing means nothing. Both Kawhi and Bron have accomplished far more than Jokic has ever accomplished in the playoffs in recent seasons when available."
"Giannis is longer and stronger, but Simmons' speed puts him on the same tier among the NBA's athletic freaks.  Going into the draft, John Wall was timed at 3.14 seconds in the 3/4 court sprint.  Russell Westbrook was 3.08 seconds.  Ben Simmons did it in *3.05*.  And his [12'6 vertical reach is supposedly the best of any player in the NBA](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/120282/who-will-ben-simmons-be-in-the-nba).    The dude unquestionably has the natural gifts to be a superstar."
"Russell Westbrook.  I'm an NBA fan since around 2002, and I never rooted for anyone besides the Pistons before like 2010. Because we were always good, and at the start of the decline I was still deluding myself into thinking we were just bad because of injuries.  But then when we weren't even in the playoffs I had to have some rooting interest, and the Pistons had too much previous series with most of the East powerhouses to really like any of them.  KD was starting to be a star, so I watched that series vs the Lakers in the first round because I wanted to see him vs the champs. And he was good, and Ibaka and Harden were good. But I couldn't helped but be mesmerized by Westbrook, his recklessness, his speed, the way he tried to dunk on both Bynum and Gasol.  It's funny in a way because as a point guard he's basically the exact opposite of Chauncey Billups who was my favourite NBA player at the time.  Since then there's been  a lot of bad, a lot of stupid dumb shots, a lot of defensive mistakes, i'm not gonna be here and pretend like he's some sort of perfect player, he's flawed, but ring or not, the fun moments have been well worth all the bad ones.  BTW my team still hasn't won a playoff game since then so yeah I kept rooting for Russ, even tho he's so polarizing that it's basically impossible to have a debate around him without it being completly toxic since the 2017 MVP Race."
Russell Westbrook will have a negative +/- and the Lakers will not make the Western conf finals with him in the rotation.

"Oh damn, there was a character that looks like russell westbrook on the tv show “oz” so I was hoping this was a reference lol"
"He got injured last year, and if he didn’t the Nets are NBA champions, so that’s a weird way to make him look bad.   You mention Luka losing to a WCF finalist in the first round when his second best teammate was THJ like that’s somehow more impressive than losing to the eventual champs in the second round when his best teammate was an injured Russell Westbrook.   And if you think losing to the eventual champion Lakers in the second round is what made him quit on the Rockets then you weren’t paying any attention to what was going on in Houston for the last few years of his tenure there."
"Westbrook best friend who was a better prospect dying and Westbrook suddenly going from a super small guard to a 6'3 guy and then becoming well the whole Russell Westbrook we all love to hate, hate to love and all the glory is a pretty unique story"

He's funny and opinionated without being a completely stupid yeller like talk radio.  He's always said that Russell is amazing, and his sites have written entire epics about Russell, but obviously Russell has things he could improve AS A POINT GUARD and sometimes that HAS to be the story.   LIKE, do you know another triple double player that a team trades away to a contender? To be third fiddle? Those are superstar numbers but not a superstar trade. Why is that? Because Simmons is right and Westbrook's game has holes in it. Kobe, Shaq, Lebron weren't too stubborn to get better. Russell is.  Harden, Durant  have flourished without him, as well. All of this can't be ignored."
Why is the thumbnailthumb Ben Simmons when the topic is Russell Westbrook?
"Might get downvoted for this but harden gets no sympathy from me - he did carry the team yes. But he refused to make any of the adjustments or sacrifices a true #1 guy does. Front office bent over backwards for him, got him Dwight, didn’t work. Ok, got him Chris Paul, one of the top point guards of the generation. Harden, a natural 2 guard tells Chris Paul “nah you play off ball, I’m the PG”. Doesn’t work out. They go get him one of his close buddies, Russell Westbrook. You mentioned them trading capela - that was a move in part influenced by James harden. Because harden’s offense and game is spacing and kicking. Trading away that pretty good asset in capela was essentially the org saying “fuck it we’re all in on harden and Westbrook”. Of course that didn’t work either. Not to say that losing capela was all on him, but harden certainly influenced that move and didn’t mind it.    Over those 8 ish years harden never really sacrificed or stepped back. A player who’s growth I compare him to is Kobe in the mid 2000’s when the Lakers basically were stalled. Kobe, like harden was averaging stupid numbers and dragging his team. Like harden, Kobe dominated the ball and the offense, they basically were the offense. Except Kobe was willing to take a step back, let others play their game, and be a part of the offense, when they had a few more pieces because he recognized that forumula where it’s one guy is the offense and controls everything cannot win you a title. He stepped up his game as a leader and boom, 2 chips in 09/10. Harden has never taken that step back. Part of that is coaching, d’antoni built a system that’s basically harden or bust, but at the same time, harden, with all the tools FO gave him, never took a step back, try to develop as a leader, make necessary sacrifices or adjustments to his play or his he fits in the scheme of a team offense that might benefit the team in the long run. Mf had Chris Paul on his team and said no stand on the wing lemme be point"
Did he not have james harden? But i Digress. This year everyones takes have been this Kevin Durant&gt;Lebron James James Harden&gt;Anthony Davis Kyrie Irving&gt;Russell Westbrook So my take is this if lebron wins with the “Inferior team” alongside the guy Kevin Durant couldn’t win with and Kevin Durant has a guy who Lebron did win with. I dont ever wanna hear Kevin&gt;Lebron. If Kevin wins this year I think the past year and this year Kevin&gt;Lebron
"Star - Russell Westbrook - He's in a spot where he can do what he does best, but, without needing to be the first or second scoring option. Lebron tends not to miss when it comes to picking stars as teammates, and, Westbrook has a spirit that won't quit.  Emerging Star - Kevin Porter Jr. - he's got the keys as full time, starting PG for to the Rockets, and is equipped with young talent in Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, along with more seasoned players in Christian Wood and Daniel Theis. He put up a monstrous performance against the reigning champs (resulting in a rare victory  for the Rockets last season), to go along with some moments of promising play before the season's end  Unproven Star - Scottie Barnes - there were many skeptics who voiced their disapproval of the Raptors choosing Scottie Barnes so high, but, he showed out in the Summer League. I think Scottie Barnes may very well end up making an impactful statement for why the Raptors choose him, especially within an organization that has a strong reputation for developing young players"
"This is a very similar argument you could have with the Lakers. Im not convinced I’d rather have Russell Westbrook close playoff games over Caruso. And it’s more of a compliment to Caruso, the dude is an elite glue guy."
"Even with New Orleans though, while he did take jumpers and he wasn’t like Russell Westbrook levels, he was below average. This year statistically he was elite"
"I guess you clearly don't follow him. He has always been a firm Russell is a knives and fork player, but no spoon. In other words, he has always said Westbrook does a lot of what you want a player to do, but has major flaws. Some people only see the good, some people only see the flaws, but you can't talk about him without acknowledging both."
"you traded Russell Westbrook for John Wall and gave up Harden for pennies on the dollar, you're just as dysfunctional as us right now."
"Yeah, I hate Simmons takes. He says whats popular to get views. Russ does make poor decisions sometimes but overall, he's a pretty good fourth quarter closer, people just like to remember poor decisions more. In his MVP he was clutch AF.     From a 2021 article on clutch time.   As of April 17th, Russell Westbrook in the last 5 minutes, within 5 points, and a minimum of 2 field-goal attempts per game has been phenomenal. Westbrook has 95 points (8th in the NBA), leads the league in field goal percentage (56%), effective field goal percentage (78%), and true shooting percentage (67%). Russ has always been criticized for his three-point shooting, but has shot an efficient 41% from three in the clutch, which has been 8th best in the NBA."
two of those are only single-digit numbers though so he is not as good as russell westbrook

"Man, I've watched Westbrook his entire career. This jumpshot is something he should have been practicing 10 years ago. He gets so amped up in games thats it's hard for him to control the jumping in his shot motion and ends up floating in the air longer than needed and it screws up everything he has worked on. I'm hopeful this season will be better but I sincerely doubt whatever he practices won't make any difference until he changes his playing style. Its hard to change who you are for 13 seasons as a lightning bolt as Russell is. Hopefully He proves me wrong, I love that guy."
"Got lucky enough to score some courtside seats at a Rockets game a few years back. During warmups Russell Westbrook took the time to say hi to us and dribbled the ball back and forth a bit with my little brother.  Westbrook thought nothing of it, but my brother was ecstatic."
Lol are you fucking high? Russell Westbrook used to be a tremendously impactful player. Rondo wishes he could've been remotely as good as peak Westbrook.
"Just to name a few: Baron Davis, Reggie Miller, Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook, Bill Walton and Kareem (imagine him as a Laker; nuts!)  I wonder if the Lakers and Clippers would flip a coin for Territorial Picks."
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area.

"This sub was up in arms when Marcus Morris said no one wanted to go to Utah, but -between shit like this and the racist fan going at Russell Westbrook- why would any star free agent feel excited to go there?

"You are conflating FMPV with regular season MVP.   In that case, KD had... three MVPs: Himself, Curry, and Iggy.  And he had three MVPS with him in OCK: Himself, Westbrook, and Harden.   See how that works out?   And you're right... I don't think there have been a lot of individual rivalries because it is a team sport.  Bird Magic. Wilt Russell.   That's about it.   You have guys like Isiah chasing after Bird and Magic. You had an entire league chasing after Jordan. You have an entire league chasing after LeBron. The entire league was chasing after Kareem.   But Kobe... who did he have a rivalry with? His own teammate in Shaq? And Jordan. But he was just chasing Jordan's shadow because they never met in the playoffs.  LeBron is chasing Jordan too."
I don’t think non NBA fans care about Russell Westbrook
"Allen Iverson comes to mind immediately. There's just no way your top scorer can be that inefficient, have limited perimeter pull-up game, and rely on fouls while also being defensively exploitable. Trae Young will struggle to win higher-level playoff series, too, for basically the same reasons. He has the perimeter scoring, but he's brutal on defense.  Among current/recent players, Russell Westbrook. Among 80s/90s players, John Stockton. It's happened very rarely that a point guard was the best player on a true championship-caliber team. Frazier, Payton, Curry. Maybe Mark Price."
"Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook"
"Since 1956, the MVP played the following positions:  point guard - 11 times (Bob Cousy, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, Derrick Rose, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook)   shooting guard - 8 times (Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, James Harden)   small forward - 9 times (Julius Erving, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kevin Durant)   power forward - 12 times (Bob Pettit, Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Giannis Antetokounmpo)   center - 26 times (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Wes Unseld, Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, Bill Walton, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic)"
"Why Russell Westbrook isn’t a top 5 point guard. He’s great, but he’s way too flawed to be considered top 5.  “But he averages a triple double!”  Yeah he’s really good in the regular season because of his inhuman motor and seemingly unlimited energy. When it comes to the playoffs, he gets exposed.  I’d kill to have Westbrook on my team because he’s exciting as hell and never takes a night off, but people overrate him because of his stats.  Curry, Lillard, Kyrie, Harden, Trae, Luka and CP3 are all better."

Russell Westbrook - dubious starter??0
"The finals record or head-to-head match-up is only one part of my position.   As I've said in other cases, KD has NEVER beat LeBron by himself: He only beat him with another MVP: Curry.  KD + Curry vs. LeBron isn't an individual rivalry.  It's two guys teaming up on one.  When KD, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka went up against LeBron and co. they both had multiple all-stars/future HOFers (granted, at different stages of their careers), and LeBron whopped him.  KD only beat LeBron after her joined a team that already beat LeBron.  And, and the end of the day, after every single series they played head-to-head, LeBron walk away with a higher ring count.  So KD was always trying to catch up with LeBron.  &amp;#x200B;  So... no.. as an individual rivalry, it isn't really much.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron's biggest individual rivalry was with guys he actually played against was Kobe, but they never met in the playoffs.  The only franchise players who played LeBron and got the better of him were Dirk and Duncan.  But, like Jordan, LeBron doesn't really have any 'individual' rivalries (even if his teams have had team rivalries) because no individual players really compares to him.  It's only now, that he is on the wrong side of 35, that critics are debating whether or not other players (Giannis, KD) are the best in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  In reality, the biggest rival that LeBron has is Jordan.  It's certainly not KD.  KD has been chasing LeBron his entire career and still hasn't caught up. It's not like Bird and Magic or Russell and Wilt where there is a debate as to who is better."

Trying to find a clip of Russell Westbrook where he gets the ball from one end and tries to run a fastbreak but falls somewhere at half court. It was during his OKC years sometime from 2014-2017. Just thought it was a funny play by one of my favorite players.  I recall seeing the clip on NBA.com or the NBA YouTube channel. It was a video that might have had multiple highlights and for some reason him falling was part of the highlight. Thanks
How do you want to count it here? Depending how you’re looking at game 4 we were either 2-2 when KD had Kyrie in support and these “Bucks/Giannis woulda been washed” takes are stupid or we were 3-1 when Kyrie was out and even that one win required Jeff Green making Steph Curry look like Russell Westbrook from three.
"&gt;How did the lakers suck  Did you look? The 2018-2019 Lakers were 37-45. Kawhi and AD moved in the same offseason.  &gt;which stars joined Kobe other thean Shaq and Pau  What a weird way to communicate. Instead of this silly exercise, let's list the stars that have joined the LA Lakers over the last 20 years.  * Russell Westbrook * Dwight Howard * Anthony Davis * Rajon Rondo * Karl Malone * Gary Payton * Caron Butler * Pau Gasol * Shaquille O'neal * Ron Artest * Steve Nash * Roy Hibbert * Lou Williams  I'm sure I missed some I'm just tired of doing this."

Saquon and Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
"Maybe Dan Marino and Reggie Miller. Both very respected, but just played in eras before the real value of how to best utilize their skillset was realized.   Adrian Peterson and Russell Westbrook. Work ethic, extreme physicality, great teammates, MVP seasons around a rare statistical feat (2000 yard season, triple-double season). AP's catching out of the backfield = Westbrook's jumpshooting.  Josh Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi's jumpshooting = Allen's accuracy. Once both figured those out, they were superduperstars.  Aaron Rodgers and Kevin Durant. Both respected more by purists of their respective sports than by national media, it seems like. Both misused earlier in their career (KD at SG and Rodgers on the bench.) Both have pretty fundamentally unmimic-able games. Both have been MVP and best players on championship teams. Both overshadowed by having one of the best all-time players in the sport playing at their position during their career. Both can seem bored during games, and can quietly have unbelievable statistical games. And most importantly, both are pretty emo dudes.  Lamar Jackson and Giannis. Extremely unusual physical tools, really unlimited potential for improvement. Perennial playoff contenders in small cities where they're by far the most famous athlete.    Jalen Ramsey and Anthony Davis. Both cried their way out of bad teams to get to LA so that they didn't have to have the responsibility of being the best player on a team."
"I'll say it slower cause you can't read.  If Khris Middleton was voted in as a guard, Russell Westbrook would not have made the cut.  Ben Simmons still would, because Ben Simmons got the **fifth** most guard votes.  Not sixth.  &gt;No one actually thinks they are anything close to being top 15 in the league.  This entire conversation began by somebody saying Simmons was top 35."

Russell Westbrook...
Good luck telling people the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook to play him off ball… who’s the crazy one here…
**Russell Westbrook- Cam Newton:**  •	⁠Both are MVPs  •	⁠Both made one finals appearance and lost  •	⁠Both are the most athletic players ever at their position  •	⁠Both have declined heavily with age and injuries  •	⁠Both have an odd fashion sense  ————-  **Larry Bird- Patrick Mahomes:**  - Both won a ring at 24 - Both were super talented but not as hyped coming in - Both were immediately seen as top players in the league at age 23  ———-  **Shaq- Gronk:**  - Both are super talented physically  - Both are among the best ever at their position  - Both were a major star on a dynasty  - Both won a ring after on a different team  ———-  **James Harden(pre-Nets)- Drew Brees**  - Both broke out on a different team - Both put up crazy stats - Both are all time greats missing something(MVP/ring) - Both consistently fell short in the playoffs in heartbreaks
"What you're looking for are superstar/star players who run their teams offense and/or rarely play off-ball *or* focus on creating their own shot.  For example, the best-worst team (with some wiggling of positions) I can think of would be;  PG: Trae Young  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Joel Embiid  To be fair Embiid would probably slot in alright, but in terms of star C's it's really either him or Jokic and I worry the latter would be able to corral the rest of the time into playing well off-ball."
"Bro, you always speak like you’re in the Lakers front office. You’re a Warriors fan… I follow the Lakers wayyy closer than you. Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis will be the dominant force of this Lakers team during the regular season. I can promise you that."
For some reason I’ve always thought of Cam Newton and Russell Westbrook as similar styles of athletes. But maybe it’s just the defined cheekbones.
"Russell westbrook. Big personality, excellent player in his own right, floor raiser for bad teams, questions on how good he is in a team concept."

"Russell Westbrook teammates historically have career years… KD in OKC, PG 2019, Beal 2021 and it’s not like 2020 Harden wasn’t great. One of the best p&amp;r players ever with the GOAT (IMO) lob threat is instant offense and easy points for AD."
And he has as many MVPs as Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook has been on 5 different teams if you count that week in Seattle, which I am, during his career. In that same span, The Clippers have been on the same team, The Clippers. Is Russ a team cancer? I don't know, but this stat was a real eye opener."

"But you have to have heart and hustle as a habit.  If you've never done that you can't just turn it on by suddenly deciding during the playoffs to have heart and hustle.    Russell Westbrook is proof of that.  With his physical gifts he should be a shutdown defender and instead he's a turnstile.   Jordan, on the other hand, competed defensively every day and was a great defender."
Russell Westbrook
"Peak Hakeem’s my GOAT defender.   Unfortunately, as bad as PER/WS/etc. are, defensive metrics are just as trash, if not worse (definitely worse). DBPM will have you thinking Westbrook was twice the defender Kawhi was, or that Drummond was like a modern-day Bill Russell.   At least with offense, we get some really useful metrics (TS/rTS). On defense, there’s practically nothing of note that I know about at least"
"AI was a very inefficient player whose counting stats were inflated by the fact that the Sixers' offensive strategy was ""give the ball to Iverson."" Some of his inefficiency is forgivable do to that fact, and it's not like anybody else on the Sixers was going to score, and the entire league was pretty inefficient at the time, but I still feel like team players like Chris Paul and Steve Nash are often overshadowed by Iverson solely because they were allowed to blend into a team system.   I'm curious to see how Iverson would've developed if he had a better attitude and if the Sixers built a better roster around him. How would we remember Iverson if the Sixers drafted Dirk or Paul Pierce in the 1998 draft instead of Larry Hughes, or if they drafted Chauncy Billups or Tracy McGrady in the 1997 draft instead of Kieth Van Horn?   If Iverson was part of a duo, I think his mythos would wear off. I think he'd be more remembered like a better Russell Westbrook, the most athletic guy on the court, and a guy who can really fill up a stat sheet, though not very efficiently."
Oklahoma City Thunder - Russell Westbrook/Kevin Durant  I know Westbrook stuck around for a couple years after Durant left but KD is so much better that I've got him by a pretty comfortable margin as the OKC goat.
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
insert Russell westbrook quote
He was also really built and could handle 2-guards too. Kind of like a diet Russell Westbrook physically
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
Anything regarding Russell Westbrook and triple doubles
"Curry, Dame, Westbrook for me  They each redefine a lot of what you should expect from a PG. Curry and Dame brought extremely deep range and 3pt shooting. Meanwhile Russell with his athleticism and being able to do everything."
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook will make it. Lebron big 3 teams almost always have all 3 players of the big 3 make the all star game as long as they are healthy. He’ll also deserve to be in the all-star game as well.
"Even the most biased eyes are better than metrics that consider Hassan Whiteside, Andre Drummond and Russell Westbrook to be elite defenders"
Like anytime he had bad stretches in his career it would somehow be because Russell Westbrook is a selfish ball hog for sme people lol
"He scored a bunch of points on bad teams, big deal. He made the playoffs 8 times and got bounced in the first round 4 of those times, made the finals one time and that was it.   You look at stats that's fine, the stats won't tell you though that for all his ability to score he wasn't able to do all that much outside one season. He literally made the finals and made the second round once more and then that's it. Russell Westbrook is on the same trajectory of AI like that."

No wonder Russell Westbrook has so much energy
"I still love Russell Westbrook, but he definitely made me realize how overrated triple doubles are"
"**Series stats:**  Stephen Curry: 28/6/6/2, 61% TS  Klay Thompson: 25/4/2, 55% TS(had a higher 3P% than FG%, lol)  Kevin Durant: 30/8/3/2/2, 54% TS  Russell Westbrook: 27/7/11/4, 51% TS  Honestly I don't think KD or Westbrook actually played that bad overall in this series, their efficiency might not be great but Westbrook's playmaking and KD's defense were extremely important to them going up 3-1 in the series in the first place  They just both decided to have a horrible game at the exact wrong time(Game 6)"
PG: Russell Westbrook SG: Vince Carter SF: Dr. j PF: LeBron James Center: Shaq Bench: OKC James Harden  They'd do alright
Russell Westbrook and Vince Carter Those two dudes always hyped me up when I watched them. Highlight reels for days. Insane.
"I remember when people thought Oscar Robertson's record of averaging a triple double would be impossible, and then Russell Westbrook did it four times"
"lol I think mine end up being all guards...  Kemba Walker, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Luka Doncic  all-time team has some size: Steve Nash, Kemba Walker, Gerald Wallace, Dirk Nowitzki, Shaquille O'Neal"
"Westbrook won an MVP, teamed up with Paul George, and then got eliminated in the first round twice. I know that PG13 didn't always come through in the playoffs, but how many MVP""s in league history couldn't make it out of the first round with PG13 as their sidekick? And it's not like they just ran into better teams. The 2018 Jazz and 2019 Blazers were good but not great.  It doesn't make sense to hate Russell Westbrook, but a lot of people think he doesn't deserve all the praise he gets. I've seen no indication that he can help your team win a championship. Let's see what happens this year.  I don't hate Westbrook as a person"
We know from Russell Westbrook that’s enough to get you MVP
Dame is the worst playoff performer out of all the stars of his era not named Russell Westbrook
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."

"Would never have guessed Shawn Marion had nearly a third as many dunks more than Kobe Bryant, or 3x as many dunks as Russell Westbrook."
"Barrack Obama, Shaq, Russell Westbrook, Nick Young, Brandon Ingram, Powerpuff Girls. Then Kobe’s wife, then Kobe. 💯💯"
Russell Westbrook is a good basketball player
Russell Westbrook is good at basketball
"Are you trolling?  Harden was a Sixth Man in OKC, I aint talking about those days. Im talking prime for prime.  Curry always had Draymond, Klay, Iggy and a great bench and then traded that bench for KD.  Dwight Howard isnt on the level of all that fire power and neither is Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook.  If you really think Curry hasnt had the better supporting casts for his prime, you gotta take the homer glasses off. The fact the Warriors made the WCF without him playing in the first 2 rounds in 2016 says it all."
"I don't give a fuck who you are, which team you support, what gets you up in the morning, how good your dad is at fighting, how big your cock is, how much you love going for long walks or any other bullshit. You're on this subreddit because you love basketball. And if you love basketball then you owe it to yourself to give up every other thing you give a flying fuck about and watch the Oklahoma City Thunder. And you know why:  Russell Westbrook.  Russell Westbrook is bringing it. He's bringing it hard. I wish everyone could go back and watch that five minute spell in the fourth where he came back in and just ignited the afterburners, strapped falcon talons onto his hands and drove his will deep into the Lakers' heart.  Russell Westbrook is box office shit. If you're bored and you've got nothing to do and you don't know which game to watch, just watch Russell fucking Westbrook deep dick stat lines with enough power to light up a major metropolis.  Seriously, why the fuck are you still reading this, go have a wank to some Wesbtrook highlight videos and pass out safe in the knowledge he plays, on average, three times a week.  Fuck your own team, Russell Westbrook is your team now."
"There’s different calibers of MVP. Peak MVP caliber Russell Westbrook was not on the level of MVP caliber James Harden, or MVP Giannis was not on the same level as MVP caliber KD."
Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving  Russell Westbrook  James Harden
But he plays as hard as Russell Westbrook
Why Not: The Russell Westbrook story
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"Boy, did you miss something magical. That championship run was legendary. Imagine a team beating the defending champions with Kobe as their leader, then whooping Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, and ultimately prevailing over prime LeBron, D-Wade, and Bosh.  That was the Dallas Mavericks. Led by a single all-star. A man on a mission. Dirk Nowitzki."
So Russell Westbrook?
This isn't just a one or two game thing. It's a consistent theme with him. He regularly throws away possessions with ridiculously bad shots. Russell Westbrook does the same shit and nobody hesitates to shit on his boneheaded shot selection.
"are there? even so thats pretty in line with dudes like LeBron whose played with wade, love, irving, bosh, davis and soon westbrook. and the celtics fell apart whenever Russell missed games, which he almost never did."
"&gt;The players that never won a championship, despite wiinning an MVP in their careers, are:  &gt;Russell Westbrook  &gt;James Harden  &gt;Nikola Jokic  Why do people include active players when discussing things that ""never"" happened.  They could still win one.  &gt;nev·er /ˈnevər/ adverb  1.  at no time in the past or future; on no occasion; not ever.  &gt;Definitions from Oxford Languages"
"&gt; Three of those 33 players -- James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook -- will likely never see free agency. Harden and Irving are on track to sign long-term contract extensions before the season starts."
His name is not Russell Westbrook
Julius Randle  Damian Lillard almost every year  Russell Westbrook
"Let's compare another great passer from the same era as jokic so that we can maintain c.e to a better degree than a cross era comparison. Hell lets do it with apg considering you love the stat so much (I don't think it defines whose the better passer but lets use it as a heuristic for now to simplify the conversation).   James Harden has a 30.4% career usage rate, with a 6.5 apg. His MVP year he had a 35.9% usage rate while having 8.8 apg.  Jokic has a 25.5% career usage rate with a 6.0 apg.  This year he had a 29.5% usage rate while having 8.3 apg.  Lebron has a 31.5% career usage rate with a 7.4 apg.  His last mvp year he had a 30.1 usage on 7.3 apg.   Russell Westbrook has a 32.5% usage rate with a 8.5 apg.  His MVP season he had a 41.5% usage rate with 10.4 apg.   I'll never understand people who have a superiority complex and just assume others ignore data all because said person might not put weight on the same data points as they do."
Really quelled the massive Russell Westbrook fanbase with this zinger. This sub basically treats him like Curry
"Every 3-4 days, somebody looks at this sub and goes, “Y’know what, nobodies ever taken that Russell Westbrook down a peg.  Well, today’s that day.”"
For some reason my dumbass saw Russell and thought u were talking about Westbrook 😭 😭
Dame is beloved. He doesn’t get the criticism a Russell Westbrook would get.

"Analytics are not new. It's funny that you think that. Humans have been using math to figure out the best way to play games for a long time. We've gotten pretty good at it. Certainly, things like efficiency matter quite a bit. ""We can't track emotions"" is one of the silliest things I've ever read on this site. I didn't say that analytics could tell us absolutely everything about the game of basketball, just that it provided important information.  Math has solved chess, can land rovers on comets when launched a decade and a half earlier, has transformed baseball completely, can create powerful simulations that can predict the weather, or the shape of a landscape 1,000 years ago, or the path of tiny subatomic particles that are detectable for only the tiniest fractions of reality, far beyond our comprehension. I'm using a wildly complex mathematical machine right now to type up this comment, which will connect to an even greater network of more powerful calculators to send it to you, all in a few seconds. I'm pretty sure math can tell us who might be better than someone else at a certain basketball skill, or is basketball some unique, ineffable sport that defies all logic?   Basketball players do indeed have a lot of knowledge. They know an insane amount about how to play a game. They are not immune from bias, or popularity, or stupid thoughts. Some of the best NBA players are objectively SHIT at evaluating talent. MJ and Isiah Thomas spring to mind. Ever watch Inside the NBA? Do you come away thinking, ""wow, these guys sure know a lot about the league and its players!"" No, they have dumb takes that were outdated 10 years ago. When they're breaking down the inside-outs of the league, or how to approach an interpersonal problem among teammates, or what its like to bounce back from a tough loss, I listen, because they know more than me. When they say that Russell Westbrook is still one of the best players in the NBA, I tune it out because they obviously have no idea what they're talking about. They're attracted to his machismo, his individual creation, his attitude towards the game and his high-flying antics. They ignore the fact that he's bad when he doesn't have the ball, can't shoot for shit, loves turning the ball over, and never hustles unless he's at the center of attention. I don't blame them. They're part of a confraternity of players and they look out for each other. But that doesn't mean they're right.  As for LeBron knowing what's best for himself, even in the worst-case scenario, LeBron is about 10x the primary ball handler that WB is. Sure, he needs someone to take the load off in the regular season. What happens during the playoffs? Is WB gonna play catch and shoot? Or is he going to use up a bunch of possessions that should be handled by LeBron, jacking up terrible shots? I think we already know the answer."
"Yeah man first names always through me off in the NBA, like someone will say Russell for Russell Westbrook and I'm just like no..."
"Yeah, for example, you think Kobe is the 3rd best player of all time!  Ok, sorry, I couldn't resist. But I don't really see why NBA players would automatically be smarter than everyone else when it comes to evaluating talent. They value different things. They have personal relationships with these players. And they generally eschew analytics, which is silly. Of course, they know a lot about basketball. A lot! But they're very protective of their own. They always want to see the positive. You've gotta be ruthless when evaluating talent in a sport like this where the cream of the crop is so much more valuable than everyone else, and overpaying the wrong guy is a death sentence for a franchise. Fuck, LeBron actually thought getting Russell Westbrook would be better than getting Buddy Hield."
The hilarious part is that it would be horrendous if you were comparing him to any other main iso scorer   except Russell Westbrook

"Au contraire, the Bucks PG is Jrue Holiday and the Lakers is Russell Westbrook"
"you’re taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton’s age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn’t do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn’t do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than Sexton😂 he’s passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you’re talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton’s entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
"&gt; The Lakers might have hoped to use their cap space in trade, but with Russell Westbrook opting to restructure and extend his contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder, few if any real options surfaced.  Also lol  &gt; If, for example, the Sacramento Kings decided to part ways with DeMarcus Cousins – something they are not currently considering – the Lakers would be required to send out $11,957,900 in salary."
"Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Dennis Schroeder, Marc Gasol"
Russell Westbrook&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Russell Westbrook.
"&gt;And then we replaced Dennis Schröder with Russell Westbrook.  Oh you mean the Westbrook who carried the Wizards to (checks notes) 8th seed in the East?  He's also struggled these past couple of years. He's an improvement over Schroder but he's not someone who can carry a depleted roster anymore.  &gt;They had Murray for most of the season…  They actually won more after he got injured. They went from a ~50-win pace to a ~60-win pace. He's huge for them in the playoffs but he's generally nothing amazing in the regular season.   &gt;What you don’t seem to understand is Jokic misses even 10 or 15 games and the Nuggets are fucked.   Jokic has missed 2 games over the last 3 seasons in total. That's 268 games played out of a possible 270.  Which is why the Nuggets have been 3rd, 3rd and 2nd in the West over the past 3 seasons.   &gt;(unlikely for LeBron)  Huh?  In his 3 LA seasons, you've been 10th and 7th seeds precisely because he's started to miss significant time to injuries. He's one of the most durable players in NBA history, but he is slowing down now.  &gt;If Jokic gets injured, the Nuggets are left with Monte Morris and MPJ.  And if your aunty had a dick she'd be your uncle."
"&gt; Right...So the best team in the West nearly missed the playoffs because your two stars were injured?  And then we replaced Dennis Schröder with Russell Westbrook.   &gt;One of those stars is getting older and starting to miss more and more time to injuries.   LeBron at any age would have missed time if a grown man fell on his ankle.  &gt;The other star has been injury-prone his entire career.  AD had about 5 straight healthy seasons before this year.   &gt;So banking on them being healthy isn't a sure thing.  Lmfao stop trolling.  &gt; Yeah and the Nuggets were still the 3rd seed... They don't need Murray to be a playoff team, that's why they're safer.  They had Murray for most of the season…  &gt;Which is the part of this you don't seem to understand. I'm not saying the Nuggets are a better team than LA but the odds that they make the playoffs is higher.  What you don’t seem to understand is Jokic misses even 10 or 15 games and the Nuggets are fucked. The Lakers have the luxury of missing 2/3 stars and still making the playoffs comfortably.    &gt;Healthy LA beats healthy Denver but there's a lot more that could go wrong for LA.  No, there’s a lot more that can go wrong for Denver since they’re literally relying on a solo carry job.   &gt;Jokic can carry them to the playoffs on his own and he's a lot less likely to get injured than LeBron/AD.  If one of those two gets injured (unlikely for LeBron), we would still have the remaining superstar to go along with Russell Westbrook.  If Jokic gets injured, the Nuggets are left with Monte Morris and MPJ."
" As a diehard understand, I’ll never forget that Kayde didn’t just go to Golden State. He went to the golden state team that he had a large part in blowing up 3 to 1 lead in the conference finals just a few months before the infamous “Hampton’s meeting”.    Sure it may have been a perfect fit with the team with three All-Stars already, but if he had stayed in OKC and manage to win one with Russell Westbrook (100% my favorite player of all time and forever will be, I consider myself a Laker fan this year to a degree because I want to wrestle I get that shit so bad) that title would’ve meant so much more especially for his legacy.  Congrats on the finals MVP, but it would’ve meant more if you had been able to do it in Oklahoma City in a small market and what fucked up isn’t he didn’t even text Russ.   I’m not from Oklahoma but I became a fan of the NBA when we got a chain here, so I’m not exactly delusional in my ability to recognize that we were blessed with a team that was horrible for only a half a season, and then consistently a playoff team with finals aspiration.    With all those first round draft picks, and Sam Presti at the helm with the record of developing their draft picks exceptionally well I can only be excited for the future as Oklahoma City thunder basketball"
"No matter the hate, you can’t deny that he was a perfect fit for that Warriors team in all the ways that he was a terrible fit with Russell Westbrook. That’s why he went."
Russell Westbrook is throwing a party over this shit this coming weekend lol
No but it is Russell Westbrook day
"Yeah, but before he got hurt he was really good for a long time. And the team that drafted him turned him into a (pretty good) year of Russell Westbrook and then Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the No. 22 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft. Not bad considering the contract."
Literally the only reason you got James Harden. Lmfao.   And Chris Paul. And sort of Russell Westbrook too.   Also the same reason you have years of the lottery coming up too.
"As a Miami Heat fan, I would redo the 2008 NBA Draft. We had the 2nd overall pick and we picked Michael Beasley who became arguably the worst draft bust in Heat history.  We could have picked Russell Westbrook! Imagine him in the backcourt with a prime Dwyane Wade? Or we could have picked Danilo Gallinari if we really needed a PF.  Alternatively, we could have picked Devin Booker over Justise Winslow in the 2015 NBA Draft! We had the 10th overall pick."
"If you read the article, it provides a link to the source. But since you're dense, I'll link that one too:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2654304-kevin-durant-reportedly-told-russell-westbrook-hed-re-sign-with-thunder  You feel better now buddy?"

Russell Westbrook ofc
"Sir, you just described Russell Westbrook."
The injury of Russell Westbrook comes to mind
I think being on a team with Russell Westbrook and Lebron James would be the best bet for keeping his attitude in check as well
"Donovan is way more popular than Jokic, are you kidding?  We're talking about a high flying guard that drops 50 pieces in the playoffs and beat Russell Westbrook in the playoffs as a rookie vs a big center that passes and has no vertical.  How many people even still talk about that quadruple OT game they had against the Blazers in the playoffs?  Nobody, because people were watching other teams.   &gt;I don’t get the Luka thing either.  Do you happen to own real estate under a rock?  Everybody talks about Luka, and he just came in 4th for jersey sales."
Russ played at an incredible level individually no doubt but when you look at the seasons before and after his MVP it was really such an anomaly that he won it for leading his team to the league's 10th best record.      |Year|Player|Wins|Conference rank|League Rank| :--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|63|1|1| |2018-19|Giannis Antetokounmpo|60|1|1| |2017-18|James Harden|65|1|1| |2016-17|Russell Westbrook|47|6|10| |2015-16|Stephen Curry|73|1|1| |2014-15|Stephen Curry|67|1|1|
"I cannot overstate just how many NBA superstars would have been dejected and checked out, after seeing their teams’ championship window suddenly slam shut when just two months earlier they were a game away from the Finals with an extremely bright future for the next several years.     Instead, Russell Westbrook took a team that was built around KD, a team that got zero assets in his departure, and said “fuck it, I’ll just do it myself then.”    He willed the team to a playoff spot, averaged 31 PPG, won the scoring title, MVP and averaged a triple double.     That’s unheard of. Most superstars would demand a trade in that situation, or at least phone it in for the next season.     Westbrook really is a different animal. He regularly dropped 40-50 points on the extremely stacked Warriors that year, despite the defense completely focusing on him since he was the only offensive threat."
"Being traded twice back to back is essentially the same as being traded once. You don’t move twice…  Now russell Westbrook? Now, THAT man gets passed around the league like a Kardashian."
Bill Russell Westbrook Lopez are the 3 on 3 kings though
"Nope. Just looked it up. There's a whole article on on it. Quote   ""Russell Westbrook has the highest field goal percentage(57.1%) of any player in clutch situations (min. 50 FGA), which are defined by the final five minutes of regulation and overtime when the game is within five points""  It's a real stat. Just proves that stats don't tell the whole picture.  Google this and the numbers show up. Yup. Crazy huh. Dude can do that in the regular season and be ass in the playoffs clutch time."
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense— some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange— I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"
I know y’all won but come on man. Don’t do that. Plus you guys lost PJ and they added Russell Westbrook.
"Uhhh LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook?"
"Russell Westbrook signed his contract extension with the Thunder on September 29th, 2017.   On Kevin Durant’s birthday."
"According to your formula, prime Russell Westbrook (32/11/10) is worth $79m?"
Russell Westbrook ❤️❤️
"Russell Westbrook -Kevin Durant -James harden  9x Scoring titles, 3 MVPs, 4x Assist leaders, 25x All-NBA, 29 all star appearances between the three of them so far....  So fucking crazy"
"Kevin Love, Chris Bosh, Alex Caruso, and current Russell Westbrook aren't superstars."
"Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook."
You quoted the statement and said Russell Westbrook and Beverly as an example. What a dumb ass example.
Russell Westbrook on a Farm type beat
"**Russell Westbrook**  Dude is an incredible athlete and is super fun to watch. Individually, he can do so much for your team that it's hard for some to understand that for all he's putting on the table, he's taking so much off of it that you're essentially playing from behind if you're trying to win a championship, or even a few playoff rounds. All of this has been said before but so many people are blinded by the triple doubles and the attitude that they forget just how horrible his playoff record is, especially after his early career, and just how many shots he essentially pisses down the drain every game because of his ego. Even in his absolute prime, he put a cap on what a team could accomplish because he's just too much of a ball-hog and inefficient. It would be a lot easier to stomach if he was a great off-ball player or defender, but he's just not. What he *is* is one of the best floor-raisers of all time, but he's also a very dangerous ceiling-lowerer. Can you really be a GREAT player if you make it harder for a neutral team to win a championship? I say no. You need efficient offense to win in the NBA and he just does not provide that. I do like the way he dresses, though."
"Nobody's ever explained the Russell Westbrook celebration for me. Why is the act of putting guns in the holster the part that goes ""BOOM""?"
All that bullshit went out the window the day he purposely tried to injure Russell Westbrook....as he does to other star players who are superior to him
"That is quite literally what they said. They said the reason they changed it was because of Russell Westbrook. They claimed it “didn’t pass the smell test” that he was #1  I’m not saying “it’s not a coincidence they changed it after 16-17”, the creators of the stat themselves directly said they changed it because of Russ  The other “inherent flaws” in the stat were stuff that had affected players for decades. They didn’t bother to change it until 2016-17."
"&gt;	Anyone who says Russ isn’t lazy on defense is lying or doesn’t know what they’re talking about.  “I am unable to actually argue for this point so I’m just going to insult the other person”  I accurately explained the nature of his defensive weaknesses and how they’re different from what you’re saying. I actually watch him play.  And nothing you said disproves the other point about VORP. The weaknesses in the stat didn’t matter for decades, until Russ shattered the record and all of a sudden it NEEDED to be instantly changed. They literally came out themselves and said they changed the stat because of Russell Westbrook.   You can’t use a metric that was specifically changed to make an individual player look worse, as evidence that that player is overrated. That’s horrible analysis."
"They said on the broadcast tonight that only 4 players in NBA history have 100 or more triple doubles: Oscar Roberson, Magic Johnson, Jason Kidd and Russell Westbrook."
"It's a weird season with a wide open race, so something weird could happen, but Lebron really doesn't have a traditional MVP pedigree.   Since 2009, every MVP has led the league in PER except 2011 Derrick Rose and 2015 Stephen Curry. Lebron probably should have won MVP over Rose in 2011, and in 2015, Curry was 3rd in PER behind Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook, but those guys both missed double digit games, and Curry was on a 67-win team, while Davis was on the 8th seed, and Westbrook missed the playoffs.  Right now Lebron is 16th in PER.  Similarly, every MVP since 2009 except 2011 Rose and 2017 Westbrook have led the league in WS/48. Lebron is currently ranked 21st in this.  Not saying these stats are the end all, be all, but not being on a top seed, while being nowhere close to the top of some stats that the MVP is usually the leader in isn't a good sign for Lebron's MVP case.  With that said, Embiid is injured right now. No one in the media wants to give it to Giannis, Harden has the Houston situation and also his stats are less glamarous than usual (although he has a weird media thrust behind him), and Jokic/Butler/Curry/Lillard all have team record problems that will hurt their case, although for Jokic an Butler that might not be the case at the end of the season (don't think it's as likely for the Blazers/Warriors to make a run towards the top of the standings in the second half)."
"Russell Westbrook: ""If I could come back, in the NBA, I want to be Patrick Beverley. I don't want to be a superstar because I want to keep my knees good and all that. I want to be Patrick Beverley: come off the bench, foul anytime I want, ultra green light for injuring, fly when hit by a screen, just running around doing nothing &amp; chill."""
Does your Russell Westbrook pillow have holes in it?
Are your Russell Westbrook posters still hanging on both sides of your bedroom door?
"From Nov 2020: [John Wall surprised Wizards GM said they’re building around Beal](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2918551-report-john-wall-surprised-wizards-gm-said-theyre-building-around-bradley-beal)  &gt;	On Tuesday afternoon, Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic reported the Houston Rockets and Washington had discussed swapping John Wall and Russell Westbrook."
"Yes because the MVP is only won by defensive masterminds such as the likes of *checks notes* James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Stephen Curry"
"Now that all 13 are out I'll bite the bullet and rank my personal peaks based on these videos alone.  1. Lebron James, simply put that version of Lebron is quite literally unstoppable on both sides of the court.   2. Shaquille O'Neal, I would have him #1 but in terms of offensive dominance only Steph really rivals him but in other avenues.  3. David Robinson, yes really, criminally underrated stretch for him that gets overshadowed by Hakeem. In those years he was either scoring leader, blocks leader, DPOY, or all of those.  4. Steph Curry, really wanted to have him higher and don't get me wrong Steph is an underrated defensive player but the 3 ahead of him brought it both ways at a high level but Currys offense alone catapults him over a bunch of 2 way guys in this list.  5. Kevin Garnett, another one that's probably a head scratcher but hear me out. At his peak he was an MVP, first team all defense, first team all nba, and was able to drag a lifeless team to the WCF as a supposed not #1 option. We can have the debate about Duncan being better all time which is not debatable imo but I've always said I'd take peak Garnett over Peak Duncan.  6. Michael Jordan, this isn't to say Jordan isn't better than these ppl, just that the stretch Ben chose (although valid) I personally would have gone back a year on each to account for 1988 when he was DPOY, MVP, but to each their own.  7. Tim Duncan, again like Garnett you had someone who was MVP, First team all nba and defense, and was winning finals MVPs. I guess I underestimated his defensive value because I only watched him 2010 and on when (to me) it seemed like he was just a post defender.  8. Hakeem Olajuwon, really Hakeem should be higher but like Jordan, his PEAK wasn't much better than his career (which is a compliment) so he falls to the wayside.  9. Larry Bird, now this is tough because Larry was god tier on both sides of the ball but not quite dominant in the sense that ppl like Shaq or Hakeem were.   10. Kobe Bryant, this is tough again because the game was different and Kobe's game was heavily ""mid 2000s"" with tons of mid range jumpers and contested fadeways. The fact that he was first team all defense while averaging 35 a game says something though.  11. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, tremendous peak but really he was good for his entire career even until his 40s which hurts him IMO. 6 MVPs with his first being in 1971 and the last being in 1980 means his career was basically a peak, much like lebron.  12. Magic Johnson, wasn't too impressed with his video and this is me being young and not understanding his impact. Very good offensive player but very poor defensive player on anyone who was laterally quick and didn't play in the post.  13. Bill Walton, least impressive peak by far but not someone I even expected on this list. Never knew how good of a passer and shot blocker he was.  He didn't post these but here are some good honorable mentions:  - 08/09 Dwyane Wade - 17-19 James Harden - 15-17 Russell Westbrook - 90-93 Charles Barkley - 16-18 Lebron - 07-09 Lebron - 75-78 Julius Erving"

I thought after Russell Westbrook we all stopped giving a shit about triple doubles lol
Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Jokic
Like Russell Westbrook you mean. Can't count on him to make a good decision when it matters most.
"Because his stats aren't good enough. He's 12th in PER right now, which won't cut it for MVP. The last MVP winner to not lead the league in PER was Curry during the 14-15 season, and that one was a special exception because the two people ahead of him, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook missed 14/15 games each, and AD was on the 8th seed while Westbrook missed the playoffs."
Giannis “Russell Westbrook” Antetokounmpo
"James Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook  The first basketball I watched was the OKC 3"
"Lol what? That video shows Russ passing the ball. You are literally cherry picking from Russels 6000+ assists to make it look like you can stat pad assists. So let me get this right, if there is a pass first PG who continually looks to pass the ball first and racks up a lot of assists that’s not stat padding, but if Russell Westbrook decides to play the game with the intention to pass first he is a stat padder. If a PG is a score first PG and he continually looks to score first he is an amazing scorer, but if Russell Westbrook decides that he wants to play the game with the intention to score first he is a stat padder."
Russell Westbrook really has just hit two season highs on us in two games.
"And no Bamba is a faster sprinter than John wall. https://www.stack.com/a/gigantic-nba-prospect-mo-bamba-can-sprint-faster-than-russell-westbrook-and-john-wall  I can’t understand you thinking combine stats are going to win you this argument. People have seen klay play at his athletic peak, and to call him unathletic at that time is absurd. He’s not elite by nba standards but he is good laterally. It would be impossible for him to guard the elite guards 30+ mins a night if he were the level of athlete you’re trying to portray him as. Fact is he took the toughest backcourt matchup every night in a stacked west for years on teams that were great defensively. He’s not an elite shutdown guy but he is good because of his combo of length, lateral agility, and feel."
Probably. Russell Westbrook is also up there. Sadly another inefficient player is oladipos teammate is John wall. 21ppg on 52% TS.
"""Anthony, that's a nice suit you're wearing!""  ""It would probably look better on Russell Westbrook tho."""
Then you don't remember Russell Westbrook.

Russell Westbrook. You cant ever get bored watching him play basketball and also the passion he has and his never say die attitude

HAPPY RUSSELL WESTBROOK DAY
Russell Westbrook Thunder jersey is one of the few non Miami Heat jerseys I own. People can crap on him all they want there's very few players I've ever had as much fun watching as Russ when he's on.
"The league is getting so small that a rebounding guard doesn't have the same value as they once did.  Whether or not a guard gets rebounds depends on whether or not his coach sends him to the basket on shots when playing defense.  It's really more of a coaching strategy of getting the ball to the PG the fastest and heading the other way down the floor.  There are the Russell Westbrook and James Harden types of the NBA world that can certainly influence a coach's decision in whether to employ this strategy. But minus a few exceptions - great overall players - it's comes down to whether or not the coach thinks this is good strategy (which considers the talent of the other players on the team as well).  If a player is pretty average at everything but a really good rebounder, I don't think it would help his chances all that much of making an NBA roster unless the coach used that strategy.  About the only exception to this is when a team doesn't hardly have any good rebounders and the guard is actually one of the best, if not the best, rebounder on the team.  Then, out of necessity being a good rebounding guard would certainly be a benefit.     90% of the players that get a rebound in the NBA think they're a guard anyway."
"Heck nawl, maybe to an average joe on the street he’s a freak but IMO that term is reserved for people like Russell Westbrook"
Im not saying he is not stat padding his rebound. Im saying he has never cared more about stats then wins.  And also Im saying free throw rebounds and a big boxing out apparently only matters when its Russell Westbrook
"In past 30 years, every MVP-winners lead their team to 1st/2nd seed. Russell Westbrook is the only exception and it's because of his triple double."
"not a popular op but i actually agree with him. Dude's game is still the same as when he entered the league. And funny enough, he's also got the 'russell westbrook' attitude to playing i.e. stubbornness. Philly should trade him while half the league still thinks he's good."

He also had to play with Kevin freaking Durant and Russell Westbrook
"What a random comparison. Russell Westbrook, even if he is better than KPJ, is one of the worst contracts in the NBA. The Wizards would move off of him in a second if they could."
"The thing to remember here is that basketball is a team sport. The objective is for your team to score more points than the opposing team, not for one individual to score more points than other individuals.  Russell Westbrook relatively recently led the league and scoring with a triple double, and was at best the 6th best player in the league. Wilt scored 50 PPG, but Bill Russell led a defense that gave up 6.5 points per 100 possessions fewer than the league’s second best defense.   Wilt only beat Russell when he played drastically differently scoring 24 PPG and 20 PPG in the playoff series against Russell. And that wasn’t a fluke, that was Wilt being the best version of himself."
And saying that while Russell Westbrook is on the screen?   Bold.
He started fighting with russell westbrook then got benched a play later. On top of having to deal with embiid....rough night for mo
Wagner allowing baseline in lieu of noted rim protector Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook has the same amount of scoring titles as Kobe, Shaq and T-Mac, and more scoring titles than LeBron, Melo and Wade."
Is Russell Westbrook drunk?  https://youtu.be/8jz9M4LIRD0
"And? Steve Nash and Russell Westbrook were some of the worst defenders in the league in their primes. Hell, Dame Lillard and Beal are some of the worst defenders right now."
Tall Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook?
"[Full article here, worth a read](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4xzq49/russell-westbrook-the-legacy-of-khelcey-barrs)  Yeah it was on court, during a practice game, and it was heart problems.  [Also interview with Westbrook about it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEDFvzJ3NVs)"
Kevin Durant and Russell “Next Question” Westbrook
"Ok, so what about Rockets Harden and OKC Harden made then different players? Could it have been his role in the offense behind Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Similar to how Wade was playing behind LeBron James, therefore putting up less volume stats?"
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
"Russell Westbrook also has a lot of triple doubles.  I think it's a little ""funny"" (read: racist) that Luka is a God for getting so many triple doubles but Russ is a joke.  Not trying to defend Russ here, he is definitely a joke to me (Blazer fan)."
"&gt; Gary, PJ, Green and Sap have all missed close to or more than double digit games.   Right, but that's one starter and then your bench players. Imagine if Murray and Jokic were both hurt. Plus you still have injuries from guys like Harris. Where would your team be right now?  And like I said, we only started getting credit for those injuries because things turned around. Without the recent 4-game win streak we'd be getting the exact same complaints we were getting 2 weeks ago, the same complaints Murray has been dealing with.  It's not a small market matter, injuries don't get taken seriously until the player is either healed back up or run out of the league. Look at Paul George, Russell Westbrook, etc etc.   Also, as much as Boston has a big internal market, we're really not a big market team on the national stage. Half our roster is unknown for the national commentators."
Russell westbrook ahead of Dwight and CP3 nah
"It would be hard but NOT unlikely for this to happen. Reasoning is usually if two players of their caliber were to both have 50 it would most likely be a blow out. Steve Nash is not leaving in his two star players in a meaningless regular season game to have the potential of an injury.   This may however occur in the playoffs, let’s say if the Nets are #1 &amp; the Wizards end up #8. Russ/Beal vs Kd/Harden/Irving .. this would have the makings of high scoring affair and I could see even a 40/40 duo. Durant and Westbrook have already achieved this feat, they became the first teammates in NBA history to score atleast 40 points twice in the same season.  Kevin Durant 51, Russell Westbrook 40 On February 19, 2012  Russell Westbrook 45, Kevin Durant 40 On March 23, 2012"
"Russell Westbrook makes one really funny quote about pat bev now everybody thinks he's a scrub that doesn't belong on the court, despite multiple all-defense teams and always playing 25+ mins per game over the last decade. scrubs don't consistently get minutes on great teams for that long while making all-defensive teams"
"After Kevin Durant left OKC, Russell Westbrook has gone 119/319 for a spicy 37.3% rate of triple doubles.  That's right, Russell Westbrook over the past five seasons is more likely to get a triple double in a game than he is to make an individual 3 point shot."
Russell westbrook has really made it hard to realize just how rare triple doubles are

For comparison-  Oscar Robertson had 181/1040 or 17.4%   Magic Johnson had 138/906 or 15.2%   Russell Westbrook is currently at 156/905 or 17.2%
"""Hey Sixers fans, one of the best and most beloved players in the history of the franchise that I'm running didn't have shit on the best player on the previous team I ran!""  Allen Iverson did absolutely nothing better than James Harden currently does. He probably wasn't even better than prime Russell Westbrook."
"Let’s see James harden has played with Dwight howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook. All future hall of famers and dude has had mind blowing terrible performances in the playoffs."
"I don’t hate when Portland plays Russell Westbrook or Steph Curry (Lillard usually steps it up a notch, so it’s always a good game)"
Russell Westbrook
"Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Lebron James and Russell Westbrook are the only players to ever average 30/7/7 lol  Jayson Tatum is obviously not averaging that"
"Easily one of the worst posts I've ever seen on this sub. not only is the argument horrible but this guy has:  1. got on his alts here in the comments defending the posts saying the same thing over and over again not realizing how easy it is to spot 2. He has just the 'source' *as a website without the direct link*. how much more pathetic can it get that you can't link to the actual data itself? pbpstats is great. doubt he knows how to use it tho  \&gt;So he pretty much keep his scoring efficiency up in the playoffs without a star guard aside from a massive anomaly year in 2014 (likely shooting luck)  If you like disregarding the historical data we have about Durant in OKC shooting *below league average for the last 3 post seasons in OKC* at the height of his career on a stacked thunder roster, then ya: let's just chuck it up to 'shooting luck, right?  When KD shot 57, 57, ***54*** TS% his last respective years in OKC, was it just shooting luck?  Was it shooting luck when Westbrook outperformed KD twice in the same postseason *when it came to shooting efficiency and turnovers*?  That's right: Durant--the seven foot guard who can score from """"""""""anywhere'''""'''''--got outshot by Russell Westbrook (one of the least efficient high volume players ever) at their peaks and lost against Curry"
"Oh what a great strategy to have your point guard ignore the other teams point guard on defense and let them rain 3s so he can pad his rebounding  Harden averaged 8 RPG once. He usually hovered around 6-7. For a 6’5 strong player, that’s not surprising. We didn’t scheme for him to get rebounds  Rondo and kidd, both elite defenders. Russ was far from that.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thebiglead.com/amp/posts/is-russell-westbrook-padding-his-rebounding-stats-by-leaving-his-defender-stats-say-he-is-01dmny0ph0z4  It’s fine if you want to defend Russ but don’t pretend you know the first thing you’re talking about"
"Russell Westbrook has a lot of flaws, but no one can question the fact that he gives 110% on the field.  He does everything he can to make his team win.  This total energy expenditure leads him to have a lot of waste in his game, but that's part of his game."
It was only a matter of time before they turned things around. A team with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook wasn’t gonna be bad forever.
Is Kyle Lowry really better than Russell Westbrook lol
Russell Westbrook is literally your favorite player's favorite player
"Nets really combined the Clippers and Thunder superteams minus Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook of course, and replaced those two with Kyrie."
"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
"Nets really combined the Clippers and Thunder superteams minus Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook of course, and replaced those two with Kyrie."
"Yeah but it’s MVP, Rose was more valuable to the Bulls success that season than LeBron was to the Heat. LeBron was for sure the better player but MVP doesn’t necessarily go to the best player every year(examples are Russell Westbrook over Kawhi or Harden, or both of Giannis MVP seasons over LeBron and Kawhi). D-Rose stats on the season were worse and less efficient because he had to carry a team with lots of injuries and Kurt Thomas getting major minutes. That’s why D-Rose got MVP, no one in their right mind would say Rose was a better player that season."
"he was never russell westbrook level bad at shooting threes tho, at least since he started shooting threes lol"
I think 2016 Russell Westbrook was the perfect mix of 1a/1b option for a championship team while 2017 Westbrook was a bit more ball dominant but not quite good enough for a championship player.
"So one of the best rebounding, worst defending guards would be better if he just did more of the shit he is shitty at? That's your answer for how to fix Russell Westbrook?   Don't use so many words to type goofy shit."
"Overall he's good. He's drafted pretty good, signed Gordon Hayward, who is the biggest free agency signing in franchise history, and somehow managed to convince Michael Jordan to draft LaMelo Ball instead of trading for Russell Westbrook. I like Russ, but Melon is obviously younger and fits our timeline more. That Terry Rozier signing is looking great, he very much deserves that contract, and he's built a solid young team.   I don't entirely fault Mitch for offering that contract to Trez. He is a young center, which we need, but obviously I wouldn't give him that money either. But small markets have to overpay to get people to actually sign with them, hence the Hayward deal (although I never hated the contract, and he is playing up to it right now)"
I love Russell Westbrook and always will

Russell Westbrook hasn't exactly delivered basketball results recently either
Is there a player for whom the disparity in perception between other players/coaches and the basketball scientists of reddit is greater than Russell Westbrook?
"I mean steven adams is one of the best big men in the league. This deal looks like a steal. He was always better than russell westbrook and paul george at OKC at playing winning basketball, he just doesn't put up a lot of counting stats.  If you watched games you'd think this was a bargain."
"Steven Adams, Rudy Gobert, Kemba Walker, and Russell Westbrook."
"Otto porter, Russell Westbrook, kevin love, formerly Blake griffin, John wall, kemba walker, and Andre Drummond  would be a good place to start."
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."

"Look, I'm fucking sick of people calling the Jazz a racist organization. Give me one proven instance where someone in the organization has done something racist. Are there going to be racist ass hat fans? Of course. But it's not a Utah Jazz problem.  Here's when Dennis Lindsey texted a beat writer about a piece on racial equality:  “Gordon, thanks for the article two days ago. I was late reading it, but my wife said you knocked it out of the park! You did. Sport can lead in the area of diversity. We have a great state full of good people, which gives us a start to lead by being on the right side of this issue. But we cannot equivocate on [it]. There is just so much ignorance. When a basic historical period like Reconstruction comes up, I cannot believe how many educated people cannot hold a basic conversation on this issue and the problems with that period. Given the atrocities that came before and the point of racial equality now, it keeps me up at night. Keep spewing the truth. And feel free to share this text widely. I am proud of your efforts. It is way more important than a game, which ironically is illuminating this dynamic. Sincerely, Dennis.”  How come the investigation turned up literally zero evidence of anyone in the Jazz organization being racist?  Look at what Donovan said after the whole Russell Westbrook incident:  “In this business, to have your owner to be so forward and so out there to back us the way she did, and to back Russell, that’s amazing. That’s the incredible thing about the NBA, as we all know all sports aren’t like that,"" Mitchell said. “She’s been been open and honest, and in my two years knowing her, that’s one of the things I respect. Everything you hear about the Miller family is nothing but positive, and this is just another instance of that.”  I love the Jazz and wish people would stop shit smearing them. And if anyone wants to say that the Jazz as an organization have racially based issues, give me a citation. I don't know what Elijah Millsap heard, but it makes no sense for a guy with 20+ NBA experience and a history of activity for racial equality just wake up one day and decide to be racist. This is bullshit."
"For those saying that Shaq has had a change of heart, I don't necessarily think that it is.  I don't think that Shaq has ever or would ever say that Chuck wasn't a great player because he doesn't have a ring. Not only would this be a nasty take to have about somebody who was supposed to be your friend, it'd just be untrue. Shaq has his moments but he's not stupid.  On the other hand, I think that Shaq definitely buys into the idea of number of rings being used to measure great players against each other. When asked to pick between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, he picked Big Bill because of ""rings"". He admitted to tearing his house up after Kobe got 5 when he had 4. When he bullies Chuck about rings, he's not saying ""your opinion doesn't matter because you didn't win."", he's usually saying ""your opinion shouldn't beat out *my opinion* because I have more rings than you do.""  Not saying it's the correct mentality, I just think that's where Shaq is. Would Shaq ever say that Russell Westbrook wasn't a great player? Absolutely not. But he might pick a player like Richard Hamilton over him."

"Steph is an elite rebounder at the pg position. Outside of Russ, bron, Luka, Simmons (so like normal sized pgs who aren’t superheroes like Russell Westbrook lol) Steph is usually in the top 3 in rpg"

"My bad, was responding a couple of posts above to  u/inshamblesx about this offseason. My comment got lost in the overall thread.  I don't disagree he's inefficient, but some of that in Charlotte can be chalked up to his best teammate being who? Nic Batum, Dwight Howard, and Al Jefferson? Those Charlotte teams he had ZERO help so of course he's going to be a volume guy (a lot like Beal is right now, except Beal is a better scorer). This year I kind of blame the injury, as he's having his worst shooting year since 2014-15. I mean, could he be regressing back to that? Sure, but part of it has to do with the knee and him being less quick to his spots. He was an iron man in Charlotte, that's not really Ainge's fault.  Smart I agree has been less of a positive impact than in past years, but with their defense being so shaky, even if he has not been as good, can you really trade him when Boston has no defensive identity? It's a tricky situation that I think is going to depend on how Langford looks and then you can use either Brown/Fournier/Langford at the 2 spot and trade Smart when his value is at its highest (a lot of teams would want him and we could get a good return), or Brown/Smart/Langford. Fournier seems more like insurance to see what the team does in the playoffs as a Hayward-lite and what to do going forward. We do have his bird rights so we have flexibility there. But I can only guess on this, I'm not a GM.  This is a weird year overall with COVID impacting every team. How can you accurately assess an unprecedented situation? This applies to all teams.  Harden, KD and Westbrook were 3 very good players. KD was 2nd in MVP voting with 28 and 8, Westbrook was 12th in MVP voting with 24/5/6. Harden was 6th man of the year. Ibaka was 2nd in DPOY. You know who has a similar comp to that? Last year LeBron was 2nd in MVP, AD was 2nd in DPOY, Harrell won 6th man. The Lakers are a championship level team. Tatum, Brown and Kemba are not on that level. But we can't get LeBron.  I know you were responding to everyone I listed, but it's cherry picking to say PG and Melo got out (didn't win) and so did LeBron and Durant (did win), but then you can flip it around and say Lillard has been loyal (hasn't won) but then again so has Steph Curry (has won). And I know it's kind of an era ago, but Dirk eventually got a ring, Duncan never left and got a ring in 2014 against LeBron. Giannis might stay in Milwaukee his whole career and may win a ring, he may not. Lowry stayed in Toronto his whole career and they won because they honestly got lucky landing Kawhi and the GS injuries that finals. He only wanted to leave SA because of how they handled his injury. And there's a difference between Simmons wanting out and getting traded is my point. Brown was mentioned as a trading piece if we went after Harden. Would Harden be a better duo with JT than Brown is? Sure.  But building super teams or amassing a bunch of talent doesn't always work. The 2012 Lakers, PG to the Thunder, Lob City Clippers,  the Rockets ""helped"" Harden REPEATEDLY with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, then Russell Westbrook and he still demanded to be traded. It's playing with fire if as a GM you mortgage the future to build a contender now and it doesn't work. Clippers traded away a bunch of picks to land PG. What if they don't win? Milwaukee traded away picks to get Jrue, are they going to beat Brooklyn or Philadelphia? Everyone laughs about it now since the Nets are good, but when Billy King traded to get Garnett and Pierce to be competitive, dude got fired for how that ended up and is the only reason we have Tatum and Brown in the first place.  So if your concern is about their prime and fear they might want out, let me give you 2 scenarios:  1. Trade (because this year's FA doesn't have anyone that makes them contenders with how loaded Brooklyn is) for whoever is available now that is *very* good to put them over the top and teams are willing to just give you despite Ainge's reputation, and competing with Brooklyn's 3 All-Stars and all top 10 players, the Lakers having the best player in the world and Anthony Davis with our undersized front court, Philadelphia and Milwaukee loading up, and try to win as many championships as possible in the next 2-3 years before guaranteed rebuilding. 2. Keep your perennial playoff team good by putting pieces around your budding superstars and be an attractive FA destination, let these aging super teams fade in 2023 RIGHT when Tatum/Brown are in their prime and Brooklyn's big 3 contracts run out, Milwaukee has no 2023 first round draft pick as a trading chip, Embiid's contract is up and that's a serious question Philly has to answer if they want to pay an injury-prone big man when Harris and Simmons are both making over $30M, Kemba will be off the books freeing up cap space, LeBron will be 39 going on 40, and you can almost certainly bet a good team now is going to blow it up before then if they loaded up and don't win.  Flexibility is way more important right now than worrying about this season, because we aren't getting LeBron, Kawhi, Curry, Durant, Harden, Luka, or Giannis, and honestly, who else is worth it if we're REALLY trying to win now. Ainge pulled the trigger on MVP winner Kevin Garnett and the game's best shooter at the time in Ray Allen. Absolutely no way he does that for a guy to help Tatum/Brown unless he is MVP caliber in the current NBA landscape."

"The answer is no. He's got awful decision making on offense right now and is a truly non-existent passer. Like Hassan whiteside levels of selfishness  He's got some nice scoring chops for sure (he can get himself decent looks from mid off the dribble) and is an  elite 3 point shooter, but he doesn't have anywhere near the athleticism or driving ability that Beal does. He's bad around the rim  His defense atm is also more show than anything. It looks good, but he's not actually a good defender. He can't switch onto bigger guys without getting abused and he's often overly aggressive leading to lots of blowbys. I think he'll end up being good defensively eventually though, simply due to effort   In spite of all that, he's going to be really good. He's got a fucking insane work ethic and the dudes got that russell westbrook I'm gonna murder you type attitude.   He's just not going to be beal"
"Russell ""Goemon Ishikawa"" Westbrook"
"The way some players are treated by the media can be wildly different from others, and I think it's a mix of your point, and whatever made up reason there is to hate on them. Westbrook gets it because of the hero ball, first option, stat stuffer way he plays, and gets blamed fully for every failure his teams have, whereas someone with a better supporting cast averaging big assist numbers who doesn't win might not. Somehow Westbrook's 10+ assists aren't ""getting everyone involved"" to someone looking for reasons to criticise.  Look at LeBron and how he gets crucified by some members of the media for losing in the finals rather than not make it there. Compare that to idiots like Skip Bayless talking about it helping Jimmy Butler's legacy to take Miami there last season and get scudded.   Russell Westbrook almost certainly won't win a ring, and that's a bummer for someone as unbelievably talented as he is, but he'll just join a group of Hall of Fame players who didn't. No disrespect to Chauncey Billups, but is anyone not named Shaq ever going to take him and his ring over someone like Westbrook or Chris Paul without one?"
"I mean rookies are very rarely considered even average players in comparison to the whole NBA. Especially not Anthony Edwards. I don't see the surprise that Wolves are bad when they made him the first option for a big part of the season.   Edwards has the lowest true shooting percentage in the league among guys with such high usage; lower even the infamous chuckers like Russell Westbrook or Andre Drummond. The fun fact is that he doesn't even stand out that much in a team with Rubio, Okogi, McDaniels, Nowell or McLaughlin.  They're a bad team, although they are closer to average when they have Karl-Anthony Towns fit. Either way they will be among worst defences, but with KAT they are closer to average offensively.   Yeah they're tanking, I guess it was not the plan when they'd got Rubio or D'Angelo, but these guys didn't change nothing and it turned out like always."
"SAS is right though. It’s not that Russ didn’t have great teammates. It’s that his me-first play style will never bring team success.   It’s no coincidence that he’s often compared to Iverson and Rose. They never won rings either. Carmelo cut from the same cloth. Low IQ, very athletic, selfish.   When you’re in the finals and have KD and Harden on your squad, the point guard shouldn’t be taking by far the most shots on the team. But that was the case. Because that’s Westbrook’s play style. And as a result he “won” a MVP (which IMO should have gone to Harden) and averaged a triple double for quite some time. But would anyone, in a world where everyone is a free agent, looking to build a championship roster, pick him to be their PG? Absolutely not. Steph, Harden, Dame, and then arguably guys like Kyrie and Chris Paul are way more valuable to building a winning team culture and chemistry than Russell “get out of the way and let me get my rebound” Westbrook.  Russ wanted out of OKC. Let’s not pretend he wanted to stay there after Melo and PG left. He was gift wrapped to Houston, to play with his best friend, and they didn’t get along because he wanted to ball hog."
"“Rui Hachimura says he calls Russell Westbrook ‘senpai,’ which means ‘senior’ or ‘leader’ in Japanese.”"
" Rui Hachimura says he calls Russell Westbrook 'senpai,' which means 'senior' or 'leader' in Japanese."
"The net effect on your team is the same, dumb ass. Is Russell Westbrook a good shooter all of a sudden just because the shots he takes are terrible? I love how people bend over backwards to not call Doncic’s shooting awful in his first two seasons."
russell westbrook will be in the goat convo in 10 years while steven a will still have that weird ass mustache so
Russell Westbrook over there basking in it like Tanaka and Nishinoya guaranteed
"Here are his words:   &gt; ""Westbrook's numbers last night mean absolutely nothing to me because even though that's great numbers, that's what Westbrook can do. We all know this,"" Smith said. ""He's a former league MVP. He's the most athletic point guard we have ever seen in NBA history.  &gt;""But Bradley Beal and you are in the backcourt together and y'all are 17-28 in the Eastern Conference. ... You've played with some great, great players over the years, some talent. And not a single title to show for it.  &gt;""The numbers are the numbers. That's Russell Westbrook. He can do that to anybody. But I'm at a point in time in his career where it ain't about that no more. It's about whether or not you can get to another level to win the chip."""
"I don’t believe he’s saying it’s ring or bust at all. He’s basically saying yes Westbrook is a beast, but he can’t get to that next level of greatness until he wins a championship. Him putting up another season of triple doubles won’t necessarily do anything to add to his legacy. It doesn’t take away from the fact that Russell is a great player, he just can’t reach that next tier doing the same things he has done the last few years"
"It's not just the championships - if you have a team with a Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal backcourt, having a 12-29 record is a bit underwhelming."
"You think it’s hilarious I called prime Russell Westbrook an elite second option ...   Um ... uhhhh ... yikes ...  I see you edited the other comment. But in the prime of Westbrook’s career, even advanced stats had him painted as one of the best players, not just second options, in the entire league.   In 2016 he had an on off of +13 to KDs +6 in the playoffs. The Spurs literally previously described him as “overwhelming” and were forced to put Kawhi on him and not KD.   Stick to the KD super team trolling. This one not for you champ."
"I really don't get why people have their panties up in a bunch over this shit. I really don't care for SAS (or Westbrook for this matter), but I'm failing to see what SAS said that everyone is so upset about. I do admit I haven't really followed anything in detail, but it seems like it boils down to the following:  1. Westbrook is a stand up guy. I don't know him, I doubt anyone on this sub really does either. But all of his former teammates, coaches, people that do know him personally all say he is a great teammate and great person. I don't think anyone here disagrees with this (including SAS as he pointed out)  2. Westbrook, over the course of his career, has put up incredible numbers and put together all-time highlights. Again, like him or not, no one can dispute this. He literally accomplished something that hadn't been done in 50 years, regardless of how you feel he obtained those stats.  3. This is where people may disagree, but the point SAS I think is making is that Russell Westbrook's style of play is not conducive to winning basketball. This is sentiment I have seen promoted on this sub for years and years and years. Even going back to 2012, the question was always ""Is Westbrook holding Durant back?"", ""Does Russ need to shoot less and be a point guard more?"".  It's unfair that SAS phrases it in a way of saying ""no chips"". There are plenty of players who have no chips but we do not blast in this way. For example, Chris Paul definitely gets knocked a little for not having a ring, but not to the extent Westbrook does. BUT, I think part of the reason for this is that (in the general opinion of this sub) Chris Paul's style of play IS a winning style. There hasn't been as many stinker games/series that Paul had individually compared to Westbrook. Paul generally had worst teammates and worst luck injury wise. This is not my opinion, but the opinion I see of this sub having been a lurker/member since 2013."
Russell😂Westbrook😂
"Stephen A himself tried to be basketball player but wasn't even good in high school and decided ""hey, let me at least talk about it"", for the likes of Stephen A. Russell westbrook should be a hero,the one who made his dream come true."
"LeBron's numbers are all-time great per game averages for every player not named LeBron or Jordan. We're just accustomed to him so much by now we take 27/7/7 as his floor for granted.   I think the only stats Westbrook kind of pads are rebounds and even then he's still the best rebounding guard of all time. Your take comes with a lot of recency bias because Russ regressed quite a bit in the past 3 years. His best years were definitely during his OKC stint with his most impactful seasons being his MVP season and the years before that, playing alongside KD.   During this era Russ was greatly contributing to winning and straight up dominated CP3 in key-matchups and decisive games, got 2 game-deciding steals against him to win the game and carried the Thunder many many times. KD wasn't quite the player he's been ever since he joined GSW, he regularly struggled in the playoffs and his efficiency dipped a lot.   In those games and sometimes entire series Russell was the guy winning games for OKC. His play translated to all-time great seasons in terms of impact, during that time he was a Top 5 player in the league that could do it all.   The season after his MVP was the last season where Westbrook was consistently elite and in that season with PG Westbrook was still a hugely winning player, being +12 when he was on the floor. So the Thunder won by an elite margin when he was on the court. And this season is only on the back-end of his prime, he's had many better seasons before.   Westbrook will go down as a top10 PG of all time and rightfully so. We're watching a hobbled, consistently fighting with injuries version of Westbrook ever since he joined the Rockets. So there's some huge recency bias going on here if you're trying to press your ""argument"" onto Westbrook's entire career."
"From the SI article done about Russ when KD left.  ""Westbrook’s shell is tough, but you know you are cracking it when he starts calling you an “a‑‑hole” or a “piece of s---.” You’re really getting somewhere when he flips you off. The Thunder have understood this quirk of personality since June 2008, when he swaggered into the Furtado Center in Seattle for the first time. Marc St. Yves, the Sonics’ legendary equipment manager, greeted him at the front door. St. Yves wanted to know if Westbrook was going to stick with the number 0 he wore with the Bruins. St. Yves does not remember Westbrook’s exact response, but it was something like, “Get my f‑‑‑‑‑‑ zero ready.” St. Yves turned to the security guard and rolled his eyes. “This kid is going to be fun,” he said, shaking his head.  He had no idea. St. Yves now cusses Westbrook like a longshoreman and loves him like Gary Payton and Xavier McDaniel rolled into one. When St. Yves bought a Western Conference All-Star jersey for Westbrook to autograph two years ago, he pleaded, “Don’t write a--hole on this one.” That’s how you break the shell. “Russell takes a long time to feel comfortable with people, to trust people, but he realizes he has that here,” Collison says. “He knows he’s been treated well.”""  It sounds like Russ is weird and this guys friend didn't know how to read him."
I have been a habitual Russell Westbrook hater. His comments honestly made me a fan. Respect to him.
"Yeah, Russell Westbrook is the most scrutinized player in the NBA! 🙄"

What if Jordan Farmar didn’t go to the NBA?  &gt; Jordan Farmar held the key to Westbrook’s future as a Bruin. There was no getting around it.

"If there's ever a role model kids should look up to in the NBA it's Russell Westbrook. Hell, I look up to him myself. He's a very rare breed of people who are so good you'd think they only exist in movies."
"I always go with Jalen Rose's perspective when media members start shit talking players and calling draft guys busts. If you can make it to the NBA from poverty and you're able to buy your mom a house and set up generational wealth from the blood, sweat, and tears you spent from travel basketball to getting drafted then you can never be seen as a bust in my eyes. You accomplished something 99 percent of the world could never accomplish. Russell Westbrook has gone beyond this. He's a dude who went from living in poverty to going to UCLA as a back up to now coming into the NBA and putting up a career that's going to get him into the HOF. A black analyst like Stephen A Smith has to watch how he diminishes these dude's legacies on live TV."
"Is he more of a champion than any of the hundreds of bench riders or middle of the road talent players on NBA rosters that have won titles over the years? I say yes. Is Kyle Kuzma more of a ""champion"" than Russell Westbrook because he was on the right team?"
"Honestly what is Durant’s legacy going to look like in 20 years? Definitely a top 10 talent of all time but man the help that he’s needed and the social media drama has gotten him a bad rep. I like KD because of his talent but this guy is really unlikeable off the court. Pre-Dubs KD was so different.   **Before people bring up Bron, until he joined Miami Bron didn’t have anyone on his team close to as talented as Westbrook. If young Bron had Westbrook, Harden &amp; Ibaka he’s probably a champion or stays in Cleveland. Mo Williams &amp; Big Z aren’t going to win a championship with any NBA legend unless it’s Bill Russell."
"Not Boxing....and Russ wouldn't be a HW.  With weight cutting he would be a CW or LHW (200 and 175 pounds respectively).  At HW Russ would be undersized at 6ft 3 200 pounds taking on guys 6ft 5 - 6ft 9 some of whom can get up to 270.  Hell, there's a [6ft 5 guys down at 154 pounds named Sebastian Fundora.](https://cdn-wbn.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fundora-mandel.jpg)  &amp;#x200B;  I saw Harden and Russ [hit a bag once for some UFC thing](https://www.facebook.com/ESPN/videos/russell-westbrook-and-james-harden-punch-the-boxing-bag/2712076275490245/)....they do not have natural talent for throwing hands.  Maybe, with a lifetime of training they could have been great, but there are plenty of beginners who just show a lot more natural aptitude for punching and that gap would be hard to bridge. It's a different athletic skillset entirely compared to run and jump athletics and I don't think Russ had an aptitude for it.  Rondo and CP3 showed more skill in their dust up than Russ and Harden.  Nate Robinson is an example of a great run and jump athlete without an aptitude for the actual skills and physical gifts of Boxing"

"I was unemployed during the russell westbrook mvp year so I witnessed that shit unfold over time. With during the first 10 games everyone was like ""holy shit he's a man in a mission after KD left, imagine if he actually averages a triple double"" then the rest is history"
"&gt; More Russell Westbrook on Stephen A. Smith's comments: ""It’s been like that my whole career, honestly. There’s no other player that takes heat that I take constantly.""  Lebron definitely. And probably Kyrie/Harden and maybe KD as well. But Russ is definitely up there because he has such a polarizing personality and the fact that it feels like he's extremely stubborn and never changes in response to any criticism (not that he has to, but it definitely looks this way to many fans)"

"Except at the time a lot of the talk was about getting a PG and moving Westbrook to the 2 spot. Just an example, here was Chad Ford's draft projection on ESPN:  &gt; The Thunder will have an easy choice here if Rubio is still on the  board. Russell Westbrook can play off the ball, and he and Rubio would give the Thunder one of the best young backcourts in the NBA.   Harden was always going top 7 at worst but to call it a ""no-brainer"" is definitely revisionist exaggeration."

"Look man, I know that this sub doesn't like SAS. But if you actually watch the clip and don't stop at reading the line in the OP them I don't know how you can really be mad at what he said. All he's saying is he is not impressed by that statline because he knows Westbrook can do that. He gives Westbrook a lot of compliments but ultimately says that he has played with a lot of high level talent and hasn't won as much as Smith believes he should have.   This isn't slander, or hate. It's Smith talking about the topic at hand. Russell Westbrook and people in this thread are acting like he said he was a failure or something."
It was Garrison Mathews and Russell Westbrook screamed “that’s an offensive foul” Lmaoo
"His advanced stats aren’t great anymore but he’s on one of the worst teams in the league, a team that has been terrible for a few years now.  In 2017 and 2018 on the Thunder, Russell had .224 and .166 ws/48 on teams that didn’t have a ton of talent and the Thunder were 33-9 and 20-5 when he had a triple double. People back then said he was an empty stat ladder but his team did significantly better when he had more rebounds and assists.  Coming into tonight, the Wizards were 8-3 the last 11 games Westbrook has had a triple double. The wizards have a significantly better record this season when Westbrook gets a triple double.  If his stats are empty, why do his teams always win significantly more often when he has better stats?"

The way it was looked at was wins that he added just by being on the team. The team without him was horrendous one of  worst in the league. The fact they were in the playoffs was quite the accomplishment alone. I know people say you can say that about any team if you take their star off of it but this one was even more extreme.

There is not a single person on the planet who wouldn’t want to see Russell Westbrook play his heart out in another NBA finals. It’s a shame that this may never happen again.
How so? The Rockets would be paying Russell Westbrook the exact same amount when they're tanking anyways. Might as well take the extra first you got and have Wall lead the tanking job.

"They actually track uncontested rebounds and players like Russel Wetbrook (76.4%) and Luka Doncic (73.9%) have a majority of them uncontested. They grab like 2.3 contested rebounds a game. A player like Steven Adams has 49.1% contested rebounds and grabs 4.4 of them a game. One of my favorite on/off stats is rebounding and a player like Steven Adams who doesn't average a lot of rebounds actually significantly improves his teams rebounding (and Pelicans are the number 1 rebounding team in the league this year and Adams has been on number 1 rebounding OKC team in the league so this is saying a lot).  When Luka is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612742&amp;VsPlayerID=1629029&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) their team gets 49.3% of rebounds and when he is off the court they get 48.9% of rebounds so he slightly increases his teams rebounding by less than half a percent.  When Steven Adams is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612740&amp;VsPlayerID=203500) his team gets 54.5% of all rebounds. When he is off they get 51.8% which is a pretty good percentage and he makes a pretty good rebounding team a good amount better.  With Russell Westbrook is [on the court](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612764&amp;VsPlayerID=201566) his team gets 47.6% of rebounds and when he is off his team actually gets a good amount more at 49.7%. He actually makes a mediocre rebounding team worse. However, have to remember on/off is finicky and if you cycle through a couple different years, there has been years Westbrook has made his OKC teams better at rebounding in terms of on/off by a decent amount."

Russell Westbrook is the poster boy for overrated player who all sizzle and no steak. It's SMH the people defending him.

People have GOT to learn there's more to being good in the NBA than all the machismo Kobeesque bullshit that actually gets in the way of winning. FFS he's a bad player. Amazing athlete but his head is just not screwed on in the win position. He's a try hard.
It's on the post:  Russell Westbrook - 16td / 38gp   Darrell Walker - 15td / 283gp   John Wall - 7td / 573gp   Wes Unseld - 7td / 984gp
"Russell Westbrook for the season: 30 percent from 3, 60 percent from the line, 49.6 percent true shooting. Oh but he had a good game. Never mind, no more Russell Westbrick then. Makes sense"
"Russell Westbrook is good today, and he'll be great until he drops another dud"
Washington Wizards legend Russell Westbrook
\-Statpadded rebounds stolen from his center  \-passed up open looks to get fake assists  \-scored mickey mouse points to get a triple double  Russell Westbrook has zero real triple doubles in my book!
One thing you can never say about russell westbrook is that he doesnt give it his all. Dude give 110 every night.
-Russell Westbrook has entered the chat-
Russell Westbrook. All his triple doubles are fake since he doesn't contribute enough to winning. Still waiting for a real one /s
I love Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook for me
I love Russell Westbrook. Even when I hate Russell Westbrook I love Russell Westbrook.
I am here for Russell Westbrook love
I love Russell Westbrook.
"On March 29, 2017, Russell Westbrook tallied 57 PTS, 13 REB, and 11 AST to propel the Thunder to a 114-106 victory over the Magic."
"Unlike Gobert, Bill was the finals MVPs on those teams. So you can’t compare the two. Gobert has literally been benched in the playoffs because that improved Utah’s odds of winning those games. That would never happen to Russell.   Again regular season is pointless when talking about what it means for players legacies. Why do media heads go around looking like fools proclaiming the Utah Jazz as the team to beat when we all know they’re getting their ass wooped in the 2nd round? They spent so much time hyping up the raptors in 2018 for being the first seed and talking shit about Lebron and saying he doesnt want to win all year because he had a dogshit roster without kyrie and Kevin love underperforming and he wanted to add more pieces until he swept that overrated ass team without even trying. I’m not saying I’d take Westbrook over Mitchell and I’m not saying shaq is super well informed but his mentality is that he’s taking guys who have performed well in the playoffs over reg season sensations. Imo it doesn’t apply to Donovan vs Westbrook because Donovan actually performs really well in the playoffs but it’s the same reason why the media keeps gassing up Giannis (and Embiid this year) just to see them get their ass beat by players who know what the reg season is for."
"buyouts are unnecessary. if a team wants a player, trade some assets or gtfo.  it's not like the player is stuck either. John Wall, Russell Westbrook, and Chris Paul all got traded with epic, massive contracts."
"How tall is Russell Westbrook you’re on thin ice  Edit: you’re safe this time, he’s 6’3"
If a rookie played like Russell Westbrook they’d get a ton of ROTY consideration
"Imagine Russell Westbrook with less rebounds and assists, more points, and James Harden levels of free throws"
LITERALLY FUCK SCOTT BROOKS AND RUSSELL WESTBROOK
LITERALLY FUCK SCOTT BROOKS AND RUSSELL WESTBROOK
LITERALLY FUCK SCOTT BROOKS AND RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"You can’t deny that he definitely had a down year in 18-19, especially in the playoffs. Most guards don’t recover when their play starts to fall off. They go the way of Isaiah Thomas, Allen Iverson, and now, Russell Westbrook. CP3 is the exception."
"these downvotes were during the off-season, surprisingly enough. ""he was so good for a month before he got hurt though"" being the main reason. i forgot to include his bbref in my previous post. it gets reeeaaal ugly in the advanced section. he's a great player. no one can deny this. but he's been overrated for years because his usage rate makes his numbers insane. like, I dislike Harden, but he's nowhere even  in the same stratosphere as Harden as a player, imo.  ""Russell Westbrook Stats | Basketball-Reference.com"" https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html"
"This includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
I mean Oladipo was already mentioned. They got those shots because they had potential that wasn’t getting used on OKC because Russell Westbrook was on his triple double rampage
"Fit matters though. I mean, Harden's Rockets are a great example of that with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, and now John Wall (because Harden's leaving) all having fairly short stints playing alongside him.  Another great example is that Olympic team real early in LeBron's career where it seemed like he was the only one playing hard and they lost to Puerto Rico. They would have been better off only taking NBA players that wanted to be there instead of just the biggest stars they could get.  Fit matters way more than some people think."
"It doesn’t discount all that he did before that (making Houston a legitimate contender without ever fully rebuilding). It’s hard to “hate” someone who did a good job for 10+ years.   Still, I think he does deserve plenty of flak for the Russell Westbrook move/leaving the year after. When the trade happened, many people speculated he made the move with the intention of not being part of the franchise long term. Giving up so much future capital leaves the organization screwed in 3-5 years. It’s one thing if you believe in the move and plan to try to charter the path forward with those missing picks in mind. It’s another to phone it in a bit and then bail as soon as it, unsurprisingly, collapses. Too, stepping down to “spend time with family” and then almost immediately taking another job is bullshit and deserves flak for the simple audacity to proffer such a lame excuse.   With that being said, I don’t know what the internal dynamics were like when that Westbrook trade went down. If Morey was overruled, then the trade itself isn’t his fault and his exit makes more sense. But if he simply was tired of the Houston experiment or recognized the window was closing and simply made a reckless decision with the knowledge he’d be gone anyway, even he deserves quite a bit of blame."
When Russell westbrook isn't protected in the expansion draft and rejoins settle baby.
"Check out Giannis’ rookie stats over his first 5 games. Check out Russell Westbrook. Check out Ben Simmons.  It’s entirely too early to state ANYTHING about Poku. Let him spend the season in the G League, get a few meaningless minutes in real games for nerves, put on 20 lbs, and let’s talk at the END of his sophomore season."
"Well for all NBA, the [rules](https://pr.nba.com/1920-all-nba/) are a little different.  &gt; Players who received votes at multiple positions were slotted at the position where they received the most votes.  I think that's how Simmons got All NBA as a guard despite receiving fewer points overall than Middleton, for example  https://fansided.com/2020/09/17/khris-middleton-missed-nba-selection-outdated-positional-designations/  https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/nbcsports/bradley-beal-gets-most-votes-of-any-guard-left-off-all-nba-as-russell-westbrook-and-ben-simmons-take-final-spots/2420527/?amp  Middleton got 82 points, Embiid 76 and both missed the All NBA  Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook, the two third-team guards, received 61 and 56 total vote points  But Middleton's votes were split between F &amp; G. And Embiid at center was behind 3 other centers.  Because of these rules, I tend to put All NBA in its own category.."
But that's his last name.. This is the mans name. We dont call Russell westbrook West
"As of today, A Russell Westbrook 3-pointer (22.7%) is more likely to go in than a Jakob Poeltl free throw (12.5%)"

"The fall of Russell Westbrook. From NBA superstar to NBA loser of worst name. Alienated all his teammates with his predictable ballhogging alpha male toxic basketball style. People wonder what Kobe Bryant would’ve been had he not championship-jumpstarted by Shaq,he would’ve been Russell Westbrook: championship-less loser who alienates other stars in the NBA. Russell is an unlucky Kobe."
Let's not act like we didn't get blown out by the Wizards without Russell Westbrook lol
"Russell Westbrook got abused by Lebron in the playoffs last year. He got dunked on, blocked, he was left open at the three point line, and he also got gentleman swept."
"CP3 and Kyrie can do a ""fake"" post up when the guy guarding them is a Raul Neto type and are unstoppable at it  Dragic used to post up a lot with Slovenia, never really did it in the NBA but he's skilled down there  Jrue is good at it really physical.  And then there is Russell Westbrook who basically scores everytime he actually uses physicality in the post, but loves his dirk fades and his face up bank shots way too much to be consistent down there  EDIT : ony the point guards here"
I’d take current Kyrie Irving over both if I want to win a championship.   Wardell Stephen Curry II and Russell Westbrook suck in the NBA Finals.
That's great news.   But did the doctors find a fifth knee ligament like Russell Westbrook?  Difference between 3-4 months and a season ending injury.
russell westbrook. i just love his family and his social media presence and want the best for him
"It’s basically how many points you generate relative to your drives. Russell Westbrook has a 23%, so basically if he were to drive 20 times in a game, he’d generate 4.6 points for himself off those drives. An elite inside scorer like James Harden has a 63%, meaning on 20 drives, he’d score 12.6 points.   Now Kyrie on 20 drives would score 19.6 points.  It also speaks to decision making, as Kyrie will look to score every time and at a good level too, whereas Demar Derozan often passes on the drive"
"He was high usage, inefficient, and had a huge turnover rate which you to go along with his big box scores. If you watched him play defensively he had major issues as well, the Pelicans had better D with him off the court for example.    Pelicans didn't even offer him a max contract pre-injury...they had a better record after he got injured with Mirotic in his place.   He was kind of like Tyreke Evans or Russell Westbrook in that if you give him the usage he will put up a ton of stats, he's just not good enough that it translates to wins.   I think he might have worked out as a stretch 5 if he found that right situation but this revisionist history that he would be the best C in the league is far off the mark."

Russell Westbrook won a basketball game!!!
"Russell Westbrook gets asked about getting his first win while on the floor, corrects the reporter: ""This is my second win, man. If I don’t play, I’m still a part of the team.”  It's a pissy answer"
"**Russell Westbrook gets asked about getting his first win while on the floor, corrects the reporter: ""This is my second win, man. If I don’t play, I’m still a part of the team.”**"
"He probably was never a good coach. Having two Top 50 players of all time (with Durant even being included in the Top 20), Russell Westbrook, and a high end championship caliber role player in Ibaka probably covered up that he didn't know what he was doing."
"Chris Paul took the struggling Hornets to within one game of the Western Conference Finals right after coming into the league.   He turned the Clippers into a contender (something no one thought would ever happen), and then got the Rockets to within one game of the NBA Finals.   He turned OKC into a better team than when Russell Westbrook was leading them, despite being 35 years old with a 0.2% chance of making the playoffs.   Now, he’s leading the Suns to the best record in the league.   Very few players have had a greater impact on their teams than Chris Paul, and that’s backed up by his win shares, the 4th highest of all-time per 48 minutes, behind only Michael Jordan, David Robinson and Wilt Chamberlain.  CP3 hardly ever lands on teams that are meant to be good, but he makes them damn good anyway.  Credits to Basketball Forever on Facebook"
They could start by : NOT PLAYING RUSSELL WESTBROOK WITH ISH SMITH WHO IS A 5'11 POOR MAN'S VERSION OF RUSSELL WESTBROOK.  Seriously it's ridiculous those 2 on the court together create open shots after open shots....for one another because nobody guards them
Especially incorporating Russell Westbrook into your offense.  People acting like the Wiz were going for 0 wins this season.
The Washington Wizards (2-5) defeat Russell Westbrook (7/25)
&gt;	“Why not.” - Russell Westbrook every fourth quarter
Russell Westbrook should have put more stats into his shooting and intelligence when he made his build. Would be the best player in the NBA
Classic Russell Westbrook
This game is absolutely full russell westbrook man
This game is the full russell westbrook experience

He should know the real answer: have Russell Westbrook not pass it to him

Can you please explain to me how RW has the same exact amount of syllables as Russell Westbrook? Last I checked 2 and 4 were not the same number.
Russell Westbrook is 1 more syllable than RW
😆I've noticed W initials tripping commentators up in the past for exactly that reason. The solution when the W comes at the end is to shorten W to dub. Russell Westbrook = R Dub. I'm not saying I like it.
“Russell Westbrook” = four syllables
How is Russell Westbrook 3 syllables and why aren’t more people wondering this
I like Russell Westbrook
"I’m confused as well, I first thought Westbrook but RW has 3 syllables. Russell Westbrook has 4 so I got no idea"
I always think Warner Brothers at first before realizing it's Russell Westbrook
"Interesting. She still comprehends the reading without monologuing it I’m guessing, because it’s not really linear(?) in how she intakes the words. Or maybe still?  Regardless, that’s neat. I was honestly shocked when OP here said (I’m paraphrasing) RW takes as long to read as Russell Westbrook. I sort of think of letters/words as just symbols when read. Like if I said I’m going to draw a 🔺 the word “triangle” wouldn’t even come up I think."
"Am I going crazy or something? The letters RW, when spoken, have 3 syllables. Russell Westbrook, has 4 syllables. What am I missing here?"
"I disagree.  He received a lot of hate by the end of Houston, and he was given to OKC as salary along with multiple picks for Russell Westbrook.  Sounds underrated to me, but aight"
I literally never heard anyone ever calling on Russell Westbrook as RW 😂😂😂
"When we say Russ, who we mean? Westbrook or De'Angelo Russell?"
"Who calls Russell Westbrook ""rw""...."
Isn't Russell Westbrook four syllables?
"Who's RW? I can only think of Russell Wilson and Russell Westbrook, but there's too many syllables."
Russell Westbrook has 4 syllables RW has 3
"I don’t think I’ve ever heard someone audibly say “RW” but I have seen RW type in reference to both Russell Wilson and Westbrook and honestly, it’s a short form that works and you just gotta read the context there."
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."
R = 1 W = 3 R+W = 4  Russell Westbrook = 4
"RW is 2 syllables, Russell Westbrook is 4 syllables..."
presti really get a pick for horford from the wizards. RUSSELL WESTBROOK - THE RETURN.
"Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook got Brooks to the finals."
Dwight had beef with everyone.   Russell Westbrook and him never had beef   CP3 and Harden beefed because CP3 was fucking atrocious in the playoffs and 2019 season.
Fun Fact:   John Wall is undefeated when he plays for the Rockets  Russell Westbrook is winless when he plays for the Wizards
"&gt;He had a singular interview where he was pretty much forced to answer the question of whether he deserved MVP or not.  He spoke about it two interviews...in the off-season lol.  [97.9 radio interview](https://theboxhouston.com/9873755/james-harden-jh-town-weekend-mvp-russell-westbrook-interview/)  [GQ interview](https://www.gq.com/story/james-harden-vol-4-sneaker-interview)  And lol at the rest of that. Y'all are too stupid to realize voters care about winning above all else. Whether that's right or not is debatable, but you are delusional if you think MVP narrative is decided the season like Harden thought. The ""narrative"" is that if you have an MVP level season on the team with the best record in the league, you win MVP.   At minimum, top 2 seed. Which has accounted for 95% of the MVPs this century (outside of WB triple double).   Im glad you have your script of Hardens words memorized tho lmao."
Best TS% off drives so far (min 15 TSA):  Dame Lillard - 72.3  De'Aaron Fox - 72.2  Luka Doncic - 69.3  Bradley Beal - 69.3  Kyle Lowry - 67.6  Kawhi Leonard - 67.2  Worst:  Ben Simmons - 32.2  Marcus Smart - 34.4  Russell Westbrook - 35.1  LaMelo Ball - 38.3  Donovan Mitchell - 40.0
Kevin Durant would be in the GOAT conversation if OKC never drafted Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook isn't a very good player.  He likes to average high rebs, so on defense all he does is camp out under the rim so he can siphon rebounds. Sometimes he literally pulls them out of much taller team mates' hands. It's gotten to the point where 6'11"" Thomas Bryant will literally pull away from the rim to make room for 6'3"" Westbrook to run in and grab it. That's Russell's idea of ""defense"".  On offense he yells and screams for people to break out of their scheme so that they can set a screen for him to do something flashy. As a result he often gets assists, but he's almost equally likely to turn the ball over.   What they should be doing is bombing a ton of threes by Bertans, Bryant and Beal. Or attacking the rim. Instead they often end up watching Russ throw in a long range bomb (his 3 ball is truly a horrific shot) or hoist up bricks from mid range. There's often a wide open corner three passed up so that Russ can launch an ill advised heroball shot.  Beal is 28 and Westbrook is 32, and other than that their main group of guys are all much younger and less experienced. It doesn't help matters that Beal isn't all that engaged or smart on defense.   It's a team that will generally need 120 points to win a game. And sometimes even that won't be enough.  Probably the worst defensive team in the league and maybe at best average on offense."
I wouldn’t mind seeing them trade him and Draymond for Russell Westbrook.
Gonna stick with my preseason hot take that John Wall has a better season than Russell Westbrook.
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
Historically his triple doubles have led to a win more often than not.   https://ca.nba.com/news/russell-westbrook-triple-doubles-washington-wizards-winless/1pdkvv0zfo2vq1i0y7oc1xcbkd
"Wiggins, Westbrook and Russell are kings of the empty calorie offense/no defence volume scorer than can just kill a team (h/t DeRozan) with huge usage and huge contracts."
You guys would definitely shoot 50% from three and over 55% from the field every single game if it wasn't for that bum MVP and perennial all star Russell Westbrook.
"RUSSELL ""THE PROBLEM"" WESTBROOK"
Russell Westbrook is really good at basketball
"Then they are taking the lead of 28 pts, lol. 6th man of the year for Russell Westbrook"
"Keldon ""PJ Tucker+Russell Westbrook"" Johnson"
"You’re still like completely misconstruing the order of the discussion for why the statement works.  Someone says ‘Russell Westbrook sucks massive cocks no wonder the Wizards are losing all their games’ (slight hyperbole, but only slight). But... they are literally not losing while he is on the court, EVEN IF THE STAT IS FLAWED, this kinda means he isn’t ‘the reason’ they are losing.  It is literally a logic gate, not an analysis of the worthiness of the statistic."
Russell Westbrook has the same TS this year then Siakam in the 2020 playoffs
"""wizards keep getting triple doubles from Russell Westbrook...and losses""    nowhere is safe"
"The Wizards were the worst defensive team in the entire league, and they just added Russell Westbrook to that. That is a very large hurdle to clear."
"This sub hates Russell Westbrook because they think it makes them huge brain geniuses for being able to say ""I actually know the big secret that box stats don't tell the whole story of a player's effectiveness,"" as though an at times inefficient Westbrook is worse than having Elfrid Payton as your starting point guard"
You act like Lowry is not those things. He is litterally the perfect leader and culture setter for the Raptors also. This ain’t Russell Westbrook lmao  Also yes Lowry is a big upgrade over Dragic. He is still a top 20 player in this league and has shown 0 signs of slowing down
Is russell westbrook more hated than harden now? Has the meta for this sub changed?
Russell Westbrook for Al Horford + George Hill
"That doesnt have shit to do with who is better. Brons taken 3 different teams to a finals win. Harden hasn't even brought the rockets into the final game while playing with players like Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul. Clint Capela and Eric Gordon when he was actually still really good"
Here is a lineup that will utilize his strengths better:  Harden  Prime Klay  LBJ  KD   Anthony Davis  Bench: Russell Westbrook
Is this where the Russell Westbrook hate train boards? I'd like to buy a ticket.
Curry  Paul  Kyrie  Luka  Lillard  Lowry  Westbrook  Young  Ben  Wall  Jrue  Jamal  Kemba  Morant  Fox  Conley  Schroder  Russell  Goran  Beverley  Jounte Murray  Lonzo  Brogdon  Graham  Garland  Fultz  Coby  Hill  Payton  Hayes
All this and people still blaming Russell Westbrook like it's solely his fault the wizards are bad.

"It sounds like your saying that Westbrook's rebounding isn't that important, because it's mostly uncontested rebounds.       Even if we ignore that his uncontested reb percentage compared to other guards is clearly superior, we can compare how ""valuable"" his rebounding is compared to others using a stat called Defensive Rebounding Value. [Here](https://greekgodofstats.com/2019/12/26/can-you-give-me-some-stats-to-prove-that-russell-westbrook-steals-rebounds/) To click bait ya', his rebounding value is better than AD's and Adam's for the past 3 years.     While we're talking rebounding value, something that I've yet to see factored in is how much easier free throw rebounding is for big men. You get an advantageous box-out position from the get go."
It was unexpected that someone on /r/nba dissed Russell Westbrook? Really?
"Apparently first player in NBA history that got a 30pt triple double in his team debut. Most assists in history for a Nets debut. The 7th player to get a triple double in team debut alongside names you would expect like Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook and Elfrid Payton"
Trade Kyrie for Rockets Center Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook was probably a better passer than Harden
"Simmions is 24. They build around Simmions, Deni, Rui, Bertans, Thomas Bryant. Their lottery pick cause they are gonna be bad. Trade Russell Westbrook to OKC for Al Horford?"
Neither James Harden nor Russell Westbrook has ever carried similarly bad teams. Neither has been on a team as bad as LeBron's worst Cavs teams.
You know you're shooting poorly when Russell Westbrook is shooting better from 3 than you
"Oh yeah, I didn't even bother to read that full post. Sounded like it was going to be a big essay rebutting something that not even 10% of NBA fans say. The premise already was pretty flawed:  &gt; Russell Westbrook is portrayed as an arrogant egotistical Selfish player on the court and a sulky, rude, and brazen personality by the media. This is far from the truth."
The truth about Russell Westbrook- the most misunderstood superstar in NBA history
"“What I mean by that is that in 2012, Durant played on a three-superstar Oklahoma City Thunder team with Russell Westbrook and James Harden. “  Lol."

I'm talking about him completely *checking out*. Not the same thing. Kobe was awful in his inefficiency but he would leave it all on the floor. He played from tip to buzzer. Harden didn't do that. You can't blame Tillman for that. We had Vince Carter, he totally checked out &amp; forced his way out of Toronto. The moment he got to the Nets, he went back to being a monster on the court. His *on-court* behaviour is why so many Raps fans are against him &amp; against the idea of him retiring a Raptor (which isn't an issue now) or him getting a statue. *Vince Carter gave up on the team* ***on the court***. That's the biggest sin. Just look all that Lebron has done &amp; you'll still hear about how he checked out in the playoffs during his last run with the Cavs before he jumped ship to Miami. That shit will stick to him forever.

I specifically said the Spurs series because I feel that’s where he made the most money. Of course they were more important over the course of an entire season because they played more minutes.   Daryl Morey clearly saw enough to offer him a max contract because he realized they couldn’t comfortably pay him and keep Russell Westbrook/Serge Ibaka  You might think Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford are scrubs because they come/came off the bench but I gotta disagree.

"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"
"Neither of those blowouts are different from your other high scoring games besides the fact that those teams had colder nights.   You had a low pace against the Suns. But you had a super high pace against the Timberwolves still.   If anything, if there was actually a pace difference, it wouldn’t be from very few shots. It would be from the fact that it’s Russell Westbrook. But it doesn’t matter anyways, the pace was high in your second game."
We're now full circle and Derrick Rose is better than Russell Westbrook again.
You can not look at stats in a vacuum. He was on a shit team where he was not given any real direction or opportunity. Do you even understand how team sports work?  Just like you can have Russell Westbrook with massive stat lines but is a useless player. Just empty numbers for a non-competitive team.
D’Angelo Russell? Or Westbrook?
"First of all, settle down. People are allowed to have different opinions than you.  Secondly, no it absolutely is not impressive. The goal of the game isn’t to get triple doubles for the sake of getting them. The goal of basketball is to score more points than the other team and win the game. Russell Westbrook was not beneficial in that regard during his second 2 triple double seasons. Sorry, but that’s the truth."

My buddy will tell me about some highlight, and while he'll send it to me from Twitter, I literally just come to /r/nba from my phone and that same highlight is probably highly upvoted and easily findable.   I don't come here for discussion, since I think most of the opinions here need toilet paper cuz they're shit. Some opinions of mine are unchanging, and some of them are completely contrarian to this sub. I hate certain players this sub loves, I love certain players this sub hates. I don't come here to discuss those things. If I want discussion, I talk to a few IRL friends who watch as much basketball as I do.  I also come here for the memes.

Let me break in down in the simplest of terms:  The Thunder were the 10 defense and the 16th offense.   That means they had a top 10 defense and a below average offense.  Russell Westbrook did not contribute to that defense positively because he’s been a bad defender his entire nba career.  If you don’t understand how that is similar to the other 2 situations then I don’t know what to tell you...
"The Hornets are far from being, or having “the next big thing”. At best they have the next Russell Westbrook who can put up big numbers on any losing team but can’t secure the W because it gets in the way of their narrative."
"Because Steph Curry is better than Russell Westbrook, by a vast margin."
Real question is will Russell Westbrook pass LeBron?

Replace cp3 with Mitchell and probably add devin booker  Simmons is not making it this year put someone like trae young or Zach Lavine instead   I’m a wizards fan but Russell Westbrook probably won’t make it unless he steps it up these next few games
"He’s not washed, but he’s half-way there. There are spurts and moments where spite fuels him and he taps into what little he has left, but physically you can tell he’s damn near down. Even that Nets game, when has Russell Westbrook had a 40 point game without a dunk??"

Pace is so different that triple-doubles are among the rarest sights in euro basketball. Meanwhile NBA had Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double for three straight seasons.
"I don't think anyone goes to a basketball game thinking, ""You know what I want to see tonight? Russell Westbrook shooting free throws."""
"If you dont like that, you dont like Russell Westbrook."
That 4th q was peak Russell Westbrook
Rockets legend Russell Westbrook
wait you're really telling me bojan bogdanovic has more dunks this season than russell westbrook
Russell Westbrook at 56 is disrespectful
"The only time he does that is when he's responding to someone who has been notably shit-talking him, witness Russell Westbrook ""rocking the baby"" in the playoffs, or PG's ""bad shot""."
russell westbrook
kawhi but y’all bullied paul george and russell westbrook into that for me too
Would bet even today at least 1/3 of current and former nba players would take Russell Westbrook over Steph curry. People will be flabbergasted and think it’s impossible that so many players could still think something like that but 100% you’d find a lot more who think like that than people realize
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"At this moment, some role players, some 3 and D specialists, some rim protectors / floor spreaders are more valuable than Russell Westbrook"
"Yeah I just figured this too, my mind went to Westbrook because I don’t see Bill referred to as “Russ” too often lol. No problem with Bill Russell at #5 though."
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They’ll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn’t fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they’ve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won’t be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
Not if your Russell Westbrook haha then it’s stat padding.
"Nah, Jordan Clarkson pushes off and hit the championship winning shot against Russell Westbrook, cementing his legacy as the best Jordan to ever play the game of basketball."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Great Value^^TM Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook has entered the chat.
"My man...You had CP3 on your team and preceding that, Russell Westbrook. Has nothing to do with the truth, just your saltiness."
Spin it into a positive tbh: Is Russell Westbrook a better coach than Scott Brooks?
"Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick rose have combined for 2 dunks this season. Melo has 1 and Westbrook has 1."
"No.  MVP doesn't mean best player. It means you're the best player on the best team, or you did something historic. Russell Westbrook wasn't a top 3 player when he won MVP. Steph Curry at his best was arguably top 3-5, and he's not even considered top 5 right now in his prime putting up bigger numbers than ever. That should say something. Everyone has a boner because his shooting skills are insane, but there is more to basketball than shooting"

"He is right. Very few players from the past could play in today's game. Old big men talk about how they wouldn't let a guard get anywhere near the paint without getting clobbered, but a 220 lb Bill Russell isn't doing shit against a 200 lb Russell Westbrook charging him."
WE WILL TRADE YOU ONE RUSSELL WESTBROOK FOR HIM
"Literally the dumbest argument I see is people comparing him to Russell Westbrook as a floor raiser and ""If Curry doesn't make higher than a 6th seed I don't wanna hear any excuses"". Like that 2017 OKC team was a top 10 defense with 1 great offensive player but Westbrook gets all the credit. If Westbrook was such a God tier floor raiser how did OKC miss the playoffs in 2015 when KD was injured and Westbrook went crazy and won the scoring title? He should have carried that team too right?"
"You can't evaluate IQ based on press interviews or public persona, that's mostly just going to measure pre-NBA socioeconomics, parental influence, the age when others encouraged them to pump the brakes academically in favor of focusing on basketball 40+ hours a week. and emotional intelligence not spatial/verbal. Tacko fall had great SATs and a difficult major, you can measurably say that he's likely pretty smart. But somebody like Russell Westbrook who is not great in the press and plays a style of basketball that is antithetical to modern analytics might not be called smart despite documented history of strong academics(Jeremy Lin also plays the same high turnover, high athleticism, middling efficiency game as Westbrook, but we can easily say hes smart cuz hatvard). Also I feel like if you went through a list of all white nba players you'd have a hard time saying that a guy is dumb even though statistically a few have to be.  These lists are fun and I love learning about dual excellence in people like Jaylen Brown or David Robinson who are gifted athletically and academically. But it's real easy to make mistakes like  Goldwater rule diagnosing from afar or Charles Murray's bell curve. I think it's best to assume that most people are reasonably smart and with effort can grasp most concepts and that with rare exceptions what we call smart when we see it in a press conference is mostly just socioeconomics merging with things like curiosity, incentives to learn, anxiety leading to over preparation and the presence of adult figures in childhood and mentors in early adulthood"
Russell Westbrook playing like an MVP against Kevin Durant or KD's team every time they play
"Win a playoff semi finalsThe Oklahoma City thunder in the finals against the golden state warriors, they were up 3-1 and Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook had horrible games which caused them to lose to the golden state warriors , then continued to lose the whole series 4-3. Pretty disappointing as a thunder fan during those years."
The Wizards' Big Three Era is here.  Russell Westbrook.  Bradley Beal.  Daniel Gafford.  (shoutout to raul neto he been fire these last games)
Wow russell westbrook
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).  KD."
"I never get too hype on Russell Westbrook. There are the try-hards of the regular season and individual stats, and then there are the players that keep some in the reserve for the games that count."
I’d venture to say a lot of teams aren’t 100% sure of everyone’s role. Russell Westbrook had to ask everyone on the Wizards to clarify their own roles on the team like a month or two ago. I doubt they’re the only team with vague roles that change night to night
"David Robinson, Vince Carter and Russell Westbrook. All super athletic, highly criticized, superstars of their generation."
Kevin Durant /  Russell Westbrook
"It literally says this in the article:   “Before sending Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers in a shocking deal, the Oklahoma City Thunder reportedly held talks with the Toronto Raptors focused on George and Russell Westbrook.”  “According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Thunder general manager Sam Presti offered George and Westbrook to Toronto for a package centered around forward Pascal Siakam, but the Raptors declined the offer.”"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html  It was both based on a report from Adrian Wojnarowski
Every day is Russell Westbrook day in okc by order of the mayor so he’s definitely getting a statue lol
"I love how Thunder fans are the battered wives of the NBA.   A decade ago, their franchise had Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  Their brilliant front office loses Harden then Durant.   The Thunder fans are left with the very least of the three.  Yet here they still are, defending Russell like hes going to come back to them and once again lead them to a sixth seed and first round exit.  Russell Westbrook is incapable of playing with another great player and making them better.  Just ask Paul George, or Kevin Durant or James Harden.     I guess you weren't a fan of the Thunder way back in 2019.  You should look up Oklahoma City and their lone playoff series from that year.  You can tell me some more about Westbrook being better than Lillard."
His name is...Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is just a character he plays
"Russell Westbrook. For all the ways you can criticize him, he’s one of the most fun players to watch in nba history. He also plays with an insanse amount of intensity and hustle which I love to see."
"I just finished watching my guys make it 8 in what has been one of my favorite stretches of fandom in 13 years as a Wizards fan. However one takeaway I have, which I’ve noticed several times before, are the constant reminders that Russell Westbrook isn’t as good as he once was. Almost every time the guy does well, the undertone of all the praise is “reminds us of old Russ”.  Before I start rambling, I’ll wrap it up briefly: Russel Westbrook has shown that, despite his obvious journey, he is currently a very good basketball player and we should expect good play. Every great play of his should not be met with surprise, and every bit of praise does not need to be accompanied by a reminder that he was stunted by taking bad shots. I get it, and I myself spent these last few years following him and being overjoyed at some admittedly average games, but it’s time to acknowledge that Russ is simply still a bad mf and praise for his play requires no validation."
Who else had a top tier motor like Russell Westbrook in nba history?
Lemme explain for you:    Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook
"Tell me a player with as much talent and tenacity as Russell Westbrook so we can argue. Stud played with a freaking dent in his head on national TV. Tough, dedicated, MVP"
"I mean I agree with you but tbf the rest of us are all just upvoting ""Russell Westbrook"" over and over lol"
Per ESPN STATS     Russell Westbrook has:  - 20 triple-doubles in his last 30 games - 18 triple-doubles in his last 25 - 16 triple-doubles in his last 20 - 13 triple-doubles in his last 15 - 9 triple-doubles in his last 10  Oscar Robertson never had any spans of this kind in his career.
Westbrook sees ball under the basket.   **RUSSELL MODE ENGAGED**
RUSSELL MF WESTBROOK
"&gt; Royce is a borderline all NBA defender he will do fine against LeBron. Obviously LeBron will get his because he is LeBron, but Royce is a very solid option.  He’ll probably average 35/10/10 if that’s the case.    &gt;AD will face Gobert when he comes anywhere near the paint.  Have you ever watched them play?  &gt;Whos guarding all of Utah's 40+% three point shooters?  The same players who guarded Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray last playoffs. Oh and the law of averages.  Did I mention they’re the #1 defense this season with LeBron and AD missing 40+ games combined?"

He’d have to go the Kobe route and be more blunt at times. But we saw how that works when you don’t win enough. You become disliked like Russell Westbrook
"&gt; , especially in the playoffs.  goddamn this is the stupidest bit of hater revisionism ever. WESTBROOK WENT TO THE FINALS! 4 different conference finals, including going up 3-1 against GOAT regular season team  &gt; but is Westbrook even one of the top 20 players in the league this year?  100% yes, shut the fuck up and watch him play. he was injured for the first quarter of the season, and now he's healthy. if you are honestly making the argument that a healthy Russell Westbrook isn't a top 20 player in the NBA, you are smoking crack  SMOKING CRACK"
This guy thinks the most talented superteam ever assembled in the history of the NBA is going to lose games to Russell Westbrook in the playoffs
Russell Westbrook is better than Allen Iverson
The should get Russell Westbrook.

He made his teammates score 11 times just to pad his stats. Russell westbrook hates america.
"I know we always say this, however  I really wouldn't want to be the team to play Russell Westbrook in the playoffs"
Isiah Thomas and I don’t think it’s particularly close. He was basically a worse version of Russell Westbrook but people think he’s a top 5 pg all time because he had probably the best supporting cast ever.
"Russell Westbrook had 11 triple-doubles in a row from January 22nd, 2019 to February 14th, 2019  That’s the record. Wilt is 2nd with 9 in a row"

I love these clips so much. How on earth can anyone connected to the game actually have the opinion that Russell Westbrook doesn’t want to win bad enough. Skip is such a fucking clown.
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
"You could make your point without underselling Brook Lopez as a stretch 5. He's at .355 from three this year, not .310  That's the difference between Russell Westbrook and Trae Young."

"Russell Westbrook would be my vote. He has such a good impact on the young players, especially Rui. He just has an energy to him that makes the whole team better."
"Nearly everyone on that team was not the player they became til the minute they got traded. I remember there being a post about players before and after Westbrook.    It reminded me of how people said Wilt only won when he toner his usage rate down.   The triple double stat is bc of playing weak teams  Do you remember the time steph &amp; kd laughed at Russell bc he raged at Steven Adams for missing a shot that would've been Russ' 10th assist in a game that was so over that russ was in while KD and Steph were on the bench?   It was just pure selfishness disguised as an all around game &amp; the harden vs wb argument always felt really one sided. The one thing ill give russ fans is idk what that rockets season would have looked like if harden didn't do two extremely cancerous ""tricks"" to get free throws 5x a game"
Russell Westbrook just doing the proud Robert Redford nod right now.
"I hope Seattle can bring in more help for this rookie KD, he needs a point guard in the upcoming draft like this PG rookie like Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook if we fail to get Derrick Rose"
"Tim Duncan, joe ingles, Russell Westbrook, dame, Steph"
John Wall works a lot with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society   Russell Westbrook and his Why Not? Foundation helps out a lot of foster kids  Karl Malone volunteers at my old middle school   Dikembe Mutombo does so much charity in Congo that he was recognized by the UN
we won the war too. History books will rightfully show a well-deserved MVP tick next to Russell Westbrook
Maybe the league saw how when Russell Westbrook had to change his routine when they made that rule it completely fucked him up and doesn’t want to do that to Giannis until the offseason.
"My man Kemba's everywhere, looking like Russell Westbrook out there."
Curry is also a more talented player than Russell Westbrook.
"Haha. Trust me buddy, I’ve watched plenty of games and was expecting no love for this post. Russell Westbrook is a god damn clown."
Russell Westbrook have it all.
Did you know Steph Curry is more loved and protected than Russell Westbrook
"I'll die on the Russell Westbrook ship. This man will be underrated when it's all said and done.   for the people saying he's padding stats.... there have been over 1500 players in NBA history, and only 2 have averaged a TD for a season."

Basic tdlr is that he's unaffected by the defense at all times so when everyone else goes down in the clutch as the defense ratchets up, he stays the same or even gets better because everyone else is tired.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/"
This is Russell westbrook to me.  I remember the season in okc with pg and Melo.  Straight blew out the kd warriors.  But lost to Detroit
"G dang it, I love me some Russell Westbrook"
I would really love to have Russell Westbrook as our starting PG.
russell westbrook plays with an emotional intensity and ferocity that i don’t see in anyone else. doesn’t matter if he’s 5-17 shooting or he’s putting up 40pt triple doubles.
If you asked yourself this question and didnt imediately think Russell Westbrook ur doing something wrong
"&gt; [Wojnarowski] Washington has parted ways with head coach Scott Brooks, per sources. Russell Westbrook will serve as the team's interim coach."
Russell Westbrook is a top 20 NBA player RIGHT NOW. And I'm muting this conversation
"Russell Westbrook remembered today that he didn't have the option of a play-in tournament in 2016-17, and took it personally."
The PER stats on this are interesting....  2019-20	Giannis Antetokounmpo	31.9   2018-19	Giannis Antetokounmpo	31.0   2017-18	James Harden	29.9   2016-17	Russell Westbrook  30.7   2015-16	Stephen Curry	31.6   2014-15	Anthony Davis	30.8   2013-14	Kevin Durant	29.8   2012-13	LeBron James	31.6   2011-12	LeBron James	30.7   2010-11	LeBron James	27.3
Russell Westbrook has entered the chat
"Good post - lets turn this into a discussion instead of a debate.  What is going on then with a historically unprecedented # of players having improvements?  Drummond was far more hopeless than Shaq - he looked to be going the way of Ben Wallace or Russell but he made improvements.  Randle is another example of a player cresting above what I would have expected his ft% peak would be.  Im also talking about improvement in general, I struggle to explain how westbrook, lebron and giannis have so dramatically dropped off from a free throw perspective.  This is not historically isolated event, but I think players who go through this typically have increased or changing muscle mass interfering with their neuromuscular recruitment.   Shaq had the capacity to shoot free throws at a 66% clip, I maintain that.  He'd get ridiculed and pressured to improve in a way he did not in the early 2000s.  There was a shift in the late 2000s to focus on release angles and body mechanics when evaluating jumpshooting and free throws as well.  Kawhi was the big test case back in 2014; a lot of Curry's training around the same period - reaction time, body position recognition and neuromuscular recruitment was not being done in 2007."
Russell Westbrook
He did the same thing when liking a tweet hating on Westbrook lol  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/4/23/17272808/kevin-durant-instagram-russell-westbrook-like-twitter-burner-account-nba
1. Magic Johnson 2. Steph Curry 3. Oscar Robertson 4. Chris Paul 5. John Stockton 6. Isiah Thomas  7. Steve Nash 8. Walt Clyde Frazier  9. Russell Westbrook 10. Jason Kidd
"Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Chris Paul. It seems like great players are always coming and going."
He was surrounded by shit spacing and Russell Westbrook
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8.

The best defenders often don’t have huge block numbers because they deter people from challenging them. I wouldn’t be shocked if the assists or blocks records were broken any time. Russell Westbrook got 21 assists in a game this year so the Wizards just need to play a team that plays zero defense so both teams get plenty of good shots.
Russell Westbrook has done this a few times too.
Stephen Curry in 2017 had a better season than Russell Westbrook in 2017 lol

"It isn't any shorter/faster to say ""RW"" instead of ""Russell Westbrook""  And, ""Brodie"", ""BeastBrook"", ""WestBrick"", ""Best/Worst Brook"" ""Leonardo"" and ""Mister Trip Dub"" all look and sound so much better."
"I am not a fan of a national basketball association team. If a flair is assigned to me, it is only to cast doubt and was done so by the illuminati.   I am an unbiased source birthed into this world merely to judge this season and whom shall be the mvp.   I have been kept in a cave, devoid of light. The last time I was let out I chose Russell Westbrook as the mvp. I was then dragged back into the dark cave where it was cold...dark...safe  I was beaten.   Numerous tines..  But now I am brought out again. And what steph curry has done, it scares me. I want to go back to my cold dark cave but I feel this is my purpose.   And it is to say that steph curry should be an mvp candidate."
Just imagine for a second if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality. Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality were people that conformed to the ruralist localities.
"Isiah Thomas said it best: you absolutely cannot tell the story of basketball without mentioning Russell Westbrook.   Truly 1 of 1, there will never be another Russ."
"This actually does make some sense, just going straight to Hustle Westbrook doesn't feel as emphatic. The Russell Hustle rhyme is nice too it's just obviously not the superior nickname"
Russell Westbrook is the coach at this point
Dude wins at 74% rate when he gets a triple double. Better rate than Oscar Robertson and Jason Kidd. Only people with better win records when recording a triple double are Magic and Lebron.  https://www.sportingnews.com/au/nba/news/russell-westbrook-surpasses-oscar-robertson-182-triple-double-wizards-hawks-thunder/1x1sxr707s96h1tbth4ngrmjq2
I love you russell westbrook
"russell westbrook is PATHETIC congratulations on your triple double ""record"" 🙄 literally any decent nba player could average a triple double for four seasons, they just don't because it's a TEAM sport russell and they choose to play with HONOR."
"What makes Russ's record more incredible is how many triple doubles he's earned from his 7th season onward compared to his first 6 seasons:   * Oscar Robertson first 6 seasons: 148 triple doubles     * Russell Westbrook first 6 seasons: 8 triple doubles  * Oscar Robertson 7th season and after: 33 triple doubles     * Russell Westbrook 7th season and after: 174 triple doubles and counting   Yeah, I'd say that's pretty fucking incredible. Shame his team didn't get the W tonight, but what a record nevertheless."
Everyday is Russell Westbrook day my dude
Man I love Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook: 182 triple doubles, more than Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Bob Pettit, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Gary Payton and Kawhi Leonard COMBINED (181)"
I’ll be telling my grandkids about the legend Russell Westbrook one day.
I love Russell Westbrook.
RUSSELL WESTBROOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what if we kissed in the russell westbrook triple double record thread 😳
"To quote ESPN, [“Westbrook amassed X points, Y rebounds and Z assists in the Washington Wizards' game against the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday in Atlanta.”](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31412465/the-numbers-russell-westbrook-triple-double-records)  Russ is getting so good at this that he’s broken into letters instead of numbers for his triple-doubles."
Hot Take: Russell Westbrook is good at basketball.
Where were you when Russell Westbrook broke Oscar's triple double record?
"&gt; 22nd triple double in his last 26 games, at age 32  That is fucking insanity. And nobody can argue he's stat padding, along with the help of Bradley Beal, he has literally catapulted the Wizards into the 9th seed and are looking to contend into the Playoffs.   He sets every one of his teammates up with their favourite shots. The Wizards have completely figured it out.  Honestly, Russell Westbrook, one of the all time GREATS. A privilege to be able to witness this.   Shout out to Big O. This record is a feat only a handful can ever touch, top 5 is entrenched for years upon years."
I love me some Russell Westbrook
Westbrook once he exits the hyperbolic time chamber and becomes Super Saiyan Russell
Russell Westbrook is going to break an unbreakable record this week. Probably tonight.
"Again, instead of shitting on their franchise, consider that they have no reason to give Hami minutes because, again, he’s not as special as you think and they had 2.5 years to evaluate him firsthand and arrive at that conclusion. They supermaxed Russell Westbrook, paid George and Adams and others, they’re not still just a cheap franchise because they don’t want to hand out money left and right in FA like the Pistons’ new exec did. The Pistons exec who btw is also intelligent himself, and came from a very strong FO in... Oklahoma City."

Russell Westbrook
"Andrew Bogut played him in the NBL and Russ was a comp he  made as well.  &gt;It’s very hard to judge some of these young kids because the jump from high school is a big step. Our league is officiating different. It’s physical, zones can be played. I think he’s done a pretty good job. I like his upside. As far as his length and athleticism, playing the point, I think he’s in that mold of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. His 3-ball’s not there yet, but he does a great job getting in the paint, he’s a willing passer and he’s very good defensively.   &gt;We played him in the preseason and he blocked a few 3- point shots from our guards that he had no business getting a hand on. So he’s very athletic in that sense and he has some dog in him. He was very fiery when we played him, very (Russell) Westbrook-esque with his emotions, and yelling, which I respect. He went out there and really plays like he cares. He’s inconsistent, which can be a knock, but we are a professional league and there are only nine teams. It’s very competitive and once you’ve played a team once, everyone knows each other’s sets, and what they’re trying to do, so I think he’s handled himself very well to this point and I think he’ll be a good guy in the draft. I think he has a chance to be a very good player."
Why not the person (jokic) that encompasses all of those qualifications?   The nuggets have a better record than the bucks and 3 games away from the 76ers. They are also in the west so they play the tougher teams more often. Jamal Murray went down and they still have been above .500. Also jokic stats are historic. Last comparable mvp was Russell Westbrook and jokic has a much much higher efficiency.
If Giannis learns to shoot he's gonna be great  If Ben Simmons learns to shoot he's gonna be great  If Russell Westbrook learns to shoot he's gonna be great
"/u/CodexProfit, /u/NobodyInParticular-, we're almost there. What counts as ""what Russell Westbrook did in dragging that team to the playoffs"" -- do they have to make the actual playoffs, or just the play-in tournament? Steph has been fun to watch, no doubt."
"Maybe they will. Kinda depends on where they’re drafted though. Are we still talking about Kawhi in the same way today if he wasn’t drafted to San Antonio?   If these guys are drafted to OKC, they’re likely to become superstars. That organization has produced Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Domas Sabonis, Jeff Green, Steven Adams, and now they’ve turned guys like Dort into productive NBA players. Their player development is off the charts.  If these guys are drafted to somewhere like Cleveland or Sacramento, chances are they’ll be squandered in a bad organization."
Why is it that interesting? This is like saying it’s interesting that Russell Westbrook is on the verge of beating Big O’s trip dub record.  It’s no secret that Steph is the greatest 3 point shooter in NBA history and one of the best shooters ever

"So my dad is a little older and he was a big fan of Oscar Robertson as well I've never talked to him specifically about Oscar vs. Jerry West but he's always talks about Oscars all around game etc, and no surprise he loves Russell Westbrook lol in the case of History Oscar and Jerry West would both have a lot more scoring titles if Wilt Chamberlain wasn't around , Oscar has a regular season MVP , Jerry West does not oh, and of course there's the triple-double average both in the One season and then when you look at his first five seasons, and ultimately I think Jerry West is looked at as kind of an underachiever they both won their one championships by teaming up with all time great big men , but I think what hurts Jerry West is that he could never get past the Celtics even though he had Elgin Baylor and then even when they brought in Chamberlain it didn't work, and then they faced the Knicks in three finals and only won once, so I think things like that hurt Jerry West, I do see them pretty close on all the time rankings though sometimes it's either or"
His teams win [74% of the games where he gets a triple-double](https://www.google.com/search?q=russell+westbrook+win+percentage+with+triple+double&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA952CA952&amp;oq=russell+westbrook+winning+percentage+with+t&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33i22i29i30l2.9431j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).   That's the same percentage as a 60-win team.
"Yes, some of the more notable scrubs James Harden played with include Chris Paul, Clint Capela, and Russell Westbrook.   Those were supposed to be his “sidekicks” - truly pathetic. And you had losers like Trevor Ariza, defensive turnstiles Patrick Beverley &amp; PJ Tucker, and chuckers like Eric Gordon.  It’s a miracle Harden was able to win a playoff series, a testament to his greatness."
I don't think you valuing players fairly. Harden was 21 years old coming off the bench. How is it that he choked when there's no game plan revolving him ? You telling me the coach's plan was we cook the with harden when Westbrook and of sits down and that's the whole game plane ? No because kd and Russell Westbrook lead that team with perk as their enforcer and ibaka as their primary shot blocker. Harden was doing great of the bench because he's a great player but that's it. You can't say someone choked coming of the beach at the age of 21
Khris Middleton for giannis. Broken Dwight and Russell Westbrook for harden. He had a great cp3 who had injury problems in the playoffs. Harden was close to defeating the warriors without cp3
Wizard fan better not be talking shit...Under .500 with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook in a Micky mouse East
Russell Westbrook  Russell Goatgoat
Clearly they are the favorites and scoring every time no question. My only thought is that Harden would only try on offense— and a good two way team (like Carmelo Anthony Davis) might be able to put up a good fight. Or Bill Russell Westbrook.
"If there's one thing I have learned from watching the NBA, it's that Russell Westbrook does not fuck around when a record is on the line. I wouldn't write off the Wizards so quickly"
"To be fair, most of his rebounds come from uncontested rebounds in which his team moves out of the way to let him get. Before you start downvoting, I’m not criticizing. It’s just how a Russell Westbrook offense works. He’s the fastest player on the floor so you may as well let him get the rebound and push the ball. It skews the stats but it is what it is. Still pretty incredible at any rate."
WASHINGTON WIZARDS LEGEND RUSSELL WESTBROOK 🤯🤯🤯
I thought you already demoted him when you brought in Russell Westbrook to be the head coach?
"A career of stats not leading to wins? The man’s made the NBA Finals, made several conference finals, and only missed the playoffs twice in his career, his rookie year and when KD only played 27 games and Russ missed 17 of them as well. Not to mention they only missed the playoffs that year by 1 game.   Post-KD the Thunder only stayed relevant because of Russell Westbrook.  The talent around him in 2017 had no business making the playoffs. 2018 &amp; 2019 he carried PG at the end. 2020 there were many factors but I’m not gonna stick up for Houston being a trash organization.   Just cause he hasn’t won a championship doesn’t mean he isn’t a winner."
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."
Russell Westbrook would box out his own teammates to get a rebound 😂
You might want to look up statistically significant data sets. Russell Westbrook is the only player that you listed who actually has enough triple doubles to be statistically significant for that comparison.

"Important?? Important if they want to loose! Man did you watch basketball? Russ is statpadding more than ever, with all of his TOs you can pile up the mount Everest, and his shooting, oh boy his shooting is so shitty that if you let an AVERAGE NBA player take the same ammount of shots Russ take he will score +130 points for the Wizards with respect of what Russ did, that's the definition of UNPLAYABLE. If you have Russell Westbrook you know that you will give up a shit tons of points, how can you win like that? Not considering all defensive metrics, impact metricrics, +/-, Net plus/minus, On/off Stats, it all says that Russell Westbrook nowadays is a rather mediocre player that just pile up empty stats at best, playing shitty defense and bad offense forcing your team to feed him.  Not considering Russ historically plays even worst in the playoff, he had 32 going for 33, he had one of the biggest contract of the NBA still. If Beal turns the back to him (which I highly expect, if not I will expect the Wizards will rather let this shitty team explode rather to play their way into mediocrity) it will be the 4th star to do so in 5 years. You won't see him playing the 6th man role because he has such a big ego he couldn't even accept to be the 3rd wheel in a team. He can't play off the ball and he never had 1 single improvement in his games in 10 years now. That are all sings to me that he will be our of the league soon.   He is playing the reminiscent of NY Carmelo Anthony or last year Denver/Detroit Allen Iverson. Melo had a way bigger bag of basketball knowledge and could actually reinvent himself, with all his flaws, as a role player, I hardly imagine Russ did so."
"If Russell Westbrook committed 100% to defense, with his athletic abilities and fast hands he would probably been the greatest perimeter defending guard since GP."
"Hard to imagine a scenario that would be better for Russ than this year's Clippers, though, right?  Like, would the Bucks be better with Russell on their roster? Yeah, of course, it's Russell. You'll never struggle to make something happen in the playoffs when the offense isn't clicking, because Russell always makes *something* happen. But it's certainly not a perfect fit and there's going to be some growing pains and awkward spacing with both Russ and Giannis.  But the Clippers would be perfect, right? PG and Kawhi are three-level scorers who are also lockdown defenders; their only weakness is that neither of them are good at making plays for others and it's exhausting to be asked to create for yourself all of the time. Suddenly Westbrook is there to feed them and the roleplayers easy baskets, take defensive attention away from them, and make chaos happen that PG/Kawhi can then feast on."
"Yep. Just checked, only players with a streak of five or more straight triple-doubles are Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, and Elfrid Payton."
He was playing with an injury at the start of the season.  No one really wanted to hear that at the time because I guess it was more fun to talk about how washed he was:  https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/russell-westbrook-hurt-since-training-230656529.html
NBA HALL OF FAMER AND ABSOLUTE LEGEND RUSSELL MOTHER FUCKING WESTBROOK
Russell Westbrook in the clutch:  105 PTS (5th in NBA) 59.1 FG% (1st) 40.9 3P%  He is the most efficient clutch scorer this season with 65.9 eFG%.
Topic is about Russell Westbrook and it took me WAY longer than it should have for me to realize what this was
Congratulations to Russell Westbrook on a brilliant achievement and level of play. His effort and energy are remarkable for a veteran at this stage of his career.
If you don't love Russell Westbrook you don't like NBA basketball.
"Congrats to Russell Westbrook.  With that said, this to me is a meaningless stat. Why do we care about if a guy got 10 of one state more than 9 of one stat? I just don't get the obsession at all and haven't understood it for a very long time."
Russell Westbrook is a beast... his stamina to keep doing triple double after the 2016-2017 season is inhuman.
"It's fucking ridiculous how the absolute dipshits in this sub underrate him. If you replace ""Russell Westbrook"" with ""LeBron James"" in the title we would not hear the end of it. The disrespect is wild. Where people rank Russ in comparison to LeBron is absolutely insane. He's avg'd triple doubles multiple seasons, now will hold the record and by a longshot when it is all said and done."
"Leverts catch and shot motion were so slow. Westbrook was in the air before him. Nah but fair play. Russell took amazing angles around that ""screen"" and picked the perfect launching point."
I have seen this same exact comment as many times as Russell Westbrook has triple doubles
RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS MY FATHER
I would rather snort Russell Westbrook than cocaine.
"Russell Westbrook was coming off of covid and injury in the beginning of the year. Plus injury with Bradley Beal. I mean they should’ve been near 7 at most 6, but Scott brooks is a huge problem, if they didn’t have the injuries plus no Scott brooks, at most 3 seed and at least 5 seed"
&gt; Russell Westbrook has a triple double in 21 of his past 25 outings.    The fuck
There's not fifteen players better than Russell Westbrook. He's all-nba 3rd team in my book.
"I fukkin love Russell ""Brodie"" Westbrook.  Fukk all the haters."
Russell Westbrook I will drink your bathwater
Russell Westbrook is the new leader of D.C   just let him move into the White House
RUSSELL FUCKING WESTBROOK
rui hachimura was the first wizards player not named russell westbrook or bradley beal to score in double digits at 3:57 in the 4th  my god
"Russell Westbrook will be to triple doubles as John Stockton was to assists, at this rate."
Nobody thought this was possible until Russell Westbrook joined the NBA.

"Memphis has done a better job surrounding Ja with a team that makes sense (outside of the bizarre and bad Winslow/Crowder trade). Not that Ja isn't an immense elevator.  That's what elite vision, play making and the ability to get to the rim get you; a chance at the playoffs. Just ask Russell Westbrook.   Pelicans don't seem to understand that if you have a player who can suck the entire defense into the paint you should surround that guy with shooters. It's like watching the 76ers before Morey showed up, just  constantly surrounding them with other players who crowd the paint (Never forget the ludicrous Zhaire Smith for Bridges trade, the 6ers needed a guy Simmons and Embiid to kick out to on the wing and willingly traded him away for a player who couldn't shoot)."
Russell Westbrook. If I disassociate the trade that the Thunder made was good but I’m never going to be happy about trading the franchise GOAT.
"Exactly. This is why Russell Westbrook breaking Oscar’s record isn’t a big deal. We all know there’s a better player who’s going to do it down the line (Luka), and with better TS% too (tbh Luka is just better than Westbrook in every way). Russell Westbrook is completely overrated. Not to mention that he’s easily injury prone compared to Luka who shows strong signs of longevity and has GOAT potential. It’s crazy how much attention Russell Westbrook is getting when there’s a better playing doing exactly what he’s doing while being younger and faster."
Bill Russell  Harden or Westbrook  LeBron
Too many people care way too much about what happened 5+ years ago.  I do not care what Paul George did on the Indiana Pacers.  I do not care that Russell Westbrook was in the finals in 2012.  That is not relevant to who they are today.
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
"The year between Harden &amp; Russell Westbrook was an actual race. Apparently that was 2017, can’t believe it was 4 years ago but that was close  Harden had monster stats &amp; was like a top 2-3 seed &amp; Russ averaged a triple double which hadn’t been done since Oscar. OKC was the 6th seed though so it was a very close decision"

Russell Westbrook to the moon!!

"A thread discussing bad contracts.  This article [exists](https://sports.yahoo.com/john-wall-russell-westbrook-and-the-12-hardest-nba-contracts-to-trade-210812805.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACh6iUPs2p-CxVW9XP4dYrULdmcn8DpxOe9zjGCpOagjasQVbdVXfD1tlZ3y0V2-lY4dZsnfC3tc2Ymtb4F1dZY64Fs0rWNhhbcPWgbNtXeftmO-7tGvpov1sC4FtTGWcKFM5UOvpEYru7VJJl5qbwMEKkOjdKWuvAGH1GPGkQQc).  I bring up Russ's terrible contract and play over significant periods of time.  Russ fan: ""BUT DAME...""  This narrative is not created by me and has nothing to do with the Blazers. His contract is bad. I'm sorry that it upsets you. CJ's contract is also bad. See how I'm able to be honest about my team and its players? You should try it.  I'm glad you enjoy lots of triple doubles and a 31-36 record. Calling me toxic to get around valid criticism is childish. I'm sorry that you're not comfortable with honesty."
"You don’t have to use a role player like that as an example. Curry plays a ton off ball.   And Harden played with Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, why would pj tucker need the ball?"
The real one was trying to decide who was better between Russell Westbrook and Alexey shved
"Additionally, 10 of the top 11 rebounders were either born outside the US or can claim citizenship from a country outside the US: Capela (Swiss), Gobert (French), Valanciunas (Lithuanian), Sabonis (US-born Lithuanian), Vucevic (Swiss-born Montenegrin), Kanter (Swiss-born Turkish), Giannis (Greek), Joker (Serbian), Embiid (Cameroonian), and Ayton (Bahamian).  The 11th is Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook since Stephen A. Smith critisized him for not having a Title: 0 titles /s
"I just don't buy that.  Yes, there is some fluidity to positions in basketball due to the nature of the sport.  And there's a few guys who truly blur the lines, but they're more the exception than the rule.     Generally speaking, centers are tall players who sit under the rim and get a large number of rebounds and blocks, while scoring most of their points from close range.  Generally speaking, guards are shorter players who are better at ball handling and shooting.    Generally speaking, forwards tend to fall somewhere in the middle.  With very few exceptions, you can randomly post a good player's stat line and guess exactly whether they're a guard, a forward, or a center without knowing anything else about the player.  For example, even Russell Westbrook - who pushes this to the limit - is still obviously a guard with his 42% shooting and blocks .5 and below.  (Or vice versa for Jokic)"
"and Russell westbrook rebounds more than anybody on washington. That’s what a Center does, but you don’t call Russ a Center.  Jokic is a playmaking center. Stop forcing everybody to point guard."
"Why are you treating ts% like it's some fancy obscure nerd nonsense?   If I drop the jargon and say ""Russell Westbrook misses a lot of shots"" why is that not a valid criticism?"
Why does that not work both ways though?  “If I could swap out Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson for Steph Curry and Klay Thompson id be a fool not to try”  They both wanted to play with each other because it gave them a better chance at winning. Both players wanted to stack the deck.
"Hey dumbass you know he was listed on the injury report and missed time for a quad injury right? “nEvEr oN tHe InJuRy RePoRt.” Either stop lying, or do a goddamn Google search. The only new information that we got was the fact that his quad was torn. Which is not something that is typically disclosed on an injury report.  Edit: Literally a news story in January, while he was playing like shit, about him dealing with quad issues. https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/russell-westbrook-feels-hes-made-breakthrough-his-quad-injury"

"The thing is it takes a healthy ankle to guard an NBA caliber point guard. It does not take a good ankle to beat the shit out of that guy, especially if the person delivering the beating is Russell fucking Westbrook lol"
"Russ can feel the way he wants. But he needs a life coach. He needs to learn to say the right thing for his legacy, his team and the league. He shouldn't reduce himself to macho insecurity. You are Russell Westbrook!"
"But imagine if you were just walking down the street and Russell Westbrook walks past you, dumps a bag of popcorn on your head, and mean mugs you until you walk away"
“Hello police? ~~Chris Paul~~ Russell Westbrook tryna beat me up”

Imagine being a member of the Wizards crew that has to hold Russ back from killing this man (deservedly). Took 5 of them and it looked close. I want no part of an angry Russell Westbrook
"Fuck anyone who does this shit, but fuck Russell Westbrook too. I’ve never watched a game where he didn’t display selfish shitty attitude and throw tantrums while his teammates just watch awkwardly. He takes idiotic shots and shoots more than actual good shooters. Relative to his reputation he’s a fucking hack and has been"

Whew sucks to be 76ers fans right now.  Thank god my team's fanbase would *never* do something stupid near russell westbrook.
The Sixers are just a better team dude.       Also Russell Westbrook continues to suck in the playoffs
Is this the Russell Westbrook is shit fanclub meeting
"Did you think you would have fun watching you play the 1 seed and you have no defense and Russell ""sucks in the playoffs"" westbrook?   I just wouldn't watch this series and prepare for wizards basketball in the fall."
You're right. I need to find a way to stop watching westbrook play basketball. It's horrible and disgusting. I think if there's a world where Russell westbrook never picked up a basketball I think we mightve cured cancer or something
Disgusting. You wouldn't get away with this if you were playing anyone but Russell westbrook
"He's signed for 4 years, but as we've seen with players [his age on a supermax,](https://i.imgur.com/NHyQffi.png) that's not always a good thing in terms of their trade value. Just look at [Russell Westbrook,](https://i.imgur.com/RqH4iQW.png) for instance. If the Clippers are forced by Kawhi to trade PG before free agency starts, who can they realistically get for him while matching that salary?"

Your favorite player must be Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook may have a horrible jumpshot and horrible rim-finishing, but he works his butt off. He's a team leader, and each and every night, he's going to give 150%. Nobody talks about him now, which is the sad truth, but this man is going to be a legend in 15-20  yrs.   TRIPE-DOUBLE KING"

So, Mike Woodson.  Toronto - Kyle Lowry  Miami - Wade  Pacers - Sabonis  Jazz - Mitchell  Denver - Melo again  Cavs - LeBron  Spurs - Timmy  Nets - Deron Williams (sorry Nets fans lol)  Portland - Dame  Phoenix - Steve Nash  Kings - Bogdan Bogdanovic (yeah that's an odd one)  Pistons - Andre Drummond  Magic - Dwight  Rockets - Harden  Mavs - Dirk  OKC - Russell Westbrook  Clippers - Blake Griffin"
"KD is the better player and better recruiter. He would help round out the whole team. If you give Harden the keys, he will demand Chris Paul, demand Chris Paul be removed, demand Russell Westbrook, then he himself demand a trade.  The risk with KD is just him leaving after his contract is up. Presumably he brings in the guys that make good trade fodder and we can rebuild his first year gone and be back to franchise level."
"Luka Doncic won Euroleague MVP at age 19.  Giannis Antentokoumpo won back to back NBA MVPs by 25.  Russell Westbrook just broke the triple double record this season.  Personally, my money is on Robin Lopez."

The fact that they had an opportunity to get to the playoffs as the 10th seed, and Russell Westbrook going ballistic, is what kept them competitive.  Any other year, most teams in that position shut it down."
As if a Russell Westbrook 3 and Alex Len are the only options the team has.
Who won the scoring title in 2015?  Who won the scoring title in 2017?  Do both of those things without mentioning Russell Westbrook and I’ll give you a cookie pal.
Russell Westbrook with better PR.
"It's amazing that UCLA has produced two of the most explosive players today, in Zach Lavine and Russell Westbrook--as well as Kyle."
Russell Westbrook is closer to Fultz than he is to Harden in AST/TO ratio  https://go.nba.com/9e7h Honestly it's not something to brag about and it's definitely a flaw in his game  https://i.imgur.com/TkT0pVH.jpg
"Honestly he had an amazing game. Even as poor a FT shooter as he is 0/6 is an anomaly, he usually makes teams pay for hacking him. But 15/15 with only two turnovers is absolutely incredible and he was almost certainly a big reason why Russell Westbrook only had five rebounds in the game."

Russell Westbrook
"Russell likes him because Scott doesn't criticize Westbrook and tell him when he's fucking up  He lets Russell do whatever the hell he wants and does nothing but suck his dick constantly praising him, rather than guiding him and telling him when he's fuckin up and needs to turn it down a notch, make better decisions, etc  And that's exactly how Russell likes it"
"I just want to make it clear that I’m not a Hawks fan or a Knicks fan, I’m a diehard Oklahoma City fan but at the same time not an OU fan at all in the slightest.   I was rooting for the Knicks at tip, but that changed very quickly and I couldn’t be happier with how that first game ended. Not sure if there’s a backstory or reason for yelling so loudly in unison “Fuck Trae Young”, but lesson learned I hope. Dude is a killer just like all the great who thrives on people talking shit and shutting that talk down and embarrassing those who spoke it.    I wish she would yell fuck Russell Westbrook at some point but he would’ve never done that outside of the playoffs which you weren’t ever in, Nor did hell freeze over otherwise you would’ve made it to the finals the same year as Ash and maybe then you would’ve got Russell Westbrook angry. Which is just how he is playing basketball so I can’t imagine what he would do to deflate the entire MSG arena of it will to continue watching his carve the D up"
"You serious with this shit? You clearly don’t know Scotty Brooks. If you’ve seen any mic’d up sessions you’d know that Westbrook has basically been doing the best player/coach impression since Bill Russell this year. He is the guy speaking with any weight in the huddles, not Scotty.   Scotty is a yes man at this point. Even just today his grand motivational tactic was to invoke the Lion King. His players like him because his idea of coaching is rolling a ball onto the court and letting them do whatever they want. His motivational abilities are laughable."
"I just want to se D Rose, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook get rings before its too late. In that order too but any order is fine"
Why won't you just concede that you created a harmful narrative on Russell Westbrook based on this statistic? Westbrook has his supporters too.
"Prime shaq and Kobe are the 90s? Lmao nice try.   Steph, kyrie, kd, fucking LeBron, Kawhi, Giannis, cp3, kg, Tim Duncan, kobe, prime shaq, Russell Westbrook, harden, dirk, etc.   Not even close"
Derozan at least looks like an nba player.   I wouldn't select Russell westbrook to play for my church team if he found out there's a trophy at the end.
Can always count on Russell Westbrook to take the big moment three pointer despite there being better shooters on the floor.
"If you don't like this, you don't like Russell Westbrook basketball"
I can’t wait to see Bradley Beal leave in the off-season. Russell Westbrook is the most overrated PG in history. The man is certified trash.
Russell Westbrook is better than your fav player lol 🤣
"Embiid can score 50 all he wnats he will get gassed eventually, the Wiz are a run n gun team that makes every game a cardio fest plus having two profilic scorers in Brady Beal and Russell Westbrook  The sixers dont have a dominant perimeter scorer and if you dont it’s very hard to win a championship"
"Its pretty simple - Any team that doesn't have championship aspirations will have players who take it seriously, it might be their only chance to gain a national spotlight that season and engage their fanbase. The games will sell more tickets than a normal regular season game with 0 stakes.  Dame wouldn't rest. Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal would not rest. Zach Lavine wouldn't, Julius Randle wouldn't. Zion, Lamelo etc all these dudes on non-contenders will go out and hoop with that spotlight on them. It might help some of these guys with All-Star voting too if it takes place before February"
"How do you guys can legitimately been a Russell Westbrook fan?? He throws a couple of balls in the stands for no reason, throw a couple of shots just on the backboard, he is putting zero effort on D. Good lord guys!

Allen Iverson brought the “urban” look to the NBA. That was popular till David Stern cracked down.   The whole eclectic designer look was Westbrook.

I take it you've never watched Russell Westbrook play.
"Aleksej Pokuševski was selected with the 17th overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the youngest player selected in the draft. Two days after the draft in November 2020, his draft rights were traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team trade. On 9 December 2020, Pokuševski signed with the Thunder. On 3 February 2021, Pokuševski received his first assignment at Oklahoma City Blue, the affiliate team of Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA G League. In his rookie season, he is the youngest active player in the NBA. On 14 March, Pokuševski made his first NBA career start. He scored 23 points which includes five 3-pointers, grabbed a career-high 10 rebounds and dished out 4 assists in a 128–122 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, becoming the third Thunder rookie (following Russell Westbrook and Darius Bazley) to post a 20–10 double-double. At 19 years and 78 days old, he became the youngest player in franchise history to score 20+ points while also setting the record for being the youngest player in league history with 20+ points, 10+ rebounds and 5+ 3-pointers made in a game. Pokuševski also became the second-youngest player in NBA history to make five 3-pointers in a game behind only LeBron James in 2004."
"Ja Morant is a chill, Gen Z Russell Westbrook"
RUSSELL WESTBROOK &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; STEVEN CURR CONFIRMED
"On paper Philly should smoke the wizards, but that's on paper. I would not be surprised if the wizards stretch the series out to the max. Russell Westbrook is an amazing talent. Bradley Beal is nothing to sneeze at either. Bertans has been a sixer killer the last few seasons as well. I'm not taking the wizards as lightly as some of my other friends that are sixers fans."
I said it last night I will say it again. When Kevin Durant left Russell Westbrook. Russ dragged OKC to the playoffs for three consecutive years with a much worse team in 2016-17 than this current years warriors team. Steph Curry hasn't made the playoffs without KD! Lol.
"&gt;Russell Westbrook  At least Westbrook can make the playoffs.  Someone had to say it.  But seriously, could the Wizards without Westbrook beat the Warriors without Curry?  I doubt it, and I sure wouldn't bet on it."
"I think the problem is Draymond. He is considered and he considered himself, too much of playmaker and great passer. When he actually is just OK in that category, but he made a lot of bad passes. He had 12 TOs in two games. That's Russell Westbrook levels of careless with the ball.  Also Steph, for how much of a great shooter and player he is, he never was the best passer out there, he has vision but also he was historically careless with the ball.  So I don't expect any huge jump in the next season. Because the Warriors system will produce a lot of TOs, when you pass a lot the ball TOs possibility will increase. The only positive thing is that having back Klay could relief Steph from some pressure and maybe Pool and Wiggins will continue to grow in that aspect, so that at least the TOs of Curry would be reduced. As for Green you can't do much than live with that, also him will benefit from having more target to hit.   Oh they also need to add smart players into rotation. They need some smart veteran like Iggy and Livingston was for them in the past."
so Klay is going to be traded to the Wizards for Russell Westbrook?
Harden had Russell Westbrook last year.
What about? I'm just speaking facts.  Also I'm not a Warriors fan lol I'm a Russell Westbrook fan
Ja Morant and Russell Westbrook have a lot of things in common. Let’s hope that 1-8 upsets add to that list!
"You better not be talking about this season Russell Westbrook, the wizards were four games under 500 in the east and he played with Bradley Beal all season.  GSW would've been the sixth seed in the east."

So, to be clear, as a Raptors fan, you're cool with free agents, or traded players, even big names, phoning it in until your F.O pays them $40 million to go and ball out somewhere else? You *want* a league where your team being able to compete is completely dependent on a KD-esque figure deciding he wants to build a superteam in Toronto?"
"Russell Westbrook, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Shaq"
Allen Iverson has nothing on Russell Westbrook as an offensive player. Westbrook could chuck insanely stupid long twos at a 39% clip just as well as Iverson could and is also a much better passer.

Giannis taking a page out of the Russell Westbrook playbook
Undeniably Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook largely due to fit
It's Russell Westbrook. Anything else is wrong.
And he did that’s why it went to 7....?   I’m not a Luka fan boy. My favorite player in the league is Giannis. I’ll actually just post my 10 favorite players to watch:   1. Giannis   2. Zach LaVine   3. Zion   4. Ja   5. LBJ  6. Russell Westbrook   7. Jokic   8. Dame  9. Luka   10. Kyrie
If you think Mitchell is better than PG you need your basketball fan card revoked  As for outplaying him that only happened in 2018 when he was playing through injury and had Russell Westbrook anchoring him on a worse team
"The cap space hit really isn’t that big of a deal for the Mavs. They’re still able to open up max cap space this summer aren’t they?  It won’t really be an issue until Luka’s rookie contract is over since Luka + Zingis make less per year than Russell Westbrook or John Wall. They still have plenty of room for another Max contract.   Obviously, the Mavs wish they were paying him less, but I’m not sure free agency this season has anyone you’d rather give a max contract too. Plus, they still got Hardaway in that deal and he’s been great for them."
"Tell that to Russell Westbrook, Luka (twice), Jeff Green, and Ben Simmons."

"Stats lie. If stats are the means by which to measure a basketball player then Russell Westbrook would be better off at power forward and kristaps at shooting guard.  Wait a minute, you might be on to something.      Jk, stats lie. Especially rebounding stats."
Lonzo Ball  Kyle Lowry  Devonte Graham  John Wall (trade)  Kemba Walker (trade)  POSSIBLY Russell Westbrook (trade)  POSSIBLY Damian Lillard (trade)  POSSIBLY Derrick Rose (free agency)
"&gt;There are assumptions you're making here.   The only assumption I make is that a complex advanced stat from a team of experts who know this stuff better than you and I is likely the best data we can use. I much rather use this stat in my argument than writing up puff-pieces with no factual base like you did.  &gt;One, every single article of playmaking is covered in the OP. Two, everybody weighs each stat between each other equally to you. Three, everyone respects as obscure stats as ""passing versatility"" as you. Four, everyone is valuing the surrounding context to the same rate as you. Those, alone, account for enormous potential for variability.  Bro that’s a stat and they weighed the inputs. I won’t do that because I’m not an expert. That’s the only available catch-all stat on playmaking. That’s simply a much better argument than just saying „I think he’s better at controlling the pace“ which has no factual base.  &gt;BBALL Index had Russell Westbrook as their best playmaker in the NBA in late march of this year, so, pretty deep into the year. Would you agree with that?  Yeah that could certainly be the case. Why should I deny it? He’s definitely one of the best playmakers in the league."

"He never played as a Sonic, but [Russell Westbrook was drafted by them](https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sonics-kd-russ.jpg?w=1024) so in my heart, he's forever a Sonic (it makes zero sense but I have no team, please just give me this delusion)"
I wonder why SAS won't put him on blast tho like russell Westbrook or AD
Russell Westbrook forever
"Ah, the Russell Westbrook special"

"See his comments about Westbrook and D. Russell. Also, Magic is not the best judge of talent, so anything he says you give a thoughtful nod and a Pat on the shoulder"
"After that game I Don’t wanna hear anyone ever put lebron in the same category as mike, magic, Kareem, or even kobe. Dudes a stat padder a bigger better Russell Westbrook who has never got called out on his stat padding. Half asses on defense nearly the last entire decade. He was just chillin watchin the Lakers lose man. Idc what anyone says a “GOAT” and competitive face of organization doesn’t lay down and roll over for nobody, even if a team mate goes down. If anything that makes the dudes above play even harder. If you’re really about ballin and competing you don’t act/play like lebron does in those moments. 🤷‍♂️"
I really believe Carmelo wakes up and thanks God that Russell Westbrook exists.   I don't know if I have ever witnessed a more talented superstar underachieve more than he has.
"The idea is overstated, misused, and over-generalized.  The general idea is that a player who uses a lot of offensive possessions with league average efficiency will make a bad offensive team averagish (raising the floor), but will not be as helpful to a good offensive team that's already efficient.  The players who fit this description are 2017 Russell Westbrook or 2001 Allen Iverson. But the term doesn't totally fit either player.  If you have a good defense, like the 2017 Thunder, dragging the shitty offense to league average raises the team's ceiling to a middling playoff team.  But if you have a great defensive team, like the 2001 Sixers or 2007 Cavs, dragging your team's shitty offense to league average raises the team's ceiling to a contender.  &gt;Harden, a very talented floor general, is more of a floor raising type of player.  Harden led Houston to historically great offenses. How is he not a ""ceiling raiser?"""
"Donovan Mitchell easily and it's not remotely close. When talking about young players people have brought up Ja, Trae, Zion, Tatum, and Luka, and no one even brings this guy's name up just for an honorable mention. He was the superstar on the best team in the playoffs and Russell Westbrook had more MVP votes than him. He had two 50 point playoff games at age 23 and still doesn't get brought up in the convo for best young player. Luka is the only player under 25 that is better than Donovan Mitchell, and I think we'll see if that holds true real soon..."

UCLA teammates Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook. Love seems way past his prime and Russ is still killing it
"Trade for Russell Westbrook to have a big 3 of Lebron, Russ, and AD."
"Dame has literally no help. McCollum is a third option maybe 4th on a good team. OKC had Russell Westbrook, Steven Adam's, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters all who were good at the time. Not to mention Andre Roberson who was shooting lights out in the playoffs that year. The idea that KD left a crap team to join GS is just wrong. Was OKC the greatest team ever assembled? No. But they beat the 60 win Spurs team."
Russell Westbrook?
"But my response was more about him needing to do that due to the teams hes on.  Thats the real question.  Is he a detriment, or a product of the teams hes been on lately?  When I watch the wizards play, it seems like the Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook show."
"It depends on how you interpret value. The vast majority of Russell's value comes from him with the ball, generally driving and kicking/shooting.  Offensively, he is far more polished than Ben.  Off-ball he is negligible. He is a great rebounder,  and exhibits effort on defense, although he is not very good in general.  Ben's offense isn't as refined as Russell's. He shows far more hesitation. He can play the same drive and kick style Russ does, and he has at times when Embiid is out. It's just not the ""full go all the time"" mode Russell has. His size alone gives him more impact off-ball on offense, either screening or sitting in the dunker's spot. He definitely doesn't have Russ's confidence with shooting, and his free throws are terrible. However, he is a very good passer. Ben's defense is exceptional. He doesn't have an assignment he can't handle.   In general, Russell is more impactful, positively and negatively. His variance is far wider. Russell is as likely to win you a game as he is to shoot you out of the game. When it's good for Russell, he's a top 5 guard in the league, and someone that you start to think ""Hm, are we sure he's not a top 10 player?""  The flip side is when Russell is in bad form, like the start of this past season, it's terrible, almost to the point of replacing him. Ben's variance doesn't peak as high, or crater as low.   It's a matter of risk/reward. If there is another star on the team, Ben is likely better, as he will consistently perform defensively while being effective on offense.  If it's a matter of one of them being the only star on the team, Westbrook would be better, as he can lead that team to a higher peak than Ben can."
"KD underperformed in the GS series, but let’s not pretend Russell Westbrook didn’t shoot the ball worse than anyone besides Cam Payne and Waiters."
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"Depends what you want. The Knicks are a good trading partner if you are looking for draft picks and you don't want to take on money.   As an example starter offer, 19, 21, 32 this year plus wherever New York and Dallas land in 2023 gives you four first round picks that convey in the next three seasons and you clear the books once Russell Westbrook expires. If the negotiation heads in a direction where you would want a couple more, swaps or more going forward could be arranged.  The downside to trading with the Knicks of course is that they're talent poor. They aren't really going to have a young and upcoming player that you want."
"If you play that game then you can do the same with 90% of all championships ever won. Just in the last few years, Bam and Dragic were injured in the 2020 Finals, CP3 was injured in the 2018 WCF, Kawhi in 2017, Curry in the 2016 Finals, Kyrie and Love in the 2015 Finals, Dwayne Wade in the 2014 Finals, Russell Westbrook got injured in the 2013 first round when the Thunder were probably the biggest threat to both the Spurs and Heat, Derrick Rose in 2012, Kendrick Perkins in game seven of the 2010 Finals, and so on."
It’s barely believable that James Harden played on the same team as Russell Westbrook.

The one thing Sixers and Wizards fans can agree on is that Russell Westbrook is the absolute worst.
I hope Russell westbrook never wins another game. His style of play is trash and he's useless
Russell westbrook is the worst shooter of all time
"Yep, that’s Russell Westbrook alright"
This is hindsight to some degree. The general consensus was that Westbrook would be the better player (younger healthier etc) and that the spacing on the rockets would allow Russell (one of the best at attacking the paint) to attack the basket and kick if needed. Additionally he put up huge number and the rockets looked good until the injury.

Russell Westbrook is my dad and he's the best dad ever
"Nah, I'm pretty sure he's named Damian Fuck-Russell-Westbrook Lillard, Jr."
Russell Westbrook
"I mean, he did have to carry a couple of guys nicknamed the, “splash brothers” that beat him in the playoffs the previous year. It’s not like they were better than Russell Westbrook, oh, wait."
"I wonder if it'd be in the Heat's best interest to do a soft reset instead of getting Butler back for that type of money. Even if Oladipo was healthy for that Milwaukee series, I'm not even sure if the Heat win that series. They'd win some games but at the end of the day, that roster wouldn't be good enough for anything more than a possible 4th seed that will likely bow out in the conference semi's.   Instead of giving all that money to Butler, why not just go for a soft reset? Adebayo, Herro, Achiuwa, Nunn and I guess Okpala as well(?) would be a good group going forward.   They'd be better off trying to give Kawhi the supermax instead of Jimmy. Kawhi turns 30 in June, Butler will be 32 in September, that's a full 2 years difference and I'd think Riley would much rather be paying Kawhi $50 million a year at 34 than Butler at 36.  There are a lot of players that could potentially hit the market, but the ones that are 100% likely to test the waters are Leonard, DeRozan, Lowry, Conley, Schroder, Holmes, Fournier, Oubre, Hardaway, Miami's own Oladipo and Robinson, along with Rose, Drummond and Williams.  Feel like nabbing Leonard, letting Dragic and Iguodala walk and then possibly getting Robinson back as well would be the best choice of action, along with looking to get some of the lesser shooters. Or if they want to go full rebuild, trying to pry Collins away from the Hawks and also looking at a player like Ball to develop as well could be a decent start.  I'm not a Heat fan, but I don't think keeping Jimmy does much other than keep them a competitive group. The ceiling is as high as Adebayo can develop new skills, because that is their best player down the line. Lots of their role players are older and or going to become expensive soon (like Robinson) so I just feel like a soft or full reset is in order.  They aren't going to be better than Atlanta next year, even though they were close to nabbing the SE title again this past season. Charlotte is probably 2 years away from being just as good if not better, Orlando is a total mystery right now and Washington will always remain a team competing for a playoff spot, no matter how bad the coach and roster is, they have Beal and Westbrook (albeit, a declining Russell).   But for the competition that Riley wants them to be up against, in Milwaukee, Brooklyn and Philadelphia, they simply lack that 1 guy that can be a total boss. Butler is a great player for team ball, but he isn't the player that is going to be getting a bucket down the stretch of games. They have good shooting everywhere and anyone can be the hero, but until they get that boss motherfucker to combat the likes of Giannis, Harden and Embiid, then they are always going to be at a disadvantage."
chris paul? russell westbrook? lillard is definitely up there though
&gt;Is cam payne the best guard ~~that Russell westbrook has ever played with~~?
Is cam payne the best guard that Russell westbrook has ever played with?
"For the future of the Knicks, it's best they look at a younger guy to be their starter. Not too many teams in the NBA will need a starting PG next year.  Hawks have Young, Wizards have Westbrook, Heat COULD use him over Dragic/Nunn, Hornets have Ball, Magic have Fultz/Anthony, Raptors have Lowry/VanVleet, Nets have Irving/Harden, Knicks probably don't have anyone else, Sixers have Simmons, Celtics have Walker(!), Pacers have Brogdon, Bucks have Holiday, Bulls could definitely welcome a return for Derrick, Pistons have Hayes, Cavs have Garland, Grizzlies have Morant, Pelicans need a new PG if they don't want to stick with Ball (could help lead that team to the playoffs with Ingram and Williamson), Spurs have Murray/White, Mavs have Doncic, Rockets have Wall (for the time being), Suns have Paul, Clippers might could get him, Lakers have Schroder/LePointForward, Warriors have Curry, Kings have Fox, Blazers have Lillard, Jazz have Conley, Nuggets have Murray, Thunder have Gilgeous-Alexander and the Wolves have Rubio/Russell.  Would really be interested in seeing if he wants to come back home to Chicago, stay with Thibs, or go ring chasing with the Clippers."
Is cam payne the best guard that Russell westbrook has ever played with?
"You all may know Cameron Payne for being a baller on the Suns, but I’ll always remember him for his electric dance moves with Russell westbrook"
"He hasn't gotten that much better at shot selection, he's just started making more of them instead. The good old Russell Westbrook method."
"Guards are rebounding more, but guards aren't oversized God-tier athletic like Russell Westbrook is. And he studies the game so he knows the probabilities of rebound trajectory - - all of the great rebounders did this."
"Harden was better than kd in this series first of all  Second of all kd numbers are comparable to harden pre gsw, and don’t even get me started about spacing. Kd putting up big efficiency numbers with Steph and klay by his side while harden had to carry the offense in Houston with players like injured 34 year old Chris Paul and a lesser version of Russell Westbrook that couldn’t take advantage of 4vs3 situations.  I have no issue with someone thinking kd is better tho it’s just Reddit my dude"
Lol how y’all think I mean Russell Westbrook?   Bill Russell you morons
No Russell Westbrook obviously
Russell Westbrook isn't close to being a one of the greats lol.  You are an idiot.
"https://www.deseret.com/2021/5/27/22457657/utah-jazz-russell-westbrook-judge-throws-out-fans-lawsuit  Case literally just got dismissed - $100M claim because, without identifying the fan, Westbrook said that racist things were said to him. Please ignore the fact that he outed himself and also tweeted racist things prior to the game."
"https://www.deseret.com/2021/5/27/22457657/utah-jazz-russell-westbrook-judge-throws-out-fans-lawsuit  I mean, Brooks isn't wrong - this dude filed a lawsuit because Westbrook and the Jazz said a fan had said racist things *and didn't even give the name of the fan*."
Russell Westbrook and me
"We need to address the racial element in the room. These are entitled, rich, white people who believe they have the right to treat black athletes as less than human because they purchased a ticket. Because I haven't seen or heard any major incidents with Luka or Jokic. Dirk and Bird seemed to be universally loved by every fan base. I also don't think that it's a coincidence that it's happening more after a post-season focused on racial justice for Black Americans.   Every-time there is a major fan incident, it is case of a white person in an expensive seat treating black players like dog shit. Malice at the Palace. Marcus Smart. The dumbass hoe in Miami with her roid Husband and LeBron. Russell Westbrook. Trey Young. Kyrie.   I know heckling happens in every sport, but as someone that's attended hockey games in the first three rows and baseball games in every section imaginable including the  ""Diamond"" sections and boxes,  I can tell you it doesn't happen nearly as much and it's not nearly as intense and of course it's almost never racially based. This is probably getting downvoted, but it's the truth.   This sub was up in arms about Jeremy Lin getting called coronavirus. Why isn't it up in arms when black players get shat on, assaulted and get racial epithets hurled at themselves and their families on a regular basis?"
" You're a dumbass if you think after all this time I'm only talking about rings.   &gt; If Russel was taken off the Celtics, they’d have 7 HOFers left to work with.   You're just brushing off the fact that Wilt played with as many Hall of Famers and All-Stars as Russell, right? And bro, most of those Celtics were Hall of Famers BECAUSE they played with Russell. Not the other way around.   &gt; He is the only center in NBA history to lead the league in assists.   There you go with the box score stats again lmao. Since you're a Wizards fan, let me ask you: is Russell Westbrook the greatest PG of all time? Because that's your logic. Volume stats that jump off the page but flame out every single postseason.   &gt; You can’t call someone with multiple rings “not a winner”   ""multiple"" is the most generous way possible to say 2 lol. This isn't about rings or team success. It's about how each guy performed in the playoffs. Bill Russell was the best PLAYER in the playoffs at least 8 times, compared to 2 for Wilt. Those teams didn't lose in spite of him. They lost because he was a selfish player and a locker room cancer. You think it's a coincidence that he was traded TWICE in his prime? Including after this so called greatest season of all time? You can't say that about any other pantheon player.   &gt; He also outplayed prime Kareem twice in the twilight of his career.   Wait, so beating someone does equal outplaying them? Because following your logic, Kareem outplayed him while losing. Since Wilt was outplaying Russell all those years? Wilt was averaging less than 15 ppg by 1972. Make you pick, either outplaying someone does go beyond box score stats, OR putting up more volume means you're the better player. You can't just switch what value means as it fits your argument. At least show some consistency."
I mean there’s Ja Morant and Russell Westbrook if you want slashing point guards. They don’t have to be the literal antithesis of half court offense to not be a three point chucker
"Russell Westbrook don’t never look that great aesthetically but when you think about it from a physical perspective they are absolutely monstrous. I have been training to jump higher and dunk as an old man and, from my perspective, the shit he is doing is Clark Kentian."
"I would take post prime Kwame over peak Westbrook.   That's no cap, no troll, or whatever slang the kids are using now a days.   Russell is just not a winning player and does more harm than good. I don't care what efficiency stats this subs throws around about his MVP year, just not a fan of his game."
Players just aren’t racking up assists like Stockton did though. More players are handling the ball now so the assists are getting spread around more.  Stockton averaged 12+ assists per game for 8 consecutive seasons. No player since has averaged 12 assists per game for even a single season. The closest anyone has come is Russell Westbrook this year with 11.7.
"I'm on the fence about him contributing to winning basketball. The better way to say it is, ""You can't win a title when you're paying Russell Westbrook 40+ million a year for the next 3 years"""

"This was the most Russell Westbrook game i ever saw. Shitty shooting selection and poor percentage (15% from the field), a mountain of useless rebound, but in 4th when mettered the most he didn't grab a single rebound and that could cost the Wizards the game (and yes guys like Danny Green and Korkmaz took the ball right over his head, he was down there but put zero effort to take the ball or cut his man off), make a bunch of quite easy passes like 1 pass a way 3 ft from him and the dude take an immediate shot after that. Playing zero defense the whole game, the Wizards always facing comebacks when they throw Russ in the ball game and going well with him on the ball.  Who watch the game without bias (don't think a lot of people here and in general) knows he is only a statpadder that mount up useless stats most of the time. That's why in the title there is the name of Russ when he really played for Philly tonight."
Russell Westbrook. Idk if elevate is the right word but he needs to refine his game for sure.
Russell westbrook
"I posted last year on reddit on how Russell Westbrook was 109 out of 128 for effective field goal percentage, and is historically bad when it comes to turnovers. The year that he and Harden lead the MVP race, they were #1 and #2 ALL TIME for turnovers per game. I got down-voted to oblivion."
KD’s best came in the season Russell missed half of the games. He was putting up 33/8/6 in the games Westbrook missed.
"I’m making a compilation starting right now of every Russell Westbrook turnover as a laker it’s gonna be hilarious at the end of the year, I’ll have curb your enthusiasm music in the background"
When Russell starts balling out he’ll silence this sub. I love Westbrook I want his meat
Tell me it's Russell Westbrook without telling me it's Russell Westbrook
Taking bets now on who will win the upcoming r/nba war of 2021-22; Lakers posters or Russell Westbrook hate-posters.
&gt;21 Russell Westbrook  &gt;54 Kevin Garnett  BRUH
I think the proper question is: why does Russell Westbrook shot *so many* jumpers?
&gt; 21 RUSSELL WESTBROOK  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
"Russell Westbrook at 21, Draymond Green at 30 makes me cringe"
Draymond at 30 was the breaking point for you? Not Russell Westbrook at 21 all-time?
"He probably does to some extent. When the two were teammates, Russell was always the one who was criticised. KD was criticised once, 'Mr Unreliable' but other than that, he was the golden boy who could do no wrong. Westbrook took the heat whenever the Thunder struggled, KD did not have to deal with that responsibility."
I’m dying at Russell Westbrook 😂😂😂
"I’m sorry but Westbrook is great.... at stat padding, he isn’t efficient, he literally steal rebounds from teammates, worst shot selection in the league right now and he just doesn’t play winning basketball. There are absolutely 75 people I would choose over him, I would rather have Chauncey Billups playing point guard than Russell Westbrook"
Russell Wilson is Russel Westbrook if he went to a Catholic prep-school.
Russell Westbrook is comfortably a top 40/50 player of all time
Classic Russell Westbrook at #21 of All Time Greatest Players.
"Russell Westbrook at 21 and Isiah Thomas at 42. It's nice when insanity is that perfectly symmetrical. The guy with no rings who can't shoot, ranked twice as high as the undisputed leader of the team that won two championships during the GOAT's peak."
Russell Westbrook over Karl Malone lol
"1. Ben Wallace 2. Rip Hamilton 3. Chauncey Billups\* 4. Rasheed Wallace 5. Tayshaun Prince  Honorable mentions : Antonio McDyess, Russell Westbrook, Joe Johnson, Khris Middleton, Hakeem Olajuwon  \*I'll admit I'm very bothered by the allegations we've seen this offseason, and if proven guilty he'll be off that least"
Russell Westbrook. It’s not an athletic skill people like to go bragging about but in addition to all his other athletic skills I’m really impressed by his stamina. Although we all know he isn’t exactly the most efficient the volume he plays with requires pretty wild stamina to maintain the numbers he puts up he’s constantly on go I think he would be super badass tennis or soccer player if life had lead him that direction.
"1. Allen Iverson 2. Russell Westbrook 3. Michael Jordan 4. Dwyane Wade 5. Reggie Miller  HM Kobe, Lebron, Ray Allen, Nash, Stockton, Pistol Pete"
"Russell Westbrook at 21 is the biggest wtf lol, I honestly don’t even have him in my top 75"
"Hey, that's interesting.  My homer list would be:  - Russell - Bird - Ray Allen - IT4 - The Glove  If I take out the Celts, it's going to be an adopted team that I really liked back in the day:  - Glove  - Shawn Kemp - Xavier McDaniel - Tom Chambers - Dale Ellis  If I have to remove that team too... I'd have to really think to produce:  - Nash - Duncan - Stockton - Dr. J - Westbrook"
"I just think it’s always incredibly anecdotal when talking about how ‘basketball fans’ rate x player  Like you throw around terms like ‘people think’ or ‘basketball fans’ like that means anything at all but it doesn’t. The entirety of ‘basketball fans’ don’t have consensus opinions about anything. You show me 100 people who sleep on Vanfleet and I’ll show you 100 people who would say he’s Steph 2.0.   Look up FVV current 2k rating. 1 point lower than Lowry’s current rating. Look at FVV contract, 12th highest paid pg in the league. That would seem to show that GM’s at least would rate him as an above average starting pg.  So like where’s the underrated part? I swear all these posts about ‘x player is under/overrated’ are just circlejerks where people can trash on whatever player is on the hot seat (Ben Simmons right now, Paul George last year, Russell Westbrook anytime) or where people can circlejerk about players that only they are smart enough to realize are actually good (FVV, Alex Caruso, Robert Williams, ect) and where they have to put down the filthy ‘casual fans’"
Russell Westbrook in a negative way
"Kyle Lowry vs Russell Westbrook.  I'm not saying Lowry's better, but that it's a lot closer than you initially imagine, especially when you consider actual contributions to winning. Lowry: 960 games, 98.3 WS, 0.155 WS/48, 1 championship. Westbrook: 943 games, 104.8 WS, 0.154 WS/48, 1 MVP.   Counting stats included, WB blows him out of the water and will be a deserved shoo-in HOFer. Maybe what this shows more specifically, however, is that Lowry should also be strongly considered for the HOF. A final comparison: even though Lowry is 35 and WB 32, who do you think the Lakers would have rather acquired this offseason?"
It just depends really. Russell Westbrook is better to lead a team but if I want a championship team I’d pick Kyrie over him
"1. LeBron James  2. Penny Hardaway  3. Russell Westbrook  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Tayshaun Prince  HM: Tmac, Rip Hamilton, Zeke, Steph"
"Lebron, Russell Westbrook, Giannis, Steph, Draymond"
Russell Westbrook.
The Russell Westbrook vs Jordan Poole thread was better
"Lebron James,  Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
"This is Russell Westbrook his entire career - plays the game at an extremely high tempo. An effective individual style that makes him a very tough player to guard.  The downside is that he gets himself out of control more often than most players, and he misses layups and throws the ball away because of it.  Someone mentioned that he needs to be coached up, and Vogel will do that.  Maybe so, but I don’t think these turnovers are because he “starts slow”. I mean, sure, everyone has some rust to shake off, but this is the way he plays the game. He’s gonna turn it over a bunch in the regular season too."
"CP3 is better than Russell Westbrook all time, but the gap is minuscule. Like, literally the same size gap as Bird and Magic. Anyone that thinks it’s not even close hasn’t been watching Westbrook."
"Almost all the Laker flairs you see commenting on here are acknowledging this is going to be an unknown season as far as how they will come together.   And the season hasn't even started yet and you are assuming everything will be certainly one way between Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis.  Only a hot take shit poster would say they know how this team will play with Westbrook."
People thought Dennis Smith Jr. was gonna be Russell Westbrook for seemingly no reason

"Cade?? Huh? We’re talking about Russell Westbrook, correct?"
\[Serious\] Is it time to be concerned about Russell Westbrook?
Has Jordan Poole blew a 3-1 lead?    Has Russell Westbrook won a March Madness game on a buzzer beater?     Which players' stats has meaningful calories?
why isnt anyone talking about the fact that russell westbrook has not has a single turnover since the 1st quarter?
First time watching Russell Westbrook?
"The Lakers are starting DeAndre Jordan, LeBron James, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk and Russell Westbrook.  Should be fun."
"Ok controversial takes:  I didn’t think this was too controversial, but looking at this sub I guess it is. Luke will be the face of the NBA after LeBron. Everyone brings up the fact that he hasn’t won a playoff series, but if you watch those games knowing that: the kid is only 3 years into the NBA, carrying a trash team, and playing against two elite defenders that should absolutely shut him down. He’s got loads of potential  The Magic have the best color pallet and name in the NBA, and the most potential for branding (it’s literally magic. They could make some wild jerseys). Some cosmic-themed jerseys could be sick if done right  Russell Westbrook (one of my favorite players) was never a natural scorer. His scoring was because of his aggression and imposing himself, his shot selection was often iffy and his averages weren’t great.   The Sixers brought all this drama on themselves. Teams should embrace their teammates/staff. Not automatically throw them under the bus, bringing hate from all over the league onto Ben. He was absolutely the reason the Sixers lost, but they should’ve stood with him to resolve it. The Mavs absolutely lost because of Porzingis, but they stood by him and they are still on (I assume) good terms coming into the new season.  Joel Embiid holds back, and he could be much better than he is. Knowing that he’s got bones of glass and skin of paper, he plays reserved hoping not to get injured (even though he still does). If he were healthier he’d be this generations Shaq  Hate for the bandwagon fans is bad for the NBA fandom. Box office teams like Kobe/Shaq, MJ, Kareem/Magic, LeBron/Kyrie, Curry, etc. attract fans who are curious what the hype is about. It brings in new people who don’t know much about the NBA teams, so they form an attachment to their first team (big-name team) which is then criticized by old fans  Anthony Davis is a beast, but he’s not a good first-option player   Seattle shouldn’t get an NBA team if the NBA expands. They had a chance and lost it, dozens of other cities would kill to have had an NBA team. Give a chance to other cities  Sort of building off that last one. No city should have 2 teams. The second teams should relocate somewhere to provide more fans with a “home team”. The Knicks are New York’s team, the Lakers are LA’s team. Give the Nets and the Clipper’s to cities that have wanted an NBA team  Draft expectations can ruin a players perspective. Most players coming into the NBA are still just college age kids, they need a few years to develop into role players or possibly stars. But labeling them a star from day one stunts them into being widely labeled a bust if they don’t live up to those monstrous expectations"
"Shameful! I bought my son tickets to this game so he could see his favorite player just for Anthony Davis to sit out! The NBA really needs to do something about this, now we’ll have to settle for just watching LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Russell Westbrook."

"which player can be the point guard on a championship team, Russell Westbrook or Jrue Holiday?"
I had a few minutes so I threw together the average player ranks across all the panelists.

"Ah yes, 9 time MVP winner Russell Westbrook"
"&gt; My initial post wasn't pro-CJ, it was made to point out that the phrase ""his flaws"" in the comment above was doing a lot of work. A typical player flaw is something like a weak off-hand or below-average speed. The current situation is a bit beyond critiquing a player's attributes, so I was highlighting some of what makes any normal comparison moot.  Makes sense, I guess I just don't see the point of expounding on Simmons' flaws when thousands of users here are foaming at the mouth to paste the exact same Ben Simmons criticism paragraph every time his value is brought up. Flaws is a perfectly fine substitute to encapsulate Simmons' issues that literally every single NBA fan knows. It's like everyone here obviously knows the situation and understands that Simmons isn't going for peak market value at this time, including the guy you replied to.  &gt; As for the contract, if Ben hit the open markets now, aside from the teams that couldn't or wouldn't try to sign him due to their salary cap situations, why would teams who already have a top tier PG go for someone who reportedly wants the ball in his hands?  The same reason the Lakers went for Russell Westbrook despite having Lebron and AD, if you have a chance to get a star player, you go for it and worry about the fit later. The Warriors and Curry along with the Blazers and Lillard, two of the three best PGs in the league, have already expressed how enthusiastic they would be to acquire Simmons which is evidence to the contrary by itself. Teams all along the ladder from rebuilding to mediocre to championship caliber have all shown tons of interest to make a deal if possible. Morey is what's stopping them, certainly not any hesitations about paying him. The only teams that wouldn't give Simmons the max are, like you said, salary constrained and wouldn't be in the running to acquire him anyways for those reasons. Also like you said, it is just differing opinions, but at the end of the day there's not a single player of Simmons' caliber in the modern NBA that hasn't received a max contract and several who are far worse than Simmons who have as well.   &gt; The fact is that Simmons is 100% historically and theoretically worth more than CJ, but depending on how long this holdout goes, a less-good CJ is undoubtedly worth more to the 76ers than a not-playing Simmons  Sure, but at that point, that would be Morey's fault alone and doesn't really have anything to do with Simmons. The Blazers would likely be more than happy to include additional picks along the CJ right now, the issue is the current ask is absurd for any player."
"Worse than that, Dennis Rodman at #18. Russell Westbrook #21... Scottie Pippen ahead of Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal... wow.... again... how does this person get paid for these takes? It's literally all about who you know, I'm convinced now more than ever,"

"russell westbrook, sadly"
"He is the Russell Westbrook of defense. His MVP season especially, he broke advanced stats. But would you really say he had the best season ever?   Gobert’s team creates a fundamentally flawed system that boosts his regular season stats, and gets exposed in the playoffs every time. While maybe any one of his DPOY awards could be argued as deserved, he is racking them up and could very well become the most decorated defender of ALL TIME. It’s clearly time to stop giving them until he can actually show his worth in a meaningful game.   There is clearly a problem with how the awards are given if Rudy fucking Gobert has more accolades than Duncan, KG, Ben Wallace, Draymond Green, Dennis Rodman, Mutumbo, or Kawhi. 6/7 of these players have led their teams to championships with defense. Gobert is a class below."
He also fucked up the D-League when he got sent down there. Man became Russell Westbrook before Russ was Russ.
"The Lakers, who are contending for a championship this year, traded for Russell Westbrook. If he wasn’t seen as valuable the Lakers wouldn’t have voluntarily traded for him."
The Russell Westbrook special
"Lmao what a take. Gobert is hilariously overrated. People give him dpoys because they look at stats in regular season games that other teams don’t care about.   He is the Russell Westbrook stat-padder of defense. I’ve seen the video where players on some random Tuesday regular season game avoid taking it into the paint when he’s there, but that really doesn’t mean shit in a game that actually matters.   When Reggie Jackson drives in your face multiple times in a row in the playoffs and absolutely chops you up, you are not a DPOY, let alone “underrated” on defense."
"What's the covid vaccine mandates like in LA. If they are not restrictive as Brooklyn maybe Kyrie should ask to get trade to LA maybe for Russell Westbrook.  Maybe we see how the trio of Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Kevin Durant do on the same team.   I don't think we've ever seen it happen before. I think people would be thunderstruck of it ever happens"
"Honestly this isn't the reason. Max Kellerman has said this, but if Russell Westbrook was a 40% 3-PT shooter he would be the best player in the league, he's just physically incapable of that.  He makes bad decisions, but so does every other player in the league, his intensity is good at every point of the game, the reason he isn't more successful is his 31% 3-PT shooting and his 65% FT shooting."

Russell Westbrook is better than John Stockton.
"Completely agree. People are so blinded by their hatred for the Lakers and LeBron that it's hard to come by actual analysis of the team they built. Russell Westbrook isn't going to be pulling up and chucking up 15 jumpers a game lol.   I think we are about to see an incredible version of Russ where he has one of his best playmaking years of all time. Him and LeBron sharing ball handling duties and allowing each other to rest is going to be huge. Last year the Lakers fucking sucked when Bron had to sit. The offense would tank with no true facilitator, but now they can stagger Bron and Russ and always have a true facilitator on the court.     Everything hinges on AD's health, but I think the trio of all stars is gonna work well together and they have some really nice complementary pieces depth and shooting-wise.    They should easily be the favorites to come out of the West assuming health"
Nice to see you had an entire season to watch russell westbrook and came away from that thinking “man that guys effort on defense is phenomenal”
Then you and every other person on here should stop attacking people for simply not riding Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is an elite player
"&gt;and ended up being one of the best to ever play the game  Yes, that's only the eyes of fans who appreciate his physical appearance. In terms of actual on court results? **He can shoot the ball. But, that is all**. Nothing else. He's 6'3"" but cannot run the halfcourt set as good as most nba PGs today. He's not athletic, so he cannot dominate on the offensive end like other 6'3"" players/Russell Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, etc. His defense is atrocious.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, when 2009 arrived. America was in a brand new place it'd never been in so the league-office got the urge to use the NBA for that symbolism of Pop Culture's love affair with Obama's election and therefore all humans with similar physical attributes as Obama.  Nonetheless, I love him as a person. Why? Because he sees the unfair, undeserved preferential treatment he receives for the past 6yrs ---*and he never EVER uses it to piss off other players like he can eeeeasily do*. Never.  He stays humble and unassuming, and it is truly a rarity. Most of all, whenever big media is being unfair to some melanin players \[Draymond, Wiseman, or Andrew Wiggins?\] then he always finds a way to just smile and make a public statement that subliminally/stealthily disagreed with how big media is handling said players."
"I know it would have been expensive, I still think it’s a mistake. But I also wouldn’t have dedicated 44 million to Russell Westbrook either. Gimme the buddy deal all day so I can keep KCP and AC. While the Lakers needed another playmaker, I wonder if they could have managed their resources better. I’m super skeptical of this teams ability to defend the perimeter."
A 7ft Russell Westbrook with inspector gadget arms? absolutely ridiculous.
* Tingus though could make arguments about that at the time he was signed. * Simmons though again at the time * Westbrook is questionable * Tobias Harris * Wiggins * D'Angelo Russell  While not exactly mediocre players they are in comparison to other max guys.  Like Tobias Harris is a good player but not a max guy
Passion Play is definitetly a porno starring Russell Westbrook. This might not be a part of Russ that we want to see.
They’re quietly trying to get him traded to the Lakers for Russell Westbrook.
It’s situational. Russell Westbrook is incredibly over paid but it doesn’t really matter too the Lakers because they didn’t have many options for how to use their cap.
"The Clippers were not and are not a good defensive team so Idk what you're talking about. Donovan Mitchell torched them just as much right after and Booker would have torched them the entire series just like in game 1 if he didn't break his nose and have to wear a mask (ruining his peripheral vision).   Also I like how you at least acknowledge the stat padding lmao. ""yEaH bUt hE DidN't dO iT iN gAmE 5"". Which btw he scored 42 on 37 shots in that game lol so if you wanna call it a good game then sure.. I guess? Russell Westbrook minus all of the athleticism and somehow even worse on defense.   Regarding Dame, I don't feel the need to talk him up because for the most part I think he's properly rated. He's somewhere between 7-11 and I think that's the fair. On the other hand, Luka is by far the most overrated superstar. At best he is number 10, and that's me being generous."
[Woj] Laker’s Russell Westbrook has announced his plans to explore NBA coaching opportunities following his playing career.
"And AD was measured 6' 10"". We are supposed to believe that they are only 1.5 inch apart. My answer? No way. And anybody who has eyes' answer is ""what the f they were smoking when measuring Lebron?  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/anthony-davis-lebron-james-carmelo-anthony-and-russell-westbrook-of-picture-id1235580943?s=2048x2048"

Russell Westbrook is only 43 days younger than Kevin Durant.
Let's see.  0. KD  1. Giannis  2. LeBron  3. Curry  4. Kawhi  5. Harden  6. Jokic  7. Luka  8. Embiid  9. Davis  Yep. Deffo Top 10. YES. HE'S BETTER THAN RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"I don't think you fully understand how  hard it is to add 4 asts per game...there are much better passers than him that don't average 10 asts a game. To really illustrate how hard it is...In Chris Paul's 16 year career...he has only officially averaged 10 or more asts in a season 5 times. Last year's top 10 in asts, only russell westbrook averaged 10 or more and aside from De'Aaron Fox and Ja Morant (7 a piece), everyone else on that list are perennial all-stars...  It's insanely difficult. Simple as that"
"Here's the list of players who hit 10APG in the last few years.  2020: Russell Westbrook  2019: LeBron James  2018: Russell Westbrook  2017: Russell Westbrook  2016: James Harden, John Wall, Russell Westbrook  In short, you have to go back to the 2016-2017 season to find more than one player averaging 10 APG in a season. Obviously, it's not impossible, but if your name isn't LeBron James or Russell Westbrook, both of whom are unlikely to hit it this year because they're teammates, it's highly unlikely."
Pushes Russell Westbrook during red light green light
Presti is not doing it at a larger scale       Presti started by getting a ton of picks for Paul George and Russell Westbrook       Hinkie started by getting 2 picks for Jrue Holiday. Sixers started with literally no assets. Thunder came out the gate with 7 FRPs and more swaps

"good news thunder fans, you're going get the return of russell westbrook to your team very soon, probably around the trade deadline, and you'll get a first round pick in the process"
I’m still not confident that Russell Westbrook can make a routine layup 75% of the time.
"Watching the Lakers develop Ball, Ingram, Caruso, Randle, Zubac Russell, Kuz etc etc for the next 7 years would be more fun the current timeline we are in.  Lakers have a 1-2 window left watching Lebron give up in playoff time (which, is understandable given he's 39 years old), Anthony Davis in Street Clothes, and Russell Westbrook play hero ball and then we spend the next 5 years being 10-12 seed.  &amp;#x200B;  dont @ me"
Russell Westbrook is the Best PG since Magic Johnson.  Jaylen Brown has more potential than Jayson Tatum.  Kevin Durant is the GOAT 2nd fiddle.   Porzingis is the most predictable player in the NBA. Second is Carmelo  Giannis is more dominant than SHAQ
"Dame is essentially Russell Westbrook. He has all the talent in the world, but idk if the way he plays could ever produce a championship. I honestly don't know who would would be the perfect robin next to Dame's batman."
Russell Westbrook isn't as good as he thinks he is. He is still pretty damn good. And every team that has had him has definitely needed him.
Russell Westbrook is the worst MVP since I don't know who
"Apparently it's ""Russell Westbrook will never win a ring and it's entirely his fault"""
"Russell Westbrook is a once in a generation talent that will go down as one of the best to ever do it. 10 years after he retires it will all be about how he accomplished unbelievable statistical feats, carried a couple scrub teams to the playoffs and helped elevate multiple players to their MVP seasons, regardless of if he gets a ring or not. Playing hard will forever be referenced as a measure of how close someone is to playing as hard as Westbrook did."
&gt; Russell Westbrook  Lol
Russell Westbrook is the worse dressed player in the nba
"Russell Westbrook is still a top 15 player.  From 2018-19 to 2020-21 he changed teams every off-season which is very difficult and also had injuries but played through them (something r/nba complains stars not doing but once they do forgets all about it).  This season he'll fortunately be healthy. I obviously expect his first three months to be shaky cause of his new environment and role but I also fully expect him to play like the top 15 player he is come February.  I value his rebounding a lot, I value his playmaking a lot, I think his shortcomings are purely psychological and I believe in LeBron helping him feel confident with himself and realize his potential as a part of the greatest Big 3 in the league."
"Russell Westbrook, has never played basketball thats conducive to winning, and Durant made him seem better than he is/was."
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
"It's not a huge indictment on anyone. So funny /r/nba gets between 1 - 8 games into a season, and types grand statements about players   No d'angelo russell is not a WNBA player who snuck into the league. No westbrook is not your 7th best player on a championship team.  People are silly."
"Guarantee Awkward Speech is gonna say smth like ""Julius Russell Westbrook Randle"""
"He had some good defensive possessions in the third, I’ll give you that. But Towns for the majority of both games vs. NOLA got pinned under the basket by Val far too many times. The boards grabbed while Towns had to help on contest only makes up a fraction.  Ant self creating those looks in transition at the end of the day with acrobatic finishes and a nice poster, plus the barrage of 3s he hit. If only Towns didn’t ice him out for bad shots during multiple possessions in the fourth, like Dane Moore said, letting Ant go into Russell Westbrook mode with usage to close it out would’ve been a better strategy."
"No worries, we are paying Russell Westbrook just 90 million over two years."
"Lebron, Russell Westbrook, AD, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan  Vs.  Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Harrison Barnes  Why is that questionable?"
Julius “Russell Westbrook” Randle
"Russell Westbrook is averaging a career high steals per game this year. I don't think he's improved defensively, at all.   On the other hand, KCP is averaging a career low steals per game. I don't think he's playing worse defense, at all.  Caruso has played 4 games. To suggest that he's somehow vastly improved his defense based on raw steals/blocks is pretty dumb. He was absolutely elite last year."

"it’s like y’all don’t watch basketball, bradley beal??  ai shot from ranges of like 26%-33% from 3.   he’d be a bona fide  russell westbrook, and not a good teammate in modern nba"
"I hope what they do is make a system where it's a formal trade request, like a legal document filled out with the team and given to them, so we have less speculation. And then it'll be like a letter with some formal reasoning attached, made available to the press and public so the player has to treat it seriously. Also, the request would be final/expire at the end of the season, with players being able to renew it.   Imagine if players simply didn't need to speak through their entourages and instead we have a list of ""who wants to be traded"" made available for the public. Idk how it would work but so much of the ""does he/does he not?"" talk could be eradicated immediately.   Also, no offense, players already give up money when they move teams and lose their bird rights, Russell Westbrook signed a 5 year max with OKC and gets paid like 12 million more than Lebron because of it. There's already financial incentive to stick around."
The Thunder seem to be in a much better place with their draft chest than if Paul George and Russell Westbrook left in Free Agency
Russell Westbrook is turning into the very thing he vowed to fight against....Patrick Beverly 😱😱😱
Russell Westbrook learning Kendrick Perkins skills.
"Exactly the point.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, John Wall, AD and Jimmy Butler all had that option as well.  That's 8 max contract players (not counting Ben Simmons) in just the last couple of years. ESPN keeps pushing the Zion and Doncic want our narrative too which would be 11 players."
Russell Westbrook
"poor harden, the rockets only gave him dwight howard, chris paul, and russell westbrook to play with!"
"Can we just make a big ""Russell Westbrook is bad &amp; evil"" thread ?"
"Also keep in mind r/nba's player evaluation is often wrong and extremely reactionary. See Westbrook, Russell the last two seasons. He started off with a new team and struggled and then reminded everyone of the player he is. With that said, I would definitely take Ja over Westbrook, but certainly wouldn't say Brogdon or Ball at this point."

"Except that's a lie. What about Clyde Drexler, Alvin Robertson, Fat Lever, Sidney Moncrief, etc.?   I mean, one of the best rebounders of all time was somewhere between 6'4"" and 6'6"" in Charles Barkley which is guard height. Russell Westbrook is a good rebounder for a guard but not the best in history at any aspect of rebounding."
"In a game with Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony  Ja Morant is the best player on the floor by far."
"Cole ""Russell 'Muscle Chestbrook' Westbrook"" Anthony"
And of course Russell Westbrook remembers how to light up the court.
austin reaves must be thinking he's going to wake up any second lmao... literally in the game with teammates lebron james russell westbrook dwight howard and carmelo anthony
"Russell Westbrook, and I mean this in the kindest possible way, plays basketball like a rabid wolverine"
"Michael Carter-Williams.  Anyone drafted by the Knicks or Timberwolves.  Recently, Russell Westbrook in OKC."
"They should have hit it when someone suggested, ""How about trading for Russell Westbrook?"""
"This team is pretty stupid. Letting go of Caruso and KCP for Russell Westbrook was a terrible idea. They don't have any defense or shooting, yet somehow they are losing in terms of collecting boards and points in the paint as well. I expect those latter two problems to be solvable but the first two are going to stay unless this Westbrook experiment is abandoned."
Russell Westbrook + Kobe Bryant = Michael Jordan.
Imagine getting Russell Westbrook over buddy when LeBron is not taking a back seat or playing less minutes... lol this one is for sure on LBJ
"Luka ""Russell Westbrook"" Doncic"
But neither is Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis tbh.
"Luka is bottom tier defense as well and he has no excuse for that given his size, his positioning and conditioning are horrible   Sure he's ""better"" but that's like saying ""Russell Westbrook is a better three point shooter than Giannis"""
"Russell Westbrook. He was failed by the OKC Thunder, then the HOU Rockets, then he was failed by the WAS Wizards, and finally it’s still early but he might be failed by the LA Lakers.   Westbrook has only been able to play with scrubs like Harden, KD, Beal, AD, and Lebron. SMH."
basically russell westbrook with talent
"Yeah, came here to say this. Westbrook just looks entirely out of place and he’s getting targeted on defense on top of that now. I’ve heard people talk about how maybe the answer is to play him with the 2nd team mostly but I think that’s flawed because…  - Westbrook has to buy into that and aside from the reality that that situation will be the only way he’d be able to have a lockdown grip on the offense, he’s also been a first team guy all his career.  - Who are you closing out games with? If it’s Westbrook I don’t see how he just magically becomes a fit with AD and LeBron in the last 8 minutes of a game.  - They’re giving Carmelo Anthony a lot of second team minutes and even a squad of backups playing against a team with both Westbrook and Anthony on the court at the same time will feast on the offensive end.  They’ll figure something over the next 80 games I’m sure but… what? It’s not like he’s going to suddenly start shooting well from 3 or being an effective roll man on picks after never ever doing that before in his career. And in the half court offense, who would you really rather run the offense through, LeBron or Russell? Even when they were both in their primes the answer was clearly James."
Yeah but let's see em do it with MVP Russell Westbrook on the court
Is this the same guy who got angry to the point of tears taking about Russell Westbrook wearing a dress
The Lakers really traded for Russell Westbrook instead of him lol
[a Laker fan mentioned that no cap he'd rather have Ben Simmons right now coz he'd rather have a dude who can playmake and play D than Russell Westbrook calling his own number with his bricky jumpshot. He said a Westbrook jumpshot is equivalent to a turnover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-DCPU58j28&amp;t=1083s)
"I think he is. Dude is a bad off ball defender and is late in transition D. He also is inefficient shooting the ball. Russell Westbrook going 100% speed is the only good thing about him in offense (its the only good thing he does on offense other than the obvious kickout to the open man) and even then his passes are reckless and so are his handles. He's a point guard yet I don't trust him in handling the ball compared to other elite point guards. Dude is too reckless and that's just not good.   Don't get me wrong he has upside, but his downsides overweigh what he can give to the Lakers team. He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's been traded three times now and for a good reason.   What's he gonna do now that he didn't do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal? This is the same Lakers team that left him wide open during the Bubble when they eliminated the Rockets. What's he gonna do? Tell me? Distribute the ball and kick it out? How many times will he turnover the ball? And if he does, do you really want LeBron and AD be spot up shooters for him? How many times will he shoot an unnecessary jumper?"

Because Klay is perhaps the best 3p catch and shooter in the world? Also often responsible for guarding the best perimeter player of the other team?  His offensive stats are elite (averaging around 5ppg less than curry while shooting less) while his defense is basically all-nba. Why is shot creation the barometer for whether a player is top 75? Is Dwight a shot creator?  Russell Westbrook (made the list) is a guy with an insane talent that has never played the game the way it's supposed to. Stats padding and low percentages have made it so he has never won anything and will never given what is presence on the court does to the Lakers. Klay silently fulfilled his role in the best team of the decade performing every one of his assigned duties to perfection. And we criticize him because he did not create his own shots? So to be recognised he should have gone to OKC and be the best player and take 40 shots a game and push his teammates around so he can grab more rebounds? Come on.
We need a Marvel What If . . . ? Series.  *What if Ben Simmons was Traded for Russell Westbrook on Christmas Day?*
imagine passing the ball around so well to end up with a russell westbrook contested 3 LMFAO
"Because the post asked ""Has Russell Westbrook been a bad trade for every team he has been on since OKC?"". Westrbook was traded for Jon Wall.  I then said they wouldn't have made the playoff w/o him and you argued that point.  If you wanna give Beal credit, I'm cool with that, but Russ was a massive part of it."
"LeBron being your team’s best shooter isn’t going to cut it. Also at one point the Lakers were outscored 48-6 in the paint with Anthony Davis, LeBron James &amp; Russell Westbrook. If this team isn’t going to play any defense they have to outscore teams ffs."
Russell Westbrook's best skill: finishing with all out effort attacking the rim in transition  Russell Westbrook on the Lakers: can't make layups  This is gonna be good
Russell Westbrook yet again ruining another basketball team.
"This Lakers team has LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook and their offence is festering liquid ass"
"Fuck Russell Westbrook and this weird roster, I miss Bald Mamba :("
Russell Westbrook still hasn't had a game which he made more FGs than turnovers
"""Sir, I would like to speak to the manager. I ordered one Bradley Beal, not a Russell Westbrook."""
Russell Westbrook is a man
"Wow amazing comment. However, I watched all the Spurs playoff games from 2002 till now and in the eye test Manu was irreplaceable. I don't think any of the statistics you mentioned can truly capture the player that Manu was. Obviously, I'm a fan and I'm biased, but he was an integral part of a team that dominated the 2000's and stayed relevant for half a decade afterwards, IMO his importance as a player in the NBA is greater than other great players who played in his era and were included in the list (Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook)."
"Copy/paste for any great player lol. It’s not feasible for one guy to dominate the ball all game (see Westbrook, Russell). Point being is LBJ needs the ball to affect the game, whereas Steph needs to be accounted for as soon as he crosses half court, sometimes even further"
how tf did russell westbrook get on that list and not Klay?

"Same with Russell Westbrook, I think a lot of recency bias was involved here, because the League know they had to acknowledge more active players and beloved ones in particular.  They didn't include guys like Tony Parker, Chris Webber, Paul Gasol, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh. Also Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady, even if they never played in a conference finals/finals (not considering Spurs TMac), had a chance if Lillard, AD and Russ was there...  Imho the biggest snubs are Parker and Gasol, with multiple rings and important role in winning them, multiple all NBA and allstar selection...  Edit: also Melo and Harden didn't deserve completely the call 🙄"
"the one thing I will give Dame which Dwight doesn't get discounted for..Dame has been playing in a guard heavy era. During Dame's career he's had to compete with Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, John Wall (when he was good), Isaiah Thomas (when he was good), Chris Paul, Kyrie, Kyle Lowry, I mean this era has been one of the most stacked guard eras in a while.   Meanwhile Dwight was making first team as a Center in an era where Shaq in PHX was 3rd team, Andrew Bogut who never made an All Star game is 3rd team, Tyson Chandler who's never made an All Star team was 3rd team. Usually the second best Center was Amare Stoudemire who's more of a Power Forward really, so yeah Dwight was making first team as literally the only TRULY dominant center during his era. Dame is out here missing First Team All NBA because he's behind Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, aka guys that are all on the top 75. Dwight Howard never had to beat a top 75 guy to make All NBA. Dame could very well get 1st team the next 3-4 years now that CP3 has cooled off, Westbrook has cooled off, Curry is still hot but maybe Dame has as good of year."
"Nah Luka was bad, worst +/- on the team and posted a bad Russell Westbrook type of score line. One thing that stuck out was, the Mavs looked so lost on D it was actually sad. Luka literally gave up multiple times for Defensive possessions"
"I'm not dismissing Taylor, I think his work is rather good and I've read some of his pieces before. Just not on Miller.   I just don't understand, who are you leaving off from a list of:  PG - Magic, Curry, CP3, Stockton, Isiah, Big O, Nash, Kidd, Westbrook (yes, even with his flaws, but considering all of his accolades), Cousy. West. Reggie doesn't beat any of them with his accolades and he beats only Westbrook with playoff performances. Even that might be debatable, considering some of Westbrook's brilliant performances in 2011-2016. SG - Jordan, Kobe, Drexler, Harden, Wade, Iverson.  SF - Bron, Durant, Bird, Kawhi, Erving, Pippen, Havlicek, Baylor. PF - Duncan, KG, Dirk, Barkley, Giannis, Malone, Pettit. C - Wilt, Kareem, Russell, Hakeem, Shaq, Moses Malone, David Robinson, Dave Cowens, Mikan.  Whom are you replacing with a 3-time All-NBA player and 5-time All-Star, exactly?"
30% is laughed at. It’s Russell Westbrook level and it’s definitely not respected. The spacing on this team would really be a massive concern.
"We’re overrating mere attempts at shots players are bad at. John Wall and Russell Westbrook are high volume, horrible mid range shooters. They have had great careers. Going by what you’re saying, would they somehow be lesser players if they took out their mid range game?  There are about a dozen active players that are or have been all-stars as ball dominate non-shooters, most of which are the defender or passer that Ben is. Ben is just generally offensively unaggressive; he doesn’t need a jumpshot, he needs to be more aggressive.   Stop listening to sports media attempts to farm clicks and watch games. Ben Simmons can be (*and already was*) an All-NBA/Star player on only dunks and layups and horrible free throw shooting."

"I’m not sure but 2 years ago if you told me that James Harden would ask out of Houston in 1 year or 3 years ago that Russell Westbrook would ask out of OKC in 1 year, I would have called bullshit on both accounts."

"&gt;	Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook. I personally don’t think one of these players doesn’t belong on that list but oh well  Who? (I have a could idea)  Why?  Who you putting in instead?"
How did Russell Westbrook make that list over Tony Parker and Dwight Howard? What did he ever accomplish? At least AD has a ring.
"The one exception to the rule. But again, Russell Westbrook made triple double common place. Like literally the entire NBA started getting more triple doubles after Westbrook."

wow so together they make up one russell westbrook

Russell he makes a difference not necessarily good Westbrook!
"Honestly does a Russell Westbrook and two picks for Ben Simmons trade make sense for both teams?   Lakers can run Simmons/Ellington/Bazemore/Lebron/AD, that has good shooting and defense. Simmons fits better than Russ and the Lakers are set up for a post-Lebron world with a Simmons/AD duo (25 and 28 respectively)  Sixers get a point guard who will actually shoot. He has star power, which Morey is looking for. Russ/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid sounds pretty good to me.   I still think CJ fits better but if Portland isn't interested, this may be a good deal for both sides"
"Lol, and you did? Lmao, you're probably a 17 year old trying to act like you were around that time. I bet you also claim The Last dance documentary was a ""propaganda piece"" And then you yourself want to use a documentary released in 2020 as your evidence lmao.   &gt; Even said him and his dad were the only ones who knew he would retire because he was physically and mentally exhausted.  Except he said he said he lacked motivation because he accomplished everything he wanted. Lacking motivation ≠ being exhausted.    &gt;Well that’s not how it works. He played 15 seasons and is 5th all time. You can’t eliminate 2 seasons but let him keep the points lmao  If you actually watched basketball then you would have known he broke his foot in the 2nd season which took him out for most of the regular season until the playoffs. Points he could have made if he wasn't injured. Also, when he came back from retirement he also missed majority of the season before the playoffs started.  &gt;This literally didn’t refute anything I said and doesn’t even make sense in the context of this argument. If you shoot more, you will score more. It’s not hard. I guess basic logic isn’t your strong suit.  Or you're just too dumb to realize that someone attempting more shots doesn't guarantee more points. Lebron has shot how many times in his career and still can't make his free throws. Russell Westbrook used to be decent and now shows brick after brick. You probably don't realize how insane over 50% career shots made is."
"He needs to try shooting if he wants to handle the ball. That's the fundamental problem. Even if he isn't a great shooter he still has to shoot some. People would accept the Russell Westbrook path, but not shooting at all breaks the offense when you get to the playoffs."
I mean obviously Russell Westbrook is still a great player lol by success for his expectations and caliber tho thats star level  Also idk if there’s basically anyone paid over 100 mil aside from Rudy Gobert that doesn’t have some shot creating ability including centers
Is Russell Westbrook allergic to being in a defensive stance? Half his time on defense is spent like rebooting into reality but it’s too late because he wasn’t even set in the first place.
"Mark Jackson (paraphrasing): ""Westbrook had a wide open layup, but he gave it to Davis who got the dunk. Little plays like that show you the type of player Russell Westbrook is""  Yeah, a stat hunter who just wanted the assist so he's closer to getting a triple double later.  Mark Jackson is so fucking stupid."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
I'd rather have Wiggins than:  John Wall  Russell Westbrook  Tobias Harris  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday  Kristaps Porzingis  D'Angelo Russell  Gordon Hayward  List goes on
Middleton is a better second option than most other team's second options but name recognition has put other players like Paul George or Russell Westbrook ahead of him. Also Jrue Holiday is a better point guard than Westbrook
Russell Westbrook. How is he supposed to be praised by media and lose in the first round with an otherwise below average NBA team when he's got LeBron and AD with him? smh
"The jazz aren't even that hostile of a fanbase.  I'm referring to Zion's lack of concern over turning his body into a beast in the NBA.  Look at What Ayton did with his first few years in the NBA.  Giannis.  Rudy Gobert had a massive transformation.  And then Zion comes in 16 lbs heavier than last year.  His knees are going to get ruined.  I'm using some imagery, for sure, but it's still a fair and true criticism being shared by national pundits.    Just in case this is referring to the Russell Westbrook racist smear campaign against the jazz - what he says is not representative of me or the majority of us.  It is representative of *the one guy* he called out."
"I want to say Westbrook for Myles, but if LeBron is going to be hurt Russell is doing exactly what he is there to do—i.e. float around .500, beat the bad teams and lost of of the games to good teams.   When LeBron plays, they have to find a way to endure his horrible playing style."
MVP has no definition and means whatever you want it to mean. This is why some years LeBron wins and some years Russell Westbrook wins.   Your second and third paragraphs are almost literally word for word what I have in my post.
"The Lakers right now are exactly what they looked like to many people in the offseason.  Old, relying heavily on a pair of stars who won't play a full season, and dealing with the engima that is Russell Westbrook.  They're still a threat in the postseason if Lebron/AD are 100%, but as far as the regular season goes, I don't think it's going to be that pretty for them.  The Nets look fine - they just won 5 in a row before their most recent loss.  The reality on the Nets though is that without Kyrie they are a much more level team with the rest of the playoff teams in the East."

"The Nets don’t have Russell Westbrook, so them."
by then y’all gonna get prime russell westbrook before he starts shitting the bed

"Russell Westbrook has made the same pledge as Randle. The Earl Monroe New Renaissance Basketball school is somehow on pace to owe $25,000 at the end of the year."
"I would have agreed with you before, but man, Russ has really driven down the value of a triple double.  To me, a Russell Westbrook triple double is just one dude trying too hard to force things.    If he's gonna lead the league in turnovers, or doesn't trust his bigs to get rebounds, or insist on shooting inefficient shots, what does it even mater if he gets the triple double?  If he wins 80% of his triple double games, but still only achieves the 6 seed and gets bounced in the first round, then no, I do not think that his triple doubles help a team win."
"Jesus, the whole Santa Clause BS needs to be retired. It's time to update the event that generalizes the whole Philly fanbase. Pick from below:  1. Not going to games at Shibe Park because they didn't like how ""the area was changing.""  2.Destroying Shibe Park.  3. The insane amount of racism Dick Allen experienced from Philly fans while playing for the Phillies.   4.Annoying the hell out of Mike Schmidt who called them "" an uncontrollable mob scene.""  5. Booing Michael Irvin while he was on the ground almost paralyzed.   6. Throwing batteries at JD Drew  7. Throwing up on a cop and her daughter.   8. Fans coming to the defense of Mikey Miss (radio host) who mocked Victor Cruz's career ending injury.  9. The Flyers fan who had ""the black guy"" on the back of his jersey instead of Simmonds.   9. Fans rooting and defending a dude who raped and murdered dogs.  10. Rooting for racist-ass Riley Cooper, yelling ""Cooooooooop!!!"" after every touchdown he scored (which wasn't that many).  11. Screaming for Desean Jackson to get out of town when he was ""supposedly in a gang."" (he was not).  12. Defending the same player when he came out as a fascist. (which he most definitely is).  13. Throwing shit during Ed Snider's Memorial night.   14. Sending death threats to Jake Diekman, Trent Thornton, and Jadevon Clowney.  15. Giving the middle finger and yelling ""fuck you, fuck"" to Isaiah Thomas in hopes of getting a free frosty.   16. Eagles fans yelling racist shit to Mike Scott.  17. Eagles fans punching horses.  18. Eagles fans burning down their city after the Super Bowl.  19. An Eagles fan microwaved his girlfriend's dog after losing to the Saints.   20. Throwing shit on Russell Westbrook.  21. Eagles fan murdering a Giants fan just a few months ago outside of Pat's steaks, arguing over which team was worse.  22. Getting in countless fights with the opposing team.  23. Getting in countless fights with each other.  24. And just yesterday throwing shit at the friendliest guy in bball--Kemba Walker.   25. Oh yeah, they also had a freaking jail at the bottom of Veterans Stadium.   Does that answer your question?  PS: All mostly off the top of my head. I could go on but I feel 25 is the perfect number to end at."
"If LeBron is the one who made the call, I’d genuinely question his actual basketball knowledge. You’ve been playing at the highest level for 19 years and you don’t realize Russell Westbrook isn’t gonna work? ESPECIALLY when your whole game plan to stopping Houston in your Finals run was based around him and the holes in his game? I just don’t get it"
Current Russell Westbrook
Maria isn't that bad outside of Lebron behind Russell and Westbrook over Robinson. But that Woods list is actually a joke lol. Did he just pick random names out of a hat or what? Steve Kerr at 50 is wild lol.
"Russell ""Serena"" Westbrook"
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-win-percentage-career  Not bad considering the inability to control oneself at all. One can only imagine how good Russ could’ve been.
“Hey we won a championship two years ago with a very obvious formula that may have even worked for a repeat title if we were healthy. What should we do?”  “Blow up 80% of the roster for Russell Westbrook.”  Makes sense…
"Prefectly said.   I remember thinking, is there anyone LeBron can't make better? Like the guy could take three white guys from Ohama and at least make the conference finals. Well, we now know the limits of LeBron's talents.....     Russell Westbrook. lol."
This is the norm for Russell Westbrook over the last 4-5 years. While this is the worst stretch Dame could ever imagine to play.
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

Russell Westbrook
"He's not even Top 10 yet... but I'll humor your argument, even though your argument contains mostly shitty non-basketball related arguments. ""small college hero"", ""off the court class act"" lmao wtf does that have to do with the GOAT conversation?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Steph’s Accolade’s over 12 years:      3x champion 2nd all time 3-pointers 2x MVP (unanimous) 7x all star 7x all NBA All rookie first team 6-time all NBA 3-point field goal leader      Regular season career stats:      34.3 career mins per game 24.2 ppg 4.6 reb 5.9 ast 47.6 fg%  Some of the GOATS worth discussion (Lebron, MJ) both have 4 or more rings, in which they won Finals MVPs for all of them, have averaged 27 and 30 points in their careers, and are #3 and #5 in all time points respectively. Lebron and MJ both have 17 all star appearances, both were ROY, and both on all-defensive teams. In short, both players have more accolades and success with better career ppg, rpg, apg (not mj), spg, bpg, and fg%. What does steph have again...?  Right now he's ranked #71/#67 all time in points behind Bob McAdoo, is behind Ray Allen in 3 pointers, is tied with Giannis and Steve Nash with 2 mvps, is tied with the likes of Javale Mcgee, Patrick McCaw, and James Jones with 3 rings, has less all star appearances than Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, and Carmelo Anthony, less all NBA appearances than Moses Malone, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Garnett, and less ROYs than Ben Simmons and Michael Carter Williams. In regards to defensive teams and finals mvps, he has the same as you and I do, 0.  Forget Lebron, Kobe, MJ, Kareem, Wilt, Bird, Bill Russell, Shaq, Magic, and Duncan, curry is only discussed with and might be below Kareem, Big O, Jerry West, and even KD.  If you want to go off the fact that he is only 33, then I can literally point to Giannis only being 26 and Luka being 22 as better contenders for the GOAT case in the future.  Let's just say that if his game ages gracefully and he plays another 5 years with the best case scenario (another MVP, 2 Finals MVP+rings, 5x all star appearances, 30 ppg average), then he STILL doesn't beat any GOAT candidate. If you add 30 ppg for the rest of his 5 year career, he still only has 31000 points, which makes him 8th all time. If you add 5 more all star appearances he would still only would have 12. If you add another MVP he still only has 3, and if you add 2 more rings and finals mvps he would still only have 2 finals mvps and 5 rings, same as Kobe, who realistically also isn't even in the GOAT conversation.  Just to contextualize, Curry would have to have at least 2 more mvps, at least 2-3 more rings all with finals mvp, at least 5-6 defensive all nba first or second team selections, at least 6 more first team all nba selections, and at least 7 more all star selections to even have similar accolades to **compare** with GOAT tier players.   To have similar **career** stats, steph would have to literally average 43.7 points per game while playing every single game for the next 5 seasons, average 9.8 rebounds, and lord knows how many blocks/steals just to have a similar stat to the lowest of either GOAT player (27 ppg, 6.4 rpg).  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: fuck no"

Bonus points if you happen to be named russell westbrook
Russell Westbrook should lead the bench. He's not a starting caliber point guard.
I call this one the Russell Westbrook effect
I despise having Russell Westbrook on this team.
russell westbrook a minus 20
"Russell Westbrook is doing his best to lose us this game holy shit can we fucking bench, trade or cut this trash can player god damn."
i guess the lakers have NO CHOICE but to turn to russell westbrook in their time of great need
"Nah. I haven't seen anyone in the Nuggets sub say Jokic is OK. The only thing that's being said is that Morris started it with a cheap shot of his own.      I despise Russell Westbrook and James Harden as players. I mean, really don't like how they play the game and wouldn't stand up for either, but if this were the same exact situation on them, I'd say the same thing. They overreacted to a cheap shot, but it was a cheap shot that started it.      Suspension warranted, but there is no reason to hate either of them if they reacted like this. None at all."
Russell Westbrook
"He’s just not a guy who will get you far. He’s like Russell Westbrook obviously not as good. But he’ll get you the rebounds. But he won’t come up when it matters. He’s slow, Not an efficient scorer. Bad FT shooter. Can be lazy on defense. But he’ll grab the boards because no ones competing with a 6’11 monster. I think he’s a good guy to have off the bench"
"I think Poole has shown that GLeague does have legitimate stars. He was absolutely balling out and leading the GLeague in scoring and seems to have kept that up on GSW (granted that they have a great system for giving scorers openings).   I'm also a fan of Jeremy Lin, though I'm not dumb enough to say that age and his injury-proneness isn't a huge factor, but the guy was one of the top scorers in the GLeague and was putting up solid statlines across the board (including less turnovers -- even less than mannion or poole). If anything else it was strange that no teams were willing to just have him as a deep bench rotation player.   Would anybody really say Russell Westbrook would be more efficient than Jeremy Lin off the bench right now? Especially if JLin could've been picked up for a minimum contract?"
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
I hear people say Russell Westbrook. Definitely don’t love his play right now as a Lakers fan.
"Everyone knows the All Star votes were meant to troll. So I'll be voting for him daily, just for the lulz. Along with James Wiseman, Udonis Haslem, Russell Westbrook, Tim Hardaway (Sr), LiAngelo Ball, Hasheem Thabeet, Anthony Bennett, Ben Simmons and DeMarcus Cousins."
"I mean...that's usually how this works. Usually the II is called Jr and all subsequent ones are III, IV, and so on. For example Russell Westbrook the NBA player is Russell Westbrook III, because his dad was Russell Westbrook Jr.   Gary Payton fucked up because he named 2 different kids II and Jr....typically they'd be the same person."
Oh no....Poor trailblazers....Sigh...... alrigght we'll take him...    Here's Russell Westbrook+THT+whoever the fuck you need except Lebron and AD
"Lakers are relevant regardless of how good they are. Heck some of y’all could analyze the Lakers might be my second favorite team but it’s really not. It’s because a lot of my friends are Lakers fans. I remember my friend ranting about Ryan Kelly being the next KD, Jordan Clarkson being a 2nd round steal that looked like their very own Russell Westbrook. In fact, I’m familiar with names like DJ Mbenga and Theo Ratcliffe coz they’re the scrubs that help Kobe win the championship."
The big #whynot #0 Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook is a floor raiser and a ceiling depleter. Has the ability to carry bums to the playoffs but when given significant help, underperforms in the playoffs."
"&gt; There's a team thats lost to the thunder....twice  Maybe its because outside of LeBron, that team can't play stable basketball. It has always been like that for LeBron teams since the dawn of time.   I'll say it again, the Russell Westbrook trade made the Lakers worse yet it heightened the expectations of the team because in the eyes of the casual ""HuRr DuRR 3 aLLStArS the LaKeRs ARE a sUpERtEaM""  The Lakers would've been better off if they traded Kuz and Harrell for Buddy. That way they get to keep KCP and Caruso who is familiar with Lakerball rather than paying one man $44MIL to shoot 7% from the field."
"Russ is a showman, he's never going to change his baravado on the court.  I would like to add that everything we know about Russell Westbrook as a person leads me to believe he's a mature and good dude.  Celebrations are a part of sports."
"Russell Westbrook  I respect the tenacity he plays with, but holy shit I do not want to sit through an entire season of him pulling up for mid-range Js that he can't fucking make with any consistency"
"Lowry only has 19 triple doubles, Russell Westbrook has almost 10 times that much.  Obvious Westbrook is the better player, triple doubles &gt; TOs, efficiency, and high IQ playmaking or so a Westbrook fan told me."
"He's not, but his gravity *is* so big that it more than offsets a bad shooting night to be ""above average."" (Prime) Russell Westbrook for example was commonly accredited with something similar, even when his own shooting numbers were bad, he still had an above average impact on the offense. Defenses will always respect superstars whether they're hot or not."
Ben Simmons not playing &gt; Russell Westbrook playing.   And it’s not close.
Empty stats kind of guy. He’s the Russell Westbrook of bigs
"3-4 team trade and Russell Westbrook starts his long, sad, decline into a journeyman. Who says no?"
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook is about that one NBA Christmas commercial all by himself with all those bricks.
Russell Westbrook hates these daters. Lol
"&gt; how is it totally fine to ignore KD having poor shooting nights when that's literally his #1 goal on the team  How is it fine to ignore westbrook's dumb IQ and boneheaded plays and shooting more than the number 1 option when he's the PG? you are playing dumb if you don't think a huge reason for KD having bad shooting nights was because defenses could easily ignore everyone else on offense and collapse on him. Think about it. His second best shooter was Ibaka. you're wrong also regarding ""kd wasn't doing anything else to make up"" because he would still be guarded by the other team's best defender and provide spacing for the rest of the team, just like steph curry. Who was the best player on the mavs other than an old dirk? chandler parsons? deron williams? raymond felton? like i'm sorry dude but no they just weren't a dangerous threat in any way.  And no dude the only person talking out of his ass is you. Since you like advanced stats so much show us the stats for 2011, 2012, and 2014 too? westbrook is the biggest statpadder of all time so who would be surprised if he has good stats? That doesn't mean he contributed to winning basketball. That's why I brought up points by other people in the NBA community, analysts, fans, Magic Johnson, etc because all you're looking at are stats, but they don't tell the whole story.   Kyrie can't playmake for shit, but he is still 10x better shooter than Westbrook at 3s, midrange, and also a better finisher. That's why Kd and Kyrie were smashing the bucks before kyrie went down, because he makes your offense extremely potent. And I'm sorry but there's no way westbrook is doing what Kyrie did in those 2016 finals. I'm a warriors fan so I know firsthand. and speaking of the warriors, check this out: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-warriors-reportedly-think-russell-westbrook-plays-a-style-thats-easy-to-guard/  Do you think people ever said that about kd or dame or kyrie? hell no.  Dame's shooting splits are terrible because he didn't know how to deal with double teams. But if he had KD, you really think he wouldn't get less double teams and less defensive attention, and have better performances? You really think KD himself wouldn't be seeing less doubles and clogged lanes if he had a dude who is a threat from halfcourt instead of a dude you can sag off 10 feet?"
and Russell Westbrook always has. Russ continues to be the worse player. Scoring isn’t everything.
Russell Westbrook
"I'm attacking an argument that KD ""dragged"" WB. Yep I absolutely disagree if they had Kyrie. Who would do the playmaking? WB has never been a great shooter but he makes up for it by playmaking and improving his teammates on the court. When KD wasn't shooting well he wasn't doing anything to make up for it. Mavs never had a chance but if WB played as bad as KD they probably would have...how is it totally fine to ignore KD having poor shooting nights when that's literally his #1 goal on the team. Yes I absolutely disagree if they had Kyrie or Dame they would get further - Kyrie can't play make for shit and have you seen Dames shooting splits in the playoffs? CP3 is an all time great and definitely a more composed player than WB and a better fit next to KD especially down the stretch where KD would often get flustered and not know how to handle double teams and turn it over, just like WB.   Let's talk about the playoffs and sure let's ignore the Mavs series even though KD averaged 26/6/3 on 37/27/85 while Russ averaged 26/7/11 on 46/38/75.   Playoffs:  WB - VORP 1.9 (#2), BPM 9.1 (#4), WS/48 (#11) .208, WS  2.9 (#4) TS .515, PER 26.9 (#4)  KD - VORP 1.1 (#8), BPM 4.0 (#18), WS/48 .103 (#32), WS 2.0 (#12). TS .542, PER 20.3 (#16)  This is all without mentioning how KD was averaging like 3 ast a game with more TOs than AST. So who was he dragging again? KD is a better player than Russell Westbrook.

"I still can’t believe Russell Westbrook made it on the top 75 all-time list. Shit don’t make sense. Averaging a triple-double and won a MVP, great accomplishments BUT he’s fucking unwatchable. Poor shot selection his whole career, doesn’t actually make his teams better, he’s TRASH"
I said that is who they wish they could get. They are not getting much of value back for Russell Westbrook at this point

"I’ve been a Lakers fan for all of my basketball watching life and I have NEVER seen a move this bad. It doesn’t take any hindsight though, it’s just a shit fucking move. I wouldn’t want PRIME Russ next to LeBron because the awful fit means you’ll only ever get the best of the two in transition and you’re not running in transition during the playoffs, which is what the Lakers are competing for. If he doesn’t make us better in the postseason then why the fuck is he here? “For the regular season” they said. To win us the games where AD or LeBron don’t play. And yet without LeBron we’ve lost TWICE to the worst team in the league, and we go up against one good team that’s not even close to being an actual contender and get absolutely ducking dogged. And who would’ve guessed it, Russ played like shit. These games without LeBron are the best versions of Russell Westbrook we should be seeing as he’s free to be him, and yet he loses as many games for us as he wins. You attempted 13 shots, and made 1 of them? If we don’t trade Russ this move is going to be the end of LeBron’s competitive years. You traded to pay $40 million for 2 years to get a guy who has zero basketball IQ, can’t shoot, plays terrible defense despite having generational athleticism, can put up more turnovers than made shots….and whom you just DECIMATED in the playoffs a year ago. I’ll never understand."
i mean there's a few Russell Westbrook trades that fit the description. lol
"If someone in the off-season had said ""let me put together a lineup made up exclusively of players on vet minimum contracts and Russell Westbrook"" how good would anyone have expected that team to be? Because other than the 7 minutes AD played tonight, that's exactly what the lineup was.   The Lakers have five players who are making more than the minimum this year, and four of them combined to play 7 minutes tonight. The other one was Russell Westbrook. Everyone else is hurt or had a stomach flu. The Lakers are absolutely decimated by injuries right now, but for whatever reason nobody seems to be aware of it or willing to acknowledge it.   Tonight both of the Lakers two-way players played. They also played their undrafted rookie, Austin Reaves (who only has $100k of his salary guaranteed) 25 minutes tonight. They started a guy on a non-guaranteed minimum contract (Avery Bradley), a guy they claimed off waivers the day before the season started, and he played 23 minutes. Their starting center was salary dumped and bought out this summer, as was their backup point guard (Jordan and Rondo).  They combined to play 33 minutes tonight. Everyone else who played was signed for the vet minimum this summer.   This is not even close to what the Lakers rotation will look like when they are fully healthy, but right now they are missing LeBron, AD, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Ariza will probably only play about 15-20 mpg, but the other guys will probably play 25-40 mpg, and they were all out tonight. If people want to know what is going on with the Lakers, it's quite simple: it's injuries and illness."
"Aight man let's do this then. Where's your source that the reason for WB being higher on the MVP list is due to triple doubles? Let's talk about the playoffs and sure let's ignore the Mavs series even though KD averaged 26/6/3 on 37/27/85 while Russ averaged 26/7/11 on 46/38/75.   Playoffs:  WB - VORP 1.9 (#2), BPM 9.1 (#4), WS/48 (#11) .208, WS  2.9 (#4) TS .515, PER 26.9 (#4)  KD - VORP 1.1 (#8), BPM 4.0 (#18), WS/48 .103 (#32), WS 2.0 (#12). TS .542, PER 20.3 (#16)  This is all without mentioning how KD was averaging like 3 ast a game with more TOs than AST. So who was he dragging again? KD is a better player than Russell Westbrook. No one is arguing that but you are misrepresenting the past and talking out of your ass."
Westbrook in a nutshell:  9:42		Russell Westbrook **misses** 21-foot pullup jump shot	65 - 93	  9:38		Austin Reaves offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:27		Larry Nance Jr. blocks Russell Westbrook 's 2-foot driving layup	65 - 93	  9:25		Russell Westbrook offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:24		Russell Westbrook **misses** two point shot	65 - 93	  9:24		Russell Westbrook offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:21		Russell Westbrook **lost ball** turnover (Robert Covington steals)	65 - 93
PEAK WESTBROOK:  9:42		Russell Westbrook **misses** 21-foot pullup jump shot	65 - 93	  9:38		Austin Reaves offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:27		Larry Nance Jr. blocks Russell Westbrook 's 2-foot driving layup	65 - 93	  9:25		Russell Westbrook offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:24		Russell Westbrook **misses** two point shot	65 - 93	  9:24		Russell Westbrook offensive rebound	65 - 93	  9:21		Russell Westbrook **lost ball** turnover (Robert Covington steals)	65 - 93
This looks fair for Russell Westbrook and I'm sure the Lakers would be interested
"Seeing that salary just reminded me what a wizard Sam Presti is. Gave Russ a huge contract as the face of the franchise, once his decline started, traded him, rehabbed Chris Paul, then traded him too.  So, in all, in exchange for Russell Westbrook, the Thunder ultimately have ended up with: Poku, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Ty Jerome, and FOUR MORE FIRST ROUNDERS (Suns 2022 pick, and Rockets 2024 &amp; 2026 picks and 2025 swap). All for Russ to turn into an albatross contract nobody wants."
"KCP, Kyle Kuzma, Montrezz Harrell, and pick #22 in the 2021 NBA Draft traded to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Russell Westbrook and two future second round picks."
Russell Westbrook is an embarrassment.
"**Russell Westbrook: 8 PTS, 9 REB, 6 AST, 6 TO, 1/13 FG, 5/8 FT**  **Los Angeles Lakers: 34% FG, 28% 3PT**  We can never win with those numbers. Westbrook, in particular, has to do better in these kind of games where AD and LeBron are absent. Tonight was completely disgusting.  The game was worse than the score line suggests. We got blown out."
Imaging giving up assets for Russell Westbrook lmao
[Laker's fan reaction to the Russell Westbrook experience](https://streamable.com/jq2psb)
"Russell ""Triple Single"" Westbrook."
"Russell Westbrook has gone 1/13 from the field, he is ice cold tonight."
"Can we stop this narrative that Russell Westbrook plays hard all the time? Just because he wears a mug face 100%, dunks to the rim and screams everytime doesn't mean he plays hard.  He only plays hard when he has the ball in his hands. He has terrible effort on defense, doesn't move offball and even if he plays hard, he goes 2nd gear, passes it to the ghost of Kyle Singler from the 2nd row.  Its Curry who plays hard all the time. Last year, the team was down terrible and showed up on all the games he had to. Yeah his frame is bad defensively but he's good at navigating screens, good at rebounding (without Steven Adams boxing out for him), better at gambling for steals."
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  2ND GEAR-PASS TO THE 2ND ROW
"Russell Westbrook, 12:51, 0-4 0-1 0-2, 0 points. Embarrassing."
Exactly! and one thing I've noticed is that everything has to be a ranking. People can't just say that Russell Westbrook is good. They say he's good but not as good as Steph.   People forget that multiple players can be good at the same time
"Russell Westbrook: 0-4 FG, 0 PTS"
Now imagine Russell Westbrook said this
"/r/nba when Dame Lillard plays like shit: ""oh dear oh dear gorgeous""   /r/nba when Russell Westbrook plays like shit: ""you fucking donkey"""
"The Wizards won an additional 9 games in the 2021 season compared to 2020. That year they started IT for 37 games, a guy who quite frankly is not an nba player at this stage of his career. The others were a combination of Ish Smith and Isaac Bonga if i recall correctly, the only legitimately good player here is Ish Smith but even he is more of a back up PG  The Wizards upgraded from the likes of Isaiah Thomas to Russell Westbrook and only won an additional 9 regular season games. I don’t get why this is lauded as all that big of an accomplishment"
"Yes absolutely. So much of basketball for the most talented players comes down to decision making and understanding when the game requires you take over in different ways.  Lebron James mastered that in Miami, but his athletic prime was 100% In First Cleveland stint. Dirk was at his best after he lost some speed. OKC PG was his best, despite Indiana PG being the most athletic.   I think mainly for the most dominant of athletes (besides Lebron) and sometimes defensive focused players do the athletic and actual prime match up. Vince Carter and Russell Westbrook are great examples."
In order by appearance:  - Curry - Bird - Westbrook - Chuck - Dr. J - Pistol Pete - Nash - KD - Cunningham - Reggie - Duncan - Moses Malone - Sam Jones - Cousy - Lucas - Harden - Frazier - Ewing - Kawhi - Mikan - Rodman - KG - West - Kobe - Hayes - Pierce - Clyde - Rick Barry - Greer - McAdoo - Sharman - Monroe - Schayes - Ray Allen - Lebron - Russell - DRob - Melo - Elgin - Pettit - Nique - Wilkens - Sharman - Bing - Reed - Worthy - Wilt - McHale - Thurmond - Stockton - Gervin - DeBusschere - Dirk - Oscar - Kidd - Magic - GP - Wade - Archibald - Giannis - CP3 - Isiah Thomas - Dame - AI - Shaq - Karl Malone - Parish - Pippen - AD - Havlicek - Cowens - Akeem - Unseld - MJ - KAJ - Walton
Counterpoint: Russell ~~Westbrick~~ Westbrook.
Dame wishes he was playing like Russell Westbrook right now. Dame is in a whole other stratosphere of suck
"Damian ""Russell Westbrook"" Lillard"
I call it The Russell Westbrook effect. Always said Russ is a floor demininisher. Even the Rockets where better without him before deciding to tank. Last year Lakers without LBJ and AD where better in any indicator.  Moreover Russ is a ceiling cap to any teams.  Bench him ASAP!
"Next will be the Hornets!  It's not crazy, it is the standard when you play a dumbass guy that didn't understand how the game should be played and is trash on Defense.  Oh I'm not talking about Russell Westbrook."
"Anyways so when Russell Westbrook woks finals MVP this year, what are you nerds going to say?"
They also locked that Russell Westbrook vs Jordan Poole post
"Assuming the starters are: Jokic / Davis / LeBron / Luka / Steph, then you have back up guards (2) back up forwards (3) and 2 wildcards. So in theory KP has 5 spots to compete for.   Booker, Westbrook, Paul, Paul George, SGA, KAT, Gobert, Mitchell, Lillard, Green are all going to be competing for those 7 reserve spots. I feel Booker, Gobert, Mitchell, Paul George and Lillard are locks, which would be the 3 forward spots and 2 guard spots. KP would have to beat out 4 of Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, SGA, KAT and Draymond Green. Not impossible, but coaches always tend to vote longevity so I'd bet on CP3 and Draymond getting the coaches nods."
"I love how there’s a “Russell Westbrook tonight:” thread no matter how bad or average or good he plays. Actually, no I don’t. I hate it."
"Lebron, Lakers, Russell Westbrook. The holy trinity of hate for nba fans. Anything that can be twisted around to make them look worse is easy karma around here right now. Gotta kick em while their down. Don’t worry if they somehow start clicking and look good again the pendulum will swing."
If Russell westbrook is shooting over 50% from 3 in the game and they still losing idk what the Lakers are doing. There's only so many games they can't care about
Russell westbrook shot 50% from 3 on more than 5 attempts and they still lost   Lakers are fucking hopeless
30pt Triple Double And A Loss: The Russell Westbrook Story
Carmelo Anthony form tonight can be credited to Russell Westbrook working with him on his shooting mechanics.
"**Los Angeles Lakers: 37% FG, 30% 3PT, 21/30 (70%) FT**  This is a such a disappointing loss.  On one hand you appreciate the effort LAL showed to erase the 25 point deficit. On the other hand, it was a very winnable game once we came back. And we probably won’t win with those numbers above.  Props to Russell Westbrook. He showed up, especially in the second half.  Anthony Davis doesn’t have that dog in him. Yes, I know he was sick. Always something with him…"
I can't watch anymore games that end with Russell Westbrook having to hit a clutch 3  never ever works ever
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook pull up midrange has to be the worst shot in basketball
lmao no fucking way. They have Russell Westbrook at point guard.
"I can’t stand Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Carmelo Anthony and I hope none of them ever wins a ring."
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
"I refuse to acknowledge anything good the Warriors do and will continue spreading Curry, Klay and Draymond slander until the day I die.   “It’s beautiful basketball” don’t care, didn’t watch, Nets better and I hope they fail.  I have love for every former Rocket except Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony. They didn’t do anything particularly wrong other than be old I just associate them with the downfall of our championship window. It’s not even a Lakers thing, I love Dwight."
"At some point Russell Westbrook is going to get sick of racist Jazz fans and ruin one, hopefully.  They really hate him and say the foulest shit to him. I used to be friends with a wealthy Mormon family in SLC and one of the things that woke me up to their racist behavior is how they’d always say out of pocket shit about Westbrook, unprompted, when any NBA discussion came up."
I hope that the only award Ben Simmons ever wins is the “Rookie” of the year that he won. Also I hope that Russell Westbrook and James Harden never see a championship
"&gt; Can someone draw the picture for the hypothetical plays where WB just randomly zigzags through defense forcing switches,  [here you go](https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/russell-westbrook-fighting-irish.jpg)"
*Liked by Russell Westbrook*
Russell Westbrook is the most overrated player in the last couple decades and will never win anything. (I'm a Laker fan)
"Ya absolutely on your last part. Going to GS and complaining about your old championship contending team is an incomperably weak move. No regular business move can be compared to KD's decision.  Beyond that, you are just severely underinformed about LeBron's first Cavs stint. It was a disaster. Those teams made it deep for one reason, and he wore #23. If LeBron had a Russell Westbrook caliber teammate, he probably would have never left Cleveland the first time, and he'd have won at least one ring.  KD has not been on a bad team since his 2nd year in the league. They've been a contending team since his 3rd season. You're comparing that to LeBron's teams, like there's just no way man"
Russell Westbrook
Actually now that I've seen Russell Westbrook on his 4th team in 4 years I get it more. RW is just not a 1a guy and at the Thunder he was treated as such.
"I NEED it to be Russell Westbrook, too."
"I don't get what you're refuting here. They played with those guards. They still carried and led the team. Guards are ball-dominant by nature. Every team needs a guard to bring the ball up and pass the ball and facilitate the offense. I listed examples of players who were not ball dominant but still carried their teams.  In fact the fact that there are other ball dominant guards on those teams who might be all star caliber players but STILL weren't the team leaders or offensive team leaders is the very essence of my rebuttal.  Maybe I'm not conveying this properly, and maybe it's my poor semantics. My point is this:  - Karl Malone played next to John Stockton. Karl Malone ""led the team"". He won the MVPs, not John Stockton.  - Giannis played next to Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, whatever. He won the MVPs and FMVPs, not Jrue or Khris. He ""led the team"".  - Shaq played next to Kobe, one of the most ball-dominant guards of all time (albeit in in the triangle). Shaq won the FMVPs, not Kobe. Shaq ""led the team"".  - KD played with Russell Westbrook, another ball-dominant guard. KD led the team.  The excuse that AD isn't in a position to ""lead a team"" solely due to his role in the offense in that he doesn't bring the ball up the court, handle the ball, playmake for others, is bullshit. Because of those examples.  You said here ""Luka, Trae Young, Dame"" are in the position to do so, and so they unfairly get more credit. This makes no sense. Because of those examples. AD should be good enough and has played alongside enough talent to be able to lead a team and carry a team to playoff contention."

Yeah really strong tools but I see really obvious flaws that can prevent him from winning anything. Sure he still young so he can grow out of ‘em but I’m just projecting off what I see  Mainly it’s the Diva stuff + Usage rate   He himself said he models himself after Lebron James (do it all wing) but that play-style only wins with a unprecedented talent (Lebron James) does it. Everyone else who has tried the Hero Ball/Drive and Kick style gets all the accolades and glory but never wins anything (Russell Westbrook/James Harden two biggest examples besides Bron)
Substitute Reggie for Russell westbrook and that's the entire subreddit.

Is this Russell Westbrook?
"Unbelievable decision by the commissioner, but w/e, Karma came for that man in the form of KD. But she was not yet done with him, Karma has come again in the form of Russell Westbrook."
You’re not quite in the right headspace   Russell Westbrook would be a demon skill position guy. I could also see Kyle Lowry or Chris Paul being a 5-7x pro bowl safety.
"I think one of the difficulties you encounter is that Bron has had such a long career, that even if these came up at a below average rate, you are still left with a high amount of incidents.  You also need to take into account 'dirty' plays that he is on the receiving end of.  In total, I think there is only a handful of genuinely dirty players (ones that come MY mind: Zaza, Pat Bev, Ron Artest, Bruce Bowen). And the ones that get accused: Russell Westbrook, Enes Kanter, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo... I think they get involved in a couple of hairy instances and people make the jump. People were calling Dellavedova dirty back in 2015."

"Russell Westbrook | ORTG - 98  James Harden | ORTG - 110  Yeah, might have something to do with that."
WTH is Russell Westbrook doing? Looks like 7th grade and hiding behind DJ too.
"Russell Westbrook was a 4.0 gpa student back in high school and had a very positive demeanor about him (my school was in the same league as centennial and they mentioned it before in his intros) I never played against him myself but us jv would all watch the varsity games and he was really skinny back then but had sick elevation on his jumper which was streaky but his makes were impressive pull ups fadeaway etc for hs 3s and just springy in general so an electrifying player but at that time I absolutely could not see or imagine that this guy was going to be an NBA MVP one day…anyways I kinda got lost there in the reflection but my initial point was on your claim he was in fights throughout his high school years, what are you basing this off of? Did you know him personally or are you assuming based on where he grew up? Cus southern CA cities can be misleading as far as how rough it is in the different areas some parts of Compton for instance look like straight suburbs"

"yes, i am a lifelong fan even though the current team tests that every single day. and, in fact, i'm more positive about the team than half the people on the lakers subreddit, that are sure we need to fire and trade everyone. obviously the team WILL get better over the course of the season, and make the playoffs. the problem is the team is constructed like dogshit and we gave away our best shooters and defenders for the privilege of paying the worst playoff performer in the history of the league $44m, and we will probably lose in the first round.  russell westbrook could start at point guard on the dream team and they'd lose to the pacers in a playoff series"
witness the power of russell westbrook. thats what an mvp caliber player can do. stay mad lakers haters
There is nothing more dangerous to the Lakers than a Russell Westbrook bucket
"Russell Westbrook is the most polarizing player.   When he's bad he's awful, when he's good he's electrifying."
Russell Westbrook trying to save the Lakers season. He's a competitor you gotta give him that.
"&gt; If someone could surround Russell on a minimum contract with the perfect team and coach, I still don't think he could be a top 4 seat. And Russell doesn't work as an ancillary piece because all of his best qualities depend on volume except for attacking the basket which he isn't even elite at  Agreed 100%. The problem with Westbrook is that he's an extremely ball-dominant player. Big contract or not, he requires the ball on his hands a lot, and he's not efficient enough to deserve it. If you give him lots of minutes, you're shooting yourself in the foot. If you don't give him too many, he doesn't get in his rhythm and you're just wasting him (and he will probably not like it, since in his own mind he's still in MVP form). Like you said, he depends on volume, and as such, it would be hard to make him fit on a team, if you want to win games, at least."
"&gt;	Lakers at this rate might not make the playoffs in a deep west, or will at least have to go through the play in games.  trust me bro, russell westbrook just needs the first 4 months of every season to remember how to play basketball, we’ll be fine"
Three way trade:  Lakers get Jerami Grant and Buddy Hield  Kings get Russell Westbrook and Trey Lyles  Pistons get THT and Marvin Bagley  Who says no? All three teams?
Russell Westbrook at this point in his career is a net negative on the floor how can that be considered a good player? It’s beyond about him being overpaid. I don’t think a team like the Warriors would even take him for free his style of play is just not conducive to winning basketball.
Russell Westbrook on a supermax has been traded three times. Once for John Wall on a supermax. The Wizards even got a bunch of positive assets out of it.  Nobody is ever “locked in” to any contract.
"Indeed so players like Kevin love Timberwolves, Russell westbrook every where he goes.   As of right now Zion is looking like a straight carbohydrate diet the way his calories looking of empty stats"
"If WB gets bought out tomorrow, you seriously think every single decent team won't be fighting to sign him?  \&gt;Let's pretend Russell was on a minimum contract with LA, he would still have to accept significantly less responsibility. Which would then make him a useless player as his stats require him to 1) control the offense on his terms 2) have a significant amount of opportunities to make up for how inefficient he is.  The Westbrook slander is becoming beyond ridiculous...  Such a scenario would make him a lock for the 6MOTY. Currently Lakers roster construction is broken and Vogel is a horrendous offensive coach, but If WB was on minimum and had a reduced role, it would be much easier to put him in lineups with the space he needs to operate. They'd use that extra cap space on a great 3+D wing and keep Caruso, both to play next to WB and he will absolutely dominate any second unit in the NBA. The Lakers will be instant favorites.   Come on....  \&gt;Couple that with him being a horrible shooter, a high risk/high reward defender, and his absolute lack of willingness to play within a coach's offensive scheme; he is only useful in a fast past offense surround by 4 shooters and an elite defensive big at the rim.  What system? Vogel has no offensive system. The closest thing he's ever had as a system was in Houston and he played exactly like D'Antoni wanted him to."
In the words of Russell Westbrook:👨🏻‍🍼
Potato or Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook…Anthony Davis
* Julius Randle * Dame Lillard * Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook. The first time I saw him play I was in OKC, and had pretty solid tickets in the middle of the lower levels. It was maybe 2 minutes into the game, and Westbrook tipped a pass and broke free on a breakaway. Once he reached the three point line, it was like watching raw energy dunk a basketball. My man soared above the rim, tomohawk’d with authority, and landed on the ground while beating his chest. The entire arena exploded with cheers and excited screams, yet we could still hear Westbrook on the court screaming “THIS IS MY SHIT! FUCK OUTTA HERE!” I had never seen anything like him on the basketball court before.  I still get chills to this day."
*russell westbrook eating meme*
everyone in this subreddit has watched Russell Westbrook take 8 steps before dribbling the basketball against GSW
"I honestly thought the plan was. Russell Westbrook would drag the lakers to the playoffs, because he's shown to be able to do that. Then when playoffs happen, lebron and ad will supposedly be more fresh than they normally would because Westbrook would be leading the season with the other players the team has. Hence all the random players we got. Ad and lebron can coast. But that is not the case at all. I dont understand the case."
Did OKC trade back for russell westbrook??
russell westbrook is single handedly stopping the lakers offence. does he count?
Russell Westbrook and a pick.
"Trade Russell Westbrook for kcp, Montrez Harrell and Buddy Hield."
The bum of Russell Westbrook clogs space and doesn’t let lebron thrive
"Good luck trying to tell Russell Westbrook to not go full clip on every play or for him to actually think a few steps ahead. I mean, for the sake of the sanity of Lakers fans I hope he does, but I have my doubts he'll change. He's been the same player for years now."
What could go wrong when you replace 3 of your top 6 defenders with *checks notes* Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony
"I don't think I really had an opinion on it. But Russell Westbrook never seemed like a team-first player or someone who is efficient. He was stat padding hard in OKC after Durant left. I don't know if he wanted to feel important after the departure, but it was kind of sad to watch at times. And I guess he never changed. Still reckless."
Russell Westbrook needs to be bought out…
Russell Westbrook has been below league average in efficiency rating. Dude dominates the ball but isnt a good shooter and has lots of turnovers. his counting stats are still decent but the underlying metrics of how he got there aren't pretty.
"AC is on the same level. It's clear as day that we had some really good pieces that held our defense together even when LeBron and ad were out so often.  I can't believe they let those guys go for Russell Westbrook. We are now stuck with an over the hill one dimensional player who eats up 35 minutes per game turning the ball over or bricking shots. All at a $44/year contract.  I want to know whose idea it was. Lebron's or pelinkas, to trade for Westbrook. That move last year to get Drummond and push Marc gasol aside was terrible. Marc was much better than Drummond and they just benched Marc anyways."

"I absolutely hate this kind of take.  You people sometimes make these presumptions that a player can in no way adapt and play a role that is within their skill set and  fits the team better.  Russell Westbrook can in no way play a spot up shooter or any shooter for that matter, that's not within his skill set, his shot was always bad and no one trusts that he's going to improve it at this age. However Derozan can shoot and players don't lose their ability to shoot once their role changes in a certain lineup. Players don't lose their ability to shoot the ball if they don't dribble it beforehand. The ones that do lose it, lose it because of their ego or laziness. Case in point - Carmelo Anthony.  As the matter of fact I don't understand how can people still have this take after witnessing the past 5 years of Melo's career. Dude never lost the ability to shoot the ball, the only thing that needed adjusting was his own ego.  So no, Buddy Hield is not a better fit than Derozan because they are both human basketball players, not some one dimensional video game characters, and one is just simply better than the other at almost everything."
Because what a young team with young guards need is Russell Westbrook taking up your cap whilst taking 30 shots a game.
"Russell Westbrook has proven to be worst than Schroder.  A lot of people this summer said that Russ just needed to be a better version of Dennis. Reality is, as I said so many times, that Russ is bad right now (and was bad last 3 seasons) by pure basketball skills standards he is way under NBA average pointguard (where I consider DS to be just average).   Last season he ""carried"" a team because the conference started to suck because of injuries of others and teams resting players for the playoffs. Moreover Russ played so many possessions that his numbers couldn't be more pumped... but in reality he was below league average for production per possession, and this is the case from 2018 now.  Russ was a statpadder at best, now people are realising, watching him more, that he is also bad at the whole basketball thing."
"You’re not seriously comparing a team with prime Lebron, Wade and Bosh to a team with 37 year old Lebron, 33 year old Russell Westbrook and AD. As long as they have Russell Westbrook, they’re not winning shit."

"I read this the other day   Spurs Receive: Russell Westbrook.    Lakers Receive: Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Thaddeus Young"
"June 26: The Washington Wizards have traded All-Star Point Guard Russell Westbrook to the Orlando Magic, league sources tell ESPN.   June 27: The Washington Wizards have hired former Brooklyn Nets assistant coach Mike D’Antoni to become their next head coach, league sources tell ESPN."
"Yeah and the last game Russell played horribly. Both KD and Rusell did have bad games, KD tried to salvage that last 4th quarter when Westbrook could not. Lebron and the Cavs kind of played bad the first 4 games hence they were in the 3-1 hole in the first place. But then picked it up and got to game 7 where Kyrie made that shot."
"Derrick Rose. If people are saying Russell Westbrook is a Top 10 PG of all time, then a prime Derrick Rose would surpass him in my opinion.  Also Len Bias, I’ve never seen him play lol"
"I'll start with this:   The 2012 Finals were a lot closer than the 4-1 result indicated, with 3 Miami wins only by single digits(meaning one individual performance could have made a big difference)  Russell Westbrook shot 14 PERCENT from 3 in the series and basically had only one good game(game 4), including shooting 4/20 in the closeout game  If he plays better, do the Thunder perhaps swing some of the close games and win the series?"
KD shot 38% from the field and 26% from 3 over the final 4 games of the 2016 WCF   Russell Westbrook shot 39% and 33% over that same stretch    Yet one gets all the blame...
What's perplexing is that they invented the 10-second rule because Russell Westbrook used to have a routine that the NBA deemed too long...but now they *kinda* look away when Giannis takes all the time in the world. I'm sure the NBA told the refs to not follow this rule too closely with Giannis after calling it a couple of times when the playoffs started..
Steph Curry for Russell Westbrook. Make it happen.
"All the downvotes lol. Clippers fans in their feelings. My comment was partially a joke but I’ll settle with he’s reckless. Ask Russell Westbrook about that, kids."
"the rules are meant to apply to all players. would you think it's fair if only gerrit cole got to use spider tack in mlb? obviously comparing apples to oranges but you can't just not apply the rule to one player.  Russell Westbrook had one of the longer FT routines in the game, he would routinely walk to half court and walk back to the FT line prior to the NBA making it a ten second ""shot clock"" on FTs. When the change went into place, Westbrook's FT shooting fell off a cliff because it broke his routine.  The rule exists to shorten the length of the game, pretty much. When a player has a long routine or takes a lot of time, players get to rest, coaches get to call to their guards, etc.  The easiest solution to this is to add a shot clock for free throws, for some reason there is none. Put the 10 seconds up on the scoreboard and that way everyone knows exactly how you long you can take and it doesn't rely on the refs giving Giannis superstar treatment."
paul george or jimmy butler or russell westbrook
"Honestly if fans overstep their bounds, there’s a part of me that wishes players could set them straight.  Like earlier this playoffs.  Obviously Trae Young and Kyrie Irving are not that guy, but no fan would assault Russell Westbrook if they thought he would be allowed to do something about it."
"Sure, in some cases delays of game may affect the game, maybe I was wrong to say ""most."" But there are definitely plenty of delays of game that can result in a technical foul even without affecting the outcome of the game.  If the opposing team ""interferes with the ball"" after a successful free throw, for example, they may not be affecting the outcome of the game but they are being annoying and slowing things down. Ditto a player doing the old Russell Westbrook walk really far back between free throws. A player not having his jersey tucked in also probably isn't going to affect the outcome of the game. A coach grabbing a ball that went out of bounds and handing it to the ref probably won't affect the outcome of a game, but can still result in a technical.  Point being - it's OK to police the game moving slowly and inefficiently, especially if there is an explicit rule on the books about it.  Plus, if Giannis's free throw percentage changes based on whether he is forced to shoot in under 10 seconds, then refusing to call it *is* affecting the outcome of the game."
"Forfeiting it would immediately give ATL the ball, versus leaving it up to chance on a rebound.  Also, something tells me giannis shooting faster won’t improve his percentage, example: Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook has been getting hate for doing that for a few years now
Oooh. Do tell. A list is necessary. Russell Westbrook AND….
"&gt;You're over rating Russell. That one Brooklyn season was an anomaly. The guy's a fraud.  His last 2 seasons after leaving Brooklyn have been injury plagued, how can you say hes a fraud when hes barely been healthy since leaving? When Dlo has played with a fully healthy team hes played great.  I think he is a good centerpiece for a swap, it can be like the John Wall and Westbrook trade."

"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
I once thought Norman Powell was the next Russell Westbrook and a future all star

Being a teammate of Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook didn't help. I think it's changed since most people thought he was done after going to OKC and now he's leading a team to the finals.
"No, and I don't think Scottie is wrong really, he makes some good points, with the exception of the Harden bit, which was dumb.   &gt; It’s not an individual game, you can’t go into basketball and beat nobody with an individual record. And I used this example of what happened to Kevin Durant just the other day: this is the first time we’ve ever really seen Kevin Durant have to be the man and bring the team home. We ain’t never really had to see that because he’s had [Russell] Westbrook, Steph Curry, Klay [Thompson]. He’s been beating people, definitely in Golden State, by committee. With a team. He did that, but that team already knew how to win without KD. But you put KD in Brooklyn, and Kyrie [Irving] gets hurt and James Harden ain’t that guy, now KD not only has to score for them but also make plays for them. And this is no knock to KD, but they asked me, “Has he surpassed LeBron James?” And my answer was: LeBron James knows team basketball better than KD.  Other than his stupid commentary re Harden that ignores that he was injured, the rest of this is pretty fair.   &gt; KD can score better than LeBron, probably always have been able to. But has he surpassed LeBron? Naw. He tried to beat the Milwaukee Bucks instead of utilizing his team. You see what I’m saying? LeBron James would’ve figured out how to beat them and he wouldn’t have been exhausted and he may not have taken the last shot. But LeBron ain’t KD, and KD ain’t LeBron. KD is a shooter, a scorer. But he doesn’t have what LeBron has.  I feel like this is a good summary of the LeBron vs. KD debate and why LeBron is better. KD would win in a game of 1v1 100 times out of 100 vs. LeBron, but that's not what this game is about, it's about who is the best 5v5 team basketball player and LeBron is better at making his teammates better. KD doesn't really do anything to make his teammates better, he's the ultimate individual player."
"The same be said about any shorter than avg NBA player who also can score in the paint.  Russell westbrook. CP3, steph curry. Literally any all star lvl PG has a solid paint/rim scoring game, too."

"As it says in the article,  &gt; They brought in a new front office last season led by GM Troy Weaver, a longtime Thunder executive who played a key role in their great drafts in the late 2000s. Everyone knew Kevin Durant would be a superstar. But it’s easy to forget that Russell Westbrook and James Harden were controversial selections at the time. Weaver showed that he’s willing to buck consensus when he signed Jerami Grant to a massive deal in free agency last summer, a move that was widely panned but now looks brilliant."
"@ Toronto fans excited to assumedly be getting Suggs…. Ima let y’all finish but Davian Mitchell will be a better pro. Book it  Suggs is *safe*.  Mitchell is **dynamic**. I see raw Russell Westbrook coming out of UCLA, Colin Sexton but with passing ability and defense, and yes donovan Mitchell.   With Suggs I see…Lonzo Ball. I see Chauncey billups. Not bad of course, but a lot had to go right for billups to get where he got. You don’t really project a player to be Chauncey billups Bc it’s more mental and you can’t really duplicate that. You can duplicate athletic profile and skill set tho. Mitchell is that guy   The biggest red flag for Suggs is: he has no mid range game. Stars have mid range games. Pull ups, hesi’s, shot making, etc. Suggs has a cap to his game that no one is talking about."

"Then you should've said that instead of all this other bullshit and nobody would've argued. But you didn't   And lmao jesus christ you did not just compare Luka to fucking KD and Curry. Kids good but he's got a hell of a lot of growing on the mental side of the game to be compared to arguably the two greatest shooters of all time. Yes, there's a lot of players that would make them better. Luka is not one of them, he needs the ball too much and forces plays all the time. KD and Steph can both work off ball far better than Luka, and make far better decisions with it than Luka does on a consistent basis.   There's also players that are better than Ayton that would make them worse. Replace Ayton with Westbrook and that team's out of the playoffs already, and I fucking adore Russell Westbrook. You're making this like it's a personal vendetta against Luka when it's just about fit, and the more you just don't grasp the concept of him fitting better in the Suns roster and style than Luka, the more it becomes clear you don't actually know what you're talking about."
"To your point about college:   Russell Westbrook averaged 2.5 Assists for his 2 years at UCLA, while Jimmy Butler averaged 1.7 assists for 3 years at Marquette. Both were also SGs and Westbrook had Jrue Holliday &amp; Darren Collision as teammates.  Damian Lillard averaged 3.5 Assists overall in 4 years at Weber State but has always averaged more in the NBA.  We have to keep in mind that in the NBA, everybody is good. So guys are going to put up better assist numbers if they are passing to better players. A guy's college numbers are not always an indication of his pro numbers.  I expect Cunningham to blow that assist number out of the water as a pro. He was the only guy on Oklahoma State that could get his own shot. Without him, no way that team makes it to the Tournament."
For the Magic how can it not be Trey Burke.  Or Russell Westbrook.  We are seemingly the only team that don’t realize Russ can’t shoot so we defend him out on the perimeter like he’s prime Steph Curry.
"&gt; It's getting exhausting at this point. He's probably the most slandered player in the last few years. Dude is a star that gets picked apart like a generstional superstar.  People only seem to judge someone on what he's done most recently. This goes for both good and bad.  But the truth is rarely as good or as bad as people on this sub make it out to be.    I remember about 5 years ago, Raptors fan would go from saying DeMar was the greatest player on the Raptors to him being completely useless and how he's less valuable than an average role player.  Same thing happens to Russell Westbrook these days."
"Lol tell that Russell Westbrook, who Beverley tried to steal the ball, on fucking deadball."
"If Ben Simmons had the 3 and free of Russell Westbrook he'd be All-NBA first team every year. He really doesn't need to be great, good, or even average. He just needs to be a credible threat that isn't clogging the paint."
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
"Interesting, are we counting Harden and LeBron as PGs? I won’t count them just to see  In no order:  Steph, Kyrie, Dame, CP3, Luka, Lowry, Young, Westbrook,  Ja, Fox, Murray, LaMelo, Conley, Lonzo are all better than him   So MAYBE yeah that 15-20 range is fine.  I still didn’t even list: Kemba, Simmons, Shroeder, DEjounte, Brogdon, Rose, Sexton and Russell"
"2nd greatest shooter of all time, he could revert to JJ Redick level defense and Russell Westbrook level stillness off ball and hed still be a league wide starter no doubt."
Insert Russell Westbrook reaction lol stupid ass questions
And Ben Simmons with Russell Westbrook 3 point shooting is still better than his current iteration
The 3pt line was shortened that season and the year after. Outside of those 2 seasons he shot under 31% from 3 over the first 5 seasons of his career. That sounds pretty broken. Not Simmons level obviously but thats like Russell Westbrook 3pt shooting.
"G- Russell Westbrook   G- Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  F- Danny Green  F- Tobias Harris   C- Joël Embiid   Westbrook would relish in feeding these players. He’s still a consistent scoring threat. He can pass the ball to shooters, drive to the rim, or throw it to Embiid down low"
"There is nothing like black or white skin. So a guy like Russell Westbrook is black? His skintone is more golden brown. Siakam is darkskin, not black. Color is not a race. It doesn't determine lineage."
"Ahhhh. The ol' 1 assist off from a triple double, Russell Westbrook."
I agree. Russell Westbrook should be above Wilt
"He's definitely top 100 but he's in that 70-100 range. For example just at PG: Steph, Kyrie, Luka, Lillard, CP3, Trae, Morant, J. Murray, Lowry, Conley, Jrue, Fox, Brogdon, Lamelo, Westbrook, D. Russell, D. Murray are all better than him.   That's 17 players better than him just at 1 position."
hypnotize him to think he's russell Westbrook
"I'll be nice, I don't think you can argue ~~the antivaxxer~~ Stockton is better than Curry. I don't see it. Curry's 3 point shooting outweighs Stockton's playmaking, and Curry opens up so many opportunities for teammates to score even if it's not on the statsheet.  Hakeem is way too low, he's better than Shaq, Kobe, and Duncan at the least. Hakeem is the best defender since Russell and was fucked over by being on some pretty lousy Houston teams. Westbrook is also too high imo. KD a bit low  I don't think it's awful, but a few things do stick out."
Russell Westbrook above Steve Nash???
"A lot of good players can’t shoot. Shooting is very important, but if you can’t, you can also get away by producing offense in other ways. De’Aaron Fox, pre-injury John Wall, Ja Morant, and Russell Westbrook are examples of great shot creators who aren’t high efficiency shooters. Ben Simmons’s problem is he doesn’t have half the confidence and aggression those guys do, so he’s mostly standing around the court doing nothing"
"It's time for Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid to be friends. One of them can play center and rebound, has no problems scoring at 5ft from the basket. The other one can iso at the 3pt line and actually make threes."
So are Russell Westbrook and Luka Doncic and they're not 6-11 and camped right next to the basket
"Yeah you WOULD say that, Russell Westbrook fan lol"
Ben Simmons needs to realize he Draymond Green not Russell Westbrook  But Dray can shoot FT tho.
"What star wants to go to OKC lmao. If Zion doesn’t like it in NOLA why would he go there? He wants to go to the franchise that couldn’t win a title with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and a prime Ibaka? Lmao."
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
Russell Westbrook: *Why Not?*  Ben Simmons: *Why Try?*

"If it was Russell Westbrook I would say he was a couple of assists short, but this is just confusing."
Does a straight swap involving Ben Simmons for Russell Westbrook make sense?
What about a Ben Simmons for Russell Westbrook trade?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK
Ben Simmons needs to accept he's Draymond green and not Russell Westbrook
"Wow... and Daryl Morey is not on talking terms with the Rockets so he can't trade him for John Wall.  And, it pains me to say it, but I don't think the Wizards would trade Russell Westbrook for him.  So, probably the most untradable contract in the NBA..."
"Trae Young giving aneurisms like Russell Westbrook. Shooters gotta shoot, but damn was this an ugly game. However, that three late in the 4th gave him the redemption."
Danny Green is rocking a leather vest and what look like platform sole shoes. Homie’s been shopping with Russell Westbrook

"https://sports.yahoo.com/how-african-american-coaches-are-still-struggling-to-find-their-place-in-the-nba-173318612.html  &gt;	“Blacks aren’t a monolithic group. They don’t give us the same chances or look at each individual case,” a high-ranking African-American executive told Yahoo Sports. “If Lloyd Pierce goes into a tough situation or Fizdale, it’s not an indictment. Blacks are put in position, historically, that they have to take the worst circumstances and make it right in the short period of time.  &gt;“One black guy gets a shot to hold a position, if he fails then the establishment looks at it and says black guys can’t do that. White counterparts fail and fail up all the time, and get replaced by more white guys.”  &gt;All job openings aren’t created equal, and many are rebuilding situations with terrible circumstances — for some. Kerr inherited a ready-to-win team in the Bay Area — after passing up the Knicks job earlier in the coaching cycle. When the Oklahoma City Thunder still employed Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in 2015, they hired Billy Donovan from the college ranks to replace Scott Brooks.  &gt;Most recently, the Milwaukee Bucks and Lakers have been the “hot” jobs, and they’ve gone to Mike Budenholzer and Vogel, respectively.  &gt;Each situation has its own complexities, but in aggregate the results reveal the quality positions don’t make their way to African-American coaches.  &gt;It’s clear black coaching candidates see the trends, and even former accomplished players who’ve done their time as assistants realize how difficult it is to break through. Jerry Stackhouse had aspirations to be a head coach and was an assistant with the Raptors and Grizzlies, leading the Raptors’ then-D-League team to a title in 2016-17. But when Vanderbilt came calling, it was obvious he didn’t see a path in the NBA.  &gt;Patrick Ewing had years of coaching experience but didn’t get a sniff, going back to his alma mater, Georgetown. Juwan Howard spent years on Erik Spoelstra’s bench, but when nothing serious developed he went to Michigan, where he made his name as a Fab Fiver in the early 1990s.  &gt;The pipeline isn’t empty, but perhaps it’s underserved, making Rivers’ call for networking more poignant. Lost in his words is the need for allies in the establishment to champion black coaches."
Reggie Jackson &gt;&gt;&gt; Russell Westbrook
I love Russell Westbrook but having 5 of him on a team would be... weird
"That’s the thing about Westbrook though. Yeah, Westbrook was developed as a 1 guard due to his slightly shorter stature, maybe, but you look at the man, dude’s a unit. Russell Westbrook is a fucking tank at 6’3” 200Lbs.   Westbrook isn’t built like a Derrick Rose or a Ja Morant, not even a John Wall. Westbrook is more so built like a wing that’s missing a few inches."
I just remembered this Spanish 2017 article: [Learning to love Russel Westbrook](https://www.jotdown.es/2017/02/aprendiendo-querer-russell-westbrook/).
"I didnt completely rule it out.  I said if he can't shoot, then his game isn't going to age well.  Reading is fundamental.  And his post moves and touch aren't the greatest right now.  He will be going into year 9 and his  game has plateaued for several years now as far as bringing new aspects to his game.  Working hard is great and all, but people said the same thing about Russell Westbrook and those people are still waiting.  And Russell has an infinitely better shot than Giannis.  That's freaking troubling based on how the game is evolving to.  It's only going to get more shooting centric.  Not understanding the pitfalls of his game by now is being peak ingnorant.  And you assuming that the game changing to suit his game the next couple of years is even more ingnorant.  Good one though."
"Lmao, you really inflating how good stat padding Westbrook was. He took shots he shouldn't have all because he didn't want KD getting it in clutch moments. That game 7 in 2016 vs GSW was partly because of Russell Westbrook bricking shots yet again. KD kept them afloat as much as he could in the 4th quarter.   If Harden was healthy, then yes Nets would have beat the Bucks. Funny how you say this as if no other NBA champions have played with stars. Only very few teams have won the chip without another star like Dirk and the Mavs. Lebron, Kawhi, Steph.... have all won with another star on their team. Even MJ had Pippen when he won."
dont take anything this sub says seriously. people were saying Fred Vanvleet was a better player than Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook at home watching mad af rn
pat bev &gt; russell westbrook
Reggie Jackson &gt; Russell Westbrook  FIGHT ME REDDIT.
"Russell Westbrook trick y'all into thinking Pat Bev can't guard guys. in all seriousness though, Mitchell having a bum ankle is a big part of it because he can't blow by guys the same way he normally would.   Bev could always guard, it's just you can only expect a 30 something 6'1"" dude to guard similar athletes. putting him on Luka who people say is bigger than his listed height or on a healthy Mitchell would be harder., but that doesn't make him suddenly bad."
Rudy Gobert winning DPOY is like Russell Westbrook winning multiple mvps  A joke
"WHAT?🤨Bro I’m out, my mans trippin-Russell Westbrook"
"He’s easy to hate and Russell Westbrook spoke some memorable slander about him so people jump on the hate bandwagon. He may have lost a step or two, but he’s still a pretty decent 3&amp;D guard who hustles hard."
Yup.. Westbrook with incredible spacing that the Clippers have is MVP caliber.    Before COVID Houston was on a fucking tear with small ball spacing for Russell.  I hope he finishes his career in LA and plays at the Forum for the Clippers.
Russell Westbrook laughing right now
I got the opposite from the OKC year. He was their scapegoat the entire season until people realized you can’t win with Playoff P and Russell Westbrook living up to their nicknames
"On paper, russell westbrook?"
"So was Lonzo, so was Blake Griffin but both of them really got better at shooting three's.  At 21, he can drastically improve.  Don't forget this was his first games under Nate, the entire team did horribly with Pierce.  Oh yeah, Russell Westbrook is 32 and again, Cam Reddish is 21 but you can believe what you want to."
"Never forget Westbrook posted a photo of some 4th of July cupcakes after this was announced.  &gt;When Kendrick Perkins played center for the Thunder, he called teammates “cupcake” if he thought they were acting a little soft. Westbrook and Durant adopted the term in jest. Westbrook posted a bittersweet pic on Instagram: three plates of cupcakes topped by red and blue stars and sprinkles.  https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/10/19/13341418/russell-westbrooks-innocent-photo-of-cupcakes-turned-out-to-be-a-dig-at-kevin-durant"
"Keep being a blind bucks fanboy my man lol Giannis can only get to the finals by going through severely injured teams. asterik\* chip. He is one of the most limited ""superstars"" other than russell westbrook and ben simmons that ive ever seen. and even had to take an injury depleted Nets to 7 games and overtime. #overrated"
First Team All-“Get This Man A Ring”:  PG - Chris Paul  SG - Derrick Rose  SF - Paul George  PF - Carmelo Anthony  C - Giannis  Second Team:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - James Harden  SF - Jimmy Butler  PF - Blake Griffin  C - Lamarcus Aldridge
He shot worse from 3 this year than Russell Westbrook by 5%. He is not a 3&amp;D player yet.
"As a bucks, fan Imma be 100% honest with u here. Defense doesn't determine middleton's field goal %. He's got that tim duncan vibe but he's really just another russell westbrook in terms of how hot and cold he is."
Kd stans always act like Reggie Jackson and Russell Westbrook were scrubs.
You realise KD made it to the finals in 2012 right? So how is Russell Westbrook and James Harden up here but not KD?  Edit: upon realisation I have now realised that KD literally made a back to back in 2017 and 2018 lul
Hands down Russell Westbrook.
Young Russell Westbrook! So explosive! Him or d rose
"The point Godzilla himself.   Russell  Westbrook  Man is on a mission to dunk so hard the rim breaks, the ball deflates, and his opponent retires from basketball."
"Damien lillard is not nearly on the level as kd. Dame was never an actual threat to the warriors. Dame has never had a teammate as good as Russell Westbrook. Those are the key differences, if u can’t recognize that than I don’t know what to tell u"
Russell Westbrook 20-20-20 game an emotional stat beast who ramped it up because he was emotional after Nipsey's passing
Imagine Russell Westbrook and Pat Bev on the same team. Staggering minutes might not be enough to keep one from killing the other.
"Yea I don’t trust random people on reddit man lmao. I trust the game I see and genuinely thought rockets would have won if CP3 didn’t get hurt and am convinced rockets don’t go up 3-2 with out him. The only, only thing I remember was him not being a good 3 point shooter that playoffs but besides that he was a stud. Idk you’re trolling bc if you genuinely thought a future with Russell Westbrook looked brighter than Chris Paul you’re insane"
We just need Russell Westbrook on that that team somehow
Westbrook actually has overachieved no?  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/russell-westbrook/
And each should went 1/1/2 the drafting of Russell Westbrook at 4 and Ibaka at 24 is enough for me to have faith in their drafting
Or told someone that Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for like 3.5 seasons and didn’t make it to conference finals
Paul is the most wrongly maligned star other than Russell Westbrook. Baffles me that people still haven’t figured out Harden was the problem.
Russell Westbrook with 3 seasons of averaging triple doubles…and not even making an All-NBA 3rd team despite averaging a triple double.
"LMAO imagine liking PatBev  Calling his dirty and reckless behavior ""scrappy and competitive""   ""Makes the game more fun"" Get the fuck outta here. Ya know what's fun? Not having a superstar like Russell Westbrook miss a year because some punk ass dove at this knees. Out here acting like it was just one shove and that he doesn't have a history of dirty playe."
Dude was drafted before Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love
He’d be peak Russell Westbrook with a slightly better shot imo
"I love this excerpt from Westbrook lol  ""Pat Bev trick y'all, man, like he playing defense,"" Westbrook said. ""He don't guard nobody, man. It's just running around, doing nothing. ... All that commotion to get 47.""  Notorious pest Patrick Beverley's reputation as an elite defender isn't accurate, according to Russell Westbrook, who cited James Harden's 47-point performance in the Rockets' 102-93 victory Wednesday night over the Clippers as proof."
"how is that “the russell westbrook effect”. russ gets the opposite treatment. when healthy he’s only had two bad postseason runs, and in his prime he was a beast in the playoffs every year. yet people look at his bad moments to call him a choker  such a stupid way to hate on a player for no reason, this thread wasn’t even about russ"
"He was having a historic run this year, and the guys that were hurt were guards so they wouldn't even defend him. Some people just hate players for dumb reasons, like most people here hating on Paul George or Russell Westbrook. Giannis is an all time great player but since he cant do any fancy dribbles or hit threes from half court he gets hate."
"I want to say its sincere, but Russell Westbrook waned us about Bev."
Martin Jarmond calling russell Westbrook dealership as we speak
"LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Chris Paul   Dwight Howard   Carmelo Anthony   Russell Westbrook   All of them could retire tomorrow and would still be first ballot. You have others who’d get in but not 1st ballot because of a lack of longevity(Jokic , Giannis, etc)"
"You mean how he had them trade the whole house for Russell Westbrook because he didn’t want to play off-ball to a top 5 PG of all-time, and then forced his way out a year later by coasting and not following COVID protocols? Saying he was only interested in Brooklyn so they had to lower his trade value even more and had even less flexibility on what they could get back for him? Yeah him"
"IF STATS ARE CLEAR REPRESENTATION OF SOMEONES ABILITIES ON THE COURT,,, IS RUSSELL WESTBROOK THE GREATEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE???"
"100%. It was the Russell Westbrook Trade for a whole year, _now_ its the Chris Paul trade"
Ben Simmons x Russell Westbrook who says no
"It wasnt uncommon because of how over-reactionary everybody is, not because it was some clinical objective evaluation of the situation and what Chris Paul vs Russell Westbrook were. Chris Paul got traded because he wasnt good in the 2019 playoffs but its like nobody in Houston bothered watching what Westbrook looked like those same playoffs(or in 2018) thinking this guy would somehow be an upgrade on the biggest stages."
Didn't Russell Westbrook win the MVP? Top 10?
It’s the Russell Westbrook effect. Under perform in the playoffs regularly but then have some great games and everyone acts like they were always that guy. PG deserved the memes. And no he deserves his respect. Both can exist.
"Just a recap on CP3 recent past.  - Got traded for Russell Westbrook to OKC and Housto(!!!) sent also 4 picks to OKC (lol).  - Got traded to the Suns for Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre and a 1st rounder (lol x2).   It is the classical evaluation of your average guy who dropped 40 in a WCF game...   When Lebron last year title speech talked about 'put the damn respect' he really didn't know what he was talking about. CP3 went through a true pile of shit along his path. He need his damn respect now. Whatever happens in the finals. He was treated like shit last two years and evaluated like an untradeable asset. Shame on 2 organisations who passed on him"
"Russell Westbrook right ""he don't guard nobody just runs around""."
Surprised no one's quoted Russell Westbrook in the comment thread.
"russell “stat padding terrible no good basketball player” Westbrook has made the 2nd round more recently than luka “literally the best player since jordan, classy, meaningful triple double” donkcic"
Russell Westbrook LOVING this…
Russell Westbrook must be LOVING this…
I'm sure somewhere Russell Westbrook is smiling thinking about Pat Beverly
Somewhere Russell Westbrook is smiling
CHRIS PAUL WILL WIN A RING BEFORE RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"PG seems to have the basketball IQ of Russell Westbrook, and everybody knows that isn’t a compliment."
Russell Westbrook
"Oh, your post wasn't very clear.   I didn't even fuckin consider they'd have WB in the top 10. But they have Kobe, so everything is possible.  In fairness to the guy, people refer to Bill Russell as Russell and to Russell Westbrook as Westbrook. Usually."
Bruh he spent 2 years there and wasn't getting anywhere with Russell Westbrook hogging the ball.
"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Is Gianni's that athletic or is it moreso bc his body gives him the most movement around the court?   If we're talking about athletic, I'd say pre-injury era Russell Westbrook for sure. Played a ton of minutes, yet had nonstop explosiveness to his game. Flamboyant dunks to long jump shots. Could drive at the rim with some incredible athleticism/explosiveness with no hesitation who is defending him."
I remember someone referring to Westbrook as Russell Statbook during his MVP season lol
Russell Westbrook for the longest time
"i’ll go with something like  PG: Magic/Curry/Oscar/Cp3/Nash/Zeke/Cousy/Stockton/Westbrook/Dame  SG: Jordan/Kobe/West/Harden/Wade/AI/Drexler/Skywalker/Allen/Gervin  SF: literally same as yours, maybe i try and put butler or pg over melo as a hot take  PF: Duncan/Garnett/Barkley/Karl/Dirk/McHale/Pettit/Giannis/AD/Hayes  C: Kareem/Russell/Wilt/Shaq/Hakeem/Moses/Robinson/Ewing/Mikan  overall i think yours is super solid. if there’s someone i forgot there’s a 90% chance they slipped my mind"
"Giannis has the benefit of elite efficiency and proved himself with deep playoff runs as a #1. Russell Westbrook has had a sizable chunk of the basketball world saying he flat out doesn’t play “winning basketball” for most of his prime and the fact that he never made it out of the first round in OKC after KD left and his playoff performances since only amplified that “stat-chaser, doesn’t contribute to winning” talk"
Bill Russell or Russell Westbrook?
"Russell Westbrook has had so many hot takes in the Rockets sub I legitimately don't have any idea what the public opinion is   He was good, underwhelmed at the end, had a great season for the Wizards and was doing good things in OKC before us. Same thing happened with Chris Paul.  Theyve always been good, but next to Harden and playing for D'Antoni they both hit a ceiling, I think.  But depending on who you ask in our sub it's usually either God or trash"
"My most unpopular opinion that granted me a lot of bad karma here is that Russell Westbrook will be out of the league in 1-2 year. Russ is proven to be only a statpadder and his teams are constantly playing bad with him. He is truly uncoachable because his skillset is so particular and hard to mesh with a normal winning rosters. His efficiency is dropping fast and as age comes he would be less and less explosive. As he enter in the last 2 years of his contract, if the Wizards are stuck in 7th or 8th seed also next season (and I think they couldn't do better with that roster) Beal will then ask a trade and playing with only Russ at 34-35 yo has zero sense for a team. That will lead to a buyout for Russ mid season or earlier, but with his skills I hardly see him playing from the bench or with a Blake Griffin kind of role. Maybe someone will try anyway but still I see more likely to see him in China in 2 years at most (or retired)."
"&gt; The window is closing on KD, Steph, Lebron, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard. The rise of guys like Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Young, Doncic, etc will eventually catch up.  Time do be like that."
True but Reggie was once as delusional. Demanded a trade bc he didn’t start on a team that had prime Russell Westbrook lol
Russell Westbrook is the most overrated player in NBA history.
I literally said a less aggressive Russell Westbrook lmao
Russell Westbrook loved his popcorn Airber delivery.
Giannis is just a taller but less aggressive Russell Westbrook
"On a worse defensive team Russell Westbrook has a better DBPM, and DWS   If you think Ingram is a superstar scorer that explains this entire convo   If you think playmaking is just looking at AST numbers....then that explains this entire convo"
Russell Westbrook is a good basketball player.
Russell Westbrook is absolute fucking ass at basketball.
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors — Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats – 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats – 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers’ defenders but couldn’t do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam’s field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim. Siakam had very little success the few times he tried to drive on Simmons as well. Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he’s done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he’s kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87. That’s a combined field goal percentage of 29.8."
"Tanking is not a way to winning any NBA titles, even if you draft well you then need to figure out how to trade and recruit other stars to the team.   This was a bizarre NBA season and we're never going to see one like this again. Injuries, going out with COVID, the favorites falling behind and losing, role players becoming heroes in lieu of stars going down. Enjoy this, one can not imagine how this current playoffs isn't a result of making players play so many games in such short time.   The window is closing on KD, Steph, Lebron, Paul George, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard. The rise of guys like Ayton, Embiid, Jokic, Young, Doncic, etc will eventually catch up.  Ben Simmons is a small ball 5.   Because Giannis can go to the basket consistently and make great plays in the paint which lead to scoring, He doesn't need a three pointer. Adding a consistent 3 pointer isn't gonna do as much as you hope it would because which guys actually going to respect it? the layup is still the most effective shot at the basket.  Giannis not being able to shoot free throws is an achilles heel, it's not only can he not shoot them but he even airballs them. Get that man shooting granny style, this is a bigger deal than not being able to shoot.  If Trae Young is indeed injured a bit at his ankle, the series is over. All that does is make it harder to go the basket and therefore easier for Jrue to guard you and score. That will be hard to overcome and I'm not sure it's possible."
"The biggest one he did was when he tackled Russell Westbrook and badly injured him  There’s a lot of them,but recently he blatantly elbowed Chris Paul a couple month ago  You could probably look it up and find a bunch of examples"
I can't see Russell Westbrook anywhere but in Oklahoma City  I can't see James Harden anywhere but in Houston  I can't see Dwyane Wade anywhere but in Miami  I can't see Damian Lillard anywhere but in Portland
Russell Westbrook
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R. Smith|40.0|35.6| |Tristan Thompson|63.6|0| |Richard Jefferson|51.6|16.7| |Kevin Love|30.4|26.7| |Iman Shumpert|26.3|16.7|  OKC  |Player||| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|42.3|28.6| |Russell Westbrook|39.5|31.7| |Serge Ibaka|47.2|34.4| |Dion Waiters|35.8|31.8| |Andre Roberson|52.0|44.4| |Steven Adams|53.3|0| |Enes Kanter|48.6|0|"
"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters. You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure.

"This whole promotional tours deserves the Russell Westbrook stink face.  ""What? Bro, you trippin"""
"I think people don't truly ""hate"" Pat Bev for flopping. Smart flops, Lowry flops, Harden flops. I think people hate Bev for two different reasons:  1. The fact that he comes off as arrogant and ""hubristic"" for lack of a better term - he talks a lot of trash and taunts without being an all star calibre player.   2. Russell Westbrook  **I am not saying Paul is an angel**, but Paul is a HoF lock, top 5 PG of all time, and hasn't fucked someone's knee, although nut shots are pretty dirty and despicable."
"You're talking yourself in circles my guy lmao you just agreed with me by calling him reckless.   Does anyone think pat bev has a picture of Russell westbrook in his room that he plays darts on? No lmao, but he makes reckless plays that injure other players. He's dove at westbrook's knees more than once. 99.9% of players haven't done it once, let alone to a single player twice.   Like I said, go to the park and try this shit and watch what happens, but the fact that you ignored me saying that and agreed with me that he's reckless proves you know he's detrimental to actually playing the game and for some reason are choosing to die on this hill"
… it’s just regular Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook saying he don't guard nobody.
"Man's been such a G after Kawhi went down, he's gonna get the brinks truck.  I remember him when in OKC, bench energy behind Westbrook was crazy. He learned how to play from Russell, I think"
"Pat gets the attention he does because of the players he's injured. Devin Booker (broken nose), Jeff Green (shoulder contusion), and Russell Westbrook (torn meniscus). He might not be trying to injure people but he's also not trying to avoid injuring them.  He makes high risk plays because at worst for him he gets a flagrant 2 and he's out. He might injure someone but that's the role he's created for himself in the league"
A wild Russell Westbrook lmao
"OP repost: NBA mods enjoy  1.) Allen Iverson: outside of volume scoring the dude added little else. He had an all time low shooting efficiency at 42% with pathetic rebounding and ast numbers. Dude was extremely overhyped and was a defensive liability at best and added a ton of TO's. (2001) Great handles, very fast and knew how to draw fouls.      2.) Derrick Rose: 25 ppg is 4 reb, and 44% are greatly below average for an nba MVP. With those numbers he should've averaged at least 10 ast per game to justify an NBA MVP but he averaged 7 ast per game. Very athletic (2011)      3.) James Harden: Slow as dog shi t, unathletic, uses the refs and knowledge of the rules to make his points, worst starting defender in the NBA, below average shooting percentage at 44% FG% 5 reb 8 ast. His MVP came right after the Westbrook MVP but was didn't come close to a triple double average and included less points 20 ppg and no defense. Dude is a fraud. Great at creating contact to get to the line. (2018)      4.) Russell Westbroke: 42.5%, 10 reb and 10 ast with 31 ppg. Volume shooter stat padder. Stats were made with him just dribbling around waiting until someone was finally open to get a good look. Rebounds were mostly due to teamates clearing out the lane for him to get the rebounds. Volume scorerer that took low IQ shots at a low which = low shooting percentage. Explosive athlete (2017).      5.) Steph Curry: The 48% FG% is great efficiency as well from the line. However, his mediocre defense combined with low ppg at 23 ppg didn't help. What makes it worse is he didn't average a double double. Normally if you do not average a double double you have to average at least 30 ppg to win the MVP but he neither averaged a double double or 30 ppg. He averaged 7 ast and 4 reb (2015), At the very least you should average high 20's and 6 or above for rebounds and ast.            Just missed the top 5 worst MVP's for the 2000's .      1.) Kobe: 28 ppg, 6 reb 5 ast and 45% FG%. His good defense saved him but overall his numbers were average (MVP comparison). His defense keeps him out of the top 5.      2.) Dirk, 28 9 and 3 at 50% FG%: Didn't get the double double and adds very little to play making. However he was very close to the double double and his scoring efficiency keeps him off the top 5.                  Best MVP's of the 2000's:            1.) Nikola: The combination of good defense, near triple double with 26.5 ppg combined with the insane shooting efficiency of 56% makes him #1 on this list. Prevented Giannis from becoming the first player in this millennium to win 3 MVP's in a row (2021)      2.) Giannis: It's difficult to pick a year but the second MVP is the best choice since he was also the D MVP as well as having a high efficiency at 55%, damn near 30 ppg, 13.6 reb and 5.6 ast. I would say his playmaking should improve but when I look at the roster for that year all I seen was an inconsistent #2 guy aging Center, dumb PG and no SG at all. (2020)      3.) LBJ: Excellent efecency at 56%, nearly 27 ppg, with 8 reb and 7ast. Didn't get a triple or even a double double or the 30 ppg mark but an all nba first team defense combined with very high effeciency and above average MVP numbers across the board is why it's a top 3 season (2013)      4 and 5 are either Giannis or LBJ for different years."
"-signed, someone who has never played sports   Being airborne is significantly less dangerous than having your feet planted on the ground when someone launches themselves at your knees. Ask Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook CANNOT be happy about this
"When you think about it, Oscar Robertson was Russell Westbrook with the equivalent of Curry’s efficiency. I can see why people in that era called him the GOAT even though he didn’t win in his prime."
I’m getting jose altuve-aroldis chapman flashbacks where james harden and russell westbrook were sitting behind the plate for the homerun
Russell Westbrook
It's never a circle jerk without an overcorrection.    Does he get way more shit than he deserves?  Absolutely.  But you don't have to act like it came from nowhere.  [Fortunately 538 just released an article detailing his inconsistencies](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-the-real-playoff-p/).  One single person in the league since 1980 that shoots &gt;10 shots on below 40% efficiency more often than PG.  And it's Russell fucking Westbrook.    Shit even in that single game against hte Suns hit two big shots to pull them back and then clanked both free throws and ends up losing the game because of it.
"Afraid to drive to the hoop based on one series? What about the rest of his career? He didn’t seem to have driving problems then. Don’t judge the player based on his last seven games!  And this isn’t just any point guard. This is a 6’10 point guard with passing comparable to LeBron (not as good, but comparable) and a handle to match.   Oh, and he is also a defensive player of the year candidate. Come on dude. Let’s stop acting like this guy is Russell Westbrook or Kemba Walker.   If Paul George goes for 5 first rounders then Ben Simmons certainly goes for 3."
"A lot is genetics, but it’s how early you start sports. Learning speed and agility drills before puberty accelerate how fast you can run and how high you can jump during puberty.     Theory based but there’s evidence to support this.  If you train for ten years from 18-28 you at 28 won’t be as fast as the kid who trained for 10 years from 8-18 when they’re 18.   However athletes like Russell Westbrook weren’t very athletic and then through word developed elite athleticism.  For one of the most explosive players in the league Russ couldn’t dunk until he was a senior in HS when most elite athletes are dunking by 9th grade, some like Mikey Williams in 6th or 7th grade"
"This whole thing is weird, y’all know Russell Westbrook did the same thing back in 2013 right? It’s not a big deal."
I’d rather sit with my family in a quieter and more comfortable area as well. I also remember Russell Westbrook doing the same thing back in OKC when Pat Bev took him out of the 2013 playoffs.
"mac had the tools, just didn't try on that end  think russell westbrook"
Russell Westbrook does not
"No, for me, that's absolutely the case. Paul hasn't played on very many teams that had a realistic chance to get this far, and further. Kobe and LeBron and Steph and Durant did. Does anyone doubt Durant would have led Brooklyn to a great shot at the championship if he even had one of the other two stars at full health?  But, the reality is that when you have few opportunities to really prove your legacy as an all time great, there's that much more pressure to produce. When Dirk had the chance, he came through. This is Paul's moment. He's still a great, great player, and he's playing with a lot of talent. There's no fucking way a Kawhi-less LAC team should even be competitive - and it's not, as long as Paul and/or Booker hit their normal shots.  It's not fair to a player of Paul's accomplishments that his legacy still hangs in the balance. But it's because when you get to very very top, the only thing we can really use to differentiate one player from another is his performance at the very highest levels - even if it's an unfairly small sample size.  To me or any halfway reasonable fan, Paul is an all time great. Sure. Nobody's questioning whether he's better than Russell Westbrook or Kevin Johnson. At the most upper echelons, the differences between the #7 player of all time and #23 player of all time are razor thin. It comes down to moments like the one that's in front of Paul the next few weeks. I personally hope he kills it."
"Great play undoubtedly, but every time I see pat bev I just think about the Russell Westbrook quote ““Pat Bev trick y’all, man, like he playing defense. He don’t guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing.”"
You do realize Russell Westbrook is one of the smartest basketball players in the NBA. This notion that Russ is a low IQ player is just stupid
Oscar Robertson would be treated the same way as Russell Westbrook if he never won a ring in Milwaukee when he was no longer in his prime.
Players with a greater legacy than George Karl on the ~~2012-13~~ 2021-22 Lakers:  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Carmelo Anthony  Dwight Howard  Rajon Rondo  Marc Gasol  DeAndre Jordan
I would feel better about it because in 2021 Ben Simmons is a better basketball player than Russell Westbrook
Uhhhh Russell Westbrook?
No because I'm not dumb enough to think Russell Westbrook is a true star anymore.
"Bro, you have LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, and a bunch of solid role players in your acting like your team's trash or something. We stacked the deck just like you guys did the last few years."
"Anything he adds, other than a low % halfcourt shot would be an improvement at this point. His 538 Projection is currently worse than 80% of PG starters:  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/russell-westbrook/"
Yeah but it’s a Mickey Mouse title or something so my hot take is 100% correct.  Also something about lebron not living up to expectations while also saying it’s a super team.  I’ll add Russell Westbrook is too good for the lakers and also an overrated ball hog.
"yep, defensive perception rises and falls with narrative. When a shit defensive player gets offensive accolades or has a great offensive season, suddenly people say, actually he's much better on defense than people think. See: Harden, James; Irving, Kyrie; Lavine, Zachary; Booker, Devin; Westbrook Russell; Jokic, Nikola, etc etc. Not all of those guys are equally bad, but what they have in common is their were suddenly considered improved defenders after monster offensive seasons. Do we really believe that's true? C'mon."
Morey said he liked it when he made it.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-daryl-morey-calls-trade-for-russell-westbrook-the-most-intense-of-his-career/
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"
Oh g thank you I really was sure that Westbrook's shot sucked because RUSSELL WESTBROOK didn't work hard enough
Lamelo Ball. Way too many people acting like he is the next Dame/ Steph. And goddamn 2K putting him 1 point below RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS A FUCKING TRAVESTY.
"Or even just a stat.   Like Isaiah Thomas being ""the worst defender in the NBA"" literally came from a single Reddit post citing he was dead last in specifically DRPM at specifically one point midway through the season [\(Russell Westbrook actually finished dead last for the full season\)](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2017/page/12/sort/DRPM).   [The season before he had tied with Jrue Holiday.](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2016/page/7/sort/DRPM)  This entire sub turned on a dime when that post came out and suddenly everyone was saying ""you just have to watch him to know it's true"" and ""he's too short to actually have any impact"".     [It got to the point where Nate Duncan was coming out to dismiss the rumour.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/626vxf/isaiah_thomas_is_not_the_worst_defender_in_the_nba/)  He was never a great defender, he was never even really a good defender. However, he was never as horrible as people suddenly decided he was. He was bad in the way other star PGs were bad (Har_en, Westbrook, Lillard and Kyrie).  He also wasn't really holding our defence back in a major way. We had a top 7 defence for more of Isaiah's tenure than not."
Russell Westbrook does all that stuff except the post D and is still a bad defender. Post defence is the only plus for Harden
"Ja Morant, no he isn't the next Russell Westbrook he isn't that efficient he is a god awful defensive liability so D Brooks kind of had to take over for him there in that department and he isn't even a top 15 point guard."
Is there any reasonable argument that could be made for Russell Westbrook to crack that W team?
Who exactly are Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook supposed to be? Are they not all future HOF locks lmao?  The moment you even said that dumb shit you invalidated you’re entire point.   Social media didn’t create shit. A lot of us weren’t born in 2003 and actually grew up getting to watch both Jordan and Lebron lol
Russell Westbrook
Anthony Davis   Lebron James  Russell Westbrook   Washed up stars….. 😣😣😣😣
Russell Westbrook made Daniel Gafford a fantasy gem at the end of last season. I’m sure AD is gonna be fine.
I don't get why people make a weird deal about this stuff. It's not someone's opinion it's based on a combination of historical data and statistics and for every Kevin Durant you get a Russell Westbrook and Demar Derozan that it absolutely nails.
"Russell Westbrook for Ben Simmons, who says no?"
"Kuzma, KCP, Harrell, and a pick for Westbrook sounds like something a lakers fans would draw up on TradeNBA.com on a Russell Westbrook trade scenario under LakersNation’s Twitter post  The wizards did that"
Russell Westbrook is my favorite non-Sixer ever. And I don’t like dirty players in general. I don’t know why being a Sixers fan would mean that I did.
Russell Westbrook wasn’t good
"message to me in 2011:  hello former me  it is 2021  joe biden is president  it is a capital offense to blow out the candles on a birthday cake  lebron james, russell westbrook and rajon rondo are all playing for the los angeles lakers  nothing you care about matters any more.   stop it. just bust nuts and tell people what you think."
"It's also what happened to Morey himself with the Chris Paul/Russell Westbrook trade. Morey tried to wait it out, insist Chris Paul and James Harden could coexist, then Fertitta came down and said ""get CP3 the fuck out of here."" Now Morey, Harden, CP3, and Russ are all on different teams. Life comes at you fast."
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.

What more do you expect from Russell Westbrook fans. Y’all don’t know anything about basketball lmao
"He shot a lot of mid range jumpers early in his career, and still shoots them probably more than anyone else except Russell Westbrook lol"
Where's the 2021 updated version with Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis
"&gt; kd was doubled out of the playoffs repeatedly till he joined GS.  Career averages of 29/8/4 on 57% TS in the playoffs with OKC is hardly ""doubled out of the playoffs repeatedly"". He lost to great teams that were better than his (Heatles, 2014 Spurs, 2016 Warriors), simple.  &gt; double KD and take him out the game  You don't take KD out of the game, in OKC he had 7 games under 20 points in the playoffs in seven years, the way you play KD is you play hard nosed defense and hope he misses. The Thunder lost to all-time great squads and had horrible shooting all those years, they didn't lose because KD was taken off those games, that's impossible to do.  &gt; at GS though, the entire league decided the more dangerous player was steph and decided to never leave him all the way through to the finals for multiple years on end  No, the league decided that they could actually do something to contain Steph and that they didn't have an answer for Kevin Durant with shooters.  What yall don't understand is that doubling KD to force a pass to Andre Roberson and Russell Westbrook in the 3-PT line is one thing, another thing entirely is when he passes to Klay Thompson. KD is a good enough passer that he will find the open man when doubled, the problem was that in OKC the open man shot under 25% from 3 so he had to force bad shots, which hurt his efficiency."
"Bonus drama points to him for being teammates with the following players before: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and even Shaq.  &amp;nbsp;  Having an opinion as an ex-teammate of LeBron James itself will get clicks. But along with that he's also a teammate of all the guys above and a lot of them either had beef with others there or have fanbases that have had rivalries/beefs with one of the other fanbases. Examples: LBJ fans vs KD fans, LBJ vs Kyrie, KD and his fans vs WB and his fans, Harden fans vs Westbrook fans, LeBron and his fans vs Celtics and their fans, LeBron and Ray Allen vs Celtics, LeBron vs Pierce, Ray Allen vs Rondo, etc.   &amp;nbsp;  There's plenty more headlines and drama I haven't even listed yet but Kendrick brands himself as someone who can provide unique, locker room insight, so it gets more juicy for drama lovers (especially when he's forced to pick a side)"
"Why are we pretending that a team with LeBron, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook making the playoffs is an ""if""?"
"Heild would be a terrible deployment of capital. Russell Westbrook is an amazing basketball player.  Russell is perfect for pushing the offense and taking  over some of Lebron's workload during the regular season. I would honestly rather have Bazemore and Ariza on the floor than Hield. That dude is an overpaid specialist who thinks he is a star. With Ellington, Monk, Nunn, Melo, Bazemore, etc, the Lakers have plenty of guys who can spot up at the 3 point line and wait for the open looks that Lebron, Westbrook and AD generate."
[lmao perfectly sums up the old schoool meme](http://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8)
"and oscar robertson, one of the greatest players of all time, was saying russell westbrook should have won mvp for the 20-21 season. so why should anyone give a fuck what players think?"
"It wouldn't work from a business perspective which is why it probably won't happen. This conversation about the lower cap hit supermax first started around the 2017-18 season, when a lot of guys were discussing if it was a failure after the John Wall and Russell Westbrook contracts. Small market teams in OKC and WAS had to do them in order to keep their guys, but it hurt team building was the argument. However there was a long discussion from I think Zach Lowe and some other guys, basically showing that it would be impossible for the small market teams to sign someone on a supermax that didn't count against the cap to make money. It's been a couple of years so I might not have all the details correct, but essentially their argument was showing the Grizzlies compared to the Lakers. They had access (by being insiders I guess) to pre-profit sharing revenues of each team and the Grizzlies who were a playoff team that years were somehow -12m before profit sharing whereas the Lakers who were awful that year were up 80m. The no cap hit supermax would essentially mean Memphis would be -20 to -30 million down instead of only -12 if they had a supermax player. No amount of profit sharing would make that up to make them profitable whereas the Lakers would have even more power to essentially sign away guys because they don't care about paying them at all."
"Russell Westbrook  ""DUBIOUS STARTER"""
I would take Russell Westbrook over everyone one of these players in that form of their self.
"Strangely, I've only ever met one and he was in between... Russell Westbrook.  Honestly, I had no idea who he was, I don't watch basketball and since he was sitting down I didn't get a full idea of how big he was until later. I was bartending at a California Pizza Kitchen in Houston and they asked me to help deliver some food to a table, his.   He didn't acknowledge any of us, which is actually fine, I didn't notice it but one of the other servers was kind of bummed since they knew who he was. They wanted to talk to him a little bit ilgot.the vibe he didn't want to talk, which, yeah I got that too. Again, that's okay in my book.  But when a kid came in cause someone tweeted it that he was there, he signed an autograph and took a picture with him. He seemed fine with it. Not exactly happy and was definitely kind to the kid.  It was kind of weird, I mean dude was really in between... like, middle of the road. Not a dick but not like a warm my life is awesome celebrity. Also, I could have just caught him on a weird day.  When he stood up to take a pic with the kid, I was immediately like, oh yeah, that's a basketball player."
"We cant know the reasons why superstar stay here or go there for sure, but money Is a factor. We cant know what John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, James Harden or Giannis was gonna do if there wasnt the supermax."
"Asterisk reason: Reigning 2012 Western Conference champs traded away future MVP James Harden before the season and lost Russell Westbrook to injury when Patrick Beverley needlessly collided with him in the first round of the playoffs, paving the way for the Heat to repeat. Invalid."
"#ThePost:  &gt;Westbrook's 3PT% in the clutch dating back to 2014  Players Clutch Traditional  2019-20, Westbrook shot 22% from 3pt in the clutch  2018-19, Westbrook shot 18% from 3pt in the clutch  2017-18, Westbrook shot 21% from 3pt in the clutch  2016-17, Westbrook shot 32% from 3pt in the clutch  2015-16, Westbrook shot 20% from 3pt in the clutch  2014-15, Westbrook shot 9% from 3pt in the clutch  Westbrook takes awful shots late in games and is a horrible shooter.  His only role is to try to drive and then distribute, which is already LeBron's role and LeBron does it better.  think about it from a coach's perspective - what is Russell's role?  If LeBron has the ball then Russell destroys the spacing for Bron and AD, but if Russ has the ball then he's gonna make worse decisions and take worse shots at a lower rate than Bron would.  And he sure ain't gonna make up for that on the defensive end. So whats is Russell going to do?"

"Thats very true, but imagine how good you gotta be to even be considered coming from the Ivy League conference.  This guy also led his team to the winning the CA state championship.  He was an all-state pick (1st team) with James Harden and over Russell Westbrook (3rd team) and Brook Lopez (3rd team).  This is an asian kid from northern California and the CA state championship is one of the toughest to win."
I wish they'd bring back the dress code so Russell Westbrook can stop looking like a toddler dressed him.
russell westbrook is another great example.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maa0XNjY7Xw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Maa0XNjY7Xw)  this clip gave me so much respect for him even if he sometimes comes off as an asshole
"Seems like to win today, you need 3 point shooting from that position. Look at Russell Westbrook. The year that he wanted MVP, and the years that he was impactful in OKC post-KD, his ability (and willingness) to take threes affected the other teams' ability to sag off him in the paint. Not that he's ever been a feared three-point sniper, but he makes enough of them when it counts to keep teams honest (which is what we wish Ben Simmons could do). I'm not sure Derrick Rose has ever gotten to that point, of even being as ""feared""/respected as Westbrook from 3 (and I'm saying that lightly). It seems like that matters a lot more now than it did in 2011."
"Stockton is a skilled passer but he’s not a better playmaker than guys like Nash, Westbrook, Kobe, Lebron. Those guys create more valuable opportunities for their teammates while Stockton is passive. I’m not disrespecting him I’m just telling it how it is.  It’s funny how people shit on Kobe for being a shot chucker when Cousy was literally the first inefficient shot chucker. Cousy never deserved mvp over Bill Russell"
Russell Westbrook
Blake Griffin   Shawn Kemp  Shaquille O’Neal   Deandre Jordan  LeBron James   Russell Westbrook   ————————  I have the more slimmer athletic guys in a different category: Jordan/David Thompson/Dominique/Vince Carter/ Dr.J   Westbrook is the only smaller guy in the first category
"I don't wanna see LeBelt and Russell Westbrook Jr. have my old favorites eat dirt, please don't"
"&gt;Giannis also has a DPOY award, so it is fair to say that most basketball analysts agree that Giannis is a better defender.  Not it's not. DPOY is a regular season award. Russell Westbrook won MVP in 2017, that doesn't mean that most basketball analysts ""agreed"" that he was more valuable than Kevin Durant and Lebron James.  Giannis plays extremely hard on both ends all the time and I think that in itself is very impressive. But, like I said in another response, AD had one of the best defensive playoff runs of the past 15 years last year. It's not just my eye test, a lot of people agree that it was an all time defensive playoff run. Giannis was more dominant offensively, and he did play great defense, but AD's defense in the 2020 playoffs was on another lever."
"For your takes :   Agree, MVP is overrated and is a team accomplishment most of the time but the main problem imo is consistency. Westbrook should have never one MVP if they wanted to be consistent.   Kobe is top 8 all time and behind Duncan. Timmy carried more in 99 and 03 than Kobe ever did on his championship. The only year Kobe had potential to have similar carry potential he lost (2008).   Indeed, 09 and 10 are highly underrated nowadays cz Kobe is retired so people forgot those great runs. Pau deserves more credit though, he was a top 3/4 player every series.   Tim Duncan is underrated not overrated. His individual skillset is highly underrated, for the first 7 years of his career he was a great scorer, arguably a goat type defensive player, and his game was built for the playsoff. Underrated passer and rebounder too. Had one of if not the greatest individual playoff run of all time in 03 and carried in 99 and 07. In 05 he was 1A and Ginobili was 1B. TP got FMVP cz he was a scorer. In 14, he was the best player with TP on the squad but kawhi overperformed in the finals and got the FMVP.   It's more a problem of today era of Basketball where most stars coast cz they don't want to get injured. It's possibly a product of the constant increase of injury rate. Right now, even before covid, players are get injured way more (most likely because the speed is higher than ever and bodies are scientifically pushed to the limit) and superstars try to avoid that. Not only Kobe but every old stars were tryharding all season.   2nd 3 peat team was easily a super team and Rodman could have won FMVP in 1996.   Yes but bird and Magic super teams clashed so it kinds of evens out. LeBron clashed with a super team too in golden state. Indeed most goat type players played at one point in a super team. Jordan last dance, wilt Lakers, Russell Celtics, Magic showtime, Bird Celtics, LeBron return to Cavs, Kobe Shaq.   Not calling Kobe Shaq a super team is acceptable but creates lots of question about other perceived super teams : was LeBron Cavs a super team ? Was Kevin Love good enough to be called a star (he averaged 10 PTS in the finals which is less than ariza in 09). Was Showtime Lakers really a super team in 88? KAJ was 40 and averaging 14 PTS. There is far less super teams in NBA history of you count like that. Stars like Bosh, Love, old KAJ, old Pippen/Rodman are very close to role splayers at some points. In the end I think the super team idea is overrated, and that every player needs significant amount of help to win a championship cz it's a team sport. I consider Shaq in the first 3 peat Lakers a more valuable player than Kyrie and KLove combined in 16 for example.   Yes KAJ got robbed.   I dunno about the great big of the 90s but the 10s definitely. Thurmond would destroy most current big men and would be a better Rudy Gobert."
Even if the C: Russell was russell westbrook they wouldnt lose
"it’s the types of players   yes, T-Mac, KG, and Tim Duncan all would rather have hand checking than help defense. they are all bigger than the people guarding them! lol  T-Mac was primary ball handler that was 6’8 225 and faster and smoother than everyone else in the league, of course he wanted to blow by 6’5 guards with less help defense   7’0 KG was literally bringing the ball up the court and was crazy athletic and strong   7’0 TD with 7’5 Duncan and a bevy of post moves would rather get 1 on 1s with post moves than have doubles sent every play     what wouldn’t happen is steve nash just being able to run underneath the basket and reset the offense in route to 2 MVPs. and you couldn’t shoot like today. if you were allowed to have a hand on a guy, the pull-up jumper is much less effective. especially somebody like steph who dips the ball every time. look at T-Mac and Ray Allen’s jumper and how high they release the ball on top of their crazy elevation  curry would still be great, but odds are that he’s closer to mark price and russell westbrook is more of a kevin johnson. great players and all-nba caliber guys, but the giant and physical dudes would rule the league"
Kevin Love wouldn’t even start on the Lakers. He wouldn’t be a scapegoat. Any team over the last 7-10 years with Russell Westbrook has had a built in scapegoat for the media.
They’d be lucky to win 30 games. They swapped Russell Westbrook for fucking Dinwiddie. And you’re questioning if they got better? Only on r/nba bruh
Kemba probably doesn't count since he was with my team for 8 years. I'm going with Russell Westbrook or Luka Doncic
Dennis Smith Jr   Ja Morant   Russell Westbrook
"he emphasized spacing, a team shooting lower than they usually do in a fairly small sample size doesn’t mean they have bad spacing. spacing isn’t the only problem the lakers have tho. you mentioned the bucks and lakers as proof you don’t need good 3 point shooting but those teams both had amazing defense. the lakers are not gonna be that same defensive juggernaut losing KCP, Caruso, and Schroeder and replacing them with Westbrook, a couple of young, decent guards who can’t defend, and Melo. and we not even talking about AD’s health, lots of guys on the roster’s old age, and the fact that russell westbrook will likely be a nightmare for lakers fans come playoff time"

Ricky Rubio -&gt; Rajon Rondo -&gt; Gary Payton  John Wall -&gt; Derrick Rose -&gt; Russell Westbrook
"Ja Morant Zach Lavigne Russell Westbrook.  Ja maront is ahead of his time Lavine plays like young Westbrook, without the shooting. Current Westbrook is absolute shite but his playmaking is elite, he is transitioning into moredern Derrick Rose Territory."
Draymond Green Russell Westbrook Lebron James  I'd say Russ and Draymond are switchable depending on what you value more but the archetype is playmakers with spotty 3-pt shooting
"Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Lebron James"
"There’s two different types of athletes. There’s graceful speedy lankiness that has an almost  and then there’s just raw power driven by pure quick twitch kinetic energy. You can usually tell by how they dunk.   Ja Morant comes to mind as one of the former, you can add Derrick Rose to that category too. Then somebody like Russell Westbrook or John Wall is just pure power when it comes to dunking.   But the rarest thing is when you have that ability to almost glide in a big man. You usually only see it in guards or wings, but by god Jonathan Bender had that as a legitimate 7-footer."

"Jimmy Butler took the Wolves to the playoffs. Russell Westbrook took a rather dismal team to the 6th seed a few years back. Pretty sure Giannis, Harden, and KD could do it. Wouldn't be surprised to see Embiid and Jokic manage that.  KAT is a star, but he's never really been top 10 in the league. If this Wolves roster has any hope of the playoffs, it'll be Anthony Edwards as much as KAT."
Russell Westbrook is going to help your team get over the top.
"https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-vs-rudy-gobert-playoffs-head-to-head   I mean I’m just saying if that’s Russ being uncomfortable, I’ll gladly take it."
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
Russell Westbrook is better than Chris Paul.
"Very good response! I think another factor is just what happened most recently, as well as, as you alluded to, the way the general public feels about the players plays  a huge part. For instance, the nuggets getting *swept* wasn’t even worth a mention in an “embarrassing playoff losses” post. By the 76ers series we had basically had already forgotten about it.    Like, last year, Paul George was public enemy number 1 even before the playoffs, because a larger group of people hated him. Whereas russell Westbrook, sure he’s hated, but he has a large group of stans from okc and over the years who defend and love him, and thus his playoff failures aren’t as talked about as pg’s were. Pg not being able to get out of the first round was the talking point during the Dallas series, and he did play poorly for the first four games, but, he also popped off in a big way, and we beat Dallas by 50 points. Something that was completely forgotten about after the Denver series collapse.   Lastly, you mentioned big markets, but I don’t think we really care about that consistently, and it relates more to the fanbase. I think the clippers being in a big market while having a  smaller fan base made it so that we were easy to straw man. But that *also* happened when Miami beat you guys, because the haters just took over the narrative. Giannis can’t win a championship and isn’t a top 8 player and will never win” was a real topic of discussion up until he actually won the finals. That’s because haters control the narrative and then the larger public can point to any one idiot with the same flair as you “talking shit” to straw man the whole fanbase."

"At the end of the 2018-2019 season Stockton had more career assists than LeBron James and Russell Westbrook combined.

There's so many ways you can present his assist record that blow my mind everytime."
I'll always think of Oscar Robertson as Mr. Triple-double.  But we should really give that name to Russell Westbrook now.
Lakers Rockets 2020 playoffs. I think getting yelled at by Russell Westbrook could do me some good mentally and with no other fans I like my odds.

Is that the only arguement you have?  Russell Westbrook is the all time leader in triple doubles.  He averaged a triple double for 4 seasons and 3 straight seasons.  Something nobody believed a player could do in the modern era.
"Russell Westbrook  Washington/Houston: Usage 30-34, TS% 50-54  LA: Usage 10-12, TS% 80-90"
Russell Westbrook
I don’t see why it matters? I mean most contenders would rather have a Robert Covington than a Russell Westbrook. Who would you say is better?  Floor raising matters
"Russell Westbrook.   He’s really good.   Incredibly dynamic.   Fierce competitor.   Extremely athletic.   Durable considering his size and play style.   And yet… dude makes bad decisions at terrible times,  didn’t improve his shooting and thought he was better than KD."
"&gt; they feel like they have nothing to lose.   I guarantee you that Philly does not feel like they have nothing to lose where they can afford to just piss away the next couple years playing ""who can be more petty"" with one of their star players. Do you think Embiid would be on board with them screwing around during his prime like that? Philly has a lot to lose. They need to resolve this situation quickly before it becomes even more of a mess for them, and simply getting Ben Simmons in line is not their goal. They want to trade him and hopefully for pieces good enough to keep them in title contention.   We've seen other teams try to fight these battles of wills with disgruntled stars before and the teams always lose. Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, James Harden, etc. In the end the teams have more to lose and always give in. No team can stomach a disgruntled star player for very long, [no matter what they might say in the press.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30338326/sources-houston-rockets-willing-get-uncomfortable-james-harden-russell-westbrook?platform=amp)"
"Because Brooklyn’s big 3 has   Best SG in the league (even though he’s playing PG his playstyle isn’t drastically changed)  Arguable best SF in the league (people go back and forth between who’s better between KD and LeBron, both have a case)  Top 3 PG in the league  All of which are 3 level scorers  Lakers have  Best PF in the league  LeBron  Russell Westbrook, who can play like the best PG in the league or not even top 5  All of which have a scoring weakness. None of them can rain 3s all game and Russ barely has a mid range so that leaves you with a clogged paint.  Both teams have great role players so we’ll just exclude that"
russell wesbtook is an infinitely more skilled player than giannis LOL and westbrook cant shoot that well...this is hilarious..agree to disagree i guess
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis"
Ignoring the rules to make fun of Perkins.  “Russell Westbrook is a top 10 player in this league!”  “Pascal Siakam is a top 10 player in this league!”  “You don’t know basketball Max!”  Cue Max easily listing 10+ much better players.
"seriously it gets even better when you realise he's saying that out of Bill Russell, Gary Payton, Dennis Rodman, Sidney Moncrief, Ben Wallace, Hakeem Olujawon, Kareem and Scottie Pippen he thinks two or less of them actually played defense  I wonder if he thinks of them what Westbrook said about Pay Bev: ""Gary Patron trick y'all man he just running around doing nothing"""
KG. This is no disrespect to Wade as he was INSANE in his prime but KG would shut down your best big man AND your best guard on a swap assignment. Combine that with a Russell Westbrook attitude and a surprisingly great mind for passing; you just got yourself one of the best versatile threats this game has ever seen.
"Why was the kellerman iguodala take clowned on so much?   It’s not that crazy it’s not like he said he wanted Russell Westbrook, in fact iguodala has actually been extremely clutch, I remember he had some absolutely backbreaking threes against the rockets a few seasons back, and it’s not just the eye test, the stats say he is the best clutch player too."
Russell Westbrook is still on a horrible contract. Somehow each team that gets him is finding another team to bail them out. It’s actually hilarious
"That’s what everyone said with Chris Paul, then Russell Westbrook, now ...."
you really comparing Post ASG Russell Westbrook with Current John Wall?!
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"Yes, because it’s very clear that players who demand trades lose respect in the NBA player circle.   That’s why guys like:  James Harden, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Kawhii Leonard, Jimmy Butler, etc.  get no respect around the league. Oh wait, that’s not true at all? Weird."
You’re getting downvoted…but if Russell Westbrook wasn’t rich…

"&gt;And you don’t think Russell Westbrook is even “in the conversation”? He’s widely viewed as a top 10 point guard of all time, some say top 5. Russ is on this list for sure.  LOL what? Dude makes bad decisions non stop, can't shoot yet takes wild pullup 3s all the time and is below average on defense. No way he's a top10 pg all time. He's not even top5 among active pg(Steph, CP3, Lillard, Doncic, Kyrie/Harden)"
Like 15 current point guards &gt; Russell Westbrook
Embiid &gt; Jokic &amp; Luka  Russell &gt; Wilt  Westbrook &gt; Gobert
Rudy Gobert &gt; Russell Westbrook
I think the Cleveland championship did a lot for his legacy. He was never able to become the #1 on his team so that will be a ding. He’ll probably be remembered as better than tony parker but worse than Russell Westbrook. So a top 10-15 point guard all time.
Russell “Frank Ocean” Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and it would happen in Utah.
"Uhhhh this comment is wild.   Kawhi is 100% on this list. He’s a 2x FMVP and won a DPOY.   Dwight Howard won three DPOYs and was the consensus best center in the game for half a decade. He will be on this list.   And you don’t think Russell Westbrook is even “in the conversation”? He’s widely viewed as a top 10 point guard of all time, some say top 5. Russ is on this list for sure.   I think Carmelo Anthony makes it, but it’s fair to say he’s questionable. Davis I agree with you, could go either way."
"I have him at 12 but he’s a top 10 talent.  I’d argue only Wilt, Kareem, Jordan, and LeBron are definitely better than him as a talent.  He’s in the same category as Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, and Hakeem as a talent but doesn’t have the legacy those guys do.    As an aside, Russell is super underrated by people claiming he’s only be a Dennis Rodman / Draymond Green type of player but he isn’t the same talent as those guys above.  Russell has the better legacy because he was like Jordan and Kobe in his mentality and played team ball instead of superstar iso ball and was an athletic freak of nature like David Robinson, Magic Johnson, prime Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Julius Erving, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."

"I mean technically he has more playoff success than Wilt   Wilt's a divisive player though, depending on who you ask he's a guy who had much worse teammates than Russell for most of his career and should be a GOAT candidate because of his insane numbers, or he was a guy who statpadded at the expense of his team and was basically a 7 foot version of Westbrook  I've seen people have him at like #2 or 3 all time or not even in the top ten"
"I dont care one way or the other if Russell Westbrook wants to crossdress, but I have a suspicion that Russell doesn't think of it as a dress, but rather as another one of his novel fashion choices."
Who really cares what KWAME BROWN has to say ?!? Russell Westbrook is comfortable in his own masculinity that he can where whatever the fuck he wants without being scared of what the outside world thinks of him. I bet that's manlier than anything Kwame has done in his career
Russell Westbrook is so good that he has a career average of 50.8% TS in the playoffs

"*Lakers proceed to acquire Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard and DeAndre Jordan in the year of our lord 2021*"
"If we're talking NBA (or professional basketball in general) then broadly speaking yes:  Guards who are considered bad shooters generally still do okay in the mid range and from the FT line and will take open 3s if they have them. Think Rajon Rondo or Ricky Rubio. Or Russell Westbrook. I don't know a guard in the NBA who absolutely can't shoot at all. There are however a handful of wings in the league who are very poor shooters, most famously Ben Simmons.   In general shooting is **always** a plus, no matter the position. This used to be different, when nobody cared if their center could hit 3s, because a center wasn't supposed to be at the 3 point line a lot. The importance of shooting decreases with increasing height however. Guards need to shoot at least half decent, Wings better do so or they should be elite at something else and bigs can easily be non shooters if they provide something different on offense(vertical spacing for example) and/or are very good defenders.  If you're learning to play the game of basketball, shooting is definitely the skill you should work the most on. Regardless of position. After that it's other fundamentals (layup package with either hand, handles, footwork, defensive stances and lateral movement, passing)"
defenses: the way DeAndre Jordan can't do anything on offense help us to load up against LeBron James and Russell Westbrook from getting to the rim.
"Russell Westbrook, he had all the physical tools to be one of the greatest, clearly lack the humble to work on his weakness and caring too much about his stats and appearance.  There are also other more clear examples with mediocre players, like Ben Simmons et al."
"I mean, I'd think MJ would be no worse than Russell Westbrook at the 3, and Russ has led the league in scoring twice. And MJ would obviously be much much more efficient from 2-point range.  From roughly 89-93, MJ was about a low 30% 3-point shooter. I'm not using his much better 96-97 seasons as that was a shorter 3-point line.  So I mean I'd say his floor in this era would be low 30%-ish with ridiculous efficiency from 2-point range and would probably be the best in getting to the basket."
"Russell Westbrook because I can't believe that someone with his athletic gifts can be so dumb with his shot selection.      Ben Simmons because I can't believe that someone with his athletic gifts can be so Inconsistent with when he chooses to be assertive, since when he chooses to be he's dominant.      Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside because I can't believe how someone with his size and strength can be so brain dead defensively and so dumb with their shot selection on offence."
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"&gt;Yeah your stats are wrong. Where did you even get them from?   I got them from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g55qk2/playoff_lebron_and_playoff_jordans_statistical/) post cause like I said, I dont know how to look up specific stretches adjusted for pace by myself. I can see that I wrote 33 points instead of 36 for Lebron though, which doesn't move the needle much anyway but worth mentioning.   [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eo6yqi/oc_40_stars_playoff_scoring_peak_adjusted_for/) post has the same ppg for Jordan but during a 7 year stretch so that part seems to check out to me.  If those numbers are incorrect for their respective 5 year stretches in the playoffs, then could you provide the correct ones and where can I look for myself?   &gt;Gotta love how somebody can blatantly lie and get you downvoted because it's Michael Jordan lmao  Blatantly lie? You dont have to play some kind of a victim here. *I* didn't get you downvoted and definitely didn't lie either. Plus, its not like you provided any stats to counter, you just call them incorrect and accuse me of lying lol.   &gt;There was a gap between LeBron and everybody else in the original version and they deliberately altered the formula when they didn't like what they saw.  [This](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2020/02/introducing-bpm-2-0/) article explains BPM 2.0 and why they changed it. It was because of Russell Westbrook and his MVP season, not to put Jordan first lol. Lebron still ended up with the highest single season BPM, so doesn't really look like some evil attempt to inflate Jordans case. They saw it was flawed after Westbrooks triple doubles and adjusted it."
Prime Russell Westbrook was pretty close.
lol you have to understand the difference and are trolling right? Most points =/= best scorer.   So there have been times where you’ve thought Russell Westbrook is a better scorer than KD?
Russell Westbrook for sure

"Great comparisons. TPG:  * James Harden 3.7 * Pete Maravich 3.7 * Russell Westbrook 4.1  As I said in another comment: Maravich was a skilled and fearless passer, but not a great passer because great passing requires great judgment, which he wasn't his strong suit.  ETA: You also have to account for usage rate. Pete played significantly more minutes per game than those two. So that matters, too. Still... that's a lot of turnovers.  ETA2: Doncic has over 4 TPG, as well, and I think he lacks good judgment on some passing, as well. We'll see if he can grow in that area."
"He probably turned the ball over about as much as James Harden or Russell Westbrook based off of the two all star seasons we have from Maravich where the NBA recorded turnovers. His free throw rate wasn’t great, so his efficiency was only slightly above league average on the front end of his prime and below league average in the back half of his prime. As skilled as he was, I don’t think Maravich’s game was on the level of the guys that came before him like Jerry West or Oscar Robertson. They were much more efficient than he was because of their ability to finish in the paint and draw fouls. We don’t have lots of footage, but based on his free throw rate, I think Pistol Pete too much of a jump shooter in an era where you weren’t rewarded for that with an extra point."
"Expanding to two years would do wonders for Washington, since we’d get to add Michael Jordan and Moses Malone.   With just one year we’ve got:  - Russell Westbrook  - Mike Miller  - Paul Pierce  - Charles Oakley  - Dwight Howard  Bench: Isaiah Thomas, Mike Bibby, Trevor Ariza  Prime Westbrook+Pierce+Howard is nice, but yeah this team could really use Jordan and Malone to be contenders."
These kind of posts always remind me that I would go to war for Russell Westbrook.
"no, we have Russell Westbrook. Do you really think neither DJ or Dwight starts? We can all wish for it, sure. We literally did the same thing in 2020 yet JaVale started all year and only got benched by the WCF. I have no doubt DJ starts. JaVale, Drummond, DJ, it's what Vogel is gonna do"
"His team was far from terrible grant you, but playing next to Westbrook as your number 2 can prove to be difficult regarding his questionable shot selection and efficiency. That Thunder team in general during that series lacked spacing, André Roberson, Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, Randy Foye, all those dudes are poor shooters. Their only decent shooter aside from KD was Dion Waiters, yea Dion Waiters. Yes KD choked a 3-1 lead and joining the team that beat you is definitely subject to criticism but to say he was surrounded by talent is a bit too much credit imo. Of course letting Harden walk away was a big blow as well. The fact they had 3 future MVPs and blew it tells you how the Thunder organization ruined their championship hopes."
"Just a few you guys might be curious to see:  Paul George: 36/108(33.3%)  Damian Lillard: 20/61(32.8%)  The worst I've seen are Tracy MacGrady, who was around half(it's hard to tell because of his late career couple minute appearances, but it seems to be around 49-52%) and Allen Iverson(42/71, or 59%)  Among active players the worst is Russell Westbrook(52/111 = 46.8%)"

"They couldn't afford Harden and still had the pieces in place to win a title without him, which is why it is an irrelevant reference.   They could have won a title with KD with or without Harden. OKC would not have traded Durant because they had a chance of winning a title. It isn't a good comparison. When players who are not free agents keep on demanding to get traded to specific teams it is a problem for the league. Presti traded Paul George because he requested a trade to the Clippers because Kawhii reached out to him about it. He literally had to trade him to the Clippers or risk him bitching all year and Russell Westbrook murdering him on the court. It isn't healthy for the game.   Durant surprising everyone and signing with a team isn't worse than what too many tier 2 stars are doing in demanding to go to a specific spot.  Im not upset, I just think Rich Paul is a bit of a bitch and puts that mindset into the players who he works for."
Russell Westbrook
"“Here we pit LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook against Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Thompson.  Their best stars are roughly even. I’m willing to call that a wash”  they say this and still pick the Lakers to win, so are the Lakers big 3 better than the Warriors big 3 or not?"
"Their leadership ability was a direct contrast. Wilt isn’t in GOAT debates for what he did do, he’s in it for what he failed to do… because if he lived up to his potential, there’d be no debate.   Russell still managed to win more MVP’s than Wilt.   Russell dropped 30/40 in a finals game 7 (10-0 in game 7’s overall)… Wilt had only four finals games scoring at least 30 in thirty four appearances, despite that being his career average…  Russell held wilt to 22 points in a game 7 win the year Wilt averaged 50, while putting up 19/22 himself…   Wilt could have literally been Russell with slightly less video gamey stats but he chose to go full Westbrook instead until the twilight of his career, and it ultimately cost him. That is all"
"Russell Westbrook. Regardless of who he is beside he gets his assists and more times than not, they will win. He doesn’t need the off ball gravity because he passes well.  Steph Curry just finished praising Draymond for his playmaking while playing with him. It’s apparent from his lack in quantity of high assist games. Y’all love to praise his off ball gravity but it’s only effective if he has decent shooters to capitalize off. Look what happened this and last season without them. Practically useless."
"Trae Young did something last year that Russell Westbrook hasn't done since Kevin Durant left Oklahoma City in 2016, which is make a Conference Finals, he did that while averaging 29/3/9 on 55% TS.  &gt;  Harden is a SG, not a PG.  No he is not, he was listed as a PG last year and Kyrie Irving himself said that James was the point guard of the Nets, but who knows, maybe he just averaged 11 apg for fun.  &gt; Russ is a 9x all star and MVP  And that has zero value on how good of a player he is RIGHT NOW, he won an MVP in 2017, LeBron James played in Cleveland when that happened.  &gt; He is going to be completely in the MVP conversation this year, getting to play with Lebron and AD.  Damn, dude didn't even make an All-NBA team last year, but will be in the MVP convo this year just by changing uniforms, LA water is something else."
"&gt; Also James Harden is primarily a SG.  I guess Harden averaged 11 apg last year, was listed as a PG and was called the PG of the team by Kyrie Irving for fun.  Also, Trae Young and Luka Doncic aren't better than Russell Westbrook? The same Trae Young that led the Hawks to the ECF last year while averaging 29 and 9 and the same Luka that averaged 36 against Kawhi/PG?  Wow, what joining the Lakers does to people, Russ went from not even making All-NBA last year to being better than Luka freaking Doncic."
"Yeah, and the other two MVP candidates that year had all-time seasons, I think he had a better season than some of the recent MVPs (Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook to name a couple.)"
"""Don't take my point how I said my point!""    I don't care about WS I care about the fact that Russell was better at his thing than anyone ever while winning so much they named the most impressive NBA award after him. If the Era was so easy how come Wilt has 2 rings? He was drafted to a team with 3 hall of famers. Russell is so easily top 10 it's not even funny. It's like saying Westbrook is better than LeBron cause LeBron never averaged a triple double."
"If you think fixing a broken jumper requires only hard work, then why is every player not a 45% 3 point shooter? Are they all just lazy? Is Steph simply the hardest working shooter? Is there no physical talent required for anything in sports?   Your response is going to be ""not every player can be Steph, but every player can be average or near average""   Well, no, not every player can be average. Just like there are positive outliers, there are negative outliers. Do we think Nick Young was a good shooter because he worked hard? I mean obviously he put in some work, but he was literally known for being lazy. Lance Stephenson shot better from 3 than Russell Westbrook did. Westbrook is just lazy though right?  Or Kobe. I bet Kobe didn't work as hard as JR Smith. That's why JR Smith shoots way tf better than Kobe. And don't bring up tough shots either because JR was cash with a hand in his face.   Should I continue? Hard work doesn't mean shit. Quit imputing mental traits on physical ones. Good players aren't mentally tougher than bad players, they're just better at basketball.  Ben Simmons' jumper is physically broken. It's been that way the entire time."
"Russell Westbrook has a pretty good shot at it in a few years too. Already at 21.8k points, and 8061 assists. I expect his assists will be down playing with LeBron for the next two years, but he only needs to average 647 assists to break 10k within 3 years. If healthy, that's a safe bet."
"Russell Westbrook is a top, and a PG in NBA history."
&gt;he is probably the single worst good player in the league to put next to Zion  Russell Westbrook just joined the chat.
"russell westbrook was also a dpoy in college, i literally dont give a damn about past defensive ability because the NBA is the only one that matters and shit doesn’t translate all the time."
Some guy tried to say the other day that MJ would be like Russell Westbrook if he played today. 🤦🏻‍♂️
"That's not really fair to OKC.  They made the finals before letting Harden go.  Then they had some bad injury luck.   They went 60-22 the following season but got derailed in the infamous Patrick Beverly/Russell Westbrook collision which results in a meniscus tear for Westbrook.  https://youtu.be/nFPHntPCvEY  Then the following season, missing Westbrook for half of it, they finished 59-23 and made it to the WCF, falling in 6 to the 2014 Spurs. That Spurs team went 62-20 and beat LeBron's Heatles to win the championship that year.  [The next season more injury bad luck, Kevin Durant had a Jones fracture in his right foot which required surgery and caused him to miss most of the season.](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/04/17/oklahoma-city-thunder-kevin-durant-injuries) The Thunder ended the season w/a record of 45-37, missing the playoffs.   Hopefully everyone here knows how good OKC looked in 2016, where they made the playoffs and frankly probably should have closed out the 73 win Warriors in the Western Conference Finals but couldn't get it done.  This is how it often goes in the NBA. Really good teams, teams that could potentially win a title, have bad injury luck, run into all time teams, etc., that can mean they miss every getting that ring.   That OKC team was one of the best in the league when healthy with its own drafted core, that's a pretty rare thing. Seems shortsighted to try and call Presti overrated because you don't think they achieved enough."
"**Russell Westbrook**  If he gets a triple-double in a game that the Lakers lose, he should turn off his social media immediately"
"Maybe, but it would also mean that Paul George and Russell Westbrook probably wouldn’t be in LA.   Look at it like this, there are 6 max contract slots available in both LA and NY. The chances are that those 6 slots will be filled most years because it’s economically and socially better for NBA guys to be in a big market.   The more teams with market advantages, the worse it is for the rest of the NBA."
"2013-era Blake, Dwight, Paul Pierce, KD, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, LMA, Zeebo, Melo, Wade, Bosh, and Brook Lopez are all putting up big numbers in the 1980s. To suggest otherwise is a joke. Others like Garnett, Joe Johnson, and Steve Nash deserve on that list if you look at their entire body of work."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"You ever watch LeBron play? He and Russell Westbrook don't get the same calls most other stars do. They are used to playing through contact because they drive like freight trains, they wouldnt have any problems getting to the rim at will in the 90s."
"Russell Westbrook would be a top 5 player all time if he learned situational awareness and or adaptation. The guy has every skill and 10 years on his only weakness is between the ears.   And I can relate, I'm not smart enough either so I substitute with volume and no breaks just to be average. It's certainly endearing in the right context, but until the mental game clicks it doesn't matter."
A tall Russell Westbrook!? Year in year out wilt was one of if not the most efficient scorers of his generation lol
[His teams are 138-46 when he gets a triple double](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/win-loss-record-when-russell-westbrook-gets-a-triple-double) I wouldn’t call that empty stats  He’s undoubtedly struggled in several playoffs due to his lack of shooting but I recall in 2012 him being solid and 2017 he put up a 37 point triple double with Andre Roberson as his second leading scorer 2018 Russ put up 45+ in the last 2 games of the series.   I just don’t think it’s fair to call him empty calories. Imperfect? absolutely. Flawed? without a doubt. Overrated? No
"for real, he averaged 25 &amp; 8 on 45/33/86 shooting. It's not like he was going to jump up to 30 &amp; 10 on 50/40/90 if he stays healthy. I don't think there's any doubt he improves, but similar to Jason Kidd or Russell Westbrook they started to develop shooting and other skills but their athleticism like all athletes, peaked in their early 20s.   Since returning from his 2nd injury he's been a career 31% 3PT shooter, and OP's example of 41% from 3 this season is a 35 game sample size from New York where he shot 37/90 from 3. He shot 13/39 in Detroit and was a 38% shooter on the year. His next closes season was 37% and outside of those two years he's never shot over 34% from 3. Most years he was in the 28-30% range."
Russell Westbrook has become the most over rated player in the league  Ben Simmons has become the most under rated  All over the course of this offseason
"&gt;Wilt is just a tall Russell Westbrook I didn't forget him, I left him off on purpose. Come at me lol  I definitely think that if someone like Dwight Howard played in that era he would have had similar results. Freak athletes were just waaaaaay less common in that era."
"That's how I feel. Jordan's the GOAT. But there are arguments I wouldn't make fun of. Russell, Kareem, Oscar even LeBron-- I stopped laughing at that argument in 2016. I still think Larry and Magic are better than young people think too.    Wilt is just a tall Russell Westbrook I didn't forget him, I left him off on purpose. Come at me lol"
"* Kyrie would be greater all-time than AI if he could stay healthy.  * Jokic is on the same tier as KD, Lebron, Steph, etc right now.  * Walt Frazier &gt; Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, John Stockton, or Russell Westbrook all-time.  * I agree on the ""D-Rose should have never won MVP"" take, one of the weakest MVPs ever. Dwight or Lebron deserved it more.  * Harden should have two more MVPs, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019."
CP3 is overrated  and doesnt belong on any top 10 PG list if it isnt about the dirtiest players.  10 Point Guards i rate over CP3 on my top 10 PG list.  Magic  The big O  Isiah Thomas  Steph  John Stockton  Jason Kidd  Steve Nash  Russell Westbrook  Jerry West  Gary Payton
"Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gay, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard  Early 2010's cheat code, and then AD came not long after, with Ariza and Marc Gasol off the bench too."
idk cause now they don’t have lakers legend and FMVP russell westbrook…
Russell Westbrook TS: 50%   Draymond Green TS: 53%
"Notably bad point guard, …Russell Westbrook?"
Zion gone. Want Russell Westbrook for Zion?!?!?
"Russell Westbrook, reborn"
"Dwight Howard, Lebron James, and Russell Westbrook"
If Russell Westbrook has taught us anything it's that any contract can be traded.
I look forward to teams going under on the Russell Westbrook Dwight Howard pick and roll.
"having fun running transition against the greatest athlete in history, Russell Westbrook, and AD lmfao  Lakers are gonna be running transition with oops all game, not the other way around"
"Disagree. Jrue stinks. He shot under 33% in 4 out of the 6 games in the finals. He's overrated, overpaid, and they won despite of him not because of him. The Bucks could've traded for Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook last offseason when nobody wanted them and be a lot better off. Jrue was Anthony Davis' #2 for years in New Orleans and they never did shit. The difference is Giannis is on currently on a GOAT path while AD is always more like a glorified DeMarcus Cousins. The only chance small market team has a chance to win the championship is fluke into a generalizational GOAT-caliber player like LeBron or Giannis who can single-handedly beat super teams and win a ring. In those cases, #2 and #3 guys don't even have to be perennial all-stars. Overpaying for the likes of Jrue and Lonzo never ends well. Even if they do win a ring, it's often in spite of them not because of them."
This is going to be a Russell Westbrook type of toxic contract by 2023 at the latest.
"If that happens maybe they'll trade him, two first round picks and two swaps to the Lakers for Russell Westbrook."
"If Russell Westbrook can get traded 3 times with that contract, Bradley Beal can definitely get traded."
Russell Westbrook about to maul every single person who subscribed to this subreddit. R.I.P. OP.
Russell Westbrook is more injury prone than this sub admits. Feels like every season he's injured. This dude never missed a game before the Beverley incident.
"No, this video does not contain any footage from Rian Johnson’s 2005 mystery/noir film *Brick* - it’s LeBron James and Russell Westbrook"
" The Los Angeles Lakers will need to round out their roster following the agreed-upon trade for superstar Russell Westbrook.  It appears San Antonio Spurs forward Rudy Gay is leaning towards joining the Lakers.  “Gay is thought to be leaning toward the Los Angeles Lakers,” wrote Tony Jones of The Athletic"
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
I want Russell Westbrook to win a chip so bad
"I don't think the situation went down the way the story suggests it did, painting Kawhi as the only malacious party. Both guys from OKC left. It sounds like they were all exploring their options and Kawhi chose PG and Russ was cool with it. Russ went to Houston. I'm sure both had multiple places they were willing to be traded to if they didn't get their preferred destination.  This story makes it sound like Kawhi Leonard went and devised some diabolical plan to rob OKC of assets and leave Russell Westbrook stranded with no-name players for two years before the Lakers dealt him a trade.  Lazy reporting, imo."
Bayless is too much of a hack to even credit Shelburne for the [reporting](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31937985/how-two-phone-calls-two-years-apart-led-los-angeles-lakers-landing-russell-westbrook) that he's bloviating about.
"Skip, just letting you know  you can't say Russell Westbrook is a negative, and then 8 months later say there a superteam."
Russell Westbrook ~ Brussels Westbrook ~ Brussels Spout ~ Brussels Sprouts
Russell fucking Westbrook is a top 15 player in the league no matter how you slice it. Averaging a triple double means averaging over 10 assists. That's an elite playmaker.
"Presti had James Harden, Chris Paul, and Russell Westbrook during his tenure and didn’t even come close to winning a championship.     He couldn’t even build a roster this te year to get past the Hawks"
Are you seriously trying to spin Russell fucking Westbrook taking 7 threes per game as a positive? This level of cope is unprecedented
"Kawhi Leonard reportedly spurned Russell Westbrook in favor of Westbrook's then-Oklahoma City Thunder teammate Paul George before signing with the Los Angeles Clippers in 2019, according to [Ramona Shelburne](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31937985/how-two-phone-calls-two-years-apart-led-los-angeles-lakers-landing-russell-westbrook) of ESPN.  Per Shelburne, Westbrook initiated a conversation with Leonard about teaming up in Los Angeles, but Leonard responded by reaching out to George instead.  The Clippers eventually traded for George and signed Leonard as a free agent to create a top contender in the Western Conference. Westbrook was traded to the Houston Rockets later that offseason and has since moved to the Washington Wizards and [now](https://www.nba.com/news/wizards-russell-westbrook-traded-to-lakers) the Los Angeles Lakers.   "
"&gt;RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS many things as a basketball player -- aggressive, explosive, inefficient -- but most of all he is decisive . . . Westbrook had become a father of three the previous November  I like where this is going."
"But when they were in the bubble, a lot of things went their way, namely their role players were hitting threes. The Westbrook signs is a great move so long as they get threes. I'd rather pay Russell stupid money for a year or two than pay DeMar slightly below market value for 3 years.   If people haven't noticed, Rob has been signing everyone to 1 and 2 year deals the last few years; at worst they have a 47 million trade exception."
He’s been winning more with less than fucking Russell Westbrook lmao.
"Okay, I’ll rephrase.   He has nearly the same career 3 point percentage as Russell Westbrook. His effective FG percentage is a full 10 percentage points below league average.  I still don’t see how that equates to being a good shooter."
" Westbrook left OKC on good will. I am pretty sure all OKC fans would agree with that. Not sure how this makes him a rat mate. I thought it was common knowledge OKC was happy to let him go, see below from a simple Google search :-   ""With the Thunder wanting to rebuild and Westbrook wanting to contend, the team granted his wish and sent him to the Houston Rockets to play alongside former OKC teammate James Harden.""  www.cbssports.com/nba/news/russell-westbrook-gets-tribute-video-enormous-ovation-from-thunder-fans-in-return-to-oklahoma-city/ampq/"
"I get that, but surely there are other auxiliary playmaking options other than Russell fucking Westbrook"
"Yeah fuck that. When you trade for a 33 year old Russell Westbrook making 47 million dollars next year, you forfeit the right to be stingy and cheap.  I'll be furious if they miss out on re-signing Caruso just because they were trying to save pennies."

Russell Westbrook it’s not even close
"The issue is no team is would contend with him as their 3rd best player, so whoever that overpays him is just dooming themselves to perpetual mediocrity and cap hell the next 4-5 years. The worst place to be in the NBA is not good enough to contend, but not bad enough to tank. Mediocre also-ran teams constantly doom themselves to this never-ending vicious cycle with players like Lonzo due to ageism while real contenders buy low on legitimate superstars Chris Paul, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook. He's frankly not worth more than the MLE. If I were a bad team, I would much rather sign DeRozan to 1 year max to keep my long-term cap flexibility than wed myself to Lonzo long-term."
"Jimmy Butler, Mike Conley, Draymond Green even more, Kemba Walker, Russell Westbrook"
"This works because they’ll gain popularity simply by sitting on the Lakers bench which means more $$. And they get to live in LA, play with Lebron, AD, and Russell Westbrook, and don’t have to live in Canada!"
Difference between spacing and being a good 3 point shooting team. The Bucks had great spacing around Giannis all 4 guys were a threat outside the arc  Combine that for the 2016 Thunder when his starting backcourt was Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson? And Steven Adams as his starting center? Forget about it
Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K
"not a superteam. russ is gonna hold this team back and we're gonna collapse in the playoffs because of it. should've taken hield+KCP instead of going for russ. now the depth is gonna be horrendous, all for floor-spacer russell westbrook.  definitely not a superteam by any good definition of a superteam. the hield trade would've made the lakers way better but the same people would say ""nah that doesnt make the lakers a superteam."" if so then what the fuck is the purpose of the superteam label? lmfao"

"&gt; Book still has many years to make the finals again.  This is the point that Draymond was making. Thinking Books' got all the time in the world to make it back to the finals is a mistake. This literally could've been his only chance at a chip. If the 2012 OKC Thunder couldn't return to their second finals after making their first one boasting a roster with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka, all on rookie scale deals then no one really has many years to make the finals again."
"It is really funny seeing this post pop up right below the Davis/Westbrook post.   &gt;In 2017, Bleacher Report predicted that Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook would team up on the Lakers  Because I'm sure 2017 people would've posted 'delusional Laker fans' all over the comments on any posts regarding LeBron to the Lakers, or AD to the Lakers, or Westbrook to the Lakers."
lakers were the same seed as the celtics and got shit on in the first round too lol. brons declining and yall just traded what little depth and spacing you had for russell westbrook. and you're supposed to be a contender?
"&gt;I still think he'll be good on the Lakers but he could be godly if he'd just move without the damn ball (which he won't)  [This article about them agreeing LeBron would play at the 4 and AD at the 5, also included Russ playing off ball more as well.](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2021-07-29/lakers-acquire-russell-westbrook-wizards-trade-deal)  Idk how much I buy it b/c honestly he is who he is at this point, but at the same time Vogel's offense employs a lot of off-ball cuts to the basket."
"I guess opm would be a pg since he's 5'10"" or smt and i see him as a russell westbrook 10.0 with his insane strength and athleticism."
I do like how he plays so fearless but it's funny what attracts fans to different players.  I cannot stand Russell Westbrook.  He has no self awareness.  Dude can be 4-22 in a game and will still take a pullup 3 at the buzzer.
I fucking love [Russell Westbrook on A Farm by Lil Dicky](https://youtu.be/AOgBg2up7Jg)

russell westbrook is the most important player on the lakers 🥺
"Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant."
"Luol Deng, Kobe, Steve Nash, and Russell Westbrook"

"I saw Russell Westbrook at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh that’s alright, always great to meet a fan. ”I was taken aback at how humble he was, and all I could say was “wow” then he cut me off and said “Are you alright kid? I’m just a regular person like you. He even took the time to take a picture with me and signed my shoes. I walked away in awe and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him in line with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands.  The girl at the counter was very rude about it and unprofessional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” As if Russell was trying to steal them or something. At first he kept pretending not to hear her, but eventually he let it go and walked up to her politely.  She took one of the bars and then moved on to another, scanning all 15 Milky Ways individually. He stopped her and told her she could just scan one bar several times to save herself the extra work, and then turned around and winked at me. She replied back to him that she was going this “to prevent any electrical infetterence”. Me and Westbrook both informed her that isn’t even a real word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag Russ asked her what the total price was, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly. What a class act he is to deal with all that and not lose his temper."
It means Russell Westbrook sixthman of the year.
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.    People on this subreddit hate Russell Westbrook."
"Lakers absolutely will make the playoffs Its Russell westbrook one of the better regular season players of course they will make the playoffs, will they do good once they make it there now that is what the off season is for"
"If the team would improve by swapping out one of the guys that makes the team ""super"" for Buddy Hield, that isn't a superteam.   To be clear, I don't agree with that, but if your logic is that this team would be better served with Buddy Hield over Russell Westbrook, then you can't call this a superteam."
"This seems like a great idea, adding 2 career .350 3 point shooters, one of whom doesn't play defense and the other a frequently injured 36 year old PLUS a career .270 3 point shooter who  has a history of difficulties in big games to Russell Westbrook, a careeer .300 3 point shooter who plays hero ball and sticks to defensive schemes like oil sticks to teflon.  Lebron + 4 poor outside shooters + would be hilarious."
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/rockets-all-star-russell-westbrook-wants-out-of-houston-james-harden-remains-committed-to-team-per-report/  ""Westbrook has informed team officials that he has been uneasy about the team's accountability and culture, and wants to join a team where he can have a role similar to his prior, floor-general role in Oklahoma City."""
"And then, like the brilliant, well-ran team they were, they decided to blow everything up, and traded the man known as point god for Russell fucking Westbrook who was far past his prime."

"The Lakers will have to [pay $44.2M for Russ this year](http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries), which makes him the highest-paid Laker, tied for the 4th highest in the league. The [contract goes up to $47.1M next season](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/washington-wizards/russell-westbrook-6141/) \+ Lakers had to give 3 solid players...   for an almost 33yr old guard that shot 40/30/65 splits this season and had [by far the most turnovers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html#totals_stats::tov) in the NBA definitely isn't cheap."
"report/s suggest that the Wizards pivoted because of Westbrook being involved  Eric Pincus:  &gt; Over the past few weeks, the Lakers pursued Westbrook and Hield in parallel conversations with the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. As the draft neared, the Wizards seemed content to wait on big decisions with Beal and Westbrook.  &gt; That pushed Hield to the forefront. But even as the possibility of a deal built around Kyle Kuzma and Harrell began to form, the Lakers kept the door open to a Westbrook deal.  &gt; Westbrook asserted his voice into the conversation, and per an NBA source, the Wizards pivoted. Just like that, the pieces the Kings liked for Hield were no longer available.

"Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook spent nine and twelve seasons with OKC, respectively. Bradley Beal has spent his entire career with Washington and he still wants to play for that shithole team. Damian Lillard has played with Portland for a decade thus far. Anthony Davis spent seven seasons with the Pelicans before demanding out. This whole shit is overblown."
"The expectations people have for Russell Westbrook are now ""is he better than my rotation level point guard"". That's tuff"
"I didn’t mean the year after Kawhi left, I meant this year. Pascal couldn’t lead his team even close to the playoffs, while Westbrook helped bring his team to the 8 seed with a much worse roster than the Raptors. He also led a much, much worse team to the playoffs with the 2017 Thunder. They were a bum squad compared to Toronto.  You clearly are the one who has zero idea what they are talking about. Siakam is not better than Russell, you are delusional for thinking otherwise.  “Overrated playmaker” fucking insane. Put Siakam on the Wizards this year and they don’t sniff the playoffs.  Edit: and FYI, Westbrook getting rebounds and starting the break IS a scheme. You clearly don’t watch games."
"In no particular order and assuming that they keep the original 50.

I got the Lakers on July 22 for $215 at +600 Fanduel pay out $1505   Knew they were going to add significant pieces and drop to like 2-1 but I never imagined getting Russell Westbrook!!! I was thinking Hield and Patty Mills.   My other bet I am going to make if the Pelicans get Lowry....  Zion for MVP at great odds. Yep I can see the Pelicans making #4 seed this year if they add Lowry and I've got Zion taking the MVP

At least link to a real analysis like [this Ringer article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/7/30/22600993/russell-westbrook-trade-lakers-wizards-lebron-james). Pretty much anything is better the same tweet over and over again.
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
Old russell westbrook isn't charles barkley. wtf is this comment. Westbrook doesnt play defense and crumbles offensively in the playoffs.
"I can envision a much easier to defend P&amp;R because the opposing team doesn’t have to worry about the ball handler’s ability to shoot the ball.   Russell Westbrook was in the 21st percentile by PPP (0.71) as the P&amp;R ball handler during the regular season last year.  During the playoffs, he was even worse at 0.65 (11th percentile).   He’s a bit net-positive player at this point in his career."
It’s Russell Westbrook bro I think it’s still worth it
You think Russell “gambles for every steal” Westbrook is a good defender?
"Sorry my mistake, I confused two different articles, I was thinking of the [Sportsline projection model](https://www.sportsline.com/nba/news/lakers-2022-nba-title-odds-much-better-with-buddy-hield-instead-of-russell-westbrook-via-sportsline-projection-model/) which had their odds improving with Hield but dropping with Westbrook"
Have you watched Russell Westbrook play basketball at any point in the last three years?   None of what you outlined is scary. Any P&amp;R with Russ as the ball handler is not insane because he’s a terrible shooter and makes really poor decisions.
"The Lakers have LeBron, AD, Russ, a washed Marc Gasol, and a non-guaranteed Alfonso McKinnie on their roster currently. They basically only have the TPMLE and minimums to work with. We have no idea what their team D will look like, and Russell Westbrook will do nothing but hurt their team defense.   Their half-court offense can absolutely get worse."
"“he had a lower VORP than other all stars”... VORP was literally changed because Westbrook shattered the previous record. You’re using a statistic that was modified for the sole purpose of making a player look worse, to argue that that player isn’t good  Russell Westbrook’s 2016-17 season was so statistically insane that it caused Basketball Reference to change the formula for BPM and VORP. Before the changes, Westbrook had the highest single season value for both metrics.  https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2020/02/introducing-bpm-2-0/  &gt;	Why was BPM changed?  &gt;The simplest answer: Russell Westbrook. Westbrook’s 2016-17 MVP season graded out at 15.6 in the original BPM. Essentially, his 10.7 RPG and 10.4 APG broke the interaction terms between those statistics. So Westbrook’s great season ended up being 20% better than any other season in the database, which just didn’t pass the smell test.  Russell Westbrook used to have the highest single-season BPM ever (15.6). He was way ahead in first place after 2009 LeBron (13.0) and 1989 MJ (12.6). After the changes to the formula, he is out of the top ten.   2017 Westbrook also had the highest single-season VORP ever (12.4), edging out 1989 MJ (12.0). After the changes to the formula, he fell from first all the way to 22nd.  Russ literally broke the formulas for some advanced stats with how dominant he was. Analytics folks had to literally come up with a new formula because it didn’t “pass the smell test” how crazy good he was that year. And yet here you are, toting it as if it’s some valid metric to criticize Russ  And yes, I do watch him play. He was good on defense in the second half of the year for Houston. And even normally when he was below average on defense, the issue is not him being lazy on defense, it’s that he makes bad decisions, overhelps, gambles too much, etc. Sounds like you’re the one who doesn’t watch him play.   And btw - his turnover rate is not bad at all. He had a better AST/TO ratio than Luka, Trae, and others while averaging more assists than any of them. Using TOs in a vacuum to declare him an inefficient passer is like using career turnover totals or missed shot totals without context to call someone an inefficient scorer."
Westbrook literally did the same play earlier in the game and that play was completely legal [link](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/04/why-russell-westbrooks-injury-isnt-patrick-beverleys-fault)
"What i can think of right now...(this is just my opinion)  Overrated: Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe (I don't know why Clippers traded for him), Doc Rivers (I know it's about players but still...),  Underrated: CJ McCollum, TJ McConnell, Nikola Vucevic"
It’s Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook is better than Siakam, Sabonis, Vucevic, and Hayward. When was the last time that Westbrook did not make the playoffs? He even averaged a triple double and the Wizards made the playoffs."
Russell Westbrook.
"Alright now, let’s not act like Hardens been alone. You’re comparing his team to previous teams that have won the chip. This isn’t a Portland-Dame situation. He played with Russ and Durant in OKC, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook in Houston. The team in ‘18 was amazing in defensive versatility and had legit shooters. Compare the 18 team to the suns team that just went to the finals. Are you really taking younger cp3/ariza/tucker/capela over older cp3/ayton/crowder/bridges? I’m not saying harden isn’t a superstar.  But acting like he hasn’t choked in big moments and always come up a bit short is pretty naive.    Let’s go back one season to the ‘20 lakers. Davis/ old rondo/kuzma/kcp. Obviously Davis is better than cp3 but besides that the rockets had the better players. In the time harden was off the floor in Houston with cp3, cp3 was still playing really well. He made cp3 just a spot up shooter, and then ran the entire offense. Don’t just gloss over the mistakes that team made to lose. They had that chance, game 5, tied and Durant goes down. Proceed to the lose the game. Game 6, they are facing just the previous warriors team, not a super team, and harden choked hard in the last quarter. They could have taken that chance, proven they could win and go on to beat the trailblazers."
"There were probably 150 players more productive than Russell Westbrook last season and it's likely to be worse next year with the Lakers.  Given his salary, he's going to be one of the least valuable players in basketball.  He's a ball-hog who does nothing for you off the ball.  He's a poor shooter, his FT shooting has tanked, his assists are largely a function of him dominating the ball, and his rebounds are very often taken out of the hands of his teammates.  He's a living, breathing example of the idea of opportunity cost."
&gt;Rondo for a second back to the lakers might as well be a done deal  Not with Russ on the team. [Rondo and his brother would be banished to the hinterlands if Westbrook has something to say](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/9/12/21434545/rajon-rondo-brother-will-barbers-russell-westbrook-kicked-out-nba-playoffs-lakers)
Russell Westbrook &lt; Chris Paul when he wasn’t garbage
Russell Westbrook is out there celebrating and pumping his fist rn
"&gt; (just to give you an idea)  I also like how you didn't say you do watch Russ and rather tried to flip this around on me, the guy with the Russell Westbrook flair...  Anyway this conversation is going nowhere, but like I said, if you really think Russ is a net negative to a team you're a fool who doesn't actually watch him"
There are 14 point guards that I would rather have over Russell Westbrook.
"No, Russell Westbrook is the black Alex Caruso"
John Wall is a poor mans Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook and steph curry have won the mvp during hardens prime. You’re talking so hard out of your ass it’s insane
I have a few.  1. Jaylen Brown &gt;&gt;&gt; Jayson Tatum  2. Russell Westbrook &gt;&gt;&gt; Damian Lillard  3. I also think James Harden was the best player in the NBA from 2017-2019.
Russell Westbrook 20/21/20 on 35/22/67 splits (W though)  Steve Nash 48/5/5 with 9 turnovers
"russell westbrook was a lot better in game 6 against the jazz than his box score looks. the thunder didn’t lose because russ took 19 threes. russ took 19 threes because after an efficient first half from him, the team was down bad. the entire team was terrible outside of russ but paul george was especially bad, finishing 2-16 from the field and 1-2 from the free throw line. in the second half, russ gave up on the rest of the team and tried to bring back the team himself. 7/19 is a hell of a statline, but it’s 36.8%. slightly above league average 3 point shooting was better than what the team had generated on offense before but was unfortunately not enough to crawl out of the hole his teammates had dug."
Most starting PGs &gt; Russell Westbrook
"Only the third tallest on his team,[4] but called ""easily the No. 1 player in college basketball today"",[8] ""the best amateur basketball player in the United States"", and ""The White Oscar Robertson"" via Wikipedia   In modern terms does this make Alex Caruso the white Russell Westbrook?"
"Luka Doncic did DSJ very dirty by just been so fucking good. DSJ basically had identical rookie numbers to Russell Westbrook. Without Luka it would had taken Dallas years to see all the deficiencies of his game, he would had gotten a nice extension even without any improvement from his rookie numbers. Right now he is unsigned."
"It's entirely possible, although in most cases unlikely, to win either one of these titles without being a tremendous positive for your team. Not saying he wasn't a positive, but you might be forgiven for thinking that a scoring title makes you among the very best scorers in the sport, or that an assist title makes you a supremely unselfish player with elite court vision and IMO Russell Westbrook does not fit either of those definitions. And the ""meh"" results support my position I would say."
Winning matters if it didn't Russell Wilson would have multiple mvps but his biggest carry jobs the team missed the playoffs or were wildcards.  Outside of Westbrook basically every MVP is on a top 4 team usually top 2.
"I wonder, regardless of all the money he was able to make during his career, how does one deal with a failure in life such as his? I mean, on the one hand, you could look at it the Russell Westbrook way: just reaching such level (the highest) in your profession should be considered a success. On the other hand, you obviously aspired to much more, yet you just simply couldn't get it done.  How do you then adjust your mindset so that you don't completely fall apart? cuz dang personally I fucking suck at handling failure, and I've never had such an ambitious goal as making it to the NBA and actually being great at it."
PG is so stacked it's great. Here's all 30.   LAL - Westbrook   GSW - Curry   Kings - Fox   Suns - CP3   Houston - John Wall  Mavericks - Luka   Pelicans - Graham   Spurs - DeJounte Murray   Grizzlies - Morant   Portland - Dame   OKC - Shai   Nuggets - Murray   Jazz - Conley  Wolves - D’Angelo Russell  6ers - Simmons  Nets - Irving   Knicks - Rose   Celtics - Smart   Raptors - VanFleet  Bucks - Jrue   Pacers - Brogdon   Bulls - Ball   Cavs - Sexton   Pistons - Cade   Hawks - Trae   Heat - Lowry   Wizards - Dinwiddie   Hornets - LaMelo Ball   Magic - Fultz
"I always will recommend a few teams   Pistons: got the newest #1 draft pick and you get to watch a team go from being ass to getting somewhere good in time. Basically see a bad team go to being good  Lakers: arguably the greatest NBA franchise. It’s got the current face of the league in Bron there along with multiple superstar/all star players in Anthony Davis and former MVP and current triple double all time leader in Russell Westbrook   Nets: has the walking bucket in Kevin Durant, the guy with arguably the best handles in history in Kyrie Irving, and the guy who can do it all offensively in James Harden  Warriors: Steph Curry is just one of the most fun players to watch and the way they play offense is fun.  Portland trailblazers or Dallas Mavericks: you can watch Dame or Luka on their respective teams do a carry job as they drag their teammates to potential playoff births and defeat.  Feel like each of these teams offer variety and you can tell where they’re each at currently in their timelines. Lakers and Nets are in win now, pistons are looking to become good, Warriors are looking to return to form then Nlazers and Mavs are fun to watch but still a ways away since the teams management need to get their shit together."
&gt;	4 . Russell Westbrook - 7  https://i.imgur.com/gHKVsPr.jpg
I'm continually amazed at the shit that gets upvoted on this website. Russell Westbrook as the most underrated player in the NBA. lol.
"Russell Westbrook proves the haters wrong , averages 25/10/8 on above average efficiency with solid defense, Lakers win the chip"
"If you compare number of good players relative to teams in the league you can have a pretty insane Centrr position mid 60s : Wilt, Russell, Reed, Bellamy, Embry, Beaty, Thurmond, Lucas and probably others.   Also today's guard era with : Steph, Harden, Westbrook, Paul, Booker, Young, Doncic, LeBron James PG version, Lillard, Irving, Holiday, McCollum, Lowry, Butler, George etc..."
"Team 1:  Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis  Team 2:  Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, LeBron James, Nikola Jokic"
Has Russell Westbrook really fallen that far down that he's considered the same level as Pascal Siakam?  Also Klay Thompson is worse than both of them?
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
"I really dislike Rudy, but it's honestly close. I'd probably lean Howard but I think either choice is reasonable.  In Rudy's favor for me, I've rarely seen guards so clearly intimidated away from driving by a center. Watching Russell Westbrook be hesitant to drive on him in the playoffs was a pretty incredible testimaent to his impact."

"Easily Isiah Thomas. People think of him as a guy who was the best player on two championship teams, but that leaves out a lot. First of all those were the most well rounded teams ever, with 5 all star level players and a super solid bench. Secondly IT wasn’t even their best player in their finals runs. Dumars was the only one to make All-NBA in 89 or 90, won a FMVP, and was a way better defender and much more efficient.   Thomas wasn’t really good at anything besides passing. He scored a lot, but he only had 1 year in his career of even being average efficiency and wasn’t a 20 ppg scorer the years they actually won. He was also by far the worst defender on the team. He was basically a shitty version of Russell Westbrook that didn’t rebound. There’s probably 30 guards in nba history you could replace Thomas with on those teams and they still win."
Y'all are absolutely doing Russell Westbrook dirty. Every off season we start roasting the man lol.

As a comparison, historically shaky three pointers like Russell Westbrook and Ricky Rubio are guarded at around the same rate. """
"I don't think Allen Iverson has more raw athleticism than Russell Westbrook, or John Wall, or even Fox or Morant. They're bigger, they're faster, they're stronger, they jump higher. All of them. If you put those guys back in 1999, just off their athleticism alone I think they are in the exact same area as AI was assuming they stay healthy.   AI did have insane athletic advantages in 2001, but the difference is that the gap between AI and the league in 2000 is way larger than the gap between AI and the league in 2021. The advantages are significantly less dramatic. Damn near every guard and forward in the NBA can dunk a ball between their legs like it was a lay up. The list of people who could do that in AI's prime was very, very slim. I know that's a very specific example and doesn't encompass everything athleticism is, but I think the fact the league went from a dozen guys could do that to hundreds indicates the difference in athletic levels.   That also means that there are a lot more guys who have a much greater chance at keeping up with AI than back then, and the help defense is significantly quicker to react to him; and again, the schemes on both offense and defense would detract from AI's numbers. Not just in that no coach is going to let Someone play 43 minutes a game and shoot 28 times every game, but defenses are  pretty equipped to deal with volume shooting mid-range and driving guards.  I think AI could maybe become a top 15 player, maybe, but like I said it would take a massive overhaul of his game. He did win 4 scoring titles but you have to take into account it was at 42 minutes a night and shooting 25-30 times a game. Some of those scoring titles he shot under 40% for the season. That just isn't going to fly in the league today. I mean Russ is noticeably more efficient than AI and his poor shooting is the biggest gripe people have with him, imagine what would be said about AI.   I hope I'm not underrating his athleticism. He was one of my favorite players of all time and I've watched an egregious amount of his games post-retirement over the years as well. He is an athletic freak in his own right, I mean even being able to play that many minutes and put up that many shots every single night is an athletic feat, no matter if they go in or not. But in the league we have today you need to be beyond AI level athleticism for it to make the same impact.   LeBron, Zion, Giannis, that level. Even at the guard position think about the guards that succeed on a superstar level that don't have a great jump shot (read: 3pter). D. Rose did in the early 2010s (and the league shoots double the amount of 3s as it did during his MVP season), Westbrook has for his career, and maybe you could say Wall did before his injuries, but he wasn't a top 15 player. But all of those guys were significantly larger/stronger than AI and were able to play way, way, way above the rim. Because AI can't do that, it is going to make things significantly harder for him. He is not gonna draw 13fts a game nowadays.   The other PGs who 6'3"" and below who are/have been superstar level players are Dame, Steph, Kyrie, CP3, who are all generationally excellent shooters. Steph, Kyrie, and CP3 are also better dribblers and passers than AI. So at the very least AI would have to become an elite shooter to be in that top 15/MVP consideration. At least."
"U do realize most of those three point shots came off the bench, right? JR Smith/Steve Novak/Quentin Richardson (the three most attempted 3s on the team other than Melo) almost never shared the court with Melo, they didn't start. Did you watch the games??? Melo's best on court 3 pt shooter was Jason Kidd shooting 4 a game at 35%   Did you know that efficiency gets significantly boosted by:  -Being on the superteam Heat  -Playing with Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and a 42% three point shooter   Because he has Harden and Kyrie taking away shots, genius. Who the fuck is able to take shots for Melo? Iman Shumpert? 39 yr old Jason Kidd? Tyson Chandler posting up? Please enlighten me"
"KD is a better scorer than Kawhi and Melo and is maybe a top 3 scorer in NBA history  Also he had Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka (and starter Thabo Sefolosha shooting 42% from three)  Kawhi had SPACING. Siakam is a good second option and he had FVV, Ibaka, and Lowry, all of which can actually space the floor"
Jalen Green is either gonna be loved like Anthony Edwards or hated like Russell Westbrook. No inbetween.
He is a star padder who only cares about himself after all. He just does it in a more delicate way than Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook is the worst MVP of all time. People always blame his teammates but if you took him off last years Wizards and replaced him with any MVP who is still in the league (bar D Rose who famously got hurt) there's no way they would've missed the playoffs in the east.

Russell Westbrook is greater than Chris Paul
"Voter fatigue is one of the worst things in basketball. Just because you're sick of someone being good doesn't make them any less good. Russell Westbrook is a prime fucking example of this. Also, on the topic, just because a player's team is bad shouldn't disqualify them from MVP contention. It doesn't make their individual performance and stats any less impressive."
paul george better than russell westbrook
"That Russell Westbrook is the most overrated NBA MVP of all time and his triple double season was the culmination of the modern NBA becoming less about winning competitiveness and padding your stats as best you can.  His MVP year was a joke. He only averaged a triple double because he stopped guarding his man to chase rebounds. He went from a decent defender to being in the bottom 5 for defensive 3pt percentage that year. What that stat shows is that he guarded on ball then when his matchup passed he would hedge back to get a rebound, leaving his man open to shoot 3s.  It was terrible basketball that got rewarded with media attention and a legacy award that should have gone to Harden (as much as we all loathe him haha)"
"1. Steph Curry was won his last MVP, ring, and made his last finals appearance (as a key player)  2. Russell Westbrook will not end the season on the Lakers, experiment will be a disaster and they’ll trade him  3. Kobe is way closer in talent/impact to a D Wade / Harden than he is to Bron / MJ"
"Dame has no leverage except he’s given everything to this team and they should honor his wishes. When you’ve got either Russell Westbrook or Simmons, Maxey and 3 firsts, you’re taking the latter deal. No way he goes to the Lakers unless he starts threatening to retire, then even then the Blazers may call that bluff"
"sorry this is the internet and we're strangers, i genuinely didn't think anyone in this entire thread was being hostile at any point, including you and me lol  &gt; And Ja Morant is in a tier above Brogdon and Lonzo and definitely not average   if we say ""above average"" is the top-10 pgs, ""average"" is the 11-20 pgs, and ""below average"" is the 21-30 pgs, that would mean that Ja is a top-10 PG?  so better than three of:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  which three here would you take Ja over for a game today?  i'm not disagreeing or being hostile i'm genuinely curious."
"maybe because people don't understand how words work, but how many fans if they sat down and thought about it would say he's better than at least 4 guys on this list:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  Brogdon  Sexton  Lamelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Ja Morant  I think he is definitely worse than all of these guys, and he would need to be better than three of them to even be ""average""."

"Weird how Russell Westbrook is the ""worst MVP ever"" and a stat padder when he averaged 31/11/10 over a full season.   Meanwhile LeBron puts up similar numbers on MUCH WORSE efficiency (something like 38/31/69 splits) and he deserved FMVP while losing in 6."
"I am the Russell Westbrook of sleeping. Im a pretty amazing sleeper at any position except on my back, but I insist on sleeping on my back. I dont care if its sore the next day or I had a bad nights sleep, I sleep on my back and thats that."

"The Lakers won the NBA title in 1985, 1987, 1988 with Magic + Kareem it was a dynasty      But a 4 peat would have been an all time probably unbeatable accomplishment.      Hakeem Olajuwon beat them like cold blooded he straight up took out a superteam of Magic, Kareem and Worthy!!!      This would be like giannis beating the healthy Nets!!!!!      And yet despite accomplishing this, despite SWEEPING Shaq in the NBA Finals, despite being the only players in NBA history with DPOY, MVP and FMVP in one season, and despite having the MOST Quadruple doubles of all time......      SOMEHOW this man is ranked outside of most people top 10 lists and out of the expert/professional writers top 10 list.      How dare you?? Hakeem is #8 on my list ahead of Bird, Duncan, Kobe, Shaq + Oscar      Can someone explain how anyone has Oscar Robertson so high? He has 1 Ring and needed Kareem to get it. He is basically Russell Westbrook from old school all triple doubles and no rings till Kareem. And now Westbrook prob gets one with Bron + AD. But not a top 10 player not even close.      also Duncan won way more rings but with HOF players Robinson, Parker, Ginobili, Kawhi and a great coach in Pop. He is in my top 10 but no way over Hakeem. Hakeem would annihilate him given equal surrounding talent.      Hakeem win his ring in 94 without ANY help. His second best scorer was Vernon Maxwell at 13 ppg.      Please get Hakeem into the top 10 all time list!!!!"

"People seriously underrate Suggs’s athleticism. On r/NBADraft prior to the draft people were talking about how Suggs wasn’t athletic and how it was a weak suit and comparing him to Chauncey Billups. To me, Suggs is the opposite of Billups. He’s a transition guard who’s incredibly athletic, but needs to learn the control and patience of Billups to be an elite guard. I consider Suggs’s athleticism to be much closer to that of Russell Westbrook than on the opposite end of the spectrum which is Billups (of course many didn’t agree with me on that since I guess The Ringer decided to compare him to Billups and Roy).   Suggs literally did a 360 baby windmill and-one in HS which was one of the best HS dunks I’ve ever seen."
"Lets say Russell Westbrook in the summer of 2016, entering the peak of his powers, created a superteam like KD did…would he not have won a chip? Would Westbrook joy have a chip if he were in place of Curry in 2017 or 2018?   Westbrook is at the tail end of his prime, but if he shows up this year at his usual guady stat self and wins a chip….I’d put him up as a top 5 pg ever."

"So, let me get this straight. You're saying that the Wizards are in a better position to keep their star than the Blazers, because they lost Russell Westbrook in free agency and Beal hasn't dealt with years of disappointment, even though they've been the worse team."
Get both bands back together. Russell Westbrook for Kyrie Irving. Who says no? Aside from Lebron of course.
There is legitimately no argument whatsoever for putting Ja Morant a tier above Russell Westbrook. Morant has the same exact flaws and none of the overwhelming strengths that Westbrook possesses in his game other than athleticism.
Right! Just ask Russell Westbrook!
"This is true. His extension started at 16 while fellow draftees Russell Westbrook, Eric Gordon, and Kevin Love started at ~13 mil. Chances are Rose wasn't going to get to 16, because like you said he wasn't winning MVP (his max might have jumped up because of that, not sure) or making the all-star team. However, I still think they would have resigned him and figured it out later."
"Russell Westbrook was playing like a top 5 player for a 6 week period too...  Lebron simply wasn't a top 5 player last year. You can say it's because of injury, but it doesn't really matter. He still wasn't top 5 no matter what the reason."
"13: Curry :  Curry has never won with his athleticism. Even at age 33, he’ll still be the best shooter in the world and one of the NBA’s most electric players with the ball in his hands. I don’t see any way how Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, or even Russell Westbrook is going to pass him up over the next four years."
"2019 is probably be the goat offseason. 2016-18 were all pretty crazy too but 2019 was nuts  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   Kemba Walker   ALL switched teams, and more then a few of them were pretty unpredictable"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Ah, retrospect is fun. I particularly like the ""leveraging his position"" part.  Dennis Schroeder went from 84M/4 to 5.9M/1 and the Lakers ended up with....*checks notes*....Russell Westbrook.  Man, he sure showed them."
Russell Westbrook does not deserve to be in that tier
"As a Pistons fan, this was the scenario we faced when SVG traded for Reggie Jackson. He believed he was good enough to be a franchise point guard and so did our front office. He came off as cocky (and boy does Russell Westbrook still hate his fucking guts) but bet on himself to be more. Injuries and the general dysfunction of our team (hmm maybe we should let Andre Drummond shoot threes) derailed his trajectory.  The major difference is that other than his exuberance and swagger coming off as lack of drive, he showed actual potential to be something (on a better team with better players and coaching and front office) whereas Dennis has always been just an overrated asshole by all accounts.   The cool black German skateboarding point guard seemed like a fun character idea but they've run out of plots and he needs to be written off the show."
Russell Westbrook will surprise many this year with the Lakers. He will show that he is capable of playing alongside LeBron James and adapting to win the NBA title that is missing from his record.
"&gt; That kind of casual racism was ubiquitous during that time... its so out of place seeing it now.  I would agree that it was ubiquitous back then. Racism is much less acceptable in basketball from the league than it was back then. But it's definitely still persistent. For instance, remember when that Jazz fan compared Russell Westbrook to an enslaved person?"
"[Harden said it first, not me.](https://www.talkbasket.net/101465-james-harden-on-russell-westbrook-he-is-our-leader) Literally all I need to say lmao"
Russell Westbrook??? Lol
"And James Harden himself said [Russ was the leader of that team](https://www.talkbasket.net/101465-james-harden-on-russell-westbrook-he-is-our-leader). Kyrie, Tatum and Brown won against a terrible team, Russ and Harden won against a great team with Shai, CP3, and Dort."
Averaged a triple double 4 times in 5 seasons. Led Wizards to the playoffs. Just look [at what he had to do in May.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-stats-in-may-2021)
"Such a silly question.   BUT, Russell Westbrook is one of the best pure athletes in his era. Not just basketball. All sports.   Watching him in person when he is on is a spiritual experience which makes you question human beings ceilings as physical beings."
months later and they someone ended up replacing him with none other than Russell Westbrook …
Yeah he looks barely taller than CP3 and considerably shorter than Westbrook.

Obviously I hate the Lakers but how the hell am I supposed to root against Russell Westbrook.
"Russell Westbrook Kia Garden Grove Ca.  , buy a car from  a brother"
CP3 easily  &gt; The Lakers have traded for Russell Westbrook  Westbrook easily
Saying luxury tax shouldn't matter is easy to say when it isn't your money. And how do you know they didn't try to sign and trade Schroder? Another team has to agree to a deal with him that makes sense for a sign and trade. The Celtics got him at the MLE. No need for it.  My questions about the Lakers revolve around Russell Westbrook. The other stuff is standard procedure when you have 3 max players. They did good in that regard.
"&gt;e wasn’t exactly a positive asset), the gordon trade (he is younger, in his prime and has a year on his deal) is  These players will realize after its too late that those rings they sacrificed their fans for will be mostly meaningless down the road. Russell Westbrook will always be loved in OKC. Kevin Durant, not so much. I'm sure they will attempt to retire KDs jersey in OKC some day, but it will be mostly boos. That's on him."

"I don't understand how someone can be talking about Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and end their argument with ""When is he going to get the respect he deserves as an all time great?""  Disconnected from reality."
Russell Westbrook shooting 35% from 3 on 7 attempts in 2016-17
"No he wasn’t. Russell almost cost the rockets the series versus the thunder. The lakers were able to send so much pressure to harden because Westbrook was on the court. He was a net negative in my opinion on the court when he didn’t isolate. He had no gravity and was a black hole on offense when the ball wasn’t in his hands. Sure Lebron messed up the rockets, but Lebron will mess up every team. Lebron didn’t massively destroy the rockets like how he destroyed the Celtics in 2018, he just did enough."

A quick google search will bring up quite a bit.  &amp;#x200B;  Russ was a better than 80% shooter prior to the rule change.  Now that he can't take forever and do a full ritual before shooting he's not good.  It was an issue prior to his stint in Houston, and Rockets fans were very worried prior to the trade that he would struggle.  It came up during the playoff in the bubble where Russ shot a crisp .42/.24/.53, to post his career low TS% for a playoff run."
"James Harden this season, James Harden in 2016, and Russell Westbrook this season"
"In 2017 Russell’s GOAT tier box scores did contribute to winning. The Thunder were 33-9 that year in games when Russell had a triple doubles and in 2018, the Thunder were 20-5 when he got a triple double.  Regardless of Westbrook’s drop in meaningful contribution and efficiency since 2017, the Thunder did much better back then when Westbrook got triple doubles"
Happy Russell Westbrook Day
"Sixers fan here, I just came to say how much I love Jayson Tatum  Hi, I’m new to basketball, why should I root for your team.  Oh, that’s a nice bit of well researched anecdotal evidence against my opinion, welp, in response to that all I have to say is fuck you I’m right  Yes Russell Westbrook is the best player in the league thank you very much for not asking  Hey how do you rank this list of 28 players that all play different positions and roles"
"We are talking about basketball, a team sport. Russell Westbrook is a basketball player who isn’t good at basketball this season despite him averaging a triple double."
"So, is montenegro like NZ with Steven Adams? I remember going there and seeing a newspaper which said something like Adams gets 5/13/3 to lead OKC to the win, helped by Russell Westbrook 20/18/11 game"
"Because when superstars go public with their demands for a trade, the team makes it happen   See Kyrie Irving 2017, Anthony Davis 2019, Paul George 2019, Russell Westbrook 2019/2020, James Harden 2020..."
"Russ should start averaging 15 rebounds per game and make Bill Russell look as irrelevant as he made Oscar look. Then he’ll make Stockton look like Ish Smith. Destroyer of legends, that Westbrook."
"The list I was replying to of potential replacement guys had Lebron, KD and Steph, all of whom have rings (though some of those rings are less prestigious).  I wouldn't put those other new guys with zero rings currently above guys with multiple rings in the past, so I wouldn't move Giannis/Luka/Zion/Harden above the multi-championship legends at all.  But if we get to comparing guys who all have 0 rings (or who have the same number of rings) then I think we have to look at other criteria, which in some cases become different in their prestige over time. Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double in multiple seasons now so Oscar's stat might look less impressive, and another guy with 1 ring might be worth putting above him. Likewise, it's looking like Karl Malone might be replaced as the league's all-time leading scorer, in which case he would probably go down the list, and so on."
"You might have a point if this was a fantasy basketball subreddit, but it isn’t.  Russell Westbrook is a basketball player, and people are going to judge him by how good he is at basketball. People are not being “too hard on him” for not caring about his triple double on an awful team he is not helping get better. Nor is it “sad” that there exist role players some people praise for having found ways to help their team win more often that don’t involve collecting tons of box score stats."
Bruh what everybody roasts Harden for being a playoff choker. But he's just objectively much better at basketball than Russell Westbrook

Russell Westbrook
Remember when Russell Westbrook outplayed Kevin Durant in the 2016 playoffs.
Russell Westbrook 😂
Russell Westbrook is the least valuable player in the NBA with his contract and the only competition he has  there is from that fraudulent turd in Minnesota by the name D’angelo Russell.
"The difference is Murray is averaging 21/5/4 on 47/41/86 coming off a legendary playoff run. And if I if you’ve noticed but yes because he’s on a successful team he will be considered better with the more success they have. That’s literally how we judge players every season. Russell Westbrook goes on deep playoff runs with KD, he’s the best PG in the league, Then KD leaves and Westbrook doesn’t have playoff success and his reputation takes a hit and his place amongst the other point guards. Harden literally has a 50 game stretch of 40/7/7 in 2018-19, but he’s just considered of choker. Goes to Brooklyn and averages 25/8/11 and now he’s the best player in the league and MVP again. Come on now you know how this goes.   What’s the difference between KD, Giannis, Kahwi, Jokic, and Embid? KD has two rings so he’s consisted the automatic 2nd best or bedt player in the league when as a first option he didn’t make the Finals once after Harden left."
I never said he shouldn't win it. I'm just saying that's what happens after someone already has an MVP award. Russell Westbrook literally only won the MVP because he averaged a triple double. Well guess what he also averaged a triple double for the two seasons after that and didn't win MVP. Did averaging a triple double suddenly not matter anymore or did they just want to give it to someone else?
"Maybe early to mid 90s MJ. Kobe never played like 80s MJ, which was when he was at his most explosive. Kinda like a Russell Westbrook with better body control and touch around the basket."
"True but lebron was dealt with a waste of 7 years in Cleveland. He did not have a star in Russell Westbrook his whole tenure.   The best player lebron had during his 7 year run was...Carlos boozer who they stupidly didn’t keep as a restricted free agent and they lost for nothing to Utah.  Those Cavs teams were actually pretty terrible besides Big Z who began to age as lebron ascended and a very undersized Mo Williams.  Let’s see 38 year old washed up shaq, Varejao, washed up Antawn Jamison, Jamario moon, an old Larry Hughes, washed up Ben Wallace for one season, mediocre delante west, below average Daniel Gibson. Decent at best drew golden.  The Cavs management wasted ages 18 to 25 of lebrons career."
"They made finished 9th last season with Wall missing the whole season, traded him for Russell Westbrook, and have the worst record in the league. I'd say that qualifies for most disappointing team."
Russell Westbrook to the Celtics
Offensively yeah. You can see Russell scoring less trying to assist brad in scoring more. An interesting stat id like to see is how many touches Westbrook hands to Beal.
"I love Russell Westbrook so much  If we get a top 5 pick this year, they should put up a statue of him outside Scotiabank Arena"
"&gt; and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%  My claim above is that this is due to a greater percentage of free throws being shot by perimeter players.  The increase in FT shooting accuracy occurs precisely as league-wide 3PA skyrockets starting in 2016-2017 after Curry makes 400 3s in a season on the best team offense in league history.  It is certainly not driven by a handful of low volume big men like Drummond or Jordan figuring out how to shoot FT at a somewhat serviceable level.  And for every Drummond or Jordan there are plenty of players like Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, Giannis Anteteokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, even Russell Westbrook or LeBron James, who are marginal-to-bad free throw shooters but don't appear to have gotten any of the benefits of 'modern coaching'.  It's certainly possible that Shaq might have taken that coaching and benefitted from it -- shooting FT at 75% would have easily made him the greatest peak player in league history -- but it's far from a given.  &gt; There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left   There was only one in Shaq's era as well -- Shaq!  [In the year he won MVP there was only 1 other sub 60% FT shooter in the top 100 players by FT attempts -- Jason Caffey at 59%.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FTA&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=1999-00&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)"
He's like the Russell Westbrook of triples
"Houston Rockets really traded Russell Westbrook and James Harden for...... John wall, kelly Onlyfans, and 5 draft picks. Pathetic."
"&gt;	I don't think Russ was a top 5 player at any point before KD left. Top 5 athleticism &amp; fire but in terms of court value, advanced stats etc there were always more than 4 better guys out there  Which advanced stats? Why did Popovich openly say the Spurs game plan was for Russell Westbrook? Why did Spo said they gameplanned for Harden? Oh right, because the offense tanks without either of them.    The Russ slander pre 2017 is hilarious as most of OKC’s post season failures were due to Durant, not Russ. Especially when you realize Durant’s efficiency took a larger dip than the inefficient guard in WB. Russ in OKC was an elite playmaker and was the best player on that 2016 team.   Why does Russ get crucified for OKC’s post season failures?"

"Allen Iverson by far. He took his team to finals on his own. Westbrook had Durant, Harden, Green, Ibaka, Perkins? Etc. Couldn't win crap. Irving has had one good year where he won with LeBron. Cousy won 7 with Russell.  Allen Iverson was awesome. He is crazy, but remember how abused he was. Arrested for breaking into a house he owned and villified for it."
Lol what? Russell Westbrook easily takes that Sixers team to the Finals. The only impressive part of that run was beating the Lakers in Game 1 of the Finals.
Russell Westbrook anyone? Just shocked he hasn’t been mentioned yet!
"Sacramento and Minnesota? They have literally wasted years and years of draft picks! Sacramento is finally starting to have a semblance of something with Fox and Haliburton, but even Minnasota missed on Lamelo and that was last draft! They are not even in the same ball park as OKC in terms of talent development and super star status. Which teams has had James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George come through in the past decade?   The whole argument of most picks will be mid to late firsts isn't even a thing! They literally could get the 5th overall pick this year! Heck the heat aren't doing too hot right now and could be in the lottery. You think the clippers pick will be in the playoffs next year if Kawhi ditched them this summer? What about in 2026 when Kahwi and PG will be in the latter years of their contracts? Not to mention the fact that Houston's picks for the Westbrook trade don't just end this year. Sure you have the Phionex, Philly and Nuggets protected picks in there, but guess what those picks can be used to leverage trades, get role players, etc. OKC has more flexibility than any team in the league, and they don't have to mortage their future on the present like the nets and clipper have done.   Sure they will have stars come and go and want out at some points, maybe even SGA (he did play in LA afterall) but if that's the case Sam Presti learned his lesson with KD walking for nothing. They either sign the extension or get traded. Presti has proven more than capable of retooling on the fly and drafting well.   Also, OKC was close to making the play in until SGA and Horford went out of the line ups and we started losing a lot, so I'm sure if you add a top 10 pick in there next year they can be right back in the midst of the battle.   Haters just hate because they haven't had as much success as OKC has had since they have been a franchise. I get it they never won a title, but hey 2013, 14 and 15 they were one of the top teams, but they had injuries and 16 they had bad luck. Had everything gone perfect they would've won in 2014."
There are players who are good defenders but they just never exert their effort on that side until like late game situations or when their offense is not going like Russell Westbrook in his prime man was a top 10 defender in the league but only did in late games cause he had such a heavy offensive load   Kawhi it’s well known with him   Joel Embiid yea he’s playing like it this year but years before he didn’t exert that much energy in it   Lebron pretty well known   There’s just a lot of elite defensive players who only get called good defenders or above average but they just don’t try cause of there offensive load
"&gt;Not Russell Westbrook, who has consistently been one of the least efficient scorers in the entire NBA   Russ wasn’t “one of the least efficient scorers” when he played with KD. Prime Russ had a league average TS% until late 2017."
"I mean thats what everyone should value. Great defensive players, great highly efficiency scorers, and shooters. Not Russell Westbrook, who has consistently been one of the least efficient scorers in the entire NBA and has been bad defensively his whole professional career.   Fun fact, the Wizards offense is actually worse when Westbrook is on the floor."
The fact that you could be talking about Draymond Green or Russell Westbrook shows just how insanely OP KDs teams have been throughout his career.
&gt;Russell Westbrook-Triple-Doubles **and 10+ assists per game**
"Lmao fr  It's easy for people to look at names on the sheet and day that OKC had a better supporting cast but that ignores two things.  1. The fit (the team was built around Russ and KD, not just Russ) 2. How good these players were at the time (Sabonis was a rookie, Oladipo's shooting was not great etc)  When Russell Westbrook sat, the team was the worst team in the league by a margin. In the playoffs, with Russ on the floor he had a +15. When he wasn't on the floor it was a -58."
" Being able to do it at that volume while being relatively efficient is part of what makes it impressive.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/   Westbrook’s crunch-time numbers this season are comical. We’ll define “crunch time” here as the last five minutes of a game (or overtime) in which neither team has a lead greater than five points. In those situations, Westbrook has been unstoppable. His already absurd usage percentage jumps from “just” 41.7 to 62.3. (Sixty-two point three!!!)  Something else interesting happens to Westbrook during crunch time: As his usage goes up, so does his efficiency. His true shooting percentage creeps up to 56.9, and his assist percentage goes to 58.3. While he’s on the court in crunch time, the Thunder is outscoring opponents by 21.7 points per 100 possessions (up from +12.5 overall). In fact, Westbrook’s work rate late in games is so prolific that he produces as much value as entire teams. No, really.  We know this thanks to a little-noticed stat on the NBA’s stats site called Player Impact Estimate, or PIE. PIE is the share of all box score activity in a game (so points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) with deductions for negative stats (turnovers, missed shots, personal fouls). The average for a player should be about 103, and the average for a team about 50.4 It’s an especially useful stat when used in tandem with net rating, because you can then see both how well a player is doing individually (the PIE rating) as well as how well the team is performing overall (the net rating).  Anyway, Westbrook’s PIE in crunch time is 40.3, meaning he accounts for about 40 percent of both teams’ combined activity all on his own — a greater share of game stats in his clutch minutes than five teams6 collect as a whole. The Thunder as a team has a 61.4 PIE in crunch time, fourth in the league, which tracks more or less with its 19.9 net rating, which ranks second overall.  https://i.imgur.com/rWpENJB.png"
"Oh yeah, he's still Russell Westbrook isn't he, the way everyone was talking about him made me completely forget he's a superstar."
"The Thunder squad during his MVP season was not a very good team, and it was an especially bad match for a Russell Westbrook led team."
"If you’re blowing your team up and giving up a top 10 player along with Russell Westbrook, why in the fuck are you looking for fit?   You obviously look for the most talented return. You know what’s not a good return? Victor Oladipo, and the other garbage they got.    I can’t believe I even have to have this conversation. You’re gonna get draft picks down the line so you can hopefully get a player as good as Ben Simmons? He’s a top 10 player under 25 and is likely going to win DPOY this year. Literally his only knock is that he can’t shoot. It’s not about competing in the next 4 years, it’s about building a foundation. Actively tanking does not work with the new lottery rules. Don’t you think OKC could trade SGA for more draft capital if they could? The reality is that Ben Simmons is a known quantity who is the 2nd best player on a #1 seeded team."

"&gt; on court, and they play like the league's worst team when Shai is not on court.   If you place so much value in on/off stats. Look up the on off of players like Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Giannis, Embiid, Nash during Suns run, Jokic, Chris Paul most years then look up on the On/off of Luka. It is comparable to a good role player which is crazy because as such a ball dominant player, he should have a huge statistical impact. I don't care how little someone values on/off, you have to be surprised that someone who has the reputation of carrying their team has pretty mediocre on/off by superstar standards even this year which is his best year.  &gt;It's not like Dallas suddenly has any offense when Doncić is out  People made a big deal that Dallas was the best offense of all time last year. This wasn't fair because for a while now every year, offenses have been getting better and better and that number 1 offense last year wouldn't even be a top 5 offense this year. What was also ignored is that even without Luka on the court the Mavs still had a top 10 offense in the league (and a better defense). Check out how bad the Trailblazers offense was without Lillard or Hawks offense without Trae Young. This year the mavs have the best scoring duo on the bench but losing Seth Curry, and with the injuries they haven't been quite as good as last year (but still overall a net positive).   &gt;if we assume Westbrook can score.  Don't have to assume, he is a scorer.   &gt;When the player in question is shooting 10 percentage points lower than most other high-usage players and 6 percentage points lower than league's average than this ""impact"" is another story in my opinion  I compared the impact of SGA and Jamal Murray to Luka, not playstyle. I compared Russell Westbrook for playstyle. Barring injuries, if you replaced Jamal Murray with Luka this year, I think they will lose less games then the amount you add by replacing Luka with Lebron James."
"&gt; Luka is compared to them because he is a one-man force  Should be compared to other 1 man forces who are inconsistent with defense, and don't shoot from range at a super high clip like Russell Westbrook instead then.   &gt;He takes 35% of Dallas shots, mostly more or less ""self-created"" (while he leads the league in unassisted shots btw), and assists 43%  Ya because he has the ball in his hand a ton. If another star comes on this team who needs the ball in his hands, he will be less valuable.   &gt;also can be easily argued to be the best unassisted scorer  So many of his points are unassisted because he doesn't let other people get the ball to pass and playmake.   &gt;I dunno I cannot look at the description above and see where it becomes comparable to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.  SGA is shooting more efficiently and has way better defense. (Luka defense is ""improved this year trust me guys"" just like Kanter's is every year). I wasn't comparing playstyles as much as I was comparing impact on team."
"I disagree, imo we should be more balanced with them. You have people who mock others for using the eye test and say ""Stats are objective, only use the box score to debate"" (I literally saw this a few hours ago) and you have people who dismiss stats and go overly heavily on the eye test. (I saw this as an example earlier too.) Perfect example is Russell Westbrook. It feels like everybody here has an extreme opinion on him. He's either insane because of the eye test or trash due to the box score (efficiency.)"
Can I get a sober analysis of where Russell Westbrook ranks all time now? Forever my GOAT :'(
"He never sucked at any point duing the year. He took a back seat to Bradley Beal when it came to scoring (which is hilarious considering all the people that call him a stats chaser) but he has averaged a triple double the whole year. Beal has been sub-par or injured since March and Russell stepped up to fill his shoes so his stat line has gone up, but he's been playing well the whole season.  The people who were already hating on Westbrook decided that since the Wizards didn't immediately become a winning team on day one it meant he wasn't a good player, which is wrong for a number of reasons, and that's why he didn't make the All-Star team."

The reports of the death of Russell “GOAT” Westbrook have been greatly exaggerated
Case in point: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/
Russell Westbrook sneezed this morning..... upvote.
The Wizards would be better if Russell Westbrook was as good as people are trying to suggest he is here
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"It was a year or two ago when I officially added Westbrook to my ""Just gotta watch and enjoy this player. Not sure when, if ever, we will ever see another player do what he's doing"" list.  I read through the NBA Reference list and saw there have only been 240 players with a triple-double (TD) ever recorded. And of those 240 players, only 178 players have had more than two TDs. 121 players with five or more. Only 61 players have recorded 10 or more triple doubles.   28 players with at least 20 TDs. Only 15 with 30 or more TDs. Assuming you have all your digits, you can use your fingers to count how many player have at least 40 trip dubs. That's just crazy. I know reaching double figures in at least three categories is not an every day occurrence, but I do see or read about them enough that I did not realize just how rare they are.   Four players in the recorded history of the league has amassed at least 100 TDs (though Bron is at 99, so he could be the fifth player to hit the century mark by the end of this season.  Just how crazy is RW's 170 triple doubles? His count of 170 is exactly the same as the sum total of TDs in the careers of MJ, Baylor, Kareem, Kobe, Barkley, Bill Russell, CP3, Pippen, Melo and Kawhi."
"They are paying Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, BY FAR their best players, 70 million dollars for the next two years and you want them to focus on player development of a player that most likely will be just a decent starter in the future?  In case you haven't noticed, the Wizards aren't rebuilding, they are bad because they have zero good shooters aside from Davis Bertans, because they have one of the worst coaches in the league and because they can't stop anyone, they aren't bad on purpose and building young talent isn't their priority when they have two All-Stars on their payroll.  The Wizards are STARTING five players that shoot below 33% from 3 and they can't guard a parking car, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know why they are 22-33. Russ and Beal are the least of their problems, if they didn't have one or the other they might've won less than 10 games this year."
"People don't understand that while TS% indeed does matter, it's only ONE stat among a billion other things that a player can do well on the court and be great. Is Russell Westbrook an inefficient scorer? Yes, but he also has a 61-win pace everytime he posts a triple double, is a great playmaker on offense (five of the last six years averaging 10+ assists) and everyone talks about how great of a leader he is.  Saying that Russ isn't great because of his TS% is like saying that AI wasn't great because of his TS%, you are literally ignoring every single aspect of basketball and only focusing on scoring efficiency.  If TS% was the only thing that mattered, Joe Ingles and Rudy Gobert would be the best duo in the league with their sky high efficiency, heck Zion Williamson and his 65% TS makes him better than LeBron ofc."
Too bad Russell Westbrook doesn’t.

Saying Bradley Beal is better than Russell Westbrook in 2020-2021 is in no way “hate”

You forgot the fact that the Wizards have Russell Westbrook and the Nets have Kevin Durant. Quantum Mechanics suggest a Russ Buzzer Beater in game 7 will settle the series.
Oh you mean he made the top of the Russell Westbrook list lmao he’s on here 4 times. Brody is the man.  Jokic is having one hell of a season
A focused Russell Westbrook is a scary sight. Washington has a chance to make the play-in if he keeps up this level of play especially in the East.
HAPPY RUSSELL WESTBROOK DAY
All I would say is that Russell Westbrook has a stronger case for All-NBA than Beal. Beal is having an extremely weak season when you look beyond his raw point totals and he doesn’t scare teams. If Beal was 2nd in PPG nobody would talk about his All-NBA case and there is honestly a negligible gap at this point in PPG between Beal and Steph.
"What's even more amazing is that he has only 4 TO in this game, which is less than his average TO in this season. Russell Westbrook is doing great in this game."
Russell westbrook sucks at the beginning of the season gets really good for a stretch and gets back to sucking in the playoffs
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going.

"Last time it happened was 2017, with Russell Westbrook. Sure it's uncommon, but it's not *that* rare."
My favorite players to watch are the ones that have fun like luka and Steph and the ones who play with pure passion like Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook hasn't been fined yet
"I am like one of those players with zero court awareness or jumper who just rely on their athleticism and explosiveness, except I am not quick and can’t jump at all. So I guess like Russell Westbrook in his last season when he is completely washed and totally useless."
I mean you could look at RPM which adjusts for lineups. Embiid isnay 6.66 and Jokic at 5.21.   BPM is the one that just looks at counting stats. The one that  was so bad they had to redo the entire formula because of Russell Westbrook
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant still play for the Thunder? Lebron still play for the Cavs? Is Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Kawhi on the Spurs? Paul George on the Pacers, or the Thunder whom he promised to stay for but demanded a trade after 1 year? Hell, Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland wanting to be 'the guy' then forced himself out of Boston where he was the guy to go be 3rd fiddle to KD and Harden. I guess they all just proved you wrong.  Giannis is an outlier, and you're trying to paint the picture of the outlier being the norm. Knock it the fuck off, it's embarrassing."
"VORP and Win Shares are just repeating the function of Jokic playing more minutes than Embiid, and VORP is based on your other cited stat BPM which we already know is broken and overestimates players of Jokic's archetype due to a AST\*REB multiplier. Russell Westbrook has benefited from this as well.   I think minutes played is why Jokic deserves the award"
There isn't a single player on the OKC Thunder who played with Russell Westbrook.
Steve Nash and Russell Westbrook. That's a decent PG.
People here think Russell Westbrook is terrible at basketball. They think Lebron is overrated. They shit on players from the 80s and 90s claiming they couldn’t compete with athletes today and in the same thread call MJ the greatest. This place ain’t long on critical thought.
"And yet again, this is wrong.  Russell Westbrook has a career win % of 75.6% when he gets a triple double.  It's a super clear and obvious statistic -- Russell Westbrook getting triple doubles is overwhelmingly good for the team he is playing on.   It translates to a win 75% of the time, and it was 80% when he was with the Thunder.  75% would be good for   *checks notes*  The best record in the league this year!   Seems like his triple doubles lead to wins for his teams at a very high rate."
"And Russell Westbrook and prime Derrick Rose.   Your point is understood here, but players (especially ones with physical styles of play) don’t need to be elite shooters to be elite scorers. The way that the Wolves are constructed, they have shooters around Ant who can space the floor."
"Yea we are lol. 5 turnovers a game is crazy, especially when you couple that with his bad shooting efficiency. Literally no player in the NBA wastes more possessions then Russell Westbrook.  Ya the wizards suck but Russ hasn’t even been a league average defender for a couple years now. At this point he’s just a stat machine, don’t you remember how bad he was in the playoffs last year? The couple games he played against the thunder legit almost lost the rockets the series"
"Once again, factually incorrect information. Comparing one triple-double king to another:  Oscar Robertson was 131-50 in triple-doubles in his career.  Russell Westbrook has a 127-43 record in triple-doubles in his career."
Russell Westbrook is [127-43](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/win-loss-record-when-russell-westbrook-gets-a-triple-double) in games where he gets a Triple-Double.   That means he wins roughly 75% of games where he gets his triple-double
Or you can just ignore that Westbrook wins 75% of his games when he gets a triple-double.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/win-loss-record-when-russell-westbrook-gets-a-triple-double  &gt; Russell Westbrook has a 127-43 record in triple-doubles in his career.

"I mean, it’s like asking if Russell Westbrook is better because he puts up wild stats. I’ll say no but prepared to be downvoted."
"It’s true he hasn’t, but harden was the guy for his team that year. KD has been around other guys who dominate the ball pretty much his entire career, Russell Westbrook for majority of his career, then had to share the ball with Steph and Klay in a system that doesn’t promote isolation ball that often. The numbers show though, KD has always been ridiculously efficient despite not having the ball as much in hands or not having as many shots. On the rockets in 2019, Harden was the guy, and the offense revolved around his isolation play. He plays that role very well, but at the end of the day, if you look at the playoffs when they don’t call fouls on harden as much as they do in the regular season, he’s been shown to slow down or get shut down badly for years. I still believe that KD has the slight edge over Harden in terms of offensive output because of this. He’s had better playoff numbers in almost every year of his career, with the same level of efficiency against defenders who are actually trying. But at the end of the day, the nets have both of them, so it’s already not fair lol"
"People don’t seem to like Jeff Teague, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Grayson Allen, Gobert, Wiggins (b4 this year), Pat Bev, Herro, Pascal and sometimes Lowry."
"&gt; You don’t lead the league in assists per game twice like he’s about to do without being an incredible passer,  Counterpoint: Russell Westbrook exists. You can absolutely put up great passing numbers while being a mediocre passer. Not to say Harden is mediocre in that regard... he just isn't anything special at it either. Think about how a 2019 Rockets possession usually goes for a second.   Harden stands at the top of the key.  Harden dribbles for 15-20 seconds.   Harden decides to drive or shoot... in this case drive for the kickout to Eric Gordon on the wing.  Gordon makes the shot.  Now tell me... what exactly in that possession demonstrated Harden was an elite passer? If anything,  it demonstrated why the Rockets struggled so much in the post-season: no rhythm outside of Harden."
This. Russell westbrook became MVP the season Kd left. So it’s on Jokic to prove that he is the rightful MVP by stepping up without his 2nd star.

Stop being soft. Russell Westbrook is the 2nd most hated player on r/NBA. After James Harden and above Kyrie.
"Lebron originally made it cool to coast through the regular season right, followed up by Toronto with a Load Managed Kawhi (and perhaps other folks before him did as well, I am just not aware of many situations off the top of my head previously).  Doesn't matter your seed right just get to the playoffs and flip that switch.  Good on Lebron for getting to playoffs healthy, great organization in Toronto there load managing Kawhi through the meaningless regular season.  Those guys won, that's why that's the story for them.   Last year the Clippers coasted a bit and nobody cared...until of course they ""didn't win"".  Winning solves everything.  James Harden, Russell Westbrook, etc go all out in the regular season and get mocked because they don't win, and the Clippers would have been fine if they won.  Now it's Brooklyn's turn.  Will we be applauding the organization for getting these guys enough rest and getting everyone healthy for the playoffs, or are we going to get another ""cautionary tale"" like we did with the Clippers and go with the ""lack of chemistry, condensed schedule, covid year, etc"" excuses similar to last year from the bubble?   Both stories are written, just got to wait and see who wins before we decide which to print and becomes the next narrative."

"| Brooks had drawn up a play, but when the huddle broke, he looked at the clock. He had 50 more seconds before the horn blew. He called Westbrook over. “Russell,” he said. “What do you think about this?” Westbrook had other ideas: Put big man Daniel Gafford in one corner, “because they’re not going to switch off him,” Westbrook told Brooks. Then put guard Raul Neto in the right corner. Story continues below advertisement  “That gives us a better chance to get a good shot out of this,” Westbrook said. “After the game, I thought about it,” Brooks said, “and I’m like, ‘Wow, it’s totally changed.’ Sometimes, he’s coaching me.”"

"nah, I don't care about stat padding, I watch sports to see people do otherworldly feats like set records etc. Run them scores up, assert dominance!  I just thought it's funny how the perception of a player changes the interpretation of their actions. Steph Curry is a good shooter so he isn't stat padding. Russell Westbrook is a poor shooter so he is stat padding."
Russell Westbrook and Vince Staples.
"The fun thing about Russell Westbrook breaking or tying records is trying to figure out what all-time NBA legend had the record before Russ.  It's typically either Oscar Robertson or Wilt Chamberlain, which 1: tells you a lot about how much of a beast Russ is; and 2: makes it a fun 50/50 game that I love playing on this subreddit.

When seeding wins over the better player, the vote differential is around 10% of the total votes. The point differential in the 1962 MVP race was nearly 100%. That's ridiculous and not a coincidence.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;But I dont agree with Bill being a better player. It doesnt take a basketball god to know that Wilt was a better player. Bill himself thinks Wilt was better.  Can you provide a source? MJ thinks Russell is the GOAT. Players opinions doesn't mean too much.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Your entire analyzing of 3 mvp races from the past around 13 years contradict your statement that Bill was better because you point out that Candidate A wins because of better seeding. Wilt should of had within 10% of the total votes but he didnt because of the voters logic that the guy with the best team is the best player. Give Wilt that team and Red Aurebach and hes getting a whole lot more votes.  This statement is chock full of fallacies.  Sentence 1: I said the inferior OR EQUAL player wins MVP over the superior player with a margin of 10% of the total votes. I then showed that Bill won with double Wilts votes. This shows that Wilt wasn't better, as if he was, the margin would have been smaller. You're trying to say that I said Bill was inferior, but my whole point was that if he WAS, he would have won by only 10%.  Sentence 2: You still haven't provided evidence that Wilt should have had a 10% difference in voting. You can't just say ""Wilt should have won, therefore your proof is wrong.""  Sentence 3: You still haven't provided evidence of the voters having that mentality either. In fact, the only reason you say that is because thats the current mentality voters today have. BUT, you said that you can't compare MVP races from 2010's to 1960's in your firsts sentence, meaning you contradicted yourself.  Incase you're wondering why I chose those 3: In 2020 Giannis was individually better so the discussion was irrelevent. In 2018 Harden had better stats AND seeding so the discussion was irrelevent. In 2017, Westbrook won WITH the lower seed, which I didn't mention but it disproves your point showing that lower seeds can win. In 2016 Curry had the better seed and stats. Then we have 2015 and 2019, two solid examples of weaker stats but better seeding. I wanted one more example, and I remember a post about CP3 vs Kobe for MVP in 2008 so I used that one."
"I think he partly has a little bit of Russell Westbrook in him. There’s really no off switch, he’s always go go go and serious"
"Russ had a bump in efficiency that year due to a career high in 3pt%, FT% and FTA. He never had the same efficiency since. You can't assume that Rose automatically gets better efficiency due to better spacing.   &gt; The entire purpose of this post is to assume Rose gets better lmao, so I don’t get that argument. Yes, it’s not a certainty, along with all hypotheticals.  No. Stephen A Smith said, and I quote ""Derrick Rose, if fully healthy is a better version than Russell Westbrook"" he didn't say ""could be"". We aren't using hypotheticals, we are using what we've seen as the benchmark, and using what we've seen, Westbrook is the better player. It's nitpicking, sure, but those were his words, not mine."
"Karl Malone is sort of like the Russell Westbrook of the 90s. He was a great player and still somehow not as good as his stats. It is hard to have conversations about a player that has a high floor but a limited ceiling against the best teams and not have people pissed off about both issues. Win a lot of regular season games, win an ok amount of playoff games, put up rare numbers in the process. Your teams always seem to be missing something.   Some of not winning is luck tbf. But if they were the best player on your team...how confident are you really in winning a championship?"
I was thinking more Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
"You said nobody else but KD was a superstar in their franchises’ history, not asking who’s on par with him. Nobody is. Anyway, Russell Westbrook is a better player than Gary Payton, and you should at least realize that.  Is LeBron the greatest Heatle because he was their best player in their most successful years? Hell no he’s not"
"I'm pointing out that if you can't tell how political Russell Westbrook is because he isn't wearing a sign on his forehead that explicitly states it - - then you likely come from an isolated community who has a hard time understanding other cultures.   Because I'm telling you, it's extremely obvious how political Russell Westbrook is in the way he carries himself be it his fashion or his on-court attitude or personality towards the media.  I'm not criticizing you for it. But it's something you might want to look into. Because it's blindingly obvious.  &gt;Ok... so he’s airing a documentary on the race riots. Are you supposed to have an issue with that because you’re conservative? That seems to be what you’re insinuating.  Absolutely not. Just read what I said above.   &gt;Also, every team has ignorant fans. Shameful for you to make assumptions like that...  I'm not making assumptions. I'm referring to people that I know personally who are racist and partake in Westbrook slander every chance they get.  Shame on you for trying to discredit my own personal experiences that I shared. That's what happens when you grow up in isolated communities, you refuse to trust outside views and sources.  &gt;and we wonder why the divide has gotten worse, and not better.  What's the point of it getting better? Those outside of isolated rural communities all knew the history of this country and we didn't rely on public education to tell us how to feel about the history of our neighbors.  The truth is that nobody wanted to be united with you to begin with. Everyone just kept quiet to keep the peace until the population numbers equalized. And here we are."
Russell Westbrook. Just to shut everybody up
 &gt;Is John Wall worth his contract or Russell Westbrook?  Those two players get called over paid all the time. Wall specifically was called the worst contract in the NBA and people were saying that Westbrook's contract wasnt moveable.
Russell Westbrook is going to go down as the most overrated player of this generation by a very large margin
"Depends where you ask. On this subreddit I think he's overrated. Despite his counting stats and longevity, If my goal is to win a championship I wouldn't pick him over Magic Johnson, Steph Curry, Oscar Robertson, Isiah Thomas, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Walt Fraizer, or Damian Lillard. But a lot of people here would have him ranked as the 3rd best pg ever based on stats alone."
"Living in Oklahoma, growing up here and seeing people spit constant hatred towards the people that Russell Westbrook represents and epitomizes, including spitting hatred at the MVP of their own favorite team while he was here, I promise you it's more than just correlation.  Russell Westbrook is an extremely political person. He just produced a documentary about the Tulsa Race Riots that's airing on national TV.  If you don't think Russell Westbrook is political in everything he does, you are blinded by *something*."
&gt; i'm saying you cant compare someone with a fully healthy career to one  that lasted 4 years. you just shouldn't make the comparison. it's one of  those things we'll never know.   You can only make the comparison based on what we've seen. And the best of Russell Westbrook is better than the best we've seen from Derrick Rose.
"Washington Wizards winning against San Antonio Spurs in Finals, the battle of 8th seeds. Russell Westbrook getting the Finals MVP and GOAT status."
Wilt  Westbrook  MJ  Russell  Stockton/CP3  MJ  &amp;#x200B;  Just in my thoughts
Im just gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you started watching the NBA after the year 2014 where he averaged 32 ppg on basically 50-40-90 shooting without his co star Russell Westbrook or great spacing
"Not OP, but I like the Thunder. I like watching old highlights of Russell Westbrook dropping atomic dunks and hitting buzzer-beating threes on his way to alpha-dog status in the triple-double record books. I like Sam Presti and his Smaug-obsession with draft picks. I like the way the team helped revitalize OKC. I like watching burgeoning young talent develop with the hope of future stars just within reach. I did not mention any other team in my comment.   I also [searched](https://redditcommentsearch.com/) through my 8-year comment history and found no mention of ""Seattle,"" ""Sonics,"" or ""Supersonics,"" (not case-sensitive) so we exist."

"&gt;This is crazy...you Westbrook homers are obsessed with praising how good he is and every time he does anything remotely good you guys come out and gloat, but then you can't handle anyone giving a statistical argument as a rebuttal.  Dude, you are literally beyond help. At the time of this comment you have 34 of the 128 comments on a thread about Russell Westbrook averaging career highs in stats. You calling someone a homer when you're 25% of the comments of the entire thread just shitting on the guy is fucking comical.   &gt;Loving a player and arguing that his stats show he is a great player are two different things.  Nobody in this thread is trying to elect him to the HoF. He is still the same inefficient player he's always been, but he's elevated his game some, and is helping the Wizards win and make a push for the playoffs. That's worth something."
Russell Westbrook is currently averaging career highs in stat padding
Russell Westbrook is Soo overrated guy  plays decent for a few weeks and now he's top 5 lol
&gt;Lmao stealing rebounds from the opposition centers  how does the guy do it. Like he has this 3rd eye for rebounds or something. THere was one video where russell westbrook falls to the gground and balls just come to him. its pretty funny.
Y’all want him to be Russell Westbrook AND Stephen Curry i stg
"LeBron and AD both big fans of Russ. Russ an LA native. 👀.  AD when talking about Russ-AD friendship:  &gt;Davis and Russell Westbrook have a good relationship. Before Davis switched representation to Klutch Sports this past offseason (the agency which represents Lakers forward LeBron James), Davis was represented by Thad Foucher of Wasserman Media Group, who represents Westbrook. The connection between Davis and Westbrook was apparent at the 2017 All-Star Game in New Orleans, when the two attended multiple events together and Davis expanded on their relationship to the media.  &gt;""Russell's one of my closest friends in the league,"" Davis said. ""Me and him have a bond. We're the same agency. Both of our parents are extremely close, so me and him are very close.”"

Russell triple double Westbrook
"Which is funny because this sub claims to love players that play hard and want to compete without stacking the deck, but hate on Russell Westbrook, who is the embodiment of that.  Russ is a flawed player (every player in the league has flaws btw, even LeBron freaking James), he can't shoot and has bad decision making, but outside of that you literally can't find another flaw in his game. Great passer, great leader, probably the greatest rebounding guard ever and incredibly clutch according to the numbers, he just can't shoot."

"Ultimately a lot of analysts will consider players in terms of what they bring to deep playoffs teams. There isn't much place for Russell Westbrook on one of those if you consider how defenses treat him in the playoffs and how much shooting you need to place around him for him to be effective.   So yes, he's better overall player than a Mikal Bridges or Joe Ingles. That goes without saying. But what does it actually mean in the long run? We should be able to distinguish between a player's box scores/first-order impact and their fit/flexibility/second-order impacts. Russ is incredible at the first but quite low on the second. I think Nate Duncan considers the second to be way more important when ranking players"

Its not like with fighting sports as small and big guys are really equal in the league as both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Guys like Steph and Harden are smaller than Embiid and Jokic but better
"Now tell us what Russell Westbrook did to you, buddy."
"Correct, because they started with Paul George, Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul and were able to trade all of them for a ton of capital. There's no way Jrue Holiday or Evan Turner were getting even half as much in a trade as the Thunder's players. Hinkie had to work with what he had and did a phenomenal job turning a mediocre roster into a ton of assets that the following regime largely squandered.  Presti started with a roster of top end talent, saw that the team he built was good but not good enough to win a title, and sold high on all of his players (much like Hinkie) to rebuild the team through the draft.  Hinkie had to be much worse to ensure they'd be at the top of the draft since we had our own first rounders. Presti had top end players that he could trade to get other team's first rounders as well as a young future all star/potential all NBA player in SGA."

Steph, kd, etc never had more than 20 fga/g. Much MUCH higher scoring efficiency.   Usage rate is due to system. Dantoni system tells players to shoot fast and dont play defense. That means more possessions which means more attempts and fouls. Which means more points. 44%fg  36% from 3  61% ts. Are not great numbers. 40% usage rate.   Btw thats never EVER indicative of winning. Thats why good teams dont do it."

Russell Westbrook averages almost twice as many assists as Steph Curry. And they both play point guard.
You’re right. Russell Westbrook will be the reason why the 10th seeded Washington Wizards will be beat in the playoffs.
Russell Westbrook stat line is the Warriors halftime.

For Harden the main issue is that his shooting splits are below league average outside of FT% and when compared to guards his splits are downright bad. His TS% doesn't look bad because he shoots a lot of free throws, so if you want to reward someone who doesn't have a FG% or 3pt% above league average and just baits 10 FT's/game, have at it, I'll watch him lose in the playoffs with a smile on my face."

Both things can be true.  Russell Westbrook is a special talent.  Lots of players can average a triple double if it was a focus for themselves and their teammates.
"It was very obviously not easier when Oscar Robertson was doing it.  From 1961-1966, Robertson (30/11/10) and Jerry West (28/5/7) were the only players to average 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game.

Russell Westbrook pretty much rebounds like a Centre anyway so in his own words.... #WhyNot?
"Russell Westbrook is genuinely a special talent.   There are several players who ""could"" average a triple double. This includes non all stars.  Russell Westbrook very clearly puts more importance on his getting a triple double than other players and their teams do.  These are the facts."

"Some complain more than some. It's crazy that you're taking this view when I'm really unbiased, I just love basketball. One thing I've noticed is how quick people are to point out negatives about Russell Westbrook but when it comes to Lebron it's an entirely different story, the man isn't a God neither is he perfect, every player no matter HOW great they are, they still contain flaws whether it's injuries, whining, bad shot selection, lazy, etc.  I never said he's the only one complaining, he just complains more than most of the league. I actually play basketball and I dislike having a whiner on my team, just play ball and stop the whining so I get what he is talking about. All I'm saying is that from my OBSERVATION Kyrie is justifed in saying what he said, Kevin Durant has a better chance at making the last shot than Lebron. Lebron might have MORE clutch shots but KD has the higher percentage of makes in the same situation. This is the last I'm saying about this shit too because y'all act like Lebron paying your paycheck"

Russell Westbrook noises
"Russell Westbrook is a lock, Harden, KD too, oh and Giannis will be there for sure."
Idk how OKC blew that. That's the Russell Westbrook effect
"The sentiment behind why he would be voted isn't crazy; the argument that Embiid is a forward is absolute unjustifiable nonsense.  If Joel Embiid is a forward Russell Westbrook is a center lol.  Either change the rules or vote by the rules, but don't break the rules just to get the intended result you want."
Well it was about that time that I realized this Russell Westbrook was actually an 8 story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

"“If you don’t respect and admire Russell Westbrook, there’s something wrong with you.”  - Charles Barkley."
"The argument is bunk, though.   &gt;Russell Westbrook has a 126-43 record in 169 games where he's scored a triple-double. In comparison, Oscar Robertson has a 131-50 win-loss record across his triple-doubles.  That's a 75% win record (and the stat's a month old, he's gone 9-1 since then to move to 135-45) when he gets a trip doub. Teams would *kill* for a .750 record. It's clear evidence that him getting them is a good thing."
Yeah but do we know whether or not Russell Westbrook was on the planet at that particular time
"how about one or two examples? pls humor us. Nothing came up when I searched ""what advantages do 60s players have on russell westbrook"""
[https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242007/Russell-Westbrook-Was-Offered-Partial-Academic-Scholarship-By-Stanford](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242007/Russell-Westbrook-Was-Offered-Partial-Academic-Scholarship-By-Stanford)
"If Westbrook had to score 10 a night to win a title he would. He consistently outworks every player in the league when it comes to effort and is the closest thing we have had to MJ/Kobe as far as leaving it all on the court. If hes hurt and he can play you can bet your money he’s going to be out there. If there was a stat for giving a fuck about winning Russell Westbrook would be at the top. Everything he does is to win, how he carries himself as a leader on and off the court. That is why his stans love him so much because the people who have consistently watched him are absolute believers in his effort and attitude combined with all the freak athleticism and things that make him an all timer. He is just a total dude. To us he is a Derek Jeter, Roger Staubach, Reggie White, a Dale Ernhardt. When they put the shield on Falcons back I was like na dawg Westbrook is Captain America."
"You mean outscoring Curry while pushing the 73-9 team to 7 games, where in game 7 Russell Westbrook shot 7-21 and the rest of OKC shot 34%, compared to the Warriors-minus-Steph shooting 40%?   He sure as hell didn’t perform as badly as Steph in the very next series"
the Russell Westbrook Experience  Not like Fred was any better though LOL
"I got so excited reading the first part of this title:  ""Russell Westbrook is the first player in NBA history to record 50 rebounds and 50 assists""  Still insane, but I was about to lose it when I thought he did all of that tonight."
I truly don’t understand why Russell Westbrook isn’t talked about as GOAT contention. This triple double streak of his is insane.  I’m not saying he’s as good as MJ or Lebron. I just think his name should be tossed out a bit more often. We’re not going to see someone of his style of playing for *checks watch* 50 years.
"Should Robin Lopez be in the MVP conversation? Also, Russell Westbrook could tie Oscar Saturday"
Jarret Jack having a single triple double actually diminishes Russell Westbrook having 180 of them?
"In other words:  Would you rather have Steph Curry, or Russell Westbrook on steroids with league average efficiency   I’d much rather have player 2. They can get the whole team rolling"
"But people criticize his playstyle, which is a main reason why he hasn’t won a title. He’s just a very selfish player and has shown to be very stubborn and refuses to change his style. Why do people think Russell Westbrook just doesn’t have any flaws?"
Russell Westbrook has been coaching the Wizards since the All Star Break.
"These last few Wizards games show us what kind of player Russell Westbrook would be if he had slightly better shooting stats. He is currently (in the last 16 games) having 46,9/33,3/72,2 while his overall career stats are 43,8/33,3/72,2."
"Russell Westbrook is his own worst enemy, and he’s an all-time player but to think he doesn’t share some responsibility for not having a ring yet is a bit obtuse. Not to imply this is what Oscar was saying but I’m more generally speaking here."
"Let me follow on from this point. A lot of people's history of the Thunder goes like this: Young Promising Team - Harden traded - KD Leaves - Westbrook never gets out of the first round. The reality is so much more nuanced than that.   People fail to understand that the Thunder were ran to make a profit in the franchise's early years, OKC did not have a billionaire on board who could stomach financial losses. The billionaire came later in 2014/5 in the form of George B Kaiser. It is one of the reasons why the Thunder were so risk-tolerant in the Westbrook-PG era, they had the muscle to deal with losses.   You can debate whether the owners are right or wrong to run the team like this until you're blue in the face but the fact remains that the NBA retroactively applying the Rose Rule to Durant's extension hurt massively. The increased max meant that the Thunder would hit the repeater tax year after year if they chose to pay KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka. The Thunder could have amnestied Perkins but getting to the Finals required an elite interior defender who could match up with Duncan. It is not as cut and dry as it is made out to be.  Furthermore, the Harden trade was not solely about money. Money was a big factor but the Thunder held concerns about Harden's partying habits. Harden partying during the NBA Finals was not a good look and did not benefit the team against a tough, veteran Heat team. Moreover, Harden wanted a bigger role and this would have been unlikely in OKC. Harden would have hit RFA in 2013 and posed serious questions about the Thunder's ability to retain his services. It is still a stupid trade but you can understand some of the justification of the decision to trade Harden.  Post trade was an injury-ravaged spell. The 2013 team won 60 games and looked to be a better side that the year before. Patrick Beverley inexplicably ran into Russell's knee in the playoffs and that was a year gone. In 2014, Ibaka was injured against the Spurs and those fine margins make all of the difference. In 2015, KD suffers a Jones Fracture and OKC miss the playoffs entirely. 2016 was the only time that the Thunder were fully healthy and we saw what the Thunder were capable of.   The Thunder's failure to win a championship was pretty poor in the last decade but the team went to 3 Conference Finals, an NBA Finals and made the playoffs nine times. The reality is that the ceiling for small markets is lower than big markets. The Spurs are the only small market team in the last 20 years to win a championship.   When you look at all of these conditions, the Thunder were pretty successful.   I haven't even mentioned the failed Chandler trade in 2010 which would have changed the calculus for the Thunder. Tyson Chandler would have meant no Perk and Jeff Green staying.   OKC could have blown it up after Durant left, Presti did field calls for Russ and was close to a deal with the Celtics. The paperwork was filed with the league office but he got cold feet and worked on a max extension for Russell. That trade was something like Jae Crowder, Olynyk and the Celtics' pick in 2017. If that trade happened, the Thunder would have been in a painful rebuild.   The Thunder and Russ did the best with the hand they were dealt. He probably won't win a ring but that's life."
"2020 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 10 minutes per game. 2019 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 25 minutes per game. They did not have a 'better version' of Terrance Ferguson because he was never good. They just did not have anyone at all better than him to play. I'm sorry, but even if your starters consist of Paul George and Russell Westbrook, if your #7 guy is 25 mpg of Terrance Ferguson you are a terribly constructed roster. Period.  Steven Adams averaged 3 less points, Jerami Grant averaged 2 less points, Dennis Schroder averaged 2 less points, Terrance Ferguson averaged 2 less points, Markief Morris averaged 2 less points... all than their regular season averages. The Thunder lost 2 games by 5 points or less, despite getting 11 less PPG of production from their already atrocious bench outside of Schroder.  2020: Shai lost 3, CP3 gained 4, Schroder lost 1.5, Gallo lost 4, Adams lost 1, Dort gained 6, Bazley gained 1, for a net gain of .5 PPG.  So yeah, I'd say losing 11 PPG of production for the 2019 squad while the 2020 squad lost nothing is a pretty big deal. The 2020 squad was also a fair bit better defensively in 2020 than 2019, and defense means more in the playoffs. The 2019 squad's strength was scoring, and the rest of the squad went cold in the playoffs. Russ and PG13 showed up and did their jobs. The bench didn't.  Cp3's run was very impressive, but ultimately he had a deeper roster and better load distribution among the supporting cast."
Yeah Russell Westbrook definitely has not played with the right group of players. Not like he's been teammates with multiple MVPs or anything
"Exactly, that's why KD, PG, Harden cannot win a chip in OKC (and Houston for Harden). They all have to deal with the shitty playstyle and zero improvement to the game of Russell Westbrook, aka the guy who took shots consistently more than his teammates while having way way worst shooting splits."
"ah yes, who could forget the incredible MVP run of 2011 Russell Westbrook?"
"Exactly, Westbrook carries expectations everywhere he goes. Dame never does, year after year, it's expected only a 1st run exit or a mild playoff run.  And this is not undermining him, Dame is an amazing player, and a lovely person for what I was able to see. But come on, he's nowhere near to what Westbrook did his entire career, even what he's doing now. Russell just takes the pressure everybody puts in him and then does something about that. It can be wrong, tho. But he always try to respond."
February-Now Russell Westbrook should be top 5
"Average NBA height in the 1950s and 1960s was 6'5"", not 6'7"" like today, so Oscar was able to leverage his athleticism and size into rebounds in an era in which there was a faster pace and lots of misses due to poor efficiency.  This is how guys like Wilt and Russell could average 20+ rebounds per game.  Thus, I would really discount Oscar's rebounds a lot.  Westbrook is a god-tier rebounder.  Truly has a nose for the ball.  All this being said, I bet Oscar as a better defender relative to the league than Westbrook is, so I would still take Oscar in his prime (and era) before taking Westbrook in his MVP-season."
"The idea is overstated, misused, and over-generalized.  The general idea is that a player who uses a lot of offensive possessions with league average efficiency will make a bad offensive team averagish (raising the floor), but will not be as helpful to a good offensive team that's already efficient.  The players who fit this description are 2017 Russell Westbrook or 2001 Allen Iverson. But the term doesn't totally fit either player.  If you have a good defense, like the 2017 Thunder, dragging the shitty offense to league average raises the team's ceiling to a middling playoff team.  But if you have a great defensive team, like the 2001 Sixers or 2007 Cavs, dragging your team's shitty offense to league average raises the team's ceiling to a contender.   &gt;There are examples of players that can raise a teams ceiling without raising its floor that much: Draymond and AD are the two I see most put into this category.  This is just lazy analysis. AD and (especially) Draymond both provide the vast majority of their value on the defensive end. Defense is just as valuable to good teams as it is to bad teams."
"Absolutely. Russell Westbrook. Demar Derozan. There are more but these 2 just come to mind immediately.  They are the guys people fawn over but as soon as they come available half the teams would pass for ""fit""."

Disagree. Russell Westbrook is a much better scorer and rebounder. Those are objective facts. They are pretty close on passing/playmaking and Paul has an edge on handles/ball security and defense.  But what russ has done in his career is unprecedented in the modern era. I would definitely put him top 3 PG of all time. CP3 makes my Top 5 but hes not over Russ or Steph or even Dame imo.
As opposed to clutch playoffs beast Russell Westbrook? There's only one of those two players that I'd trust to make the best decision in a close game
"If you think Westbrook on the Celtics is going to make Tatum worse then I suggest you look at Russell Westbrook’s history with co-stars the past few years. He fit in nicely to allow George, Harden, and now Beal to excel."
“Russell Westbrook would son you watch your mouth”. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to decipher the meaning of this sentence. Chill out with the racist undertones.
Russell Westbrook: Oscar Robertson without a ring.
Russell Westbrook and AI now that the talk has arose  Russ and CP too
Reposting this as an original instead of a reply: One of the most underrated demoralizing shots is Game 6 of the 2016 WCF between Golden State and OKC: Klay Thompson pulling that insane top of the key 3 w/ Russell Westbrook defending him while the Warriors were down and 5 minutes left in the game... that was when he got the playoff record for most 3s in a single game and it is still crazy to watch now
"According to [that site](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-number-of-triple-doubles-and-wins),Westbrook has 134 wins with triple doubles in his career. More trip-dub wins than poor Zach has just wins.     Tangent: basketball references new subscription model is dumb."
People keep saying this and I don't see it. He's average.  &amp;#x200B;  Russell Westbrook is actually ugly and he has a ton of fans.
Julius Randle  Derrick Rose  Russell Westbrook  Steph Curry  Carmelo Anthony (forever)
Russell Westbrook has won fewer playoff games in the past 6 seasons than Guerschon Yabusele.
Because bjorkgren's defensive system calls for players to fight over ball-screens at all times. Which doesn't make any sense with non-shooters like ben simmons and Russell westbrook. The pacers fucking face guarded draymond green on the perimeter lol Brogs is not the issue.
Nowadays you need a rebounder that can stretch the floor and shoot threes unless you're like Russell Westbrook or something
It is the best option. You can't double Giannis because he's surrounded with shooters.  Nets just put DAJ and Blake Griffin at center and gave him 10 feet of space.  It worked and he went 10/29.  So there we go. Washington Wizards don't got any Giannis DPOY stopper either. They had Russell Westbrook guarding him.  It's better to put a center and not help off the shooters.

"Russell Westbrook is a generational talent. What he is doing is historic. Not in a hyperbolic SportsCenter Stat esque way. I mean we're watching a 6'3 guard average a triple double year after year.   I'm one of the doubters. I was one of the people who says he does too much but stats and records stay long after you're gone.   I'm not saying you can't critque a player but we have to know what we're witnessing. There's a few guys in the league like that (Bron, KD, Curry, Harden, Giannis, and any great that we can look back and tell our grandkids we got to watch them.)  So I've given up on hating on WB."
Russell Westbrook and it's not even close.  Michael Jordan and it's not even close.  Ez pz.
"My transition was pretty smooth. I went straight from college to the Olympic team with Bron, Melo, Kobe, Tyson Chandler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul. I was able to be around these guys 24/7 for about two months, and learn a lot from them.   My “welcome to the league” moment was when we played Indiana at home during my rookie year. They had PG, Lance Stephenson, David West, Roy Hibbert, all those guys. David West just lit me up. I couldn’t stop him. I was so frustrated. He went to the same move, over and over. Literally 5 times in a row. Just caught the ball, jab, jumper from the elbow. I couldn’t stop it. That’s when I knew the league was for real."
Russell Westbrook?
"Lol, I can't believe that was a legit response to Russ transition game.  Ball might be faster than the avg man. It's not always faster than Russell Westbrook."
"I'm chuckling imagining an adult person spending their precious free time logging onto the same website every day and every day discussing the same important subjects like ""Is Russell Westbrook overrated or underrated?"", ""Is Rudy Gobert top 15, top 25 or top 35?"" and ""If Miami won in 2011 but with Chandler injured and Dirk averaging 8/8/8, what would that mean to Kyle Kover's legacy?"", with the same, barely ever basketball-related arguments every day. Yeah that doesn't sound pretty. Oh wait that's me."
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"I mean, with Durant it was obvious. The deadliest scorer in the NBA dropping his small market team, leaving Russell Westbrook, a fan favourite, by his own and going to the Warriors, who had already an established superteam. It was the underdog failing to deliver and instead of trying again he went to GSW. To say it wasn't a popular decision is an understatement."
Congratulations to Mike Malone and Russell Westbrook for winning Coach of the month for their respective conferences.
"I still think WB is secretly not good for team basketball. And I accept the downvotes for this opinion.   He hasn't made it out of the first round* since Durant left despite having a season with Paul George and one with James Harden.  \* the one with James Harden, a team with TWO MVPs got taken to 7 games by the OKC Thunder and was a Lu Dort 3 away of potentially getting bounced again. Westbrook also played in only 3 games that series so it really says more of Harden than WB (doubly so since Harden managed to block that shot) but that's kind of unrelated.   The Wizards are likely to make the play-in but are otherwise still a terrible team despite having the leagues leading scorer and Mr. Triple Double himself. If we give CP3 credit for building teams up despite what traditional stats may indicate about his performance compared to others, I think Russell is firmly on the other side of the spectrum.   /endrant"
"I am not even a big fan of Russell Westbrook, but how does he not even make top 25 this season? Absurd."
"Shit I remember even thinking “nah they probably just lied about that feat, no one can average a triple-double for a whole goddamn season” like some legendary stories still seem possible (Wilt getting 100 points or 50 rebounds) but some just sound too far-fetched for me. I considered that legit though and I just thought that would probably never be broken. Then you have Russell Westbrook doing it 4 times. What a ridiculously amazing man."
"&gt; Tony Parker plays next to a generational talent, and he wins championships as a result and even a Finals MVP. Russell plays next to a generational talent...and wins nothing  Yes, they didn't win anything because of injuries/poor roster construction/coaching. Context is important.  &gt;Long story short : Tony Parker played a championship style of basketball. One you can actually rely on in the postseason. You can take Russell and all his stats if you want to...but I'm going to have a much better chance of winning with Tony Parker. I guarantee you I'll get a chip faster with him  ""Championship style of basketball"" is all relative and a product of circumstance. Replace TP w/ Russ on those teams and they have the same amount of success if not more.  &gt;AI has also done something relevant in the postseason as a #1 option, which Westbrook cannot say. We need to see if Russell can even get out of the first round without one of his Thunder buddies, before we talk about anything else  AI did that while his team was amazing defensively, they literally had the best defense in the league that year, do you think that was because of AI?  He had the DPOY, 6MOY and COY. He had a series where he scored 31 PPG on 30 shots and still won. Russ could easily win in those circumstances too and he's not even an efficient player lmao."
Westbrook would never ever be able to take that Philly team to a Finals and we all know it   And the fact you have the audacity to suggest Russell should even be in the same conversation as Zeke is pretty ridiculous
"Tony Parker plays next to a generational talent, and he wins championships as a result and even a Finals MVP. Russell plays next to a generational talent...and wins nothing   Long story short : Tony Parker played a championship style of basketball. One you can actually rely on in the postseason. You can take Russell and all his stats if you want to...but I'm going to have a much better chance of winning with Tony Parker. I guarantee you I'll get a chip faster with him  &gt;AI is def bigger in terms of impact on the culture, but basketball alone he only has 2 more All-Star appearances, which directly ties in w/ his impact on the culture tbh.  AI has also done something relevant in the postseason as a #1 option, which Westbrook cannot say. We need to see if Russell can even get out of the first round without one of his Thunder buddies, before we talk about anything else"
"no shit, its funny how each individual fanbase would probably take at least  5 current point guards over Westbrook to have on their team as of today yet its apparently blasphemous to not consider him top 10 all time lmao   name a team that would rather have Russell fuckin Westbrook instead of Dame Lillard"
Whose been the better player this season: Russell Westbrook or Luka Doncic?
"I'm always fascinated by comments like this because I just don't see it. There really just isn't that much to say about basketball.     Top posts right now on /r/nbadiscussion:    * Russell Westbrook is underappreciated.  * Should top 3 seeds pick their opponents * List of players Who Have Led the NBA in 2 Major Statistical Categories In the Same Season   * Bradley Beal could be having the worst season by a scoring champ.   * Why Isn't Kareem Abdul Jabbar Considered The GOAT? * Why are the corporate sponsor logos on jerseys iron-on stickers and not embroidered?    I mean, I could sort by new here and get a lot of the same shit."
"&gt;That’s an excuse people use when they don’t actually watch the teams they are talking about. You literally mentioned nothing about the skill level of both players.   What excuse? I asked a direct question. Where is all this Westbrook ""clutchness"" when it really matters in the playoffs?  &gt;JV for one. Dillon Brooks has been good for them as well, Slow Mo, Bane and Allen both been really good. And the biggest issue is they are ninth in defense despite Ja not being a good defender.   I thought u said ""elite"" role players..    &gt; I know we aren’t comparing two years of Jamal Murray to the entirety of Westbrook’s playoff career. You can’t be serious, you can’t mention “it’s just one one regular season” and then allude to one Jamal Murray bubble run. You just cant.   Of course I'm not talking about whole career but if we're talking about who's better right now I'm taking Murray. It's not even just the bubble run either...the Nuggets had a good playoff run in 19 as well.  &gt;From a basketball standpoint, Westbrook is better than Ja. He’s not efficient especially cause of the games with the injury now and he’s still a better scorer, playmaker, defender, and rebounder.  The only argument u can really make for Russell is statistics, but his statistics never actually amount to anything"
Is today russell westbrook post day?
"When Russell Westbrook dropped a triple double on your team it was the most significant day of your life, but to him it was just Tuesday"
Russell Westbrook is literally this generation’s Wilt Chamberlain
Calls me a troll yet you’ve never ever refuted any of my arguments.   Ranking Russ at 15-25 is a reasonable take.   No need to be so emotional. Russell Westbrook will be ok.
"Gafford is a legitimately good defender but he gets I swear 90% of his points from either Russell Westbrook or some other player on the Wizards who makes a good pass for him to get an easy layup. He can’t create points on his own so his offensive production is mainly a product of Westbrook and more generally, the Wizards passing."
“I’ve been busting that ass for years” Russell Westbrook to Damian Lillard.
"Lol @ *""lack of success in the playoffs""* and then you list Stockton, CP3, Nash, KJ, GP - - all who had the exact same amount of success in the playoffs as Russell Westbrook tho none of them were ever the #1 option on their team while carrying point guard duties.   Russell Westbrook has had more success or the exact same amount of success in the playoffs then all of those players who don't have rings and the ones who have maybe 1 more WCF/Finals appearances, it was done when they were all 2nd or 3rd options - - even when Russ was a 2nd option to KD he was still option 1B. Those players are not comparable to Russ carrying teams in the playoffs in his early years.   So you literally can't say this as a legitimate reason to your rankings.   For example, CP3 was an annual first/2nd round exit his entire career until he teamed up with Harden for TWO seasons - - people have such short memories, that was the biggest knock on CP3 was he couldnt last an entire playoffs and he still hasn't proven that untrue."
"People forget that the end of the game is really what matters.  If Russ shits the bed in the 2nd or 3rd quarter, yet turns God mode back on in the 4th and wins the game, all you'll ever hear from the haters is... ""efficiency""  You know what's more important than efficiency? W's.  Your favorite most-efficient point guard doesn't have more career W's than Russell Westbrook.   (Steph Curry not withstanding. He's in a league of his own as well.)"
Every single day is Russell Westbrook day. That is the joke. [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-okc-mayor-declares-every-single-day-is-now-russell-westbrook-day/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-okc-mayor-declares-every-single-day-is-now-russell-westbrook-day/amp/)
"Wilt is an excellent comp for him - physically dominant at his position, had to be there to see him, clearly not a player who contributed to winning at the HIGHEST levels but an excellent floor raiser who put up absolutely wild counting stats.  It also makes me wonder if 50 years from now people will be saying ""Steph Curry was great, yes, but Westbrook was better if you look at the stats."" Obviously this is an insane thing to say but perhaps that's the Russell/Wilt of our day."

It's better than Russell Westbrook guarding him. Wizards aren't deep w defenders.

I celebrate Russell Westbrook Day every day
"As a long time Thunder fan, I will say over and over again; Russell Westbrook is the most underrated and under-appreciated player in the whole league. 50 years from now when none of his records have been broken (or even touched), maybe then the main stream media but focus on that rather than “he’s a bad teammate”. We are witnessing a player of the likes we will never see again."
Russell Westbrook with the Triple H mentality.
"2 rings at a time when there were 8 teams and very few career athletes in the league. People call last years Lakers ring a mickey mouse ring and yet they went through more talent in the west than existed in the entire league when Walt won his 2 rings, which means I could easily call them mickey mouse rings (I won't, just using that to illustrate how weak the league was then). I give people Bill Russell cos he ran the league for a decade so he earned his rings even with less competition. 2 rings though and never averaging more than 22 points and never averaging double digit assists as a point guard, and his career falling off a cliff as soon as he hit 30. Westbrook would of absolutely ran the league if he took Walts place on any of them teams. Sorry but sports science and development and the league getting far more competitive and popular make it far harder to succeed in todays game. Your list putting Walt ahead shows you're either an Old head (eg nostalgic and not concerned for facts) or you just don't really know ball. It's not an unpopular opinion it's an objectively wrong one. There isn't an argument to say Walt is better than Westbrook outside of rings, that argument is shut down entirely when you look at the competition difference and amount of teams back then. Also when you consider that Westbrook got beat in the finals by a dude many consider the GOAT it's hard to hold that against him."
ALL TIME GREAT RUSSELL WESTBROOK
Russell Westbrook plays 2K in real life he’s so good
" &gt;Russell Westbrook is a different species.  Or as Chuck [would say](https://youtu.be/BSzDhQfPMn0), he brings a different animal to the table.  Insane performance!"

"Russell ""Jason ""Andre Drummond "" Kidd"" Westbrook"
"The second 10/20/20 in history; the first is held by none other than Russell Westbrook, with a 20/20/21."
Watch russell westbrook
What will we do when Russell Westbrook no longer plays in the NBA? In all sincerity there isn't a player that I find half as interesting or enigmatic in the league for better or worse.
"Russell Westbrook will go down in history as one of the absolute best ever when it’s all said and done. We will look back at the numbers he’s put up as a modern-day Wilt.   Also, it’s Russell Westbrook day."
Russell “Pure sex” Westbrook
"So should Brooks have said:  &gt;Scott Brooks says he thinks Russell Westbrook is not even a top 5 point guard ever: “Point guards don’t do what he does."""
"He's 4 away from having the most triple doubles in league history now. When I was growing up, O's triple double mark and season average were basically untouchable milestones. Russ has made the triple double so non-chalant I feel like we're not even really talking about the fact he's gonna pass him in like a week or so at age 32. Crazy.  [Good article in the NYT about Russ and triple doubles and how he made them seem routine.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/sports/basketball/russell-westbrook-triple-double.html)"
"WTF, only 5 degrees for the Bill Russell Westbrook link.   Bill Russell -&gt;   John Havlicek -&gt;   Cedric Maxwell -&gt;   Benoit Benjamin -&gt;   Joe Smith -&gt;   Russell Westbrook"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"""Never tell me the odds"" -Russell Westbrook, probably"
Shoeless Russell Westbrook
Russ is an all time leader behind the scenes. Oladipo credit’s Russ’ work ethic for how he was able to transform his body over the summer after his OKC year. And there was an article earlier this season where Russ had every player on the team define what they think their role is and how it revealed why there were so many holes. So they laid out what everyone should be doing and they went on like a 5-game run after that.  https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/team-meeting-led-russell-westbrook-and-bradley-beal-helped-spark-wizards  I wonder if this was the same meeting.
No one hates Westbrook come on. Saying that someone is overrated is not hate. And this is the only bad thing I've heard about Russell.
You've got to give it to the Wizards. Had a terrible start to the season. Bradley Beal scoring a lot of points and they were still losing. But they bounced back especially with the leaderahip of Russell Westbrook who made triple doubles left ang right. The Wizards may not win in the playoffs but just getting into the playoffs is already a feat on it's own. Well done Wizards.
"This is incredible. Please tell me that this actually happened and someone isn't just playing Hall &amp; Oates over this clip of Russ. Fuck this season, but at least I know that Russell Westbrook fucks with Hall &amp; Oates"
Kevin Durant&gt;James Harden&gt;Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook against the Pacers is a top 10 player in the league
"Russell Westbrook straight-up took his shoes off, threw them into the crowd and sat on the bench with over five minutes left into the game and I don't think Indiana basketball will ever be able to recover from that."
Yeah if I’m Russell Westbrook I want to have to play against Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons on defense instead of Kyrie Irving and Blake Griffin
My favorite player is Russell Westbrook so that can't be true.

"If we going by this, Russell Westbrook MVP no debate. I'd take the warriors team over the wizards any day of the week."
Russell Westbrook. John Wall is second.
So does that also me we cross out Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul... this list pretty much just leaves Giannis again to win
"&gt; Curry wasn't always revered by his peers in this way. Six years ago, Curry won his first MVP as he led the Warriors to 67 wins. But that season, the NBPA, fed up with what it saw as biased and unrepresentative media voting, held its own awards show with honors voted on by the players. They picked James Harden, not Curry, as their MVP. &gt;In the 2016-17 season, the league added player input to the long-existing fan vote for the All-Star teams. Curry won the fan vote by far that season, *but finished a distant third in the player vote for Western Conference guards, behind Harden and Russell Westbrook.*  Damn, I forgot about that.  This season does seem to have gone a long way towards Curry earning the respect of Lebron and a lot of his other peers. Dude proved he could carry a team."
Dennis “Russell Westbrook” Schroeder taking all the shots with two of the greatest all time to ever lace it up is just amazing.
"Russell Westbrook is the best player in the NBA right now is globally wrong. There are lots of reasons (on-court impact, eye test, the fact that there are players who are inarguably better) why this is an objectively wrong opinion, and the onus is on Rasheed to justify his (obviously wrong) opinion, not on us to disprove it."
Murray 4th quarter play remind of playoffs Russell Westbrook fucking brain dead.
All imma say is russell westbrook got a lot of shit in front of him  He has to make the playoffs his game from game 1 - 16 and then some
Nobody gets more love on r/nba than Russell Westbrook let’s stop the fake everyone hates him outrage.
Russell Westbrook
Have always said that your opinion on Russell Westbrook says everything I need to know about your understanding of basketball
"The first year they had Allen Iversons 2001 legacy team he was literally unguardable. Mid range moving shot was 99 or something so any free space you didn't even need to get set.  Same with Russell Westbrook in 2k13-2k14 you could either take it to the rim and get fouled or dunk on someone, rain mid range Js heavily contested and he'd nail a 3 if he was wide open."
"While Russell Westbrook left for the locker room early. I guess when stats don't count, he doesn't play hard."
"Whatever the time was, you can literally see him limping. The time isn't the point. The point is that unlike your favorite players, Russell Westbrook suits up even when he's injured. He played through a torn quad earlier in the season and in the playoffs last year. Those are actual facts. If you don't like it, take it up with the official press releases by the team."
"Love both of them but I think this is the right call. Garland showed a ton of upside this season and is the prototypical NBA PG who can consistently hit 3s. Sexton is a great player but his ceiling (not saying he’ll be anywhere near this good) is more of a Russell Westbrook type where having him run the team you’ll be competitive, but he’s not able to be the guy to take you to the final level."
Russell Westbrook is what Monta Ellis would have been if everyone suddenly decided if he was a star
"Yes and Russell has never even done that with players like James Harden, Kevin Durant and Paul George. Tony Parker actually won meaningful basketball games. Russell Westbrook is all stats he doesn’t help you win at all."
"Kidd is definitely over him  Westbrook without KD or James Harden is a complete afterthought   Jason Kidd went to the Finals with Kerry skittles and K-Mart. Westbrook went to Cancun with Paul George  the only reason Russell scores more is because he plays in an era with no hand checking. shooting wise, they were pretty similar in league adjusted shooting   Kidd was consistently a way better passer, every bit as good of a rebounder, and then he’s 20x the defender   even the triple doubles doesn’t do much for westbrook. Kidd was the best in the league at them for 10 years, same as Westbrook. one of them plays in a faster league with smaller dudes  Kidd is super underrated, he gets better in the playoffs"

"There are probably two key factors here, trust and aggression. Russell whenever he feels like he cannot trust his teammates to reliably score the ball will take on the scoring burden himself especially in the postseason. This means he takes bad looks such as threes or early shot clock mid-rangers. Westbrook os best when he takes like 10 shots a game.   The other factor is that getting by on aggression is not enough in the postseason. He has to play smarter. The post-up is one of his most efficient shots, he had to get down low and make Kemba Walker hurt."
"Dame ""Get Swept In The First Round Two Years In A Row"" Lillard has never been, and will never be, as good as Russell Westbrook."

Russell Westbrook in his career has never had a postseason as good as or as efficient as  Tony Parker in 2014 not even counting the things that dont show up on the stat sheet like IQ.
"Yep. I've been calling this all year: Westbrook chases empty stats and prioritizes it over winning, and it was inevitable he would lose in the first round.

Brick after brick in a loss of empty stat chasing. What those commentators don't realize is that this is VINTAGE Russell Westbrook. Dude just isn't that good, always comes up short in the playoffs. Not a natural leader."
"I’m sure, because everyone that disagrees with your assessment of Russell Westbrook being the goat is some burner troll account?"
They deferred to ish smith instead of Russell fucking Westbrook in a pretty much playoff game. IN TRANSITION. Literally where Russ is at his best. He dropped the ball this game.
&gt;Russell Westbrook is an elite scorer  Stopped here lol
"Okay, I will give a detailed answer.  Russell Westbrook is an elite scorer who is absolutely fantastic when he gets close to the rim. He is also a great passer, rebounder and defender.  He has also been to the finals once and was incredibly close against the 2016 Warriors.  A guy that can do just about everything for a basketball team can be the biggest piece to a championship team. Yes he's inefficient and yes he has choked in the playoffs before, but he is an incredible talent who just never quite got over the hump"
"Yeah but you’ve never had Russell Westbrook on your team, that alone takes 20 years off your life"
"I’d say John Wall’s contract and playing situation was even worse, and he not only got traded but he got traded for Russell Westbrook lol."
"I'm not surprised by this at all. I've been hating on Westbrook all year about how he chases empty stats and always loses in the first round. So glad to be vindicated and proven right!

Wow! Russell Westbrook underperforming in an important game? No way that could happen!

"When Russell Westbrook plays basketball, the gods flip a coin. Today it landed on Westbrick."
Imagine if Russell Westbrook was in the WNBA
Sure. Russell Westbrook has been in big games. And he's only been bad in half of them.
&gt;Guard: Russell Westbrook  lol k.
"Fringe All-Star isn't really a slight considering how many great guards there are, especially in the West. Russell Westbrook literally averaged a Triple Double and barely got any All-Star buzz (to be fair, he had a relatively slow start to the season). Until Fox is on a team that wins more, he's going to be fighting for one of the last couple spots."
"People on this subreddit hate Russell Westbrook.  We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  People on this subreddit hate Russell Westbrook.  The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Brodie in his prime.  And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Westbrook's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest PG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that Steph Curry is better than Russell Westbrook, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Westbrook in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Westbrook is better.  You might be jealous of Westbrook's 184 triple doubles, or jealous of his status as the greatest rebounding guard in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Thunder fan who watched basketball in the 2010s, or a Bucks fan who watched basketball in the 1960s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This sub would make you think that Westbrook isn't even a top 100 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like ~~Steph Curry~~ The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Westbrook talk to the adults. Fair?"
"The sunk cost of acquiring PG won't be a factor in this hypothetical scenario though. In 2019 they didn't look at it like ""would we rather have 7 picks, Gallo and SGA or PG"", they looked at it like ""even though we're giving up literally everything, we'll get PG and Kawhi."" If Kawhi says ""trade PG or I walk"" then they'll be looking at it like ""would we rather have Kawhi plus whatever we can get for PG, or just PG by himself?"" That's an easy decision. So even if all they can get is Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook or CJ McCollum or something, one of those guys paired with Kawhi is still better than just having PG by himself."
"Part of it is the Celtics, part of it is wanting to see Nets v Wizards round 1, most of it is Russell Westbrook being amazing"
"no they specifically came out and said it was because of Russ  https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2020/02/introducing-bpm-2-0/  &gt;Why was BPM changed? The simplest answer: Russell Westbrook. Westbrook’s 2016-17 MVP season graded out at 15.6 in the original BPM. Essentially, his 10.7 RPG and 10.4 APG broke the interaction terms between those statistics. So Westbrook’s great season ended up being 20% better than any other season in the database, which just didn’t pass the smell test.   &gt;Russell Westbrook used to have the highest single-season BPM ever (15.6). He was way ahead in first place after 2009 LeBron (13.0) and 1989 MJ (12.6). After the changes to the formula, he is out of the top ten. 2017 Westbrook also had the highest single-season VORP ever (12.4), edging out 1989 MJ (12.0). After the changes to the formula, he fell from first all the way to 22nd.   &gt;Russ literally broke the formulas for some advanced stats with how dominant he was. Analytics folks had to literally come up with a new formula because it didn’t “pass the smell test” how crazy good he was that year."
Is russell westbrook a winner ?
y’all ni**az trippin - Russell Westbrook after a reporter asked him if the Jazz won this game or did the Thunder lose this one
"Ok if you really want to argue that Russell Westbrook is a top ten player for the week of may 2021 sure. I’m taking a more broad approach, these guys are hurt but we are aware of the ability"
"Russell Westbrook : ""I've been blessed with the talent not to give a f\*\*k""  Special mention for his ""Imma get his a\*\* back"" about Pachulia since he actually did it lol"
"I think it's hard to say who the *two* best were *as point guards*.  What we've had is the absolute pinnacle of the three types of point guard.  Steph Curry is the best pure efficiency scoring point guard.  Russell Westbrook is the volume-scoring burst athleticism pure power point guard.  Chris Paul is the peak of passing point guards in the modern game.  Comparing them directly doesn't work well for me because they have different strengths.  I think with the right team around them any one of them could play point for a championship contender.  Steph Curry is the only one who *has*, sure, but as all three of them have demonstrated - unless Curry takes the Warriors to a ring this year, in which case I will in fact insist that Curry is the unambiguous GOAT but I really don't think that's likely - a point guard alone, no matter how brilliant, can't carry a whole team to a championship."
&gt; it could have just been getting away from westbrook  You mean getting away from another top ten player whose impact rivaled Durant's own during some of their playoff series together? LOL. This idea that Russell Westbrook was not also an insanely good player and elite in his own right during their time together is ludicrous. Westbrook has always been a boneheaded dumb ass but he was a top ten player in the mid-2010s.   &gt; he's going to go crazy this postseason as well  On the most offensively talented team of all time? Nobody cares. Come back when he's not on bullshit video game teams lmfao.
"Melo was the best player on the second seeded Knicks and didn’t have much help, especially on the offensive end.   PG was the best player on his team too, but he was playing with Russell Westbrook, who made all NBA third team and averaged another triple double, and was on the sixth seed."
If Russell Westbrook can bring the fucking 7th seed Wizards over a Nets team with 2 top 5 players and a top 20 3rd I will get his face tattoo'd on my ass. That would be the most absurd and incredible upset in NBA history and one of the biggest in sports history.
"&gt;don't you think every player would go for triple doubles if it gave them a winning percentage of 74% like it does for Westbrook  Averaging triple doubles has gotten Russell a bunch of first round exits   Also, your logic is twisted...it's easier to get triple doubles in games you're winning of course. Doesn't mean he isn't stat hunting"
"I'm sure plenty of players prioritize their own points over winning. Lots of players probably end up hurting their teams ability to win games by focusing on themselves and playing hero ball. This is not something unique to Russell Westbrook or Donovan Mitchell. Look, you have taken Russell Westbrook's triple doubles and determined that they are great and that his motives are pure. That is fine. I just look at them differently than you do. Of course it's and impressive feat and Russell Westbrook is a very good basketball player, but when I put it into context and think about it, it looks more like stat padding and I think it sometimes can be counter productive."
Yep. It's pure conjecture. Same with your opinion. I think it makes a lot of sense. Why are you so invested in defending Russell Westbrook? Why do you care that I think he prioritizes triple doubles?
Lebron joins elite company in this stat: Russell Westbrook
"Because the scoreboard doesn't differentiate between positions as someone else mentioned.  And efficiency is about getting the best shot, which the more selfish guys in the league frequently show a shocking lack of awareness of.   Consider this. Imagine all the leagues guards had the abysmal TS% of say, Russell Westbrook. What's the more important takeaway here, the fact that Russell Westbrook isn't so bad compared to his peers or the fact that the leagues guards would be wise to utilize their much more efficient front court counterparts more often? I think it's the latter. That's why positional TS is pointless IMO."
"This is a super important record, as Russell Westbrook becomes the first Eastern conference player with West in his name to win player of the month."
Lmfao. Here you go. All of these guys are statistically having better years:  Bradley Beal   Russell Westbrook   James harden   Kyrie   Jokic   Embiid  Demar   Fox  Zion  Lebron James.  Luka  Steph
"There is no clear way to grade it. Russell Westbrook and Steph drug their respective teams kicking and screaming into the playoffs. The Lakers are barely in the playoffs, thanks to a competitive West and their number 1 and 2 missing a number of games at a pretty crucial time. Harden is straight fire on the Nets. Embiid was balling out. Jokic is setting records and looks to be the favorite.   I think Jokic deserves it, but it would have been a really fun (and probably eye-rolling) argument if injuries had not sidelined so many stars this year."
"&gt;The first third of the season Edwards was the worst player in the NBA  No, that was Russell Westbrook. Then the rest of the year it was John Wall."
This has to be a missleading stat there is no way Shai or Trae drive more than Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook Top 10 PG of all time.  LOL  People seriously don’t watch games here or look at any objective analytics.
You can tell the people who don’t understand what is valuable with regards to winning by how high some of you are rating Russell Westbrook.
"* The ""If He Dies, He Dies"" Award (presented by Tom Thibodeau, sponsored by Ivan Drago) * The “He Trick Y’All, Running Around, Doing Nothing” Award (sponsored by Russell Westbrook, presented by Tony Snell)\*      By far the best award names ahahahaha"
Russell Westbrook? The guy that took a knee injury when patty beverley dove into his knees but after the whistle?  That Russ?
"""Well they added the NBA All Time Leader in Triple Doubles, Russell Westbrook to their roster. What else did you think was gonna happen? LMAO"""
Point center Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook lmao
&gt; No team with Russell Westbrook as the starting point guard in 2021 can be a title contender   I think that's the point?
"As soon as people are able to overcome the dual factors of name recognition and obsessing over triple doubles (e.g never). No team with Russell Westbrook as the starting point guard in 2021 can be a title contender, period."
"Reddit: ""Twice-traded Russell Westbrook shoots poorly from the field while recording ZERO blocks, as his Washington Wizards come within 8 points of losing to the undermanned Philadelphia 76ers"""
"Russell Westbrook.  No contest. Never played for Dallas, likely never will. But he's one of the most electric players in my lifetime.  Probably THE most electric player who hasn't played for LA or NY, and it's already in my blood to hate NY/LA teams from other sports."
"Robin Lopez hookshots and skyhooks. Lot of them! He can't miss. So many hookshots that Embiid, Simmons, and company can't keep up. Then Westbrook, Beal, and Hachimura start hitting lots of hookshots. It's pandemonium. Is Scott Brooks actually a wizard for real? A fan runs onto the court, the security guard misses a tackle, the fan gets off a shot in the final seconds of the 4th quarter. The shot is good, but does it count? Have the Wizards won Game 7? Yes! They have! The fan was Russell Westbrook disguised as a fan!"
"Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, James Harden..."
If Russell Westbrook had 11 assists but 10 turnovers you really don’t think people would be right to mention the 10 turnovers if someone just brought up the 11 assists?
"It’s 2021 and Russell Westbrook scores 19 points shooting 3-19 from the field, has science gone too far?"
Are yall talking shit about 2X scoring champ Russell Westbrook?
That is the most Russell Westbrook statline I've ever seen

Are we absolutely sure Russell Westbrook is a point guard? He may be a center.
[Russell Westbrook has never been swept in the playoffs](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/npfehs/russell_westbrook_has_never_been_swept_in_the/)
Paul George and Russell Westbrook aren't superstars right now. I dont believe there's 15-20+ superstars in the league   They got deals when they were at their peak status of popularity. Hell iirc rose still has a signature line with adidas or doesnt still had a shoe deal when it was clear he wasnt a superstar
"What’s not to like about Russell Westbrook? I’m not even a Wizards fan, but the guy goes balls to the wall in every game. I respect anyone who puts it all out there like Russ."
Russell Westbrook has never been swept in the playoffs. Thanks u/triosway
"&gt;	What was lebron's goal when moving to the heat?   This is literally the goal of 95% of players when they move teams. What LeBron did is more similar to what Kawhi did going to the clippers.   The only similarity between LeBron and kd is that they both were on new teams. If LeBron joined the lakers, a team who went to back to back finals and already won a chip, with another mvp on the team, you would have a case. But he didn’t.   &gt;	How is that any different?  1) warriors went to back to back finals and already won a ring with the same core. Kd joined that team. LeBron joined bosh and wade, both who couldn’t make it out of the first round, wade hadn’t even reached the finals in 6 years.   2) warriors had a back to back, first ever unanimous mvp. The Heat had no mvp. Kd has won rings playing with other mvps. LeBron *was* the mvp.   3) warriors broke the record for most wins in nba history before kd joined. The Heat? Lol.   4) kd literally lost to the team after being up 3-1 just a few months prior to joining them. LeBron never lost, let alone, played wade or bosh in the playoffs. Mainly because they couldn’t get passed the first round.   5) KD left a team that had a future mvp in Russell Westbrook. LeBron left Mo Williams. Westbrook is better than any player LeBron ever played with in Cleveland."
The Russell Westbrook experience is something so beautiful it cannot be understood with our current concepts.
**Russell Westbrook has never been swept**
RUSSELL WESTBROOK WILL NOT BE SWEPT IN THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR
Dude’s more like Gallinari right now than Russell Westbrook are you done with your joint?
Russell “Tyrese’s Son” Westbrook
on the other hand he's still shooting better than Russell Westbrook.
"how you gonna let russell westbrook grab that offensive board, he's a point guard"
Bradly Beal and Russell Westbrook is 8-30 from the field and it’s this close 💀💀💀
"So if Russell Westbrook took a water bottle and threw it at a fan, you don't think there would be a charge?"
"It’s weird to root for another player when your team is currently at home waiting for the draft results? On top of that, Russell Westbrook did everything he could and more for OKC. Do you just wanna torture fans of bad teams, at least give us something to root for in these playoffs."
I care because I'm sick of seeing people call Paul George or Russell Westbrook superstars when they're blatantly a step below actual superstars. I like PG and Westbrook both but cmon.  Also it's a basketball discussion forum I'd rather talk about this than Kawhi's theoretical free agent destinations again
"Ehhhhhh  Paul George,Russell Westbrook and Kyrie Irving have shoe deals thats been around for years and jokic doesnt yet iirc but he's a superstar"
Yeah I mean I think it’s fine to throw around “superstar” just to describe very famous players like Russell Westbrook. Not a crime. But those top 6 feel like a notch above.
"None of what you’re saying has ANYTHING to do with your original post which refers to Houston’s (paraphrase) &gt;&gt;Failure to surround James Harden with other offensive talent that eliminates his need to fight through multiple coverage&lt;&lt;.  I point out that the standard of a front office surrounding their star player with literal generational talent is a totally unfair expectation.  Then, when pointed out that Harden played with great talents such as Russell Westbrook and CP3, you switch focus from the front office to now say Hardens help either sucked or weren’t available. Ironically, Kevin Durant and Kyrie have been LESS available than either CP3 or RW. Furthermore, I disagree and say Hardens talent was plenty good with great spacing and a team built to his strengths.  Now you say you’re talking about playoffs only. Well, Harden played plenty of games with CP3 and Capela and never before average 80% TS. Then you somehow go on to talk about Harden having to average 36 a game to GET INTO the playoffs, which completely deviates from you saying we’re only talking about playoffs.  I didn’t bother reading the rest. Pick what you want to say. You’re all over the place with this bullshit.  Harden is great. His lack of surrounding talent wasn’t what was preventing him from unlocking god mode scoring, assist, and efficiency. He had talent. He still put up amazing numbers. Now he has generational talent. So now he’s putting up ungodly numbers. You’re implying that with literally any good player, Harden can be this efficient. I’m telling you no, he’s playing with Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving."
" &gt; • How many games did Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving play with Harden? In comparison to CP3 / Capela?  Not sure why that’s relevant given  a) the nets are in the East and literally second seed despite Harden playing 36 games this season (best believe Houston would not make it out the west)   b) I was talking about the playoffs as well  &gt; • Is # of games played together relevant at all? Or is only the games they played together relevant? See the previous item when answering this question.  What?  &gt; • Which seasons do you want to talk about in regards to this with player availability in the first place?  Again, you’re not understanding my point. You’re absolutely delusional if you don’t think Harden HAD to average 36 pts a game for an entire yr + bust his ass off for the last 5 years just to get us to the playoffs, then lose steam come playoffs. Meanwhile nets are a top seed without him having to break a sweat. Why do you think that is? Regardless, we didn’t have it in Houston.   &gt; • We just gonna let you write off Russell fucking Westbrook like he’s not on the general same tier of talent?  I love Russ and he’s definitely one of the GOATs, but the whole small ball experiment and trading CP/Capela etc was a mistake. Him and Harden don’t work as well as Harden/CP, but I also understand the trade was done because of Westbrook’s longevity. Ironically, he got injured right before the playoffs as well...  &gt; • What does player injury history have to do with front office surrounding players with talent that demand opponent defensive coverage?  It means that those players are not available to play games and take away defensive attention lmao? CP and Harden worked very well when they played together, but when CP was injured, nobody was there to take defensive coverage away from Harden. Make sense?  &gt; • What other valuable role players did Harden with? Ariza? Gordon? Covington? Other great floor spacers?  And look at them all now, all shit. Harden has a tendency to make role players look a lot better than they are. It’s what he does. Remember Mclemore? None of these guys can take any defensive attention away from Harden... maybe Gordon when he used to remember how to play pre knee injuries, but that man has not had a single good game since 2017"

LeBron is the only player who gets this benefit of the doubt. Should Russell Westbrook be considered a top 15 player because of his HOF career? It's just dumb.   The only reason the Lakers are even in this series is because of Chris Paul's injury. LeBron hasn't been the best player in any of the first 4 games. Every game has either been a Suns win or Anthony Davis carrying the Lakers to a win. LeBron is washed.
"In the playoffs, the 2016-17 Thunder were a [-61.3](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?TeamID=1610612760&amp;VsPlayerID=201566&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs) when Russell Westbrook was off the court. They were actually a +2.6 when Russ was on and beat the rockets in those minutes, but their bench completely blew that series. :/"
Russell Westbrook?
"I'm now realizing that you aren't playing with a full deck, lol. Obviously the Westbrook thing got more coverage because it was in full camera view for everyone to see during the broadcast and Russell lost his shit and had to be restrained.

This is why I'm trying to deprogram myself from sports in general. I have zero interest in sitting next to any of you at a sports game, let alone root for the same team, or be in the same room as you even outside the sports environment. You don't respect players, you see them as animals even if you don't want to admit it. You show your true colors. It's sad and sorry."

"It's the opposite.

"I disagree. I think what really makes the offense work for them is trae young’s passing who will be replaced by another just as elite passer in Russell Westbrook. Westbrook throws great passes and with a finisher like capela, it’d work very well. Beal would be replacing bogi’s spot and that alone makes up for everything. The upgrade of scoring is insane"
Colin also said Russell Westbrook and Cam Newton are the most overrated athletes ever
"Last we talked Washington's future around here, the only reason Washington was in limbo was John Wall's unmovable contract. Now that it has become Russell Westbrook's much more movable contract, I have no idea what else they have to work with. They [seem](https://tradenba.com/teams/Wizards/30/draft-picks) to have picks, there's really just Westbrook's contract they could keep or not, and they have a few interesting younger pieces that could either develop or move.  I don't know much about the Wizards but it looks like they don't have much to put together a package for another star or big role player. That means if they trade any of their 6th+ best players, it's likely to be a horizontal move. That usually means bad news for a rebuild... on the other hand, they could make horizontal moves to get role players who better fit the team, and matters of fit are certainly what I see when they play.  I do love Dame and the loyalty thing is beautiful. VERY unfortunate that doesn't amount to much at the end of the day in the NBA, where we root for teams whose rosters can and do roll over in 2 seasons. My options would be:  1) Trade for forwards who can compliment Brad and Russ with off ball options- not picky here because I don't claim to have thought it through, just see what's on the market and what we could build from that.  2) If that doesn't work, think about moving Westbrook first. I bet there are takers but no idea what you could get back in return.  3) Honestly if 1 and 2 don't pan out great, I bet we could reset hard and fast by trading Beal. Or keep him for the loyalty factor, and the fact he'll sell tickets by himself."
Maybe Julius Randle is just another Russell Westbrook. The Peyton Manning of the NBA. A regular season guy.
No. You're worried about their postseason performance and you want them to trade for Russell Westbrook?

"Nothing racist, just lots of Kyrie slander and people yelling “Russell Westbrook” at KD"
"Go look at some of the other names in this post. People here are listing Kyrie, Trae Young, Kemba Walker, Kristaps Porzingis, &amp; Russell Westbrook. None of them are getting as much push back as Paul George even though he is at least on the same level as they are."
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
&gt; Russell Westbrook needs to call up Derrick Rose and train with him in the offseason.  I know before his string of injuries Rose actually did train with Westbrook as well as Durant.
"I think that’s fair. Matt is not at all the primary problem for the Falcons. Hopefully it doesn’t take Trae 10 years to bring the Hawks to the finals though. A single player has a more drastic effect in basketball so I’d imagine it couldn’t possibly take that long, if it were actually possible.  And just to be clear, when I referenced “limited ceiling” that clutchness is most of what I’m talking about. Russell Westbrook is an amazing player but it’s fair for me to say he often hampers his team’s playoff success, simply because he’s not enough of a threat as a shooter. No athlete is perfect, but sometimes their only flaws are the ones that matter most in crunch time."

"The whole defamation is self inflicted. Looking back on the chain of events, this guy was always referred to as ""a fan"" ie ""Utah Jazz fan and Russell Westbrook get into verbal altercation"" ""Russell Wesbrook claims a Utah Jazz Fan yelled racist statements at him during the Jazz game"" ""After an internal investigation the Utah Jazz organization have announced a lifetime ban on the fan who yelled racists statements at Russell Westbrook.""   It wasn't until this clown posted on his twitter account that he was kicked out of the game, and decided to tell his side of the story. Then everyone else was able to put two and two together.   I just did a small search during the reports, and the original articles/tweets refer to him as a fan, once he outed himself, then he was fair game for media outlets to use his name - whether you agree with that or not. He wasn't doxxed or anything from what I've found, he did something stupid and decided to double down on it. If you find something contrary to what I found, let me know.  As for being fired at his job, we don't know the whole story, it's possible that an internet mob got angry and sent a bunch of complaints to his work (I believe he was a salesman at a car dealership) so they had to let him go to protect their image, and with Utah being an at-will state, that's within their rights as a company. On the other hand, he may have already had some disciplinary things against him, and the company decided to let him go (again, which is in their right.)   Again, HE'S the one that got online and made it known. Had he stayed quite, this all might have been avoided. The idiot that poured popcorn on Russell at the 6ers game didn't get his information released. Neither did the moron that spat on Trae Young or the 3 idiots that were at the Jazz game. They're all gonna drift off into obscurity, and end up being a story. That could have been this guy, but he thought what he did was OK, and is blaming everyone other than himself."
And on that day Russell Westbrook became a dominatrix.
did you hear about how ALL PHILLY FANS beat up santa and dumped popcorn on russell westbrook AT ONCE???

"I know for a fact people \*will\* hate me for this, but why is everybody freaking out? It's \*just\* popcorn. It's not like the guy dropped bricks or nails or a syringe with covid on him, he just spilled some light and dumb snack on Russell Westbrook.  And yet Russel Westbrook was the guy who acted like he wanted to murder the fan. If anything \*he\* should be banned."
It's going to be Russell... and by that I do not mean Westbrook.
Utah had the same problem 3 years ago with Russell Westbrook in the postseason series against the Thunder.
Why are there so many people downvoting this. Lets not forget how disgusting they treated Russell Westbrook. So fucken sick some of the NBA players deal with on a daily basis.
"The first quote has [zero hits on google before yesterday's game](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22I%27ll+put+a+nickel+in+your+back+and+watch+you+dance%22&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA768CA768&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk004y50cF2rCpfn2pxjnNrqgJMgeyA%3A1622172786261&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A5%2F25%2F2021&amp;tbm=).  Was it meant as a racist remark?  I honestly have no idea. The ""boy"" part seems offensive, but the rest of it is too strange to even put a label on.  The other two *clearly* have nothing to do with race.  They're sexist, but for some reason that didn't make it into the headline.    The NBA has a bit of a history of taking [explicitly sexual comments](https://www.newsweek.com/nba-oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-utah-jazz-fans-racism-fight-1359393) and declaring them racist without an explanation.  It's as if they have an offensiveness spectrum with sexism somewhere in the middle and racism at the far end, and a sufficiently sexist comment will get bumped up to being racist.  It would be nice if the Jazz could ban fans simply for making sexual remarks to a player's mom and calling her a bitch, but I guess that's just not how the system works."
Russell Westbrook and Garrison Matthews vs James Harden and the popcorn guy.
Holy shit. This is like watching a video of Russell Westbrook shooting threes in the gym for 2 hours straight.
If you think you can go out in public and throw food at a grown man who’s clearly much stronger than you and not expect to get your clock cleaned you live in a bubble. I know that I’m not walking into a restaurant and tossing my appetizer at Russell Westbrook because A that’s stupid and B he could probably beat me senseless.
"I'd like to see these things just settled on the court. The jackass that threw the popcorn vs Russell Westbrook (6'3, 200lbs of pure muscle) in a boxing match."
my non-fan friend said “why did someone dump popcorn on Russell Westbrook” and all i could truthfully say was “because Philadelphia”
Finally found what the guy looks like. He gave a news interview at the time. Jesus.  https://deadspin.com/the-chud-who-heckled-russell-westbrook-has-been-permane-1833244144
Russell Westbrook has been nothing but a professional and a great human being off the court and he gets subjected to such a crazy amount of hate and ridicule. It's honestly pretty insane.
[Video of Russell Westbrook having popcorn dumped on him](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zQSPt3huvvo)
"That's what kills me about these dudes (popcorn man included). Like these are obviously dick moves, that should not happen. But I really have no respect cuz it's like yo if they were chest up with anyone in the L, nevermind the monster that is Russell Westbrook, they would be nothing but respectful. Absolutely scared to death if any kind of confrontation arose. Bitch made mayne."
Breaking: Some Guy on Reddit says he wouldn't fight Russell Westbrook
Are your eyes fucked up? Lebron James and Russell Westbrook are not skin and bones lmao.
"It’s all fan entitlement, not being able to distinguish the disparity in power and importance in this situation between some random fan and Russell Westbrook. I mean there is a reason one of my most downvoted comments in this thread is talking about how individual fans don’t matter and should hold no power or importance including being able to disrespect the players like this. Guess you can’t expect much else out of a forum from sports fans who have likely never been on the other end of the conversation lol"
&gt;  if Paul George played with LeBron for a decade  No one in NBA history has had better teammates than lebron and he's still only 4-6 in the finals  HALL-OF-FAME TEAMMATES  LeBron:  * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Russell Westbrook * Carmelo Anthony * Derrick Rose * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal  Jordan:  * Pippen * Rodman * Kukoc * Parish
"I think the closest current day players to MJ when it comes to pure intensity, competitiveness and will to win would be Jimmy Butler and Russell Westbrook."
"Jimmy also hinted that he fell out with Brown because Brown favored players that Jimmy didn't trust on the court. He didn't mention the name, but his facial expression hinted that it was a very big name on the roster and very well could have been Simmons.  There's certain players that I've always seen eye to eye with: Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, those types. I've never been a fan of Ben Simmons and I can definitely see Jimmy Buckets not feeling him either."
"I first watched the NBA because of the Kobe-Shaq (retired celebrity) Lakers, and the Rise of T-Mac so those were my favorites growing up, until LeBron showed up. Safe to say, there are a lot of things to like about watching him.   Least liked, as a person, will be Karl Malone. He’s a pedo and does not deserve to get respect for his accomplishments no matter how great he is on the court. Never watched him and don’t plan on watching his sorry ass. Should be in jail.   Strictly on the court tho? Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons. Both can’t shoot for shit. Both have been the reason a lot of their teams haven’t gone farther than they should have. Russ is too damn aggressive while Ben is soo damn passive. Different sides of the same coin if you ask me. I just hope Russ gets over himself to help Bron get his 5th Ring."
"Russell Westbrook doesn’t fuck up our offense by shooting volume 3’s, doesn’t play hero ball at the end of games, improves his decision-making and lessens his TOs."
"Agree 100%. I think a lot of guys in the league currently, like Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook, would be a lot more outspoken if they didn't have to share a locker room with anti-vaxxers."
"One, DEATH ISN'T THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF COVID, HOLY FUCK DOES THIS STILL NEED TO BE EXPLAINED?  Covid can fuck you up, even if it doesn't kill you.  KAT lost 50 pounds due to covid, Jayson Tatum needed to use an inhaler for all of last season, and Christian Wood and Russell Westbrook both got smacked around by it.  Also, just because they can't die from it, doesn't mean they can't spread it to people that will. Just one example: There was a wedding in Vermont that, as a result, killed three people due to covid spreading. None of those three people attended the wedding.  And two:  &gt; instead of older white people  It's killing more minorities than white people! This has been a talking point for months!  &gt; And I say that as someone who’s been vaccinated  Being vaccinated doesn't mean you know a damn thing."
"I think its hilarious u kids talking about Russell Westbrook. u wouldnt say this stuff to him at Russ, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol"
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.

"All stars play badly sometimes. Look at klay Thompson and Russell Westbrook. You’re just diminishing them to prop up Giannis. He won in the most injury plagued year in league history. He’s a great player, all time top 25 but let’s not overreact from a very strange playoff run"
That he was college roommates and BFFs with Russell Westbrook at UCLA.
"&gt; Washington GM Tommy Sheppard attests that Westbrook was “professional” and never demanded a trade from the team.  &gt; “Russell actually never asked to move on. He just said, ‘If I can get to the Lakers, that’d be something I would love to do. If not, I’ll be back here.’ I said, ‘What about the Clippers?’ He said, ‘Hell no.’ So Russell was happy being here and we were very grateful for him being here.”  Source:https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/wizards-gm-says-russell-westbrook-never-asked-move-washington?amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true"
It’s legit remarkable that a guy as good as Russell Westbrook has played damn near a whole career and been the best player on his team for legit 1-2 whole seasons
He had a high enough GPA to get admitted to Stanford on academics alone  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9114915/oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-unique-style-the-court-espn-magazine
"LeBron wasn't that good by his standards in the Finals  He played like Russell Westbrook, not like LeBron James  There are plenty of examples of him performing efficiently with substandard teammates, he had a back injury in that series and wasn't able to perform to his normal level"
Russell Westbrook didn't miss a game for his first 5 seasons
We've got Aaron Gordon too.  And your team literally just turned a bunch of garbage into Russell Westbrook.
"Reddit: Listen, Bradley, going from no vax to vaxxed is like going from being teammates with John Wall to Russell Westbrook.  Bradley Beal: Hmmm, I think I get it.... so Kyle Kuzma is the booster shot?"
"Russell Westbrook was the only player who stopped KD from winning a championship at OKC, and he can stop KD again."
"1 a guy like Russell Westbrook was virtually uneffected the first time he had Covid. So now that he has the antibodies you think its going to hit him like a locomotive? Unlikely 2 Then your problem isn't with the unvaxxed. You problem is with the powers that be that have ruled children 12 and under cant get it. Show me your letter to any news station or CDC complaining about that? Yup, you never complained. And BTW, why are children not approved to take it? I thought it was safe. If its safe why the apprehension? Tell me the difference in the physical make up between a child who is 12 and a child who is 13..There isn't much of any.  3 your problem is with the cities who made free choice illigal 4 your problem here is with the league who would make a player miss out on money because of their choice. 5 haha #5 is laughable. Do you have the same outrage when these players get busted for drugs, besting their girlfriends or caught at strip joints.  6 chicken pox vax and flu vax are two diffeentt things. One you are protected for life the other you have to get a booster every year."
"Maybe people who are hesitant don't need or want a vaccine. A better question is, Why would a NBA player want a vaccine. Pick a player..Why would Russell Westbrook take a vax?  #1 He's already had Covid making him 12-17 times more protected than someone has had any vaccine ( cited Israeli study on t-cells and antiboidies) #2 When he got Covid he barely knew it."
No way Kyrie belongs in the same group of players as Russell Westbrook. Russ like top 35
[Russ seeing the clownery happening with the Wizards](https://c.tenor.com/NHQLfISCv_AAAAAM/russell-westbrook-nba.gif)
"russell westbrook was a totally different animal in 2016-17, he is not at all that same player and the fact that you think he is just because he’s still putting up triple doubles is laughable. obviously he hasn’t fallen as far as derrick rose but the drop has still been significant."
"i doubt any of the lakers are winning MVP but if one does i doubt it’s gonna be russ. please stop with the triple double crap its cool and all but in terms of affecting winning russell westbrook and his triple dubs do not compare to actual MVP caliber players and what they can do. triple dubs don’t outshine terrible efficiency, terrible spacing, bad defense, high amounts of turnovers and rebounding stats for a player in general are overrated af"
"A lineup with LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook isn't intimidating at all?  LMFAO"
"It’s wild to me that we list a lineup with Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook and say they’ll be terrible on offense. If they are healthy, that lineup won’t be terrible at offense."
"Ah yes, Russell ""Rings"" Westbrook, knower of championships things. Giver of advice on how to win at basketball with tips like ""tip the ball to yourself to get more rebounds on the stat sheet"" and ""if you throw an infinite number of balls at a hoop, some are bound to go in"""
You don't win a Finals MVP and two titles without being a playmaker you fucking troglodyte. You fucking Lakers fans are so delusional. The Lakers have the oldest team in the league didn't even make it to their own conference Finals and yet somehow Lakers fans think they're winning a title this year because they got Russell 'pad the stats' Westbrook.
"The Los Angeles Lakers may have landed Russell Westbrook this offseason, but he wasn't their first choice.  Bill Oram, Shams Charania and Sam Amick of The Athletic reported the Lakers initially wanted to target Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard to team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. When it became clear they weren't going to get either Beal or Lillard, the team shifted its focus to ""more realistic"" targets.  No shit"
Russell Westbrook is about to be on his fourth team in four years despite being incredibly talented.  That should tell you everything you need to know about him.
"It certainly could be, but a lot of reputable sites reported it so it is at least as likely to be true as all the other rumours that people eat up here.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/russell-westbrook-wanted-to-team-up-with-then-free-agent-kawhi-leonard-on-the-clippers-in-2019-per-report/"
Tbh Russell Westbrook wasn't even a top 5 teammates for Beal in his years in LA and Beal would have asked to the team trade Russ asap (as they did).
"Excerpt:   &gt; In the two months that followed their first-round playoff flop against Phoenix, when Davis’ groin injury left them pulling up lame, the Lakers explored the prospect of trading for such stars as Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook. The process unfolded well beyond the team’s front office’s search, with James setting up a war room of his own at his Brentwood estate for some in-person player meetings while leading remote communications in other conversations."
Fun facts : his name also triple double itself RUSSELL WESTBROOK III
Nope he has basically no scoring gravity. Def not as good as prime Russell Westbrook  He was a good passer sure but pounding the ball and passing to wide open scorers is not valuable playmaking  Idc ab rn but at his prime with the Celtics he had no shot
"Bulls, so:   Lonzo-Jason Kidd  LaVine-Russell Westbrook  DeMar-Vince Carter  PWill- OG Anunoby  Vucevic- Wang Zhizhi   Actually a pretty great team"
BULLS:  Jason Kidd  Russell Westbrook  Vince Carter  OG Anunoby  and...Mehmet Okur. Unless you were really high on Wang Zhizhi at some point
"I like the confidence, but he's not quite top 5 yet.  Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, (even) Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Jamaal Murray, Steph Curry, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard are all better.  You could argue he is a top 10 PG. He is definitely in direct competition with the likes of De'Aaron Fox and D'Angelo Russell.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Forgot Westbrook. Yeah, Morant isn't quite top 10 yet."

Russell Westbrook on the Lakers tbh
"and yet, Russell Westbrook"
"&gt; not a popular op but i actually agree with him. Dude's game is still the same as when he entered the league. And funny enough, he's also got the 'russell westbrook' attitude to playing i.e. stubbornness. Philly should trade him while half the league still thinks he's good.  The Prophet of our time."
"The first time Russell Westbrook lost to the Sixers was in 2019, his 11th season in the league. Ben Simmons embarrassed the Sixers more in 11 seconds than Russ did in 11 years."
Lol one guy dumped his pop corn on Russell Westbrook and got banned from the stadium
"Ohhhhh we talking about statistics?!  Carmelo has 27,370 total career points in 1191 games played averaging out to **22.98 points a game**.

That Russell Westbrook can’t play defense
Russell Westbrook. Its a shame he had to go to the Lakers
Yea still confused about Russell Westbrook. He’s barely used when lebron is calling all the shots. pointless addition.
"I believe the final 25 will be:      11 Locks: Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Kawhi Leonard, Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Dolph Schayes, Dwyane Wade, Dominique Wilkins  6 Probables: Carmelo Anthony, Billy Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Robert Parish, Russell Westbrook  2 Likely but on the bubble: Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman  5 Squeaking in: Ray Allen, Dave Debusschere, Grant Hill, Bob McAdoo, Tracy McGrady  10 Biggest new omissions: Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Dikembe Mutombo, Tony Parker, Ben Wallace   4 Omissions from top 50: Dave Bing, Pete Maravich, Earl Monroe, Lenny Wilkens"
"1. Russell Westbrook finals MVP and Bill Simmons never says the words ""4 rounds"" and Russ in the same sentence ever again 2. The Celtics to finish just below the play in tournament 3. Ja Morant to make the second round by dunking ON EVERYONE ALL THE TIME 4. LET DONOVAN MITCHELL BE FREE FROM UTAH 5. Ben Simmons trade 6. Klay Thompson to catch fire for a few quarters 7.

Celtics should build around Jaylen and trade him away for triple double machine former MVP Russell Westbrook.
you traded for Russell Westbrook lol
"All team subs are pretty bad tbh. I'm in the Pistons team sub and there is a lot of dumb shit that goes down in there too. We just have the issue of being the 2nd largest fanbase on Reddit so we just got volume, Russell Westbrook."
"Its a lot about the lineups  Of course Russ/Baze/LBJ/AD/DJ is going to struggle, its ridiculous to ever try that lineup. It kept up because LBJ was shooting so well but its never going to put Russ in any sort of position to succeed.   So will Russ/Rondo together. If Vogel doesn't learn that soon theres no system in the world that can really help that.  AD should be at the 5, LeBron at the 4, 2 capable shooters next to them and Russ. Thats should work very well offensivley.   After that basically what we saw in preseason, [this breaks it down](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/10/15/22729132/frank-vogel-new-lakers-new-offense-scheme-spacing-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-cutting)"
"I can't believe the commentary on this thread. Everyone is saying the Lakers can't treat him as a role player because he's paid too much or is bound to improve as the season wears? It doesn't matter what his contract is and it doesn't matter what his history is. For me personally I envisioned Russell Westbrook as a role player from the moment the trade was announced. It's time for him to change his game to something that minimizes his usage where said usage is not helpful and redirects his energy to things like defense. He can play his preferred role when LeBron is on the bench as a LeBron substitute. His time should be staggered away from LeBron as much as possible and maximized alongside young, fast defenders that can create turnovers and score in transition. And I don't think he should play more than 25-30 minutes a game.  Something needs to be tried or Russell Westbrook will never shake his reputation as a player who is not conducive to winning at the highest level. The fact that he is overpaid is irrelevant and a sunk cost at this point -- the Lakers can offset that anyway by overpaying in terms of luxury taxes and by having gathered a deep roster of role playing talent at the vet-minimum to flesh out the rest of the roster. This is the only way this experiment can work out."
"Breaking news: Russell Westbrook to join Ben Simmons in Sacramento, Golden 1 Center already removing the three point lines from the hardwood"
"Yeah, I think a lot of times the problem is “greatest” is a subjective term. If you put Russell Westbrook in Oscar’s era he probably puts up 50/15/15, so how do you account for that? How do we evaluate Bill Russell’s rings when many of them were won in an 8-team league? I guess that’s part of what makes it fun to argue it."
Russell Westbrook for Deandre Ayton.
"Yes, they downgraded from a single digit scorer in the playoffs to Russell Westbrook who led the league in assists last year"
"Just cuz I’m bored at work….  I’d say Kyrie is in the top 20 discussion, id have no problem leaving him out and no problem with those that include him  In no particular order and help me as I’m sure I’m leaving some out (maybe even obvious ones)  1.	Magic 2.	The Big O 3.	Isiah Thomas 4.	Stockton 5.	Steph Curry 6.	CP3 7.	Steve Nash 8.	JKidd 9.	 Gary Payton 10. Bob Cousy 11. Walt “Clyde” Frazier  12. Nate “Tiny” Archibald 13. Allen Iverson 14.Sidney Moncrief 15. Dennis Johnson 16. Chauncey Billups 17. Tony Parker 18. Russell Westbrook 19. Penny Hardaway 20. Tim Hardaway 21. Lenny Wilkens 22. Damian Lillard 23. Dave Bing   I can see an argument for Kyrie over a number of the guys on the list and certainly not an argument for top 10. Kyrie has a chance to still build to his legacy, but the last few years he’s absolutely torpedo’d his legacy…  We shall see"
"Trade suggestion:  * **PHI gets**: Damian Lillard * **LAL gets**: CJ McCollum, Norman Powell * **POR gets**: Russell Westbrook, Talen Horton-Tucker, Tyrese Maxey, Ben Simmons, 2022 FRP (via PHI), 2024 FRP (via PHI), 2026 FRP (via PHI), 2028 FRP (via PHI), 2025 FRP (via LAL)"
"ESPN Breaking News!   LeBron said he told Russell Westbrook to go home ... ""I just don’t want him."""
"It isn’t that hard to believe that a guy like Russell Westbrook - who seems to be intense 24/7 about everything - would be especially hard on himself after a rough preseason and poor first game back in his hometown.   And I don’t see a problem with teammates reassuring him and staying positive. That’s what teammates do, and he definitely knows where LeBron and AD of all players are coming from."
Media tomorrow:   Lebron told Russell Westbrook to go home… “I just don’t want him…”
Exactly Steph was trying to outWestbrook Russell Westbrook out there stat padding and being inefficient. Only Westbrook is allowed to do that.
type in Russell Westbrook on twitter and the whole world is on his ass
"LeBron with an exceptionally generous heart, just basically running an orphanage out there - his own biological children, the Toronto Raptors 2013-8, Russell Westbrook."
"It's tale as old as time: r/nba shitting on Russell Westbrook after a bad game.  Russ is what he is at this point. It's one bad game, there's 81 more.  Russ is gonna lose you some games but the hope is in a 7 game series you somehow get Bestbrooke for at least 2 them and hopefully 4. Russ will probably have a Bestbrooke game in the playoffs were AD is off and the Lakers when bc of him."
If you're a Lakers fan. I feel sorry for y'all. Lmfao. This year will be 2018 all over again for LeBron. Russell Westbrook will not change. I keep saying this but nobody listens. This style of play is hard wired into him. There is no spacing on that fcking floor.  The warriors just kept throwing threes loool.  RIP LAL
Russell Westbrook really sucks. I don’t give a fuck what he averaged    Westbrook is so far past his prime. He isn’t a top 150 player in the league if your goal is to win a tire
"They'd be able to hide it if the team with LeBron, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook had more than *five* offensive rebounds. That's terrible."
"What kind of father figure LeBron is to you, Russell Westbrook?"
Rich Paul and LeBron James are conspiring to get Ben Simmons in LA for Russell Westbrook. Change my mind.
"LeBron said he told Russell Westbrook to go home and watch the comedy “Trainwreck” staring he and Amy Schumer, or be with his children — to do something that will make him smile and keep the loss in perspective: “I just don’t want him to be so hard on himself.”"
"there was this big write-up in the athletic about the lakers off-season.  lebron's first choice (in consultation with AD, jared dudley, etc) was basically russ.

"&gt; Russell Westbrook was their best player tonight, going +21 in 35 mins for the Warriors.  Bro..."
"Breaking: LeBron James tells Russell Westbrook to ""go home"": ""I just ... want him to be ... hard on himself"""
Russell Westbrook number matching his impact on the game.
Plays against Russell Westbrook on opening day and gets a triple double. Lmfao you have to love it
Now that Westbrook played 1 game out of 82. I have dragged down by the cesspool reality that we have Russell WestBrick as our point guard.
Aka just Russell Westbrook on a min? No.
Steph Curry with a very rare Triple Double and Russell Westbrook with a Single Triple! What a fun night of NBA.
russell westbrook
Russell Westbrook was a huge mistake. They’d be way better off with Ben Simmons to be honest lol
"I think the big picture plan for the Lakers was pretty clearly to go after Chris Paul, and he would’ve been a great fit.   Problem is, his success with the Suns last year was too much for him to walk away from and when PHX offered him the bag as well, the Lakers had to move to plan B. Which was somehow Russell Westbrook. Unfortunate."
Russell Westbrook   That's it. That's the comment.
"If Russell Westbrook is on your team, you don’t have an NBA championship team"
THANK YOU RUSSELL WESTBROOK
It’s difficult to win rings with Russell Westbrook as your point guard
Steph had a Russell Westbrook statline tonight
Steph with a Russell Westbrook statline  Russ with a Shanghai Sharks statline
RUSSELL WESTBROOK WOKE UP FEELING DANGEROUS 💪🏿🐐🔥💯                                                        8 POINTS    4-13 FROM THE FIELD    0-4 FROM 3 🧱   4 TURNOVERS    13 HANDSHAKES    5 BARKS 🐶    FUTURE FOOT LOCKER EMPLOYEE???
Russell Westbrook trick yall man  People talking bout “big 3” lmao
"Just as I predicted:   	- Curry with a Draymond statline of inefficient triple double  	- AD and LeBron would put up 70 points on high efficiency  Jordan Poole and Russell ""Single game +/-  doesn't matter"" Westbrook  would still bring the Warriors the win"
"I know no one has the guts to say it, but as a die hard Lakers fan I think I speak for all of us when I say we don’t want Russell Westbrook here. He is a liability and is holding this elite team back It would be the best to send him elsewhere in exchange for a few 2nd round picks"
&gt; its historically difficult to be russell westbrook ~~against good defenses~~
Russell Westbrook with the stat pad dunk lmao.
*Russell Westbrook
It’s historically difficult to be Russell Westbrook against good defenses
thought the Lakers signed Russell Westbrook not his brother Wussel Restbrook
"What was the point of getting an explosive PG in Westbrook to have him play like this? I know, first game, but wtf is this? And him shooting 3s? Lmao Russell, bro, you don’t do that."
Russell Westbrook doesn’t even have a go to move to get to when he’s struggling
Russell Westbrook can't play off ball. This isn't going to work.
Would the Lakers be better off with Russell Westbrook or Isaiah Thomas on the floor right now :|
&gt;and Russell Westbrook....And you’re fucking losing.  And this surprises you.. how?
Russell Westbrook for Ben Simmons trade?
I still have no idea why Russell Westbrook is on the Lakers. Surely he's gotta be trade bait for later in the season
"#You have LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook.  Don’t matter if it’s the early 2000s or the early 2020s  #And you’re fucking losing."
Russell Westbrook is doing his best Russell Westbrook impression
"When someone said “Russell Westbrook really just runs around”, this is what they are talking about"
Russell Westbrook?  More like ... Russuck Westbad!!!  LMAO got'em 😎😎😎
is Russell Westbrook emotionally prepared for what’s going to happen to him with laker fans every time he has a 4 for 18 game and they lose
Russell Westbrook
Who is Russell Westbrook?
his name is russell westbrook
Russell Westbrook has entered the chat
Russell ‘Abloh’ Westbrook
Something about Russell Westbrook
"You forgot this team now has Russell Westbrook, the worst shooting point guard in the league aside from Ben Simmons"
Why is no one talking about Russell Westbrook. So underrated and overrated. He averaged X/Y/Z and A/B/C splits. The hate is in another stratosphere and it's not even close.
"[AD said he was expecting to mostly play center this season](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/9/28/22698674/anthony-davis-la-lakers-center-starting-lineup-lebron-james-russell-westbrook), guess we gotta wait and see if that's actually legit"
That team didn’t have Russell Westbrook fucking their spacing
"**BUCKS TRADE:** Giannis Antetokounmpo, Thanasis Antetokounmpo.  **LAKERS TRADE:** Russell Westbrook and all those picks that they somehow haven't already traded.  Easy!"
Who else should they have added?  I would’ve loved to see Embiid [as Hakeem posting up Shaq](https://images.app.goo.gl/Uip5Vaad3tKDc6Gx8)  Zion as Charles Barkley grabbing a board  Russell Westbrook as Oscar Robertson
"Joel Embiid literally said that he felt that the turning point of game 7 was when they had a layup and ended with a FT. I couldn't be Ben Simmons in that situation, i would've legit said that i thought the turning point of the game was when my center had eight turnovers and my 200 million small forward shot 8-24 from the field in the most important game of the year.  Harris played like absolute horse shit in Games 5 and 7, Embiid was turning the ball over as if he was Russell Westbrook, but despite all of that the entire organization blamed all on Simmons."
"Not really?  The Pascal contract is definitely big, but OG and Fred combined make less than Russell Westbrook lol, and would most likely be paid more if they went into free agency this offseason"
Currently - (Kyrie - previous seasons ) All Time - Russell Westbrook
"Gobert’s been a more impactful player than Lillard for years.   Adrian Dantley is the most underrated player ever, he was KD before KD but did it without a 3 point shot.  Hakeem is slightly overrated on this sub because he wasn’t a fantastic offensive player for most of his career. 51% from the field as a center is decidedly meh and the fact the he’s the go to guy for magical post moves instead of Kevin McHale is absurd.   Isiah Thomas cost the Pistons 2 championships in 87 and 88. People only remember his fantastic game 6 in 88, but he was under 40% from the field in every other game that series. Every criticism of Russell Westbrook applies to Thomas, frankly to a greater degree. He gets way to much credit for their two championships-those rosters were stacked top to bottom. Not even close to a top 10 all time point guard by individual ability."
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."

Russell Westbrook
"Bird never averaged the usage that Westbrook did either. He never had the ball nearly as much as Russell.  Larry was a great passer and, if it had been a priority for him, could've averaged 10 assists. Same thing with Magic. He didn't tell Kareem to let him have all the uncontested rebounds, but if he had forced the issue, he could've had double digit rebound averages.   Kidd didn't chase triple doubles nearly as much as Russell does either. But if he had focused more on them, he would've gotten more. Very few people have ever had the ball in their hand as much as Westbrook though"
"I hope Russell works out so bad in LA.   This sub will not be able to stomach the Skip Baylass quality logic LakerNation will have once Russell has a ring. I have 5 ""Russell Westbrook carried Durant"" posts in my drafts right now."
"I’m not comparing him to the rest of the league though, such as big men, I’m comparing him to SGs as his contributions to Boston can be compared with other guard’s contributions to their teams.  He’s the 10th highest paid SG, 26th highest paid Guard going into 2021-22 and performing with the aforementioned stats. He’s paid accurately, not overpaid, not underpaid. Only guards that are making more than him and aren’t better are De’Aaron Fox ($28M), D’Angelo Russell ($30M), CJ McCollum ($30.8M), Ben Simmons ($33M), John Wall ($44.3M) - those guys are probably overpaid, even if it is slightly. Maybe throw Klay Thompson ($37.9M) because we haven’t seen him in 2 years, and Westbrook at $44.2M. I wouldn’t say he should be paid at their levels because those guys are overpaid, hence Brown is paid accurately for his contributions."
Are you Russell Westbrook? Because you’re 1 for 5 on takes.
"When both teams are even in points, Russell Westbrook feels that OKC is at a great advantage and thus he does not hesitate to shoot a 3. When OKC is 5 points behind, Westbrook thinks that OKC is at a small advantage, and he so he shoots a 3 to secure their ""lead"". When OKC is behind 10 points, Westbrook thinks that OKC is at a disadvantage and so he looks for a 3 to regain control of the game. When OKC is 20 points behind, Westbrook thinks that the team has reached a desperate situation and they are only waiting passively for their death if he does not shoot a 3."
Russell Westbrook: he’s from the west coast.
Russell Westbrook is from the west and plays in the west  (2 more days)
"And vice versa too, Javale McGee, Dwight Howard, Markieff Morris, and Russell Westbrook."
"Context matters.     Russell Westbrook averages 23 points a game on 18.8 FGA for his career. Doesn't sound that bad but when you factor in that he was playing with an MJ tier level scorer in KD for most of his career and has taken more shots than KD for his career, it looks awful.     MJ was surrounded by bums in his first couple of years in the league and even when the bulls got amazing, the bulls never really had other great offensive options that were relatively close to as good as Jordan.      Westbrook on the other hand has played with 2 MVPs, a guy who finished in top 3 MVP voting, and another guy who was 2nd in PPG last year and he still has managed to average more FGA than anyone he has ever played with despite all of them being better offensive players than Westbrook."
"That's why.. he didn't have a chance.. the injuries. And that word makes all the difference. Prime DRose never existed, so of course prime Russ is better than peak DRose. If Rose reached his prime, he could have potentially been better. If you truly wanna get the point of ""prime Russ is better than peak Rose and prime Dame"" across, you can mention that not only did he lead a non-playoff team to the 4 seed while averaging a triple double (a feat many if not all alltime greats considered unrepeatable since the days of Big O), then he averaged a triple double for two more seasons, could have done it again in Houston had he not been injured and caught CoViD, then did it again the following year. Russell Westbrook will go down as the most underrated player of our generation, if not of all time.  We are gonna miss this man when he's gone."
Controversial only for r/nba but I think the Lakers are going to cup or throw out of the roster Russell Westbrook. At very least I bet the will bench him in the 4th when things matter the most (aka playoff bball).
"If he’s mad enough Russell Westbrook.  I’ve seen him body KD, Giannis, and GoberL"
James Harden averaged 29/11/8 on 44/34/84 shooting splits.  Russell Westbrook averaged 31/10/10 on 42/34/84 shooting splits.  So they basically shot it at the same clip and but Russ scored more. So please explain why Harden should've won MVP.
"I understand what you're saying, but I can't agree with it fully. Luck *does* play a role, whether we like it or not. In basketball and in life. Russell Westbrook played with a similar level of athleticism and above-the-rim type of play as Rose did, and yet Russ has managed to play in 7 seasons with at least 80 games.  In fact, the two of them played in pretty much every single game during their first three years in the league. And then the injury happened. So yeah, sometimes shit does happen. Nothing right or wrong about it. It's just a part of life."
Russell Westbrook will get benched in a key playoff game/moment.
"Russell Westbrook is more valuable to the Lakers than Anthony Davis, and LeBron becomes the oldest MVP"
Finally. He is now just enlarged Russell Westbrook with these rule changes.
who the fuck tells you that because there are a number of guards I would not be shocked to have people claim are better defenders than Steph but Russell Westbrook does not make that list
"for a comparison, Russell Westbrook is averaging 20/8.4/8.1 on worse shooting and awful defense while DJ is still as good as he was when he was all defense a few years back. JUST PUT SOME RESPECT ON THE MANS NAME."
I think Russ is a good regular season addition for the most part. He can carry a lot of the load whenever LeBron/AD need rest or are injured.   But I’m honestly really nervous for when playoffs roll around. Because asking Russell Westbrook to put up a good/great playoffs will be a tall task as it’s something he hasn’t done in 4-5 years now. Overall I’d say it’s a B addition as of now.
He is truly our very own Russell Westbrook
Who the hell had them as favourites? They lost one of their best players and replaced him with Russell Westbrook
Would you rather have one Kyrie Irving not playing or one Russell Westbrook playing?
Because whether or not they like it they signed up for the Russell Westbrook experience
In today's game; i'd say Mike Conley &amp; Russell Westbrook (despite the streaky start to the season) but I think Jrue Holliday behind Giannis &amp; Middleton is the right answer.
"He is Kawhi with Russell Westbrook type of athleticism , I think he would be pretty good"

Trade this man for Russell Westbrook already!
Imagine thinking Russell Westbrook is a winning basketball player in 2021
Nah Dangelo Russell was definitely better than this Westbrook. I'd probably take Fisher over him too.
"~~Michael Scott~~ Russell Westbrook - ""Sometimes I'll just start a possession and I don't even know where it's going.  I just hope I'll find it along the way."""

I’ve reached a point where’d I’d rather see austin reaves take the final shot over Russell Westbrook…what a timeline
the russell westbrook experience
russell westbrook is a terrorist
"*One in LA.  Also one at home, humiliating Russell Westbrook on his return as a Laker to OKC."
You know what doesn’t work in the NBA? Dismantling your title winning team for a bunch of 35 year olds and Russell Westbrook when your real need was shooters or do nothing.      We are a round 1 exit team if not playin even at full strength
"&gt;27/6/5 and a +6, but also 10/23 with 4 turnovers, one being down 2 with 30 seconds left, and a missed game tying attempt   So essentially, the full Russell Westbrook experience."
"Russell Westbrook needs a better cast around him, not this fluky ass team is forcing him to play this way. This ain't on him!"
The Russell Westbrook experience
Russell gonna Westbrook
"A Russell Westbrook pull up three is very suboptimal if you wanna win the game. Disappointed that they didn't go to Carmelo, who was shooting 50% from 3 in the game."
Russell Westbrook still has OKC in his heart
HERE COMES RUSSELL WESTBROOK
"""Russell Westbrook of coaching"" LMAO"
cause Doc Rivers the Russell Westbrook of coaching… wait until the playoffs
Russell Westbrook hits two threes in some games lol. Nobody gives a single fuck if he shoots. Sixers fans really need to give it up. Maxey is not saving them this season and probably won't even be the All-Star creator they must have if they wanna be serious contenders (especially without Simmons).
Russell “Triple Dubs and Swag but 20 Point Losses” Westbrook
Russell “Innings Eater” Westbrook
The Russell Westbrook effect
Is he Russell Westbrook?
"Except for most his prime Russ's advanced impact metrics had him as one of the top players in the NBA.   While he was never traditionally the efficient high volume scorer, his TS% was league average for his prime and he added tons of value to the Thunder with his playmaking. Advanced stats loved Russell Westbrook when he was in his prime lol."
Bro you're comparing Ja 8 games into his 3rd season to 9th season Russell Westbrook.
"Ah yes, unlike Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Kevin Love."
"Yeah no I get what you’re saying. And I’m just pointing out that it takes very little energy to type out a comment on Reddit. Like yeah I wonder all the things I could accomplish with the 5 minutes I saved not talking about Russell Westbrook. Maybe build a spaceship or something, who knows."
I made a Russell Westbrook stat post and a Christian Wood stat post  Guess which of the two got more traction and made the front page  The front page is littered with Lakers discourse cause it’s the most polarizing team and the posts about them garner attention. Not because people only talk about them
Russell Westbrook with another Triple Double
"Unless you're the Lakers, the basketball Gods punish you for winning a championship. Rockets won back-to-back and since then it's been Stockton buzzer-beaters, Yao and T-Mac injuries, Harden dating a Kardashian, 0-27, Paul's hamstring, the Russell Westbrook playoff experience...We're on year 26 and counting since a title."
“Russell Westbrook has shot under 40% from the field in four consecutive postseasons” is an objective fact. You can look it up if you don’t believe me.  What’s truly embarrassing is plugging your ears and going “lalalala” when objective facts say something you dislike.
"Do you understand the concepts of recency bias and small sample sizes? Genuinely asking.  Let’s do a thought exercise. Russell Westbrook, a notable poor shooter, gets hot and shoots 40% from 3 for a month. Should he be considered a good 3 point shooter - yes or no?"
Welcome to the Russell Westbrook experience
If the Lakers win the 1 seed that means the big 3 is working well together.   Now how the fuck does Lebron James win MVP with a healthy and successful Anthony Davis AND Russell Westbrook on his team tearing shit?  No Bron ain’t gonna win MVP and honestly that’s not even the only reason.
Same age and draft as Russell Westbrook and Derrick Rose. It's weird
but it’s funny because when draymond stat hunts they usually win. It’s not like a Russell Westbrook situation
"For me, it's the big shot by Westbrook.   This shot won the game, eliminated the Nuggets from playoff contention, recorded a 50 point triple double, and arguably clinched the MVP award, all in the game where he set a new season record of 42 triple doubles.  https://ca.nba.com/news/this-date-in-nba-history-april-9-russell-westbrook-50-point-triple-double-game-winner-denver-nuggets-2017/16g857af78wob14t1uqxnqvz10"
Russell Westbrook is gonna go to Reddit HQ and destroy the servers himself if they don’t cut down on these Giddey posts
"&gt;When he shares the court with Russell Westbrook, LeBron is taking 47 percent of his shots from distance. But when he plays without his new All-Star teammate, that figure is just 35 percent—the same proportion as last season. James’s free throw rate is also three times as high with Westbrook off the court.  the Westbrook-lebron fit is as bad as everyone thought it would be. you're supposed to try to give lebron more space as he ages, not less"
*Russell Westbrook dislikes this*
"Fvv doesnt have a higher ceiling than lowrys career though. The metaphor you used doesnt make sense and I tried rly hard to see it from so many angles and tried using other players. The key thing to say is cole is better atm, but suggs has a higher ceiling. That being said, there are players like lowry and Russell westbrook for example, where lowry is the better player but russ has a higher ceiling given his physical profile and athleticism."
He’s like a dollar store Russell Westbrook.
"Tatum shouldn't speak on Kobe again until he develops that mamba mentality himself. He's closer to that Harden/Westbrook/Melo mentality where the desire and drive for winning is secondary, tertiary to putting up numbers/highlights/fans that defend his toxic basketball performance.  Now let me play the counterpoint: Kobe had Jerry West, Phil Jackson, Shaq, Horace Grant, AC Green to learn how to win very early on in his career. Where's Russell, Bird, Pierce, KG to take Tatum and Brown under their wings and show them how to win?? Wyc has done a piss poor job fostering a culture to where the former Celtics are intertwined with today's team. The Lakers have done a good job intertwining yesterday's champions with today's teams.  These guys are going to learn how to win WHEN they're somewhere else, in a more stable environment, cause when your enigmatic starting point guard/role player is viewed by the higher ups as your franchise player and your all stars as secondary people, I wouldn't be inspired to win there either."
"Heat, Warriors, Cavs, Grizzlies.  And I know he is bad and evil but I'll never get tired of the Russell Westbrook Russian Roulette show"

Of course it is we’re talking about Russell Westbrook here.
No body wants to admit its Russell Westbrook
"Spare me the sob story. If you're going to try to make this an argument it's not even after I clarified, then yeah, I'm going to get annoyed. You want so badly to make this a discussion of who is better between Russ and Wade when that's not really the case. I can admit that Wade was overall a better individual player in most aspects and fit with LeBron. I shouldn't have to point that out consdering where this discussion started but I clearly have to to prevent you from continuing to attack your straw man.   &gt;How about you actually look at the percentages I provided you? I know you are dense but it really is not that hard to look at the percentages.   Nearly all the percentages are insigificant enough to be the difference between ""floor space"" and ""worst shooter ever"" lmfao. Why does it have to be your percentages, anyway? I don't even know where the fuck you got your numbers but I made it clear mine are from bball ref.   &gt;I am comparing Wade's shooting percentages in the years that he played with LeBron, because that is the most relevant years to this discussion.  Oh, so you mean compare some of Wade's most efficient seasons in the middle of his prime to the entirety of WB's career including his rookie years and decline? No, of course it's ridiculous to suggest that's an assymetrical comparison.  &gt;We are going to have to agree to disagree on 3 to 10 feet providing space. You obviously think it doesn't and I think it does.  Have you ever played basketball? Assuming you're a normal sized guy, now imagine NBA sized players and how little distance that is to them. If all defenders were within 3-10 feet of the three point line, would you consider that good spacing? I think that would be extremely cluttered. Do you see any floor spacers who are standing from 3-10 feet? Hell, no. That's where stars go to work in the mid-range.   &gt;Regardless you would have not seen teams scheme against Dwyane Wade like the Lakers or the Jazz did against Russell Westbrook in the playoffs.  In my first reply to you, I clearly linked a video showing how the synergy between Wade and LeBron had holes due to Wade's inability to shoot.   &gt;My point was that Wade was a much better overall player and that is why despite him not being the best shooter in the NBA he could still make it work with LeBron because he's better on offense, defense, off-ball movement, ball security, etc.  Cool, point, but ultimately irrelevant because: 1) nobody said that Wb was better or that he'd pair better with LeBron 2) we're talking about offensive synergy so defense is irrelevant. As I've said before, this is symply a comparison of two ball dominant scorers who can't shoot pairing with LeBron.     &gt;Miami LeBron was much better back then too.  LeBron is still the same role (primary ballhandler/creator) he was back then. I'm not saying he's as good or that WB's as good as Wade or that they'll combine as effectively.   &gt;And I really don't care about your opinion either.   That's why you took 30 minutes typing this up and why you're going type a reply to this?"
How is this your takeaway on a team with Russell Westbrook and Lebron James
"It’s actually one of the most fascinating phenomenons in the basketball world. Westbrook is so ineffective at playing basketball that he’s completely desensitized the average fan to his shitty performances. Every traditional method of evaluating effectiveness simply don’t apply to Russ because we’re so used to his shitty play that a bad game for anyone else is considered a good game for him.   Shoot like shit from the field and waste possessions for your team? Doesn’t matter. He got his 20 points, the amount it shots he took to get there is irrelevant. Average nearly 6 turnovers per game? Completely fine. Just part of the Westbrook experience. Revolving door on defence? Doesn’t matter. He’s there for his inefficient offence, not defence. Play like shit for 4 games straight and have a half decent 5th game? The 5th game is who he actually is and the 4 games prior are just outliers. And anyone who thinks otherwise is a hater.   Russell Westbrook is the prime case study of how far tribalism and blind homerism can cause fans to abandon all logic and say “this player is exempt from all traditional evaluation metrics because I like him, fuck you”."
There's really not much of a precedent for a player on a team outside the top 4 (5?) in the conference to win the MVP. I can't remember the last time a player bucked this trend with the exception of Russell Westbrook.  I think the Mavs would have to finish top 4 in the West to put him in contention to win the award. That or Doncic will need to average 28+/10/10.

"Yeah and then he was hurt in the playoffs for the second straight season with you.  At some point playing games matter especially in the playoffs and the last time he played in the playoffs and without trying to sabotage his team was 2017.  Russell Westbrook was the MVP, Pau Gasol was still a starting center in the NBA, and Markelle Fultz was viewed as the best point guard prospect since...Kyrie that's how long ago it was"
"But nobody has ever had the combination of speed, strength, vertical, and raw size. THAT is what makes LeBron one of the greatest pure athletes ever. Dudes bigger than him are slower and don’t get up as high, dudes that jump higher don’t have that strength or size, dudes faster than him don’t jump as high and aren’t as strong. Man is 6’9 and for 16+ years moved like a giant Russell Westbrook"
"Dame, Boogie and Russell Westbrook. Even in Russ’ best years as the first option, he wasn’t a winner yet he’s always at or near the top of people’s rankings.   Boogie was an empty stat guy. Sucked on defense.   Dame as a playoff performer is overrated as well. He’s inconsistent."
Shooters shoot   - Russell Westbrook
"Lol this is r/nba, we criticise people like skip bayless and shannon sharpe, but we’re no better. Everything is over exaggerated to cause drama.   James Harden: 18ppg/39.8fg% Luke Doncic: 22.4ppg/41.7fg% Damian Lillard: 18.3ppg/34.9fg%   Russell Westbrook: 18ppg/44.7fg%  Don’t get me wrong. At the end of the season, all those guys I mentioned will finish stronger than Russ. Point is, they’ve played like 6 games in an entirely new team and Russ is struggling, those other guys are playing in more comfortable roles with the same teams, they should be doing better than Russ but they’re not. I haven’t seen posts with those guys stats making it to the top of the page with awards, you might ask why, and the answers simple. It’s the lakers, they’re title contenders, everyone likes to shit on the lakers and lebron, so full circlejerk."
there isn't anything i have less confidence in in the entire NBA than russell westbrook trying to shoot a bank shot from 5+ feet out
No that would be Russell Westbrook
Yep. Herro is flying under the radar in the same way that Scottie Barnes and Russell Westbrook are flying under the radar so far this year.
It’s actually Russell Westbrook III  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html
Pj Washington jr   Russell Westbrook jr   James harden jr
"It’s always funny to see Westbrook apologists grasp at straws to deny something that should be common knowledge to anybody who understands basketball at even a basic level.   The reason the coaching looks better is because it’s much, much easier to coach low usage players like Kuz, KCP, and Trez than it is to coach Russell Westbrook. What can a coach say to a low IQ player who insists on shooting a high volume of shots despite being one of the most inefficient scorers in the league?  Is he a better coach than Brooks? Probably. Would Unseld Jr. be able to turn Westbrook into an effective player? Absolutely not. **We’re talking about a guy who shot *under* 40% from the field in 4/5 of the last postseasons he participated in**. The guy exists to waste possessions and be an inefficient player.  And that isn’t even mentioning his defence. For as much shit as he got, Kuzma really stepped up his defence the last few years. KCP has always been a good defender. Replacing a garbage tier defender with two positive ones is obviously going to have a large impact.  For all your talk of injuries: Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant haven’t even touched the floor.  If you can come up with a response other than “I watch games and you don’t 🤪” I’d love to hear it. I watch all teams. I just turn off the Westbrook blinders when doing so."
"Yea and replaced them with well known basketball *savant*, Russell Westbrook   Like what?"
We would never blame the refs for a loss. We have Russell Westbrook for that.
"I mean, we just had a full season of Russell Westbrook, Winwiddle is tame in comparison."
"&gt;Giannis needs ONE specific style of teammates around him because of his unique skillset. In comparison to Lebron, there is no one specific style of player or play that is required.  No, there is. He wants offball 3nD. This has been proven over and over. Giannis doesn't NEED spacing, like Lebron doesn't NEED non ball dominant players, but both REALLY want it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Maybe you want to check the usage rates of Wade, Kyrie, Davis, Westbrook if you think Lebron hasn't played with ball dominant players. 3&amp;D? That's what Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, Chris Anderson, Javale Mcgee, Deandre Jordan, Anderson Varejao, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Daniel Gibson, Mo Williams, Drew Gooden, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis are all about! /s  You wrote /s but this actually sounds like an argument, so I'm not sure whether to reply or not. Eh, whatever. Take care."
What do you describe as rivalries? Your talking about team rivalries ? Because there is definitely player rivalries.   Lillard and pg13. Giannas and harden beef for the mvp and continuing with bucks vs nets.   Simmons carried a whole summer of rivalries. Kat and embid. Nba players switch teams too fast now a day for it to be  team rivalries like back then a player can play for a franchise for 6+ years.  * imagine being a Russell westbrook fan and having to buy a new jersey every year 😂
"Up 12 with 40 seconds left, Dwight puts up a three with 15 on the shot clock..  And Russell Westbrook celebrates? Wasn't this the same dude who was butthurt the other night because someone dunked during a 5 point game?  Fuck off, Russ."
"I don't think it's very high at all. It is not easy for players to average a triple double, even if Russell Westbrook III makes you think otherwise."
"[Laughs in Paul George, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving]"
"If KD, LeBron, Steph, do it then force is with them and the throw is negligible and the criterion is not met.  If anyone else does, the force is not with them and it meets the ""with force"" threshold and an ejection occurs.  If Dwight Howard, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook do it (or are in the immediate area) then the force is against them, considered excessive, and anyone involved is ejected (including them for even observing from a ""too close"" distance) and all are subsequently fined/suspended."
"Tommy Shep turned an injury prone Wall on a Supermax into a redemption season Russell Westbrook on a Supermax into a career revival trade for Trez, Kuz and KCP not to mention using the left over money to get a now healthy Spencer Dinwiddie.  Hiring WUJ as well to bring our Hometown boy back Home.  Man is a genius!"
" After an ugly and shameful, turnover-filled first quarter, LAL completely turned this game around, and never looked back. LeBron and Carmelo were our two best players, solid contributions from Russell Westbrook, Avery Bradley, and Anthony Davis. Dwight Howard and DJ were so important in gaining those second chances buckets to help us keep the lead.  **Positives**: focus and effort for the last 3 quarters, very strong defensively in the fourth. Carmelo Anthony and LeBron. Dwight Howard hit a three.  **Negatives**: We still need to defend the pick and roll better. We need to start the game sharper, and relax on our turnovers."
I can't believe someone really said that Russell Westbrook is just a Smush Parker on Adderall
i actually watched Lakers game and Russell Westbrook jesus christ what's wrong with your defense man   &amp;#x200B;  I was ready to shit on Lebron for anything but end up feeling bad smh.
I mean you’re describing Russell Westbrook on defense…
that would have required him to give his energy not bringing Russell Westbrook to the Lakers.
Lmao these are tough times to be Russell Westbrook fan
"Ok, CP3 stan.  If that was true, and he wasn't never actually good, he would have been good with Luka Doncic, James Harden, LeBron James, and Russell Westbrook, all of whom are excellent playmakers"

The man is a mid-tier all star at worst. Yeah I think I prefer to watch him thrive on a good team than Russell Westbrook.  It's entertaining to see them lose hilariously but I would prefer great basketball

Tatum putting a clinic on how exactly you dont defend Russell Westbrook especially when he's looking to go early bringing the ball up the court. He's looking for a reason to take a pull up 18 footer if you just lay off him a little.

Not much of a shootout if one guy makes three and the other does a Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook to have a statement game against the Celtics after this
‘Vassell Fastbreak’ looks like someone tried to type Russell Westbrook with their eyes closed
Imagine if they traded away 2011/2012 Westbrook to the Warriors for Klay and Draymond which would actually be considered a bad return for Russell at the time. The Thunder starting line up would be Steph-Klay-KD-Dray-Ibaka without any free agency moves.
Russell Westbrook - 35.5 MPG | 29.2 USG | 19.4 PPG | 38.7 AST%   D'Angelo Russell - 31.3 MPG | 26.9 USG | 17.8 PPG | 30.4 AST%
&gt;btw if Russell Westbrook put up this statline it'd get posted immediately after the game ends.  Literally nobody cares about 2nd half and 4th quarter stats to hate on players. I'm pretty sure nobody but Steph has had their 4th quarter stats posted. Stop hatin.

I’ve never seen anyne play like Russell Westbrook - with the good and bad. Never. Totally unique.
"It's even funnier than that, as it started with [Westbrook calling Kawhi](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31937985/how-two-phone-calls-two-years-apart-led-los-angeles-lakers-landing-russell-westbrook).  &gt; Westbrook had become a father of three the previous November, and while he'd made a home and carved a Hall of Fame legacy in Oklahoma City, the chance to live and play in Los Angeles, where grandparents and his large extended family and friends could visit every day, held deep appeal. &gt;  &gt; Teaming up with Leonard would be the fastest way there, so he placed the call, according to multiple sources. But Leonard didn't just take the call as one native son of Los Angeles to another, ponder it and file it away. &gt;  &gt; He used it. &gt;  &gt; According to multiple sources, Leonard then called Westbrook's teammate in Oklahoma City, Paul George, and told him he'd rather team up with him on a homecoming. &gt;  &gt; George had always longed to play in front of his family as well but had formed a close bond with Westbrook in their two seasons together in Oklahoma City and was content to stay. &gt;  &gt; Leonard's call upended all of that, though. And within a week, Leonard was teaming up with George -- not Westbrook -- for their hometown LA Clippers."
Genuinely my only take in Basketball that I will hold to til my grave: Russell Westbrook is the funniest sportsperson to ever live.
Russell Westbrook gets a lot of steals and he sucks at defense.
"Sure. But a big part of that engagement is people being annoyed that it's given it's own thread, and thre rest of it could easily be housed in the post-game thread, which is the intended place for those discussions.  If there wasn't another ready-made place to discuss the daily performances of Russell Westbrook, sure, but there is."
The Lakers just traded several players for Russell Westbrook like he’s a great asset.  Plenty of dumb Gm’s out there man
"Russell westbrook being a great rebounder. I though it was Steven Adam's just letting him grab em, fast foreword he still up there"
"That's Russell ""highest motor in the league"" Westbrook btw"
Not going to happen. Russell Westbrook gets shit in more than any player I have seen. People act like he was never a great player and that he is currently the worst player in the league.

They have Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook. Even without Lebron that should be a good team. They shouldn’t need Lebron to win games. And I think people are really overrating how much 36 year old Ariza coming off an ankle injury is going to help. His defense isn’t what it used to be and his shooting isn’t really good either. Nunn can get you some quick buckets but the Lakers already have like 4 guards. They have a lot to figure out.
19 and 15 Russell Westbrook? He's not the problem. Injuries are
"Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal have all shot worse this year  Donovan Mitchell and SGA have shot roughly the same  Paul George, Anthony Davis, and Trae Young have barely been more efficient.   Again, lol"
"&gt; notoriously known for being elite talents while making everyone around them worse?  &gt; John wall  &gt; James Harden  &gt; Russell Westbrook  &gt; Anthony Davis  ???  You literally picked two Assist-champions, a PG that's averaged 9 assists per game, and one of the greatest 2nd options and said they ""make everyone around them worse"""
Russell Westbrook is absolutely not the most important player on the Lakers.
Turns out Lakers likely made the right choice in THT over AC.  Too bad we shat the bed with the Harrell + Kuzma + KCP + 1st round pick for RUSSELL WESTBROOK.  I am completely awestruck at that awful fucking trade.
I'm sure theres a healthy amount of morons shitting on Russell Westbrook too.
Ladies and gentlemen... [Russell Westbrook!](https://i.imgur.com/XwZKcIA.gifv)
A team with Anthony Davis and superstar point guard Russell Westbrook should not be this pathetic without LeBron
So … Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook is a player with a lot of volume so it matters less but if he took a heave a game it would still matter.   After 30 seconds of searching - Here’s a recent [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qvjave/cohen_last_summer_as_he_shot_threes_in_the_nba/hkwy098/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) on yours comparing someone who took 14 vs 11 shots and 38.7% vs 36.6% and your comment how they were shooting better. These are pretty close but imagine another heave a game lowering that 38.7%?   If I can find a comment of yours like that in two seconds how many of these comments exist. Based on a game by game basis? Based on a year by year basis? You’re talking about westbrooks career but there’s a lot more comparisons to be made
"I dont get your point. Russell Westbrook, for example, is a career 30.5% three point shooter, and he doesn't take heaves IIRC.  If he **doesn't** shoot heaves because he's worried about criticism, why does he **still take** 4 three pointers per game?   He's still being criticized for those 4 shots he's taking.   I would actually criticize him less for his shooting if he took heaves. I'd rather he take 4 heaves per game at the ends of quarters than take 4 three pointers in the flow of a half court offense."
"Tyler ""Russell Westbrook"" Herro"
Read this quickly and was like BRO YOU GOT WESTBROOK IN THAT STARTING FIVE?! FOHHHHH  Then I realized you meant D'Angelo Russell and I calmed down.
Russell Westbrook
So does Russell Westbrook...
"That assumes that every other GM is perfectly comfortable with their teams and they all have infinite timelines from their owners with no pressure on their jobs.  I think there's a possibility the Sixers get Russell Westbrook. Keep an eye on NOP, Spurs, Pacers (Pacers are mediocre but they have a well-known playoff mandate from ownership). I wanna say Rockets, but some reports suggested their owner refuses to trade with Morey."
"Surprisingly, LeBron James didn't know that Russell Westbrook would not be effective in the Lakers system.   Most fans know that Westbrook is not for the Lakers..."
"The lakers have openly tampered with AD, Westbrook, Lillard, and now Derozan.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;“Bron asked what I was thinking with my situation, and I told him what I’m telling you: that I just want to be in a position to win it all,” Lillard told Yahoo Sports. “He painted the picture to me that if I were to leave, the situation could look like this. He didn’t tell me to come to L.A., and he didn’t say anything to me that I didn’t already know other than what it could look like. I told him, ‘I know if I were to play with y’all, I know it would work out because of my skill set,’ and who I am and who they are.”   &gt;   &gt;They all addressed their respective first-round losses, and what each team needed to improve its roster. Davis explained his transition to Southern California. Lillard expressed his hesitancy to join any iteration of a super-team.   &gt;   &gt;“I was just saying, I don’t know if this is the route I wanted to go,” Lillard told Yahoo Sports. “And that was pretty much how the conversation went.”   &gt;   &gt;The meeting lasted for an hour and a half. Lillard promised to keep them posted on what he decided to do, but the Lakers were already privately evaluating their options on potentially landing Lillard, sources said.  [https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/amid-chaotic-offseason-damian-lillard-meeting-lebron-james-decision-loomed-sealed-recommitment-trail-blazers-200041277.html)  &gt;About two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook went to LeBron James' home and together they and Anthony Davis had a conversation about the All-Star guard joining James and Davis on the Lakers   &gt;   &gt;James and Davis talked about the two of them changing positions if that was best for the team — James moving from small forward to power forward and Davis from power forward to center.

[https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1177717804952367105](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1177717804952367105)"
"Russell Westbrook only averaged a triple double because he was the only one to have the ball. There is a certain number of assists, rebounds and points a team can have in a game. If one person is handling the ball the whole time he naturally will accumulate those stats for himself"
" AD in a good day is a monster, the problem is that he needs a captain in his team, someone who's better then him. Without Lebron AD is AD. Russell being Russell is easily targeted as the problem because of his terrible efficiency (and I don't cara about what anyone says, Westbrook shouldn't be on the lakers, he is too damn expensive and inefficient and we had to give up some pretty good guys, but I digress), meanwhile Ad's problem requires looking beyond the stats, which most people in the media don't care about discussing, they prefer pointless debates about who is the GOAT. We are no one without Lebron at this point, we need a team leader (I think Russ with a bit more time and chemistry will be our 2nd leader). That is how AD can reach top 75 status"
"That's right, folks, head on down to the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) Arena for some hot Lakers basketball action! Watch Russell Westbrook chuck up missed three after missed three and then turn the ball over nine times! Watch Elijah Price -- sorry, Anthony Davis -- waddle onto the court covered in three inches of bubble wrap! Watch LeBron glare at everything from the bench while injured and then hobble to the locker room five minutes before the end of the game! The NBA's marquee franchise is BACK!"
Does Russell Westbrook belong on the list?
"At this point there might not be. They have very little in the way of trade assets. I can't imagine any team wanting this version of Russell Westbrook, and he's going to be a problem no matter who they can get for THT."
&gt;Dwight's narrative was still pretty golden in the late 00's and started to flip early 10's.  I'm confused...? What's your point? Russel Westbrook is still doing the same stuff he has done since his rookie season. That along with being a part of losing teams recently is the reason masses hate on him now. That's why Dwight Howard (and for some other reasons) started getting slack.   Howard still had all time athleticism and improved after that championship run. There was nothing to hate yet. Frustrated? Sure but you live with that when you are in the moment.   Russell Westbrook is playing the same way he played when he averaged his first triple double. Everyone loved the fuck out of him that season... except for a few. You telling me the hate just started randomly?
This is a worse transaction than trading for Russell Westbrook was.
kd is the best player to ever touch a basketball  ben simmons is better than russell westbrook
"&gt;Russell Westbrook is averaging the most career turnovers per game in NBA history (4.1).   Prime Kobe also held this title. Shave off Harden’s non All-NBA seasons, and he’s averaging even more career TOs than Russ. While Luka and Trae are on pace to smash this record.  What matters more is the ast:to ratio, and Westbrook’s solidly eclipes 2:1, which is better than most star combo guards.  &gt;Even if he were to have 0 turnovers for the rest of this season, he would still hold the all-time record.  I question the intelligence of someone who actually believes that lol"

James Harden is playing like Russell Westbrook without the rebounds
"I feel like of all the factors discussed, All-NBA can be the best indicator of overall peaks and longevity. How many seasons a player was considered top-5, 10 or 15. And when you look at that, it becomes evident I think that Dwight &gt; Dame and AD.  Player | 1st Team | 2nd Team | 3rd Team | Total :------ | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: | -----: Chris Paul | 4 | 5 | 1 | 10 Russell Westbrook | 2 | 5 | 2 | 9 Dwight Howard | 5 | 1 | 2 | 8 Damian Lillard | 1 | 4 | 1 | 6 Anthony Davis | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4  Dwight was the best centre in the league by this account 5 times, and in contention several more seasons. AD was 4 times. But there's nothing else. The rest of it is either injured or underwhelming."
I guess we could finally see if some of these nephews could outplay Russell Westbrook or shoot better than Ben Simmons.

They are trying to incorporate Russell Westrbook. Let me state that again. They are trying to incorporate Russell Westbrook.   Everyone here mocked the decision because we knew it wouldn't work and then when it doesn't it's somehow Anthony Davis fault?
How could the Wizards possibly be good when they traded away Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook was the best KD stopper.
"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/  This may help explain that he wasn't just stat padding, at least during that season. We'll see if you read it."
"LOL so anyone who blindly upvotes your comment is right and anyone who cares enough to have an actual conversation are wrong. Very interesting defense tactic you got there. Even funnier that you're trying to absolve your many dumb comments by bringing up a separate one. You loving those cherrypicked arguments huh.  You got that Russell Westbrook 3PT mentality. No matter how silly you look to everyone, you keep on shooting even if it exposes you more and makes you look even worse. But you think you're a shooter because you hit 1 3pt every 10 shots so you'll keep going. Very funny."
"I'll take the downvotes, but until I see Russell Westbrook playing for a reasonably constructed team, that has an actual offense and the expectations for it to be run, then I don't have an overall problem with how he plays.  I just don't.  A lot of the ""BBIQ"" that gets bandied about here is due to the team having an actual offense that will allow the players to think beyond set plays.  Russell can't will players to cut to the front of the basket, but I promise you, if Andre Roberson had been coached to do that at least five times a game, he would've been a lot more useful to OKC than he was.  The first half, Russell and Steven could terrorize teams with a PNR, the second half, the other professionals on the floor shut that down.  Four players standing outside of the arc looking at the PG isn't exactly a difficult team to defend, I don't care who the PG is.  Put him in a real offense, if he fails, I'll clown. Until then, I will continue to stand in awe of what he has managed to do with the bulk of his teammates over the years. And no, I don't think Houston had a real offense either, despite Russell figuring out a way to flourish."
"russ pulling down a rebound and pushing the pace is much faster than a big securing the board, chinning the ball, then a guard has to move back towards the opponents hoop to receive the outlet pass (in most cases).  russ cheating for boards can be a benefit to his personal stats while helping his team, i dont understand why people treat those as mutually exclusive.  16-17 thunder -  9th in pace, 3rd in drb%, top 10 defense, 10th best record in the league. russ 10.7 boards per game  17-18 thunder - 17th in pace, 16th in drb%, top 9 defense, 9th best record in the league. russ 10.1 boards per game  18-19 thunder - 6th in pace, 7th in drb%, top 4 defense, 9th best record in the league. russ 11.1 boards per game  i know this is an oversimplification as it does not take into account team composition, but it paints a pretty clear picture of that teams ethos. the question of whether russ was driving it for team success or personal success is irrelevant because those two things mean the same exact thing to russell westbrook.  it becomes pretty easy to make the case that while russ may have been selfish, it was in the best interest of his TEAM for him to do so."
"exactly , thats why they get paid the big bucks, the nba is an entertainment and the more drama the more clicks and intrest, the kyrie saga, like cmon ... I dont want to get into that. the russell westbrook saga , he is averaging the most turnovers of his carreer. truly believe he is turning the ball on purpose , so the haters can have something to talk about, the warriors/ nets/ lakers saga. The harden trade , like cmon , what kind of a trade was that, the philly drama. the nba lottery   &amp;#x200B;  ive been watching the nba since 2006 and ive notices these small things because of the social media era . like whatsup with all these youtube clickbait titles that have like 100,000 views in a day, the nba allows that to happen so they can get more popular"
"lol its ok  &amp;#x200B;  its funny because is demar was with the lakers and yall lets say got westbrook  &amp;#x200B;  demar would be the devil and say he doesnt fit , like they where saying when there was rumors that he was going to sign with the lakers and he is a playoff choker with the raptors , goes missing in the playoffs   &amp;#x200B;  if westbrook was with the bulls they would say he is the next chris paul for the bulls , and how he makes his team better be playing with more energy   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  the fact of the matter is that westbrook has proven the be the better player in his carreer by taking the thunder deep in the playoffs and becoming the undisputed triple double king. I would take russell on the lakers over demar anyday of the week because we all know the russell is not trying right now, all these turnovers that he is doing are all scripted , they are the most stupid turnovers ive ever seen in my life and i know that a passer like him , what is he top 10 all time, is passing the ball blantantly to the opposing teams in the third quarter, the nba is scripted , they want to make fun of him, its all scripted"
No you DumbNBANephew Russell Westbrook cannot be explained
Russell Westbrook
"it's weird cause AD does seem fragile, I am a Laker fan and every time he hits the floor I have t panic. I get the empty stats comment because when Kevin put up those Minnesota numbers I was thinking he is garbage, I think KAT with those numbers is garbage, I thought Chris Bosh in Toronto was garbage,  I thought Melo's numbers were garbage. But garbage to me is what do those stats mean to me nothing. Is Wilt the best ( a ton of stats) most will say no is the Kareem  (all time leading  scorer most MVPs) the best? most will say no. Russell has 11 rings in 13 seasons and most won't say he is the best. So when I watched Westbrook get to me empty triple doubles, meaning I won't put him even in the top 25 of guards. Davis should be held to the highest of standards because he is that good."
"Okay, but have you considered a five Russell Westbrook lineup? That's five triple doubles!"
You know and I know that Russell Westbrook was not the MVP of that season!
"well tbf, their other two guys are CP3 and Mikal Bridges instead of Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis so their 3 pts are still probably way better than us (which isn't saying much though lol)."
"Great comment that in my reading boils down to this. Rebounds and assists have a ""quality"" aspect to them. They are all counted as ""one"", a whole number, but in reality they should be counted on a ""0-1"" scale if you are a team trying to evaluate performance of a player and team instead of a fan. Is Russell Westbrook grabbing a free throw rebound actually ""one"" rebound or ""0.1"" rebound in quality? Is Blake Griffin handing off to Kevin Durant for a 23 footer actually ""one"" assist or is that better described by Lamelo Ball threading a backdoor pass through 3 sets of arms to a cutting Hayward?  Baseball somewhat does this cutting Runs Allowed down to Earned Runs Allowed. If I was a front office analyst giving my year end Powerpoint presentation to Morey on a player's performance, i would include a ""quality of rebounds"" and ""quality of assists"" category instead of just plain aggregate numbers."
"Mo Williams made an all star team in a very weak East, and he was playing around the same level if not higher thab current Poole or Wiggins.  Here are the guards that easily make it before Poole, and forwards before Wiggins.  Lillard, McCollum, Morant, Mitchell, Conley, Fox, Westbrook, Doncic, Paul, Booker, Edwards, Russell, Gilgeous-Alexander, Dort.  Powell, George, Barnes, James, Davis, Porzingis, Ingram, Zion (Once he starts playing).  That's a lot of players that without question are playing above those two, and that is only considering west coast players, so there aren't many spots open to fill.   They are playing very well, but are not all-star caliber players atm. Wiggins has a much better chance if he keeps his offense rolling like his outlier Hugh efficiency games, but that trend doesn't usually stick with him unfortunately."
https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/russell-westbrook-6141/
"Russell Westbrook has always been an up and down player that commits a lot of turnovers, has questionable shot selection and is a bad defender"
For his career Luka is a 43% shooter from the midrange and 33% from three Trae is a 47% midrange shooter and a 34.6% career from three also Trae is an 88.6% ft shooter to Lukas 73%. But tbh the best thing to do here would be to look at true shooting for their careers tbh to determine who’s more efficient Trae is at 57.4% and Luka is at 57.1% so basically the same. Also an underrated factor that Luka benefited from the past 2 years prior to this one(not this year I think they are starting Powell) is that he played in a 5 out offense which cleared out the paint and allowed him to get easier looks at the rim. To give an example of how helpful that can be look at Russell Westbrook numbers on the rockets % wise vs everywhere else because they ran a five out he shot a career high 47.2% and that’s while he had his worse three point shooting year obviously that’s not the only reason Luka was successful but worth noting.
Well what do you expect when you just traded a top 5ish player and Russell Westbrook for effectively 1 guy who you're paying $40m to sit at home
"What does this have to do with being a homer? I'm just saying that he deserves to be in the league and shouldn't be benched for worse players like Avery Bradley. I agree that building a roster where the only perimeter defenders are Kent Bazemore and 36-year old Trevor Ariza coming off ankle surgery is asinine. Having to do that because you traded for 33-year old Russell Westbrook and cheaped out on luxury tax as the Lakers is even more asinine.  I'm always ready to shit on Rob Pelinka who I've considered a bottom 5 GM basically since he was hired or the Lakers ownership who tried to make Caruso feel bad for wanting what he's worth.   What I have an issue with is people underrating players who have memeable lowlights. Baze is a solid rotation player and a good defender despite a high foul rate for a perimeter player.   As far as Buddy is concerned, I don't really think that would've been a panacea. He's a high volume average efficiency scorer who is awful defensively. Not sure he'd be able to close games in the conference finals. Trading Kuzma+Harrell+pick for him would've been solid and kept KCP and Caruso but I would've liked to target someone with more two-way ability."

A former league MVP, he checked the superstar box, and as a dynamic playmaker he would help ease the burden on James. &gt; &gt;[...] &gt; &gt;Once Westbrook persuaded the Wizards to engage with L.A., the Lakers made a choice to back off of the Hield option, too. Even if Hield was a more natural fit for their structure, the Lakers believed Westbrook _made them a more dangerous team in the postseason._ &gt; &gt;_It was, in essence, the decision between a player they believed could be the difference-maker in a 16-game title run vs. one whose talents had only been utilized in the regular season._  supposedly, they thought westbrook would be more valuable than hield in the postseason, since playoffs!hield is an unknown quantity."
"https://theathletic.com/2848702/2021/09/27/superstar-shopping-lebron-russell-westbrook-and-the-lakers-summer-of-recruiting  &gt;The group focused first on Lillard and Beal, but with no viable path to trading for either of them, turned their attention to more realistic targets: Westbrook, DeRozan, Hield and Kyle Lowry, who would eventually pursue a deal with the Miami Heat instead. &gt; &gt;There was genuine excitement shared in the player meetings about how DeRozan would fit. Even if he wasn’t the Lakers’ first choice, it was easy to envision a scenario where he would be their best available option. &gt; &gt;For the Lakers, according to those with knowledge of the situation, it was imperative to keep as many potential avenues open as possible. &gt; &gt;Sources said Pelinka and his front-office group strongly considered executing a sign-and-trade for the 32-year-old DeRozan, giving up Kuzma and Caldwell-Pope in the process, but couldn’t come to consensus terms with the Spurs in free agency or a suitable contract number for DeRozan. What’s more, sources say the DeRozan option never advanced to the point that it was presented to Buss.  so they'd have to offer more than that...."

It's all luck really.   Except for Russell Westbrook. That is his fault. No cap.

Boogie is less of a self absorbed bitch. He is a head case that fights on the court but his issues are very different from Westbrook. Remember when Russell and The Rockets went back to OKC the first time? That was so sad and unprofessional by Wes.

"I hope the NBA comes up with *consistent* rules for next season.  You can't NOT call it all season, then call it a couple of times when you feel like it, then not call it when he does something like this. This cannot be a subjective decision like it is now. Russell Westbrook changed his routine years ago, Giannis is doing whatever he wants rn."
"Reggie Jackson and Russell Westbrook hate each other. but I suppose so did Reggie and Ibaka, and they could squash the beef"
Russell Westbrook will average 51ppg
i have gary payton and russell westbrook above him too
"Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler. Super spacing."
So Russell Westbrook is the best facilitator in the league right? I just want you to admit that because he should be by your logic.
Westbrook has been injured plenty of times? How old are you lol   EDIT: It literally took me 3 seconds to find this [https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5608077/a-timeline-of-russell-westbrooks-surgeries](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5608077/a-timeline-of-russell-westbrooks-surgeries)
https://www.sbnation.com/2018/9/12/17851948/russell-westbrook-knee-injury-surgery-history-thunder  Torn meniscus in 2013 requiring surgery. Multiple knee arthroscopic procedures in the following years. Incredibly explosive athlete who plays as hard as anyone in the lrague? It's no wonder his body is deteriorating compared to his previous standards.   You're full of shit and a garbage troll
Can’t believe the Thunder chose that bum Russell Westbrook over him
"He's shot with his non-dominant hand his whole career, and if Russell Westbrook is any indication (same thing, writes left, shoots right), he likely doesn't have the foundation on which to build a decent shot. Players seem to improve an average of 5% over their career from the line, so expecting someone to go from the 50s to 70s is exceedingly rare, especially for people who shoot with the wrong hand."
"&gt;Russell Westbrook invited his old friend Spalding for dinner at his mansion. That night in the suburbs, BB even ate a vegan burger for the first time. ""I could fuck with this,"" he said. A super-team was starting to be formed, over a side of kale salad and... clink."
"Russell Westbrook is the best passer of the 21st century. Ahead of Paul, Kidd, Nash and really anyone who’s played since 2000 really.  Also Aleksej Pokusevski will be the best player in his draft class.  Refs don’t call less fouls in the playoffs"
"idk he's literally a 25 point 10 assist a night guy which is fucking absurd except he's a slightly better shooter than the other guy capable of doing that right now (Russell Westbrook) and WB was very much the best player in the league during his MVP season. Trae Young could be so transcendent on offense he could actually prove to be as good as Luka. If Luka is playing down a year then people might start hyping Trae as the one leading the league. Weird analogy but it reminds me of professional League of Legends and Jensen vs. Bjergsen. Bjergsen was the golden boy, the one that most people considered the best and Jensen was viewed as sort of the player in his shadow but there were years where Bjergsen looked worse and Jensen had to be considered the best player in the league and the same thing could happen here."
"I think Lebron has a point. Though admittedly, it can be said that the short offseason affected more of the Bubble teams that made at least the second round than either the teams that didn’t get into the Bubble or had early exits like the Suns (though Chris Paul has had some bad luck this playoffs with the bad shoulder and COVID).  I think we should also keep in mind how apparently taxing these last two seasons have been for the teams that got deep into last year’s playoffs. Brad Stevens reportedly feeling worn down, especially coming out of the Bubble, and moving into the front office could not be a simple coincidence. Even Pat Riley, one who establish this militaristic attitude in the Heat culture, wanted his players and staff to find time to rest up and focus on health first, after a trouncing in the playoffs by the Bucks.  Then you list all of the significant players who played at least up to the second round of the playoffs in the Bubble who had an injury or COVID throughout the season and in the playoffs, it’s pretty amazing. AD had three significant injuries on one leg. Murray couldn’t even make it to the playoffs after suffering an ACL tear. Butler was clearly not the same after his signature playoff run in the Bubble. Lebron appears to finally show his age in the playoffs, not helped while recovering from a high ankle sprain from bad luck when Solomon Hill landed on his ankle in the second half of the season. Harden dealing with his hamstring multiple times. Lebron and Harden have played over 90% of the games played since 2009-10, mind you, along with Russell Westbrook, who also suffered injuries these last two seasons. Kawhi Leonard apparently just suffered an ACL sprain (?).  This year’s playoffs has had its moments, but it’s unfortunate that we’re seeing more All Star injured and either missing time or showing obvious decline in their play. Sure, injuries are a thing in sports. I’ve had my share playing sports. But it’s something to consider with all that has happened the last year and a half."
I know a guy who’s VERY willing to shoot 3s.  Mr. Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook at home watching what a real starting point guard looks like
Not Russell Westbrook
"It’s not wrong. Westbrook struggled with a more clogged paint near the beginning of the season. They made the trade specifically to get him going.   [Through the first couple months of the season, it almost seemed like the Rockets were winning in spite of Westbrook. Harden was posting absurd scoring numbers, while Russ continued to clank threes from the outside, the duo producing a partnership that was statistically worse than what Harden and Paul did the previous couple seasons. While Westbrook obviously deserves the most credit for his new style of play, Daryl Morey was smart in realizing the team’s current setup wasn’t the best way to get the most out of his two superstars. The Capela trade wasn’t only about Houston wanting to shoot even more threes or trolling people who hate the way the Rockets play, it was about giving Harden and especially Westbrook even more room to showcase their talents.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/02/27/russell-westbrook-rockets-small-ball-clint-capela-trade)  [This article](https://ca.nba.com/news/stat-just-happened-the-houston-rockets-have-unleashed-russell-westbrook-in-a-terrifying-way/14g2mlhh9upc61mrl3015dvxek) goes into more detail on Westbrook’s numbers before and after the trade.   To their credit, it kinda worked. Westbrook was a completely different player working with all that space. But it came at the cost of rim protection."
"Yeah, Shaq has insanely good footwork and post moves considering how massive he is, and a pretty soft touch on hook shots too.   But Giannis is more skilled. I can only imagine how hard it is to handle the ball at his height and with his huge hands but somehow he manages to have really good ball control. Remember, Giannis is only 1-2 inches shorter than Shaq.  Giannis is pretty much a stretched out Russell Westbrook with better footwork and finishing. And that comparison in itself is insane."
"Popularity is still not a good factor. Russell westbrook ""brings more fans"" than Trae young to games. Is Russell westbrook better than Trae young rn then? Nah. Did you know Kyle Kuzma is for some reason crazy popular in China? Worldwide he's definitely more famous than Trae. Is Kyle kuzma a superstar rn? Hell nah."
"ok?? who gives a fuck who the ""partner"" is? literally every ama has something like that in the post body... no one reads it and no one cares. this is not something that is remotely specific to the anthony davis ama. they all have something like that.  did you actually look at any of his replies? or are you just circlejerking based on what youve seen others say?  how are any of these answers not ""opening up and interacting with fans""??  &gt;My transition was pretty smooth. I went straight from college to the Olympic team with Bron, Melo, Kobe, Tyson Chandler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul. I was able to be around these guys 24/7 for about two months, and learn a lot from them.   &gt;My “welcome to the league” moment was when we played Indiana at home during my rookie year. They had PG, Lance Stephenson, David West, Roy Hibbert, all those guys. David West just lit me up. I couldn’t stop him. I was so frustrated. He went to the same move, over and over. Literally 5 times in a row. Just caught the ball, jab, jumper from the elbow. I couldn’t stop it. That’s when I knew the league was for real.  ...  &gt;I would choose the ability to teleport. It seems weird to be invisible and have no one notice you, and flying I don’t really care about. But being able to teleport and get point A to point B anywhere in the world would be the best for me. It would be even better if someone could hold onto me and we could teleport together.  ...   &gt;A guy I’ve looked up to a lot was Kevin Garnett. I always wanted to be like him, play both sides, be a fierce competitor. He was in the later part of his career when I came into the league but I always looked forward to playing against him too.  ...  &gt;If I’m back home in Chicago, I gotta have Giordano’s pizza. In New York, Philippe’s is a must.  ...  &gt;A little of both. They made me feel a part of the team. They welcomed me, they invited me to dinner. And then I got a chance to play sometimes, and they would coach me up. Most of the time it was just being shocked that I was even there, being able to share the court with them and win a gold medal.  ...  &gt;I was actually nervous. It’s a moment you dream of your entire life, and you reach that childhood dream...it was a lot. I was able to take it all in and embrace the feeling with my family. When I heard my name called it was one of the best feelings in the world.  ...  &gt;Just winning.   &gt;Winning it all with family there, and me just sitting back and reflecting on everything that happened that season, everything in my career, in like 15 seconds. That’s the picture that floats around a lot with me sitting by the bench, just crying with all the emotion coming out."
He’s now tied with a bunch of guys for 11th. Russell Westbrook is constantly dragged for his turnovers but both he and Trae have a playoff high of 9 turnovers which they’ve each gotten once despite Westbrook playing 98 more playoff games in his career.
Russell Westbrook
this game got boring.  i wanted to make the best lineup with players that shot less than 70% from the free throw line this season and it says Russell Westbrook shot 271/453 (0.656) from the line.  is that right?
UCLA legend Russell Westbrook
&gt; its not easy to keep your team focused when your season is falling apart.  It is when your point guard is Russell Fucking Westbrook
russell “draymond green” westbrook
Russell Westbrook is just something else. I'm happy to see him succeed. I want him  to cause trouble in the playoffs.
How come every single time Russell Westbrook gets brought up it has to come with the disclaimer “love him or hate him you gotta admit....” or whatever? I don’t think there’s a single other player who gets that disclaimer. It annoys me because it makes disliking a player feel legitimate.
"I don't give a fuck who you are, which team you support, what gets you up in the morning, how good your dad is at fighting, how big your cock is, how much you love going for long walks or any other bullshit. You're on this subreddit because you love basketball. And if you love basketball then you owe it to yourself to give up every other thing you give a flying fuck about and watch the Washington Wizards. And you know why:  Russell Westbrook.  Russell Westbrook is bringing it. He's bringing it hard. I wish everyone could go back and watch that five minute spell in the fourth where he came back in and just ignited the afterburners, strapped falcon talons onto his hands and drove his will deep into the Pacers' heart.  Russell Westbrook is box office shit. If you're bored and you've got nothing to do and you don't know which game to watch, just watch Russell fucking Westbrook deep dick stat lines with enough power to light up a major metropolis.  Seriously, why the fuck are you still reading this, go have a wank to some Wesbtrook highlight videos and pass out safe in the knowledge he plays, on average, three times a week.  Fuck your own team, Russell Westbrook is your team now."
Russell Westbrook is good at basketball
"Yes. I enjoy watching the Wizards play. If you don't like watching Russell Westbrook play, you don't like basketball."
Russell Westbrook: a different animal and the same beast.
"I don’t know man, I don’t want to sound like a homer but I’m starting to think this Russell Westbrook guy is good at basketball."

So guys I've been thinking and... I feel like Russell Westbrook might be good at basketball (?)
Russell Westbrook is my obvious #1.
"why on earth would i bother debating russell westbrook with people who can't read? his haters are some of the most unintelligent and immature people on the internet and don't care about the words you tell them. you bring up the same trite and faulty arguments that have been discussed hundreds of times because you dont actually care about the game of basketball or bother to watch him play. you haven't actually listened to anything i've tried to say either, so I guess insulting you is the best way to go. at least it's funny and I don't have to put effort into talking at an arrogant brick wall anymore."
"&gt; Oh it’s way more than just shooting efficiency. It’s how he literally can’t play within any other system other than how he forces his teams to play.  counterpoint houston. but you don't watch basketball so you wouldn't know that.  &gt;And we’ve seen what that is without Durant next to him.  an mvp and multiple years of insanely fun and entertaining basketball?  &gt;And you absolutely should care about analytics and metrics. Again. You can’t measure effectiveness without the tools we have available today without them.  who cares? seriously, what is your motive behind posting this shit? everybody who enjoys watching russell westbrook has come to terms with his analytics and efficiency *years* ago. why the fuck do you keep bringing it up like it's something new? do you really think you're actually contributing to a discussion beyond repeatedly and aggressively pointing out a player's flaws? are you sincerely trying to convince or educate people and are just too fucking stupid to read the room, or are you a narcissist who revels in negativity and hatred?"
"Lebron/KD/Curry/Harden/Kawhi were all pretty much inarguably better every season from 2015-2018. (Maybe AD over Kawhi in 2015)  Within that time frame, you also had Chris Paul playing at an extremely high level and Russell Westbrook winning MVPs."
"Except the play-in is also part of this set schedule to prove you should qualify for the playoffs that you're holding so sacred, and every single player in the NBA knew that before the preseason started.  Not having a Play-In is a kick in the face to teams that had early covid related losses.  You know what else is unfair?  Russell Westbrook and Jayson Tatum not having their lungs back to pre-covid condition before the regular season started.  I don't see Lebron standing up for the Celtics and Wizards to get their fair shake though, weird how he only cares about the thing that hurts the Lakers..."
Julius Randle braids  Russell Westbrook vs Kevin Durant
"ESPN, April 30: Kendrick Perkins says Westbrook will have a better career than Iverson  ESPN, May 3: Will Russell Westbrook finish with a better career than Allen Iverson?    This is what ESPN does: they have one ""analyst"" say something, and then discuss it on another one of their dumb shows"
"Really?  That one game in finals solely puts him over Russell ""Mr. First Round Exit"" Westbrook, you don't even have to look at whole finals run.  Westbrook most overrated player ever in NBA"
"He has a better chance to not reach 30k points than 10k rebounds.  There’s still 15 games left in the season.  If he can have 2 more Russell Westbrook triple double seasons, which he might, then he’s definitely going to get 10k rebounds."
"To be honest he only carried teams to the playoffs when he was young. All the carrying he's done is in the post season. All the teams he's been part of would have made the playoffs, but at the same time none of them would have won if he wasn't there. He's not been doing Russell Westbrook type of carrying. He's a ceiling raiser, not a floor raiser."
You ask how could they not give this man the MVP award? And that just shows how truly great a season Russell Westbrook had that year. For those of us who watched every game with Russ of that season it is not so far-fetched as to why Harden lost. Do yourself a favor and look up the [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook).
"Depends on the team. If my point guard is someone like Simmons, LeBron, or Russell Westbrook I'm taking Embiid"
I feel you man. I got this feeling in 2011   All under 25 players in 2011   Dwight howard   Cp3   Derrick rose   Kevin durant   Russell westbrook   Kevin love   Andrew Bynum   Rajon Rondo   Brandon Roy   Tyreke evans   Blake Griffin   These guys had me excited for the next decade    The future of the NBA is currently really bright.
"OKC lost Paul George *and* Russell Westbrook, added CP3, and got better. They lost CP3 and got tremendously worse. The CP3 effect is *very real*."
Here in r/nba Russell Westbrook is a very weird player lol. Some hate the guy. Some will defend him with his life. Can never really predict how the thread will go.
"Russell Westbrook is legitimately one of the most underrated players of all time. I would put him right next to Pete Maravich in that conversation.  Let's not discount either that Russell Westbrook plays in the era least ideal for his skill set. If Westbrook plays in any other time period over the last 60 years he's just as good, if not better."
"what you typed doesn’t make sense as a response. Either you misread or just didn’t understand.  BTW if Jokic missed a handful of games and Steph played in all of his, it’s painfully clear you would be arguing it as a reason Curry should win the award.  Here’s the argument that should end any logical Steph fans’ MVP case: At best Warriors finish 7th, but likely 8th-9th. Steph could put up 40 for the rest of the season on historic efficiency and still wouldn’t win MVP. It’s why Kobe didn’t win it in 06’, and a significant reason why Steph himself did in ‘15. Winning has always mattered when it comes to the award. The only outlier was obviously Russell Westbrook, and Curry isn’t going to break any popular enough historically significant enough records to sway the voting media."
"""Oscar Robertson? MAgic Johnson? Russell? Westbrook? All amateurs"""
It’s reality because it’s reality.  Russell Westbrook is an above average rebounder. He’s also nowhere near the elite rebounder his 10 rebounds per game would suggest. Both of these things are true. If you genuinely believe Westbrook is in the paint banging with big men and actually fighting for most of his rebounds you just don’t watch him play.
"I agree with you, even Russell Westbrook stated, James Harden got everything. Coming late always, not working hard enough, not proper time spent in the video room, it's a recipe for disaster in the end. Look at where Huston is now, totally lost. This is what happens when you put too much trust into one player rather than the whole team. I mean whatever he asked he was given better shooter, better pg in cp3 and Westbrook but still not enough."
"That's some wild armchair psychology.  You know his teams are 133-44 when he gets a triple double, right?   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-record-when-russell-westbrook-gets-a-triple-double-with-wash"

HAHAHA where are all the haters at tho?  RuSsElL wEstBrOoK iSn'T eFfiCeNt.  Fuck the stats you know who Russell is and what he's capable of period  Everybody can get a triple dub if they a ballhog. Imagine being that guy? This the nba and everybody can get a triple dub. Vince Carter said had 5 in his carrer to put that into perspective for everybody.
Russell Westbrook has more triple-doubles in the last 5 seasons (140) than the number of games the 4th seed Knicks have won in the last 5 seasons (133)
I absolutely love Russell Westbrook.
I hope so. The NBA is better when Russell westbrook and Bradley Beal can compete
"&gt;Karl Malone is sort of like the Russell Westbrook of the 90s. He was a great player and still somehow not as good as his stats. It is hard to have conversations about a player that has a high floor but a limited ceiling against the best teams and not have people pissed off about both issues. Win a lot of regular season games, win an ok amount of playoff games, put up rare numbers in the process. Your teams always seem to be missing something.   &gt;   &gt;Some of not winning is luck tbf. But if they were the best player on your team...how confident are you really in winning a championship?  Since you cant read, this was my initial comment. You made this matter. You said I stated a bunch of things I didnt. I was consistent in my message and you either misread words, missed words entirely, or didnt care because you wanted to argue. You are being obnoxious"

There's a lot of untapped talent on the roster.  Scott Brooks and Russell Westbrook are about as bad a combo for player development as you can get.

"Buddy Hield is great, but he isn't really even close to Russell Westbrook."
"Yeah, Russell Westbrook."
"meh, not nearly as significant as you think. We were already capped out before we got westbrook, we only really had access to resign our own free agents, sign someone to the taxpayer mle, and vet mins. We are still in that exact same position, just now without kcp and kuz, as its safe to say harrell doesnt reup on that option year if he was to stay with us. I actually really fucking love this trade, we turned two quarters into a dollar, and if westbrook really does decline, im sure russell westbrook plus whoever the best replacement level player would be is better than what kcp and kuzma would have offered"
Thats a made up talking point by goofballs.   https://phenommedia.net/russell-westbrook-has-been-one-of-the-best-in-the-clutch-this-season/
"You may observe how it is particularly amusing because Russell Westbrook might be achieving a stat that LeBron James is otherwise known for, despite never attaining the precise statline in game"
Cos we're going to pay Russell Westbrook 47 million dollars next year.  You're paying Blake Griffin $8.32 and a pack of cigarettes.
"Just report it. Have a database accessible to every team that logs reported conversions. It could be something simple like:  Affected players: Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook  Discussion: Talked about Westbrook requesting a trade to the Lakers.  It shouldn't be too difficult for a player to text the FO and have a staffer input it."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
LA Lakers are not winning anything. I would surprised if they even make it to the Finals. Russell Westbrook can't shoot.

"It all depends on how good you think westbrook is. A superteam to me has to have two top 10 players in the league and another all star player. We already know Lebron and AD are both two top 10 players, but is Russell westbrook good enough to considered an all star at this point in his career?"

Russell Westbrook
The perception vs the reality of Russell Westbrook nowadays fascinates me
"Good for pointing that out OP, to me I think the deal for Russell Westbrook is only the first part of a bigger deal that might see Buddy eventually ending up on the Lakers as well."
Russell Westbrook and Josh Primo
"Let's look at last season Donovan: Regular season: 26.4/4.4/5.2 on 56.9% TS and 2.8TOV  Play offs: 32.3/4.2/5.5 on 60.2% TS and 2.8 TOV Westbrook: Regular season 22.2/11.5/11.7 50.9% TS and 4.8 TOV Play offs: 19/10.4/11.8 46.2%TS and 4.2 TOV. And note league average for the Regular season was  57.2% TS. Pretty much the only thing Russell is better at that is actually relevant to a guard, while rebounding is useful isn't really important for a guard, is playmaking. He is inefficient does not provide spacing at all, and is most efficient when  there is more spacing on the court, something that is not going to be the case on the lakers. Donovan is a much better scorer and is actually efficient."
"You're really just telling everyone that you've never watched Russell Westbrook play if you think he's going to play good team defense. They're going to cover up some of his flaws but they definitely aren't going to be the same defensively. I never even claimed the Lakers are going to be bad on defense, you just got weirdly worked up and emotional over me telling people it's stupid to say he gives 110% effort when he doesn't give a fuck on defense. You're definitely gonna complain later when he decides not to close out on his man in order to try to get a rebound. You seem pretty confident tho you should bet a couple paychecks on them making the finals"

I'm just going to be honest with you man. Russell Westbrook pulled a Blake Griffin on you guys. Ain't no point in tearing up his body for that.  Give Russ something to play for and see how many dunks he gets on a team with no shooters.
I was making fun of Laker fans who think their team needs to be the center of the universe. I’m still making fun of Laker fans for the same thing here. Your entire argument was based around the idea that the bulls aren’t interesting because they won’t get a star. Then you want to puff your chest out because you traded for 32 year old-44 million a year-Russell Westbrook. You can’t even make this shit up lol.   You are the exact type of person that espn targets in their marketing when Perkins starts calling the new Lakers the new Heatles. So congrats on being the median. But some of us are more interested in teams that can’t break every tampering rule to form a squad and then immediately start fucking up every decision after that.
"The Rockets were a much better team with CP3 than Russ.    Obviously different situations, but Russell Westbrook is an insanely talented player that is somewhat difficult to build around.  He’s got an insane motor, gives everything he has, is crazy talented, but his style of play has some unique challenges.    Still an upgrade for the Lakers, and this will truly tell the full story of who Westbrook is in my opinion.  If he comes to LA and gels and finds success, I’ll eat my words about the Houston comment.  He’s talented enough to pull it off too, it’s more a question of can Frank Vogel make all this work out."
This is Russell Westbrook we’re talking about.
"Not to go against your theory but something to add to the conversation,  Eric Pincus:  &gt; Over the past few weeks, the Lakers pursued Westbrook and Hield in parallel conversations with the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. As the draft neared, the Wizards seemed content to wait on big decisions with Beal and Westbrook.  &gt; That pushed Hield to the forefront. But even as the possibility of a deal built around Kyle Kuzma and Harrell began to form, the Lakers kept the door open to a Westbrook deal.  &gt; Westbrook asserted his voice into the conversation, and per an NBA source, the Wizards pivoted. Just like that, the pieces the Kings liked for Hield were no longer available.

Maybe if the best player wasn’t turning 37 and coming back from the biggest injuries of his career while limiting minutes and the second best player wasn’t an injury prone big who won’t play center even though it’s his best position. They’ll be good but your comment makes it seem like Russell just joined Harden and KD in their prime while the reality is that Westbrook is declining and needs to be a 3rd option.

"No, it's the casuals who think this is a good move because Russell Westbrook is a big name. No one's asking if he's better than Schroeder, another player who needs the ball in his hands to succeed and who can't shoot. Obviously he's better than Schroeder, that's not the question. The question is fit. Lakers would have done much better to use their few assets to address team needs, not to get the biggest star they could.  LeBron and AD are already ball dominant players. Russell Westbrook is someone with no off-ball game, someone who needs the ball in his hands to succeed, and someone who can't shoot. On the Lakers, they needed someone who was a 3-pt sharpshooter who didn't need the ball at all, unless it was hitting their hands specifically to drain a 3. This was the exact opposite of the Lakers needs.   Got them kids in this thread saying how he's going to take the load off during the regular season so LeBron can rest. Sure. And what about when they hit the playoffs? And I dare you to call me a casual, I don't know how many years back I'd have to go to find a Laker game I missed."

"I'm in LA, my window is open and I just overheard someone outside talking about the Russell Westbrook trade. I've never heard anyone even mention the Clippers."
"No they wouldn't.  Teams don't want Russell Westbrook, that's why Washington was able to get him for freaking John Wall (literally injured all the time and didn't play for almost 2 seasons) and a heavily protected pick."
"I'm not talking about his stats, I'm talking about his actual on-court basketball ability and contribution to winning playoffs basketball. The major criticism of Russ (beyond the idiotic stat padding shit) is that he doesn't do anything offball, provides no spacing and plays no defense.   He didn't provide any spacing in Houston but his defensive effort and ability to cut and screen was really good in that stretch before he got injured. That's the Russell Westbrook you need if you want to make it past the first round."

While there, he didn’t start on his high school’s varsity team until his junior year, and did famously not receive his first college recruiting letter until the summer before his senior year. "

"I mean rings don't define you as an all time great player. There's several dominoes that have to fall into place for you to win a ring.

With what Russell Westbrook could control he's beyond accomplished everything you can ask for in a NBA player."
"You're right, but it almost immediately becomes one of the top stories of the season. PG gets traded to LAC, and Russ requests to be traded to a contender. He gets sent to his old teammate James Harden, and CP3 gets sent to OKC. For all intents and purposes, OKC was expected to be a tanking team, but they were (at least in my opinion as an unbiased fan of the team) pretty entertaining to watch.   The playoffs come around, and while the Thunder exceeded expectations, the Rockets equally failed to meet their expectations. I know Russ is a Thunder legend, and most Thunder fans don't blame him for wanting to be traded to win a championship, but you can't tell me there wasn't a part deep down where you wanted to beat them just to stick it to him?  The outcome of the playoff 100% still ends with the Lakers hoisting the trophy, and there probably won't be much of a ""ripple effect"" for either Houston and OKC. Russ and Harden will probably still get traded and Houston will go full rebuild and Chris Paul will still end up in Phoenix cuz Presti needs his draft picks, but does this tarnish Harden's legacy? Whether it's a fair argument to make, will people say that he got to the WCF with Chris Paul and couldn't get out of the first round with Russell Westbrook?"

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

incoming Russell Westbrook comments in here 👇🏽
Zion is definitely better than Jaylen Brown and Russell Westbrook in that list above. You have to understand that both Brown and Westbrook’s defense are actually atrocious. He’s around a few of the other players.
"Jaylen Brown and Russell Westbrook are the only one I could say for sure I’d rather have Zion over at this very moment. But going into next season I’d take Zion over CP3, Gobert, Booker, Mitchell. I’ll take the two way wings in Butler, Tatum, PG though."
"Malik Monk and Nunn arguably wouldn’t have come if Westbrook wasn’t here lol. Two guys in their 20s capable of starting, on a vet minimum. It would’ve been hard to foresee if I was Dennis Schroder because, as we all know, I am no Russell Westbrook lol"
"its not even that, its more of teams don't have cap space to sign him for the contract he wanted. Dennis wanted a 100m contract so he turned down 84 thinking he could prove his value. He couldnt so now instead of 20m a year he is looking at MLE as no other team can sign him for that money and the one team that can sign him moved on with Russell Westbrook"
"All I ask is to think about how you are thinking compared to what I just said. Use all the bullshit I want? What bullshit - you mean *facts*? Stop using the truth? If highlights are all that matters, you must live in a bizzarro world where Bismack Biyombo is a top 5 centre after that block-dunk sequence five years ago.  &gt;	He's proved it time and time again.  You're trying to use a fact to back up your statement which is blatantly false: you tell me not to use the relevant facts but then make a claim that he shoots poorly in the clutch. But we both know that if he shot poorly in the clutch, he wouldn't shoot 49% from the field in the clutch. You are thinking irrationally here.  What you are saying is more indicative of a thought process that buys into bullshit narratives that make ESPN money than a thought process that involves watching and thinking about basketball. There are legitimate ways to disagree with what I'm arguing, but this is not one.  If Russell Westbrook is benched in more than one clutch situation for the lakers for a non-injury related reason, I will eat crow. But you need to realise that assuming he will be is absolutely absurd."
"He will never make a deal about anything he does for others. It only comes out when someone else tells the story. One of my favorites is him getting a stroller for one of our sideline reporters  &gt;Westbrook will never be a garrulous speaker, but he respected McCaslin’s candor. During the playoffs last spring McCaslin was pregnant, and Westbrook pestered her about when she was starting maternity leave. She didn’t understand why he was so interested. Finally, after a flight from San Antonio to Oklahoma City, Westbrook led McCaslin through the airport parking lot and popped the trunk of his car. Inside was a Maclaren stroller. “He’s more human than people would ever think,” McCaslin says. “He just doesn’t want you to know that.” When McCaslin thanked Nina for picking out the stroller, soon to be occupied by baby Hunter, Westbrook’s wife laughed. “That wasn’t me,” she said. “That was all Russell.”  From [this article ](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/20/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant)"
I don’t think it’s a big deal. Russell Westbrook sat in OKC’s skybox back in 2013 after tearing his ACL as well. As long as the team is cool with it…who gives a crap?
"Unrelated, but this is bloody brilliant - https://www.theonion.com/loyal-russell-westbrook-fan-tired-of-buying-new-jersey-1847415975"
If he's an elite shooter then Russell Westbrook is a good shooter
"Your 1999-2012 is accurate. Your 2012-2020 should not include James Harden though. He’s good but not a generational level talent. If guys like him are getting in, then Russell Westbrook too since he’s more of a freak talent wise than James Harden if we’re being honest."
"that’s like saying “russell westbrook spaces the floor for the sixers more than ben simmons” if the teams had swapped those players  sure, it’s true. it’s not exactly a great point in an argument though"
Did you really just try to compare Dennis schroeder and Russell Westbrook? Lmao.
D'Angelo Russell Westbrook Lopez
I just tuned in. How os Russell Westbrook looking with Anthony Davis?
"Really his problem is he just doesn't have a realistic outlook on how good he actually is. This is really a problem for any player who is like this. It's a big part of what the drawbacks to Russell Westbrook have been, just like it was with later career Allen Iverson, and like it was for years with Melo and Dwight Howard.   But those guys were all absolute stars who just had a hard time accepting that their role had changed as their skills declined. Schroder is clearly a guy who's ceiling is basically a very good bench player, but he apparently thinks he's a star, and that's why teams aren't willing to give him a contract.   Teams are willing to gamble on him for a small one year deal, where it's not too costly if it doesn't work out and they have to cut him, but nobody wants to make a big commitment to a guy who has a good chance of causing problems because he won't accept his role. Like even a team like Boston who needs a PG won't want to invest too heavily in a guy who may come in and picture himself as part of a ""Big 3"" with Tatum and Brown.   I'm sure if Schroder was fully willing to happily just be a 6th man and lead a bench unit on a salary that matched that role then the Lakers would probably be willing to bring him back. But who wants to give more than a small, short contract to a talented player who has a high risk of causing a bunch of problems with team chemistry? Nobody doubts that Schroder can actually play, this is all about his attitude and his willingness to accept a role which matches his skills."
"I saw an interview with rodman where he talked about how he trained to rebound. He would have his friends miss shots and he would study how the ball bounced based on where the shot was taken from and arc of the ball, etc... I don't think I have ever heard another play study that. I wonder if Russell Westbrook does that. His rebounding for his size is so good, he must do some kind of studying."
"&gt;Theres a reason why everyone wants him to come off the bench  Yes, and that reason is Russell Westbrook.  Did you think you were making a point?"
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good.

"Russell Westbrook obv had tampering going on, and throw McGee to us in there as well, why is the league so selective on who gets punished?"
"I feel like they have 3 guys who I would be comfortable playing over 25 minutes in a playoff game.   One of them will be 37 years old, another is injury prone and the third is Russell Westbrook.   Who else is there? Malik Monk and Dwight Howard are in your best 5? 36 year old washed up Ariza?   They are one of the shallowest contenders that I can remember."

"The best point guard in the league, Russell Westbrook."
If Jordan played in today's game he would be more like Russell Westbrook than either of those two. A much better Russell though.
"&gt;Kobe was the best shooter on the team of course he’s going to shoot more!  Not when he played with O'Neal.  Not when he played Pau Gasol.  Not when he played with Andrew Bynum.  Not even when he played with Karl Malone.  Or Lamar Odom.  Or a bunch of other guys.  Bryant was never the most efficient scorer on his team, but that never prevented him from firing up ridiculous numbers of difficult shots -- and that hurt his team.  &gt;Take a look at the Lakers rosters; no seriously look at the rosters after Shaq was traded who else is going to score? Give me one good scorer that you would trust to hit the shot if Kobe doesn’t have the ball.  This is the critical point that Bryant never could understand either.  The winner of a basketball game is not decided by which player scores the most points.  It is decided by which team does.  It doesn't matter if you have one player score 50 points, if he needs 40 shots to do it, if his more-efficient opponents have 5 players who each score 12.  If Bryant were a smarter player, and less egotistical, he could've created easy shots for his teammates constantly, and helped the **team** win.  Ironically, this is precisely what Russell Westbrook demonstrated last season -- and yes, the fact that I am using Westbrook as an example of smarter play than Bryant's, is astounding, and incredibly damning towards Bryant.  Bryant could've led the league in assists any time he wanted to -- like Westbrook did, and like James did the previous season -- and the Lakers would've been much better off, but Bryant's ego was too big, and his IQ was too small."
Of course! An autograph from Russell Westbrook would be amazing.
"&gt;About two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook went to LeBron James' home and together they and Anthony Davis had a conversation about the All-Star guard joining James and Davis on the Lakers.  &gt;[They talked about putting their egos aside and playing as one in their quest to bring the Lakers another NBA championship.

"Lmfao no. Are you saying Mario Chalmers is better than Russell Westbrook, Chris Bosh is better than AD, and Turiaf/Anthony are better than Gasol/Dwight?"
"Since a number of people are asking about context...  The Thunder were in the midst of a 13-2 run. Melo had missed a couple of layups prior then a Kevin Durant three and Russell Westbrook dunk led to a Nuggets time-out.   On the first play out of the time-out, Anthony squared up Durant from the high post and dribbled straight into Durant and lowered his head and shoulder into Durant's chest. Anthony lost his balance and fell to the ground with the ball still in his hands. He was whistled for traveling.   Anthony then lifted his arms to his head, moved his leg around, and exhaled, blinking as his teammates came over to help him up. Anthony, however, continued laying on the ground, holding one arm with the other, seemingly mouthing something to a teammate.   Likely due to the innocuous nature of the contact and the fact that Anthony was moving, blinking, and possibly talking, officials may have interpreted Anthony's response as being a form of protest in the midst of a huge Thunder run. As such, they allowed play to carry on.   Anthony sat out the remain 23.5 seconds of the third quarter. Doctors cleared Anthony of a concussion and quickly determined he was eligible to return to action. He then checked back in [37 seconds into the fourth](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201004070OKC.html) and played the rest of the game, scoring six points down the stretch. The following night, he played 42 minutes, [scoring 31 points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201004080DEN.html) (10-of-20 shooting) in a two point win over the Los Angeles Lakers.   Anthony's [claim](https://www.espn.com/nba/recap/_/gameId/300407025) is that he was initially conscious but as he laid there he eventually stopped being conscious."
Russell Westbrook
He wants to go to a contender so the only realistic locations/packages would be...  To the Clippers for Paul George  To the Lakers for Russell Westbrook  To the Nuggets for Jamal Murray  To the Suns for Chris Paul  To the Nets for Kyrie Irving  To the 76ers for Ben Simmons  To the Celtics for Jaylen Brown  I doubt half of these deals would ever happen tho. Philly seems the most realistic.
absolutely unreal... dude was a laughingstock and basically out of the league and the total 180 on his image post-Warriors is so complete that the US National team felt comfortable reaching out to him last minute to replace a guy from the squad. unreal  really sometimes is about the team you land on and the opportunities you get. Cameron Payne before the Bubble would have been best known by NBA fans as the scrub on the bench who did all the intricate dances with Russell Westbrook in OKC. in basically 1 year he went from Chinese league player to guaranteed bigtime NBA contract $$$ after getting a shot with the right team and backing up the right guy
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
"Center is the toughest position for team USA. Look at the best ones in the NBA. Guys like Jokic, Embiid, KAT, Ayton, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela -- all international.   Believe it or not, the only American in the top 10 in rebounding in the NBA last year was... Russell Westbrook!"
"The most regular season wins of all time, but definitely not the “winningest” team of all time. That goes to the Russell Celtics or MJ Bulls.   Best spot up shooter is probably Kyle Korver. This guy shot over 49% over the course of a season on 6 attempts per game. Obviously Klay is by far the better player because he has far greater defense and the better overall offensive package being able to cut to the rim, relocate, better utilizer of screens.   It was a team that lost in the finals to a superteam, and it was unlikely KD would have won a championship elsewhere without forming a superteam of his own. Why put in the risk and trouble of recruiting for a superteam when he can instantly create one by joining the second best team in the league? Do we discredit LeBron for Miami, Cleveland, and now LA with Westbrook and AD? The only time LeBron won a championship without two other all-stars was last year when he had a top 5 two way superstar with DPOY caliber defense. And that was statistically one of the easiest paths to a championship in 30 years because of COVID.   I agree that the optics were terrible, but it was a good business decision and honestly his only choice if he wanted a ring ASAP. In practice it’s really no different than what LeBron did, he just didn’t do the recruiting himself."
"&gt; “The Lakers probably would just naturally play better easily, because Anthony Davis doesn’t need to handle the basketball to be productive,” Smith said. “Russell Westbrook can pass and assist and rebound to be productive. LeBron doesn’t need the basketball to be productive. I think that when the Nets are at their best, their best players score. So with one basketball, I would say it would be easier for the Lakers to adjust to play better together.”  How is that a ""nonsensical"" take? Just because you disagree with it?  I don't necessarily agree with him but it's very clearly a coherent opinion."
"For those who just hate Kenny and didn't read the article, here's what he said:   *“The Lakers probably would just naturally play better easily, because Anthony Davis doesn’t need to handle the basketball to be productive. Russell Westbrook can pass and assist and rebound to be productive. LeBron doesn’t need the basketball to be productive.""*  While I think playing LeBron off-ball should only be used in spurts, it's hilarious that people are already writing this trio off before they've even played a game together. Y'all know basketball better than LeBron, I guess?"
Immortal Russell Westbrook

"I feel like the subreddit could really crack down on “fun facts” that aren’t relevant to anything, and in a lot of cases are a shallow attempt at a karma grab. There are a number of players with weird targets on their backs and get negative posts every so often that aren’t really relevant to anything - Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, Paul George, Porzingis.   One example that immediately comes to mind was the daily Ben Simmons posts that happened for weeks and weeks after the Sixers were eliminated - stuff like pointing out that Steve Nash missed fewer free throws ever than Simmons did in one postseason. Sure, it’s mildly interesting and borderline funny, but it’s really not relevant or improves the subreddit at all almost a month after the Sixers have been eliminated from the postseason."

"LeBum would plummet in the all time rankings in this scenario, Russell Westbrook however would end up Top 3 All Time"
"&gt;If he pulled this “ego bullshit” then why did the Lakers offer him a 4 yr extension AFTER he said he wanted to start?  Because at that point, their options were very limited. They didn't foresee Schroeder going 0-fer in a key playoff game, getting COVID twice or Russell fucking Westbrook being available for next to nothing. It all worked out in the end."
"Right? If someone believes that Russell Westbrook is the GOAT, they have as much of a legitimate opinion as anyone else."
Russell Westbrook.
Do you think Lebron was worse than Russell Westbrook in 2019? Cause that's the same logic.

"They were just one example of a team I follow closely because I was too lazy to look up a deal for *your* team. That's your job as a fan, but you decided to just throw up your hands and say it's impossible.  How about the return Washington got for Russell Westbrook? I doubt you could get the picks they got but you probably could have gotten Montrezl Harrell, KCP, and Kuzma for CJ McCullum was probably available and filled a lot of holes in the roster at both the 4 spot (Kuzma/Harrell) and the new void at the 2 (KCP) from moving McCullum.  It's difficult to be sure but not impossible, you're just not putting in the effort and neither is Portland's ownership."

"Plenty of guys have had to work on their jump shot. Early in LeBron's career he had the same rep of ""Needs a jumpshot"". Same thing with Russell Westbrook. (Russ' career 3-pt % of .305 is almost identical to the .300 that Simmons shot this season as a 24-year old.)   The difference is LeBron and Russ have legendary work ethics. LeBron made his shooting pretty solid and Russ improved his enough to be playable. Ben could be a really impactful player for the right team if he could work hard enough to have a close to average shot."
The Lakers will be paying Russell Westbrook 44 million was left out for some reason.
You’re not wrong lol.  &gt;the Lakers will spend $44.2 million on Russell Westbrook. During this time the Celtics will spend $2.6 million on Enes Kanter.
They will pay Russell Westbrook 5x more than Alex Caruso despite being only 0.5x as good.
He's also a left-hander that shoots right handed.  So is Russell Westbrook.
Because having to cut one ups the ante and lets you scream at people over social media because THIS DUMBASS SAID HE WOULD CUT RUSSELL WESTBROOK LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😂🤣😂

"Russell Westbrook, incoming starting center for the Lakers."
"Lmao yeah Trae young, Damian Lilliard, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook. Yeah, shoot first really dying off. You’re the worst at this."
This post misses the point though. Russell Westbrook is worth as much or more than all these players combined. Whereas all the roll players the Lakers signed were easily more valuable than Evan Fournier.
"If we did this for the NBA's entire history Westbrook would be a 3X all star, Tony Parker would have like 1, Arenas would have like 7, the Russell Celtics would only have been known to have 2 different all stars (Bill sometimes, Cousy other times) and Kemba Walker would be an 8x all star etc. Fun to think about though."

"Powell is too efficient.   Honestly? Russell Westbrook is basically a bigger, more athletic, (much) better Monta Ellis. They both can get to the rim in electric fashion, but shoot too much anyway. They both are frequently indifferent on defense and jack up bad shots at inopportune times.   Monta didn't have the ability to finish through contact that Russ does and was craftier as opposed to just sort of barreling into guys, but their mental approach to the game was very similar."
The Lakers will spend $44.2M total on the contract of Russell Westbrook in 21-22. The Rockets are gonna pay John Wall $44.3M during that same time.

That man is great for carrying your mediocre ass team and getting you wins in the regular season, but in the playoffs? He puts a hard cap on your ceiling and how far you can go, and we have years of evidence to prove this.   I'd have bought more into the Lakers as a Finals/championship caliber team if they *didn't* trade for Westbrook."
Knicks vs Bulls in the 1st round of the playoffs. 4v5 or 3v6. The Nuggets will finally get to the finals. Russell Westbrook and James Harden will make some boneheaded plays in elimination games that knock the nets and lakers out of the playoffs.
"The Hawks will be the one seed (they won't be better then the Nets or the Bucks in the playoffs tho)  Both the Knicks and the Bulls will be in the play in  The Mavs will be a big time disapointment, end up in the play in, but real dangerous in the first round because they have fired Jason Kidd  The Clippers will look like fringe contender   Ben Simmons will make 5+ 3's this season  Russell Westbrook will shoot 36+% from 3  Derrick White will average 20+PPG"
I don’t think a team can win a title with Russell Westbrook as a starter. So not winning a title imo.
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."

Russell Westbrook will have another great season and will still get relentlessly shit on by people in this subreddit.
"Russell Westbrook: Patrick Beverley 'Running Around, Doing Nothing' on Defense. ... ""Pat Bev trick y'all, man, like he playing defense,"" Westbrook said of Beverley while noting Houston's James Harden dropped 47 on the Clippers in a 102-93 victory. ""He don't guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing."""
Dang I didnt realize Kawhi had more points then Russell Westbrook in the playoffs
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."

So Blake Griffin should've had his contract shrunk because the Clippers decided to trade him? Or John Wall? Russell Westbrook? The NBPA will never agree to it nor they should. It gives owners the chance to trade away players who get injured to reduce the wage bill and gives the players nothing. The contracts aren't designed that way right now and the player association would have to agree to make the change. Why would they agree to reduce their own power?
All 3 OKC draft picks actually. Every “explosive” PG is the next Russell Westbrook.
"In a trade that makes zero sense for Philly, the Lakers send Russell Westbrook and practically no first round picks because New Orleans got them when we traded for Anthony Davis.  Philly would also need to send more players or cash because the salaries don't match. Russ makes $11 mil more than Ben this season."
"Russell Westbrook doesn’t play hard. He plays hard when he has the ball. Otherwise he stands around off ball on offense and defense, flexes and yells when he does something cool, and talks shit."
Wizards beating the Nets off a Russell Westbrook inbound steal and 3 was epic too. Nets had some all-time L's last season. Don't mean that disrespectfully just shows how hard people have to go at them in the regular season too
The player for me is: Russell Westbrook. Have come to appreciate how hard he misses shots EVERY….SINGLE……GAME. it’s unreal.
Russell Westbrook. There was something about him that I was not a fan of. I think it was his attitude and his demeanor and I just couldn't seem to enjoy watching him play. Fast forward to this past season and what he did in Washington was hands down the turning point for me. For his play and the constant shit he has to face from fans I realized he is a phenomenal talent and a snazzy dresser. Late to the game but I want to see him get that ring
No chance Russell Westbrook could do what Reggie Jackson did though.
"The jazz don't, but the Lakers do, his name is Russell Westbrook."
Russell Westbrook now and pretty much ever is a better basketball player than Rajon Rondo. Get the fuck outta here.  Rondo was terrible for the vast majority of the 2020 season for the Lakers. Played better in the playoffs but still had some real stinkers. And was absolutely terrible last year in both Atlanta and on the Clippers. Westbrook is coming off a very good season.  We've never seen Westbrook as a third option. Many of his weaknesses are likely to not be as big of a deal when he doesn't need to do everything for his team.
"For the majority of his career he was at or slightly below league average efficiency, but with much greater volume. His efficiency should rise back up given the decrease in his volume as the 3rd option, that's not a hot take.  He's been an average defender for the majority of his career, but Vogel is the first defensive-minded coach he'll be under, and their def are competent defenders on the Lakers, so I expect him to be at worst average defensively. That's not even accounting for the reduced usage which will allow him to expend more energy on that end.  This last point is the most valid concern, and that'll hinge on AD's shooting while also playing at the 5 for crucial matchups ([which is something they already apparently agreed upon](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/30/22601457/anthony-davis-told-russell-westbrook-hed-play-center-more-make-trade-work-lebron-james-lakers)).   But LeBron's shooting has been underrated, he shot 36.5% on 6 3s per game, and that increased to 37.5% on 8 in the playoffs. And with Russ to take over some of the playmaking roles he should get much easier looks at 3 to make the defense pay if they do sag off him."
"Because now you are paying Russell Westbrook, who is a bad defender, turnover machine, bad shooter, and cannot play off ball, paired with LeBron who is waaaay more effective with the ball in his hands and you now cannot afford good, consistent role players (that can shoot and play defense)"
"He was a rookie with Steph Curry confidence shooting Russell Westbrook numbers, but Warriors fans insisted the confidence waa the important part. Turns out they were right"
"Russell Westbrook averaged 24/6/8 as a second banana to KD during John Wall's career. During that same time, John Wall averaged 18/4/8. Russ had better efficiency btw.  Not to mention advanced stats, where westbrook completely blows John Wall out of the water, but that could be excused since John wall was on a much worse team with his second option being a young Bradley Beal compared to KD for Westbrook.   Sorry, but John Wall was never better than Russell Westbrook at any point in his career."
"We all know he's considering the Lakers. Imagine telling someone in 2015 that you could have a starting lineup of Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and LaMarcus Aldridge on the same team. Fuck I hate super teams lmao"

IQ is super important. Look at Russell Westbrook. Great length and the best athlete at PG in the NBA and yet he is not a good defender.
"I like that you put LEARNING in caps to celebrate Russell Westbrook, who in 13? seasons has never learned to play a different way.   What I'd prefer is a primary ball handler that can shoot."
"And all have had their most team success away from Russell Westbrook. KD 2 rings compared to lost Finals. PG 2 ECF 1 WCF compared to no playoff series wins. Beal 3 ECS compared to no playoff series wins.  Shit Harden averaged his 2nd highest, a ridiculous 34. But 2 WCF compared to a WCS. If history stays true then AD (or Monk like you called OP) is gonna go nuts and then they'll not do their best in playoffs."

"I dont think thats the notion that he cant win.     The notion is he cant win a title. Hes like Allen Iverson, Carmelo Anthony, etc. He is one of these guys who is a great great player but he doesnt make his teammates around him better enough to help get him over the hump.    The issue with Russ more so than AI and Melo is that with Russ he will LITERALLY shoot you out of big games by taking bad shots and trying to be a 3 pt shooter. With AI and Melo it was more like these two can just score at will and they will do so but it isnt going to translate to a win.     James Harden is in the same boat as AI and Melo. Hes great. He can win you a series. But he will also shoot you completely out of games too. He could go 5-25 from three in a playoff game and you lose it cuz he plays hero ball.     Westbrook, Harden, AI, Melo, etc.     Wilt Chamberlain was kind of the same way. Great player but his best teams were when he decided he was going to be a distributor and not just score 50 points per game. All of a sudden Wilt let the NBA in assists and they were drastically better as a team overall. Which is part of what makes Bill Russell so great. He couldve done what Wilt did but he didnt because it was better for the team for him to play the way he played.     Hero ball usually doesnt end up in guys winning titles. In fact I cant think of any time in the last 30-40 years where its worked, if ever. Even the Jordan and Kobe teams all had a top tier coach with other all stars."
"Completely disagree, hes the 3rd option as a scorer, and Lebron doesn't have to have the ball in his hands every possession, nor will he have the energy to do what Russ is also capable of doing as we saw fatigue start to come over Lebron last year when AD went out, and Lebron was forced to do everything again for the Lakers. Lebron can play off ball more often, and let Russ play PG. Russell Westbrook literally led the league in assists last year, while also having to be the #2 scorer on his team, now he can just focus on creating plays for all the star power around him on the Lakers, and he can still be a 3rd option when he gets open looks."
"My probably incorrect guess:  It's added on as part of the Russell Westbrook trade as a three team deal. The Nets want to be compensated a player, but they can't take on a player without paying a ton in luxury tax payments, so they want to dump Jordan. Meanwhile, the Wizards have a logjam at forward/center now, so they probably want to consolidate some of those players or trade them for better positional fits, so they're rerouting some of the players from the Lakers trade to yet another team. The Wizards have also been rumored to be interested in dumping Chandler Hutchison with a second or two since they'll be near or potentially above the luxury tax depending on what happens with the other trades, so that brings in one more team.  If it's not that then I'm also quite curious  Edit: totally forgot about the Pacers Wizards draft night trade, so there’s another team. Apparently the lakers are still trying to S&amp;T Schroder, so that could be another?"
"&gt; I picked those games because that's when they made their famous playoff run.  You picked those games because you wanted to support your argument that Westbrook is ""still an insanely good player.""  You're using stats the way a drunkard uses a lamp post--for support rather than illumination.  &gt;There's a reason teams signing new players look at how they player closed the previous season, not how they started it.  No front office is evaluating a player based on his last 23 games of the regular season--while ignoring his shitty play before that stretch and his shitty play during the playoffs.  Westbrook was [declared healthy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/01/russell-westbrook-healthy-wizards/) (by himself, his coach, and fans) whenever he had a good stretch earlier in the season. You can't just wish away his bad stretches by pretending he regained his health on the exact date that best supports the argument you want to make."
"Beal was injured in the 5 games previous that stretch. He was also injured more in that 15 game stretch. Regardless, Westbrook averaged 25/12/12 with a borderline G-Leaguers. Russell also hadn't become fully healthy until the last third of the season."
"I think the decline of Russell Westbrook is overstated though. Westbrook is still in his prime, he’s just changed a bit as a player. He’s not at his peak athleticism or speed anymore but he’s become one of the 3 best passers in the league."
"&gt;how do you think Russell Westbrook will fit in to the team?  Very aggressively, at 100 mph with maximum force, like he does anything else."
"Trust me they would. That's why superstars get to demand trades in the first place. Not treating a superstar right really hurts your chances with other stars. It would also piss off Paul George who wants to be paired with Kawaii in the first place.  Also most of the star players who will be in free agency will be Brooklyn's core. Assuming they don't want to break up their super team you're not getting any of them... So you're left with Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle, John Wall.... I think Leonard is better when healthy than those players.  Also signing a new super star means you have to make the cap room. You can't just use your bird rights. Makes you lose a lot of talent, sometimes assets to move contracts."
"&gt; If Lonzo with a roster of BI and Zion couldn’t make the playoffs, one of the players has to go.  what...?    they're literally all 23 or younger and all seem to be continuing to improve year to year.  why not give them another year or 2 to actually grow/improve together...?  The Wizards just traded 32 year old Russell Westbrook making fucking $45 Mil a year for positive assets.  I PROMISE YOU that 24/25 year old Lonzo at $21M/year will not be difficult to trade if it comes to it"
Russell Westbrook deserving the 2017 MVP over James Harden.
Because he's Russell Westbrook
It is physically impossible for some people on this app to give Russell Westbrook credit.
"I don't think so. They have Russell Westbrook in there now, and I think LeBron mentioned that he's going to shift more into a postup small forward instead of a point forward / point guard like what he's been playing as in LA so far."
Hold on. You are seriously comparing Alex Caruso to Russell Westbrook?
"Fair point about the team led by Westbrook/AD vs the other two. Interesting way of thinking of it   Just looking at the season, Devean George was the starter and 5th in MPG, averaging 7.4 PPG.   Byron Russell was 11th and only played 13 MPG and averaged 4 PPG. Horace Grant was 9th and played 20.1 MPG and missed lots of games, averaged 4.1 PPG. Rick Fox is fair, he was 6th in MPG and 4.8 PPG, but either way he’s worse than Carmelo."
"I don't think you could make a reasonable argument to start Westbrook and AD over Gary P and Malone. I don't personally  think it's remotely close, but arguing hypotheticals so you are entitled to your opinion. Imo a team led by AD and Westbrook is a first round exit while a team led by Malone and Gary P is a finals contender.   Ain't no way devean George is the next man up for the 04 Lakers. Byron Russell? Horace Grant? Rick Fox?"
&gt;Yes. We have all seen what works around LeBron and the Lakers went far away from that.  So LeBron with a secondary ball handler which is exactly what the Lakers did?          &gt;And I don't see how Russell helps when the Lakers have shown teams how to play him in the playoffs before.  You don't think Westbrook will help the Lakers to not blow leads when LeBron sits?
[538 RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/russell-westbrook/) says no.  I don't know what that's worth though.
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
"&gt;I mean most people have prime Lebron over him  Yeah, and most people are wrong.  Abdul-Jabbar won 6 MVPs in a decade, and has a very strong argument that he was robbed at least twice.  He also took an expansion team to a title, in dominating fashion.  &gt;Howard and Gasol are all time defenders  Neither managed anything similar to the defensive season Abdul-Jabbar posted in '71.  No one has -- not even Chamberlain or Russell.  &gt;offense their whole job would be too slow those two down and they might be able too.  Better players than those two couldn't.  And whoever is guarding Gasol can play free-safety, which is a luxury the modern squad will not have.  &gt;I’m not saying it’s clear just that it’s close  I was referring only to the frontcourt matchup that you described.  &gt;On the other side they have no one who could guard Lebron or Melo,   You would put Cooper on Russ  That depends on which version of James we are talking about.  The current one, at 250 pounds or whatever, would be tough for Cooper, but if say, 2007-ish James then I would put Cooper/Worthy on him, Johnson/Wilkes on Anthony, and Nixon/Scott on Westbrook."
"Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook"
Said Russell Westbrook had the worst finals performance from a point guard he’s ever seen
"I don't know about everyone else, but he kicked my dog in 2015. That's when it all went downhill for me.   Now, to be fair, my dog attacked Russ and started dry humping him. After a good two minutes, Russ kicked my dog in the testicles. This was actually convenient because I was going to neuter my dog the next day, but as it turns out, my dog could still procreate despite Russ kicking him square in the nuts. My dog fucked this poodle bitch a few weeks later and they had 100 puppies. We had trouble taking care of them, my wife and I, then a nice white-haired lady took them away. I wonder what those puppies are up to now. The white-haired lady gave my wife a nice fur coat for Christmas last year. She's really nice. Moral of the story: spay and neuter your pets, even if Russell Westbrook kicked your dog in the balls."
2014 finals is when everyone started to question his basketball iq  edit: i meant 2012 finals [Magic Johnson said Russell Westbrook is the worst point guard in the finals he'd ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_U5YWgBwYo&amp;ab_channel=kkrev2795)
"&gt;limited court vision and an inconsistent shot from range.  So, store-brand Russell Westbrook?"
"It's a team with Lebron, AD, and Russell Westbrook. They will coast to the playoffs load managing all 3 of them and everyone will ride on those 3 backs when they get there."
"It’s actually crazy that Russell Westbrook has played that much time, considering he’s a lot younger than the rest of these dudes"
"YOU ARE WAY OFF. LEBRON WANTED TO GO TO LA BECAUSE HE HAS A FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY, THIS WAS NOT ROB PELINKA'S DOING AND NEITHER WAS THE AD TRADE. THIS WAS ALSO ALREADY BROKERED BY LEBRON, NOT TO MENTION HE FUCKED THIS TRADE UP BY KEEPING KUZMA INSTEAD OF HART. LET'S LIST OUT THE THINGS PELINKA DID:  SIGNED MONTREZ HARELL   TRADED FOR DENNIS SCHROEDER  SIGNED KCP TO A BAD EXTENSION  SIGNED KUZMA TO A BAD EXTENSION  TRADED THE SHIT SANDWICH THAT WAS THOSE THREE CONTRACTS FOR THE ULTIMATE POPO PLATTER THAT IS RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND THAT CONTRACT.   &amp;#x200B;  ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOT?"

"i mean different people are entitled to their opinions but me personally i loved the Russ pickup, u guys need scoring and playmaking outside of ur top 2 and picked up another all star level player. Russ has a lot of haters bc of his statistical success but i thought that was a huge addition for the lakers. the only reason he’s been not valued much w trades is because he’s paid an insane amount. If he was just a FA and could be more reasonable deal 30-35 mil maybe then he’d have a ton of suitors.  I’m also very high on kendrick nunn and malik monk and u guys added a ton of shooters.  Not everyone hates russ, his haters are just very vocal. He’s a star level addition. Lakers in 2020 third piece was kuzma u can’t compare that to russell westbrook"
"5 finals appearances, 3 titles, 2 MVP’s and 2 scoring titles all in five years? Plus he’s the only player to average 26 ppg in the finals for the winning team without winning finals MVP - and that’s happened all three championships. Better return on investment than the other $200 million men Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert and Trae Young combined"
You think LeBron James Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook are not a superteam lmfaoooooooooooooo
"Caruso got left than the MLE. The Lakers wouldn’t even match the offer let alone give him more than that. Lol that’s disloyalty at its best.   You dumped Kuzma for Russell Westbrook. Kuzma would’ve gotten that contract on any other team that drafted him, it wasn’t a “fat” contract. You keep calling these mediocre contracts “fat”. You do NEED Westbrook. You just lost the first round and panicked. That’s why your roster is completely overhauled right now. Your team from this year and last year are completely different than the championship team.   Thanks for the long winded way of telling me what I already said. The Lakers dumped all their young players for Anthony Davis. BI and Lonzo only got paid as much as they did because of the strides they made with NOLA. Their reputations weren’t high when they left LA.   “You find me another team who wouldn’t make that trade” Find me another team that doesn’t trade IT for Kyrie Irving. You see? You’re proving my point for me.   IT didn’t get paid before or after his injury because he wasn’t good enough to get paid that much. Either way he wasn’t getting paid.   Why didn’t the Lakers re-sign him after they traded for him the season after? Because he wasn’t the same player.   You just asked me sarcastically if the Lakers were supposed to over pay Alex Caruso because you had his bird rights, but now you’re implying the Celtics should’ve given an undersized injured point guard a max contract instead of trading for Kyrie? Lol   AD’s father wasn’t right. If anything he exposed he’s a hypocrite. The Lakers dumped all their players for his son because he colluded with LeBron and his agency the year before and quit on his team. But yeah the Celtics are disloyal. It has nothing to do with just wanting to play with LeBron and be in LA. Definitely. Haha"
"Basically because it pretty much has to be a three team deal (either added on to the Russell Westbrook trade or a third team to take on Deandre Jordan) and the Nets want to be compensated for their role while the Wizards probably don't want to pay too much in draft capital or players for a FA signing, so all three teams have to be happy with the arrangement"
"&gt;so that he could get replaced by a $5M per year player  Russell Westbrook isn't a 5M a year player, lol."

"I know it’s probably a long shot, but I hope Toronto keeps him and doesn’t flip him.  Here’s why:  Look at all the over-performing NBA teams these last couple years and what do they have in common? Vet pgs that know what they are doing:  CP3, Jrue, Conley, DRose, Lowry, Rondo… and vice versa for underperforming teams (they have inexperienced, or shoot first pgs): Simmons, McCollum/Lillard, Lonzo, D Russell, Westbrook, etc.  Dragic is a vet that knows the right play to make.  Raps please keep him and let him steer the ship for a bit until these kids learn the game."

Russell westbrook has never been criticized before being a laker
Tatum made multiple Conference Finals as the best player on the team. Russell Westbrook has an 8-21 record without Kevin Durant in the playoffs in his career.
"Russell Westbrook is anti union/worker's rights, prefers contractors that don't need benefits."
“Russell Westbrook reminds me a little bit of my first marriage”
"I have zero optimism of another move. Maybe I’m being dramatic but this off-season is fucking garbage from Rob and Rich Paul. The fuck you thinking bringing on russ’ contract? If I knew it was gonna result in gutting the rest of the 12 roster spots, I’d tell Lebron and the wiz they can get fucked. I have to imagine there’s a better fit out there than $85 million of Russell Westbrook.   Fuck this shit bruh. This team can’t even shoot fucking free throws. Really excited they’re going against the grain and trying to outsmart the other teams with their 1960s fucking spacing.   I wanna be so wrong, but this shits gonna blow up back in their face"
"This team is no better than it was last season. Ariza, Bazemore, Ellington and Howard are pretty much done, Ariza especially. Everyone else is a year older, and I don't think Russell Westbrook chucking shots is going to do much but give LeBron a rest."
"We don’t, people forgetting Dinwiddie is unrestricted and we can absorb him into the Russell Westbrook trade.  Team’s trying to get us to do extra shizz we don’t even need to do lol"
Except they had Kevin Love and Isaiah Thomas coming off an injury as their 2nd &amp; 3rd best players as opposed to Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook
Dinwiddie can be absorbed into the Russell Westbrook trade
Imagine trading for Russell Westbrook but not Kyle Lowry lmao  Whoever is running the lakers Jesus Christ
"I don’t think people necessarily think we’re a finished product, it’s just that, even with whoever we get in FA, people think ultimately it’s not going to stop the “problem” from eventually coming true; that Russell Westbrook is bound to not fit at all with AD and Bron and this will bring our season to an end prematurely.  Now I’ll admit it myself, Russ’s track record is not the best and many have the right to be skeptical of fit given that record, but the dude is still a superstar and one of the most elite playmaking talents in the league along with being one of the most gifted athletes in the league as well. That possible combination with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, if optimally created, can’t be understated.  This could very well go badly and we do end up losing; but that’s the risk you have to take with your best player and main playmaker being almost 37 years old. And the signings we’ve made have been solid, we’ve gotten good 3&amp;D wing depth and gotten a valuable big man piece back in a very weak center market. And we have more assets to spare to get more good talent.   And it’s a long season, anything can happen. Trades etc. you gotta look at what you’ve done right now, and what you can do right now, instead of trying to guess the future off what the past may have shown. That’s why our 2019-2020 team did so well and won it all.   I believe we’re on the right track, just gotta be patient and see what other moves we make."
There are plenty of Billionaire owners that are tightwads when it comes to Player Payroll. Y'all already have 3 Supermax players.  Payroll for 2021-2022 Season:  Russell Westbrook 44 Million  Lebron James 41 Million  Anthony Davis 35 Million  120 Million for 3 players.  Those 3 players alone almost match CHI entire payroll which was around 126 Million before signing Caruso. Are the Lakers going to re-sign Schroeder? Maybe this deal was to get him back for next season?
"Russell Westbrook here, I don’t know"
Because he's Russell Westbrook.
Ok they got 1 trash pick and no tradable assets for Russell Westbrook. What's step 2 again?
Russell Westbrook shot 43% from there this season.
yeah the idea that crips are gonna conduct an forensic investigation of a death note and then kill someone over a threat to russell westbrook. sad to see what so much sun does to the brain

Of course! But no one was calling Westbrook a star past season and now all of a sudden he is? If Russell is being labeled as a star then Jrue should too. So both teams have 3 stars.
"The Los Angeles Lakers are nearing a deal with the Washington Wizards to acquire Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski."

"Ah yes, Lebron, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook. The truest underdog story."
I agree 100%. This is some stupid shit.  You have to believe that Pelinka knows better. It's probably LeBron and AD pushing for this trade since players always misevaluate the talents of other players. No modern GM would actually want this lineup of four mediocre shooters:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Russell Westbrook 2. LeBron James 3. Anthony Davis 4. Random 7-Footer who will play Center when AD is scared.

They Fucking Did It. They traded their second best shooter for Motherfucking Russell Westbrook. Alright.
Sharpshooter Russell Westbrook going to shoot lights on the Lakers
[WOJ] Breaking News: Russell Westbrook to the Lakers is officially done. Both sides working on minor details at the moment before announcing deal. #Lakers #NBA
A declining Russell Westbrook is not a prime James Harden
"Woj Tweeted Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN.  That feels like so little for Westbrook, why would the wizards do this? Are they going to move Beal too and go full rebuild?"
Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma and Cranberry Sprite
"Im ngl, this is a great package for Russell Westbrook. Wizards must know Lakers are desparate."
Russell Westbrook
"With Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook likely staying in Washington, I'd expect there's a strong chance DeRozan can end up with the Wizards."
I thought it was opposite. First it seemed like a funny idea and then it quickly turned into cheesy nothingness with one good line from Russell Westbrook.
"What if they give him for a bad contract, but still a good player. Maybe for Kemba Walker or best case scenario Russell Westbrook. Seems plausible and I could bet that Embiid would view Russ as an upgrade from Ben Simmons."
You acting like that was crazy feat he had Russell Westbrook on his team who dropped 40 in the finals and harden who was 6th man and was killing it to the way to the finals
unfortunately it was prime Russell Westbrook who promptly went behind the back with the baby and shot a pull-up jumper directly into the sink
"The question is... how far into the bench would USA have to go to lose to the world's best?  Team 1 = Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar  Team 2 = Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Shaquille O'Neal  Team 3 = Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Wilt Chamberlain  Team 4 = Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Bill Russell  Team 5 = John Stockton, John Havlicek, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Moses Malone  Team 6 = Isaiah Thomas, James Harden, Scottie Pippen, Anthony Davis, David Robinson  Team 7 = Bob Cousy, Allen Iverson, Bob Pettit, Elvin Hayes, George Mikan  Team 8 = Russell Westbrook, Rick Barry, George Gervin, Dominique Wilkins, Bill Walton"
Russell Westbrook shot 36% on 150 attempts for a stretch of the 2012-13 season. I guess that meant he had potential as a shooter. LMFAOOO.
"Adding Russell “Regular Season God” Westbrook to the Lakers would easily make them a super team. His defense would be elite in Vogel’s scheme. When the playoffs start, you can trust him to handle the ball in any situation. His IQ is underrated. His motor will keep the offense up throughout the game. If the Lakers can also grab some consistent shooters it’s a wrap."
That's called Russell Westbrook.
"I kind of want it to happen in a ""some men just want to watch the world burn"" sort of way.  I genuinely have no idea how this team would work, I don't know what the roles would be or how these players would adapt to them. Aside from ""please, someone, anyone who can shoot"" I can't figure out which ring chasing role players make sense to try to add to glue the whole thing together.  LeBron is a point guard in the body of Karl Malone. Anthony Davis is a shooting guard in the body of Kevin Garnett. Russell Westbrook is a much shorter, much more inefficient Wilt Chamberlain. Is Russ the Center on this team? I'm only half joking when I ask that question.  But it'll certainly be a spectacle, both the product on the court and the endless discussions and arguments and gloating and excuse-making and hot takes it'll generate. So fuck it, roll the ball out, let's see what happens. It'll be super interesting, that's for sure."
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"&gt;He says he continues to believe that there are FAs who would ""love"" to play with Beal &amp; Russell Westbrook.  My sources confirm that this is in fact not true."
"&gt;there are FAs who would ""love"" to play with Beal &amp; Russell Westbrook   Nice!  &gt;though the Wiz only have the non-taxpayer MLE when free agency starts this weekend.  Oh"
I can’t think of a worse pairing than Russell Westbrook and Ben Simmons.
So because it’s a Russell Westbrook his mvp is worthless 😂😂 right ? He never averaged a triple double and got a mvp right ? Man you are so delusional it’s funny
Russell westbrook
Always felt like he was Russell Westbrook of that era. It was more about the story and hero mentality rather than results.
"What else are they supposed to do? They can't tank and they just signed their franchise player to an extension. I don't think trading away the #9 pick, Buddy Hield, and Marvin Bagley would hurt the team.  It's not like they're going to trade multiple 1sts and Haliburton for Russell Westbrook."
"&gt; I don't see any team trading an all star-caliber PG for any combo of those pieces.   They might if that PG is either an unrestricted free agent who might tell his team to trade him to the Lakers or he'll just walk and leave his team with nothing (i.e. possibly Kyle Lowry or *maybe* Chris Paul), or if that PG is incredibly overpaid to where his team might just want to get off his contract (i.e. Kemba Walker or Russell Westbrook). It's not like they could use these pieces for Steph or Dame though, obviously.   &gt; the Lakers don't have many picks to trade.   They have the 22nd pick in this year's draft and their 2027 1st round pick, along with a bunch of 2nds.  &gt; Kuz has seemingly been on the trade market for years now and no trades have materialized.   That's not really accurate, or rather doesn't reflect the truth there. Up until free agency starts and Kuzma's extension kicks in, he'll have been on his rookie contract this whole time, meaning before this season he was on a deal that paid him less than $2 million per year. Just because of the need to match salaries, it's impossible to trade a guy making that little and get anything valuable in return, and at that price the Lakers wanted to keep him and see how he developed. It's tough to get good rotation players for less than the minimum like that.   Once Kuzma signed that extension last off-season it made trading him this year basically impossible because of [the poison pill provision,](https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1340781915226435588?s=19) and because the Lakers were hard capped. This upcoming free agency is really the first time in Kuzma's entire career where it will have made any sense for the Lakers to trade him. That's why nothing has ever materialized. People on here have talked about him getting traded for years, but it has never been realistic before now.   &gt; Lakers aren't really in any position of leverage with the assets they have.   This is wrong for one reason, and it applies to all three players: Bird rights. It's the same reason why Lowry is probably going to be signed and traded rather than just signing as a free agent: because the good teams who might want him are capped out, so he'll need to involve the team that has his Bird rights to get to where he wants to go.   Maybe if Schroder and Caruso get monster offers in free agency from teams they want to play for then they'll leave (as would Kyle Lowry if that happened), but it's highly unlikely that happens. Some shitty team with a lot of cap space isn't going to want to blow it on those guys. The only teams who might want to give them big deals are contenders looking for more depth, but those teams are capped out, and thus would need the Lakers involvement.   THT is a different case because he's [a restricted free agent that is Arenas limited,](https://youtu.be/YdCOrUGdgg8) meaning teams can't offer him more than the MLE, and the Lakers are able to match any offer he gets. So if some team desperately wants him, they probably will need the Lakers involvement as well.   So the Lakers don't have *total* leverage over those guys, but it's wrong to say they ""aren't really in any position of leverage."""
"They were 3rd in the West two of the 6 years in question. I think he should have made it probably both of those years in concept, just based on his performance and the team performance. But in practice those years you still had Westbrook/Harden/Lillard/Curry/Thompson in the West already. You can't really justify adding a 6th guard.  If he's in the East I think he's a 2 time All-Star right now. It's that simple. At the very least he makes it over D'Angelo Russell in 2018."
"Yeah that’s true. No one here watched Oscar, and less and less people got to witness Magic or Stockton. Recency bias is going to cause a lot of strife in those conversations.   You can’t really talk about Oscar anymore because it’s all stats, and by that metric Russell Westbrook should be a top 5 PG."

fact: trae is a defensive sieve because of his wiry frail frame and low weight. he is not one inch shorter than steph curry and russell westbrook lol
"Yeah this still seems like a wild exaggeration. He might be a little quicker than Shai in transition, but that’s not Cade’s calling card at all. And even if it’s true that he turns into a 6-8 Russell Westbrook/Deaaron Fox (laughable) in transition, that’s really no grounds to call thesupersized Shai comp “horrible.” Both are just not very athletic, but extremely well rounded players otherwise with few flaws."
"Because he’s younger, cheaper, and they would get a guy like Kuzma in return. + it would be doing Westbrook a solid. You gunna keep Russell around when he wants to be in LA?"
"Morey got rid of the Al Horford contract after 1 season and traded Josh Richardson for 3 years of prime Seth Curry. He also acquired Harden in Houston in the first place. And Chris Paul. And Dwight Howard. And Russell Westbrook. Sure Harden and CP3 were the reasons the team challenged that KD-era Warriors, but Morey built it."
"&gt;I do, but it's objectively wrong to say Kobe was more efficient.  You don't say Russell Westbrook is more efficient than Allen Iverson even if his TS% is higher. Efficiency is something to be used relative to time period. Iverson being slightly inefficient for his time compared to Russ being far more inefficient for his time makes Russ a more inefficient player."
But I thought Russell Westbrook chased superstars away?
Fortunately for him trading Westbrook and that $47 mil is easier said than done.  (I also dont really think this is going to come down to Westbrook in terms of what dictates Beal's decision. If he choses he wants to move on not gonna be about Russell Westbrook either way).
Russell Westbrook drives F1?
"The dress code was specifically to stop them from coming into the game with durags and chains and stuff, not on court attire.  It was supposed to make them look more professional to tidy up the image.  There's on court dress code stuff too, but the controversial one was the off the court attire.  Obviously that part has become pretty lax and now you have Russell ""Burlap Sack"" Westbrook walking into the games.  But the main point was pretty much stop looking like big scary black guys cause it's scaring off a bunch of viewers."
"Just curious, is Russell Westbrook not of Dennis' stature? Cause that's what it's looking like on the trade front."
"I've ran into a handful of Spurs players, and I've had friends run into a ton of players from other teams when they come into town to play (my friend never let's anyone forget about the time he sold Russell Westbrook a snow cone at his job a few years ago). Me and my friends never really bothered them.   I know two stories of Lonnie Walker getting bothered by fans in public his rookie season though so that's not always how it goes"
Russell Westbrook
"Simmons, Thybulle, and 3 first rounders is better than Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and 4 first rounders.  And yeah a lot of the league wasn't going after him hard because Houston's dumb owner decided he was just gonna hold onto him until after the regular season started for no reason lmao.

There are really people being upvoted for saying they would take Caruso over fking Russell Westbrook. God I hate this sub
 Russell Westbrook makes an All-NBA team.
Ah yes because Russell Westbrook was just some bench warmer and not another star player that averaged 25/7/8 in the playoffs.  Y'all act like 30/5/8 is nothing.
"Not really.  People think he can’t shoot because of his NBL stats but we should really disregard that now that we have a solid NBA sample size.  LaMelo made more threes his rookie season (92) than he took his entire season in the NBL (80). He shot 48% on 2s last season, putting him in the company of Trey Young, Kamba Walker, and Ja Morant. He shot better from 2 than Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Edwards, Russell Westbrook, Dennis Schroeder, Julius Randle, and D’Angelo Russell.  I’m too lazy to look up his stats before the injury, but if memory serves me correct he was shooting something like a 50/38/80 split. Post injury all his numbers really got dragged down and he couldn’t hit a three to save his life. Besides him constantly grabbing it every stoppage in play, it was obvious he needed more rehab time on that wrist to get his shooting form back.  But just from watching him, kid has a shooters touch. People hold his janky form against him but the ball goes in and his touch on 20 foot floaters is insane. Not to mention once he slowed down on his free throw routine he started shooting 85%.  Guy is a shooter, I think this next year really shows it."
literally looks like Russell Westbrook on these two plays
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
Russell Westbrook was very commonly seen as a top 5 caliber guy
1. LeBron James ($111.2 million) 2. Stephen Curry ($92.8 million) 3. Kevin Durant ($87.9 million) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo ($80.3 million) 5. Russell Westbrook ($74.2 million) 6. James Harden ($62.3 million) 7. Damian Lillard ($56.3 million) 8. Klay Thompson ($54 million) 9. Paul George ($47.8 million) 10. Jimmy Butler ($47 million)
Russell Westbrook
Psh yeah [Lillard never looks explosive](https://youtu.be/Ap-yzvWirIs)      What does that even mean lol. Not everyone who’s athletic plays like Russell Westbrook.
I can’t believe we traded this guy for Russell Westbrook
"Booing, hopping on chants, shit like that is perfectly normal. Doing the kind of weird personal shit that constantly happens to Russ? That sucks. That’s shitty.

Nah it's just no one was talking about Westbrook one way or the other but yet you feel the need to come in and bring him up. If you wanna create some strawman about how we were all saying russ is a much better rebounder than Drummond go ahead but I would suggest just not thinking about Russell Westbrook so much.
Lakers should try that route with Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook played inefficient for the wizards the beginning of the season but became more efficient towards the end. i would expect this from him at the lakers too
[Russell Westbrook + LeBron James  = Lakers preseason record](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2021/10/09084706/USATSI_16916872-1024x683.jpg)
Russell Westbrook is inevitable.
"Russell Westbrook. That’s easy. There’s no way in hell Russ is actually outside the top 100 players in the league based on last season but RAPTOR and Win Shares, two holistic measurements, rank him outside of the top 100 players. It’s absurd that people take these metrics so seriously when they are wildly off base on quite a few players."
Alright Imma ask you this: Kyle Lowry or Russell Westbrook all time?
"[Wojnarowski] Russell Westbrook has left the game after the end of the 1st quarter and is heading to horny jail, sources tell ESPN."
"Really? Because in the last 5 years, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, D'Angelo Russell, and Goran Dragic have all been All-Stars. Point guard defense is greatly overrated. Westbrook and Harden have won MVP's while playing almost no defense. Dame is considered a top 10 player while being a bad defender."
"That was Game 6, in Game 7 he was absolutely fantastic, he simply didn't get enough shots up because Russell Westbrook is the actual worst."
"&gt;Vaccination Status and Star Treatment:  &gt;Yet team management and ownership figures across the league have voiced frustration about double standards for players like Irving, whom the NBA does not require to be vaccinated.   &gt;Meanwhile, the league does require basketball and business operations staffers to be vaccinated, and they are subject to close contact with unvaccinated players.  This has nothing to do with ""star treatment"" and everything to do with collective bargaining.   I'd note there's also no mandate on owners being vaccinated.  &gt;Proposals have varied, but they largely center on something that would be a reverse trade kicker of sorts, where players can receive a maximum bonus of 15 percent of their salary if a team decides to move them. Some team officials want to see a player who requests a trade forfeit upwards of 70 percent of his salary. Others have told B/R about what seems like a far more realistic scenario, where the player in question would only make 60 percent of his guaranteed money once he requests a new team.  These are pipe dreams from owners. There is no formal definition of a ""trade request,"" and there is no workable definition. Players can very easily make it be known that they want out without ever directly requesting a trade, and encouraging players to do that through the media rather than directly with the front office doesn't resolve any problems.  &gt; Paying a player up to 35 percent of the salary cap when rival suitors cannot hinders a front office's ability to surround that player with the supplementary talent needed to win a championship. And when that team drifts out of contention, that player has typically requested a trade, such as Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City and James Harden in Houston. Many rival executives hope the same eventually occurs with Damian Lillard in Portland.  The OKC and HOU front offices cheaping out by refusing to pay the tax to compete is not an actual problem the league needs to resolve. Giving superstars a smaller portion of the cap will just lead to superteams fitting more stars onto their rosters.  &gt;But executives are curious about adding a budgeted waiver system that would allow teams to bid on bought-out players similar to the popular free-agent budgets in fantasy sports  This sounds fun, but I'm not sure many players would agree to buyouts if they couldn't control their next move."
"&gt; The model does not like this version of the team. L.A. has the ninth-best projected record in the conference, which would have the Lakers once again competing in the play-in tournament. The reason behind that: RAPTOR views LeBron James and Anthony Davis as the only net-positive players on the roster during the regular season.4 The model is particularly low on Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony, who are projected to play sizable roles. It’s notable that L.A. is given a better chance of postseason success than its projected win-loss record and point differential would suggest — and that’s largely due to the presence of James and Davis."
"His playmaking comes with record breaking usage rates and turnovers. If he has that kind of usage rate in LAL that will hurt the rhythm of James and Davis, making it even harder for them to carry the team. His rebounding is good. Winning MVP 5 years ago is irrelevant. He's not that caliber player anymore.  You tell me, do you think the Lakers have a better chance of closing games against the best teams in the league with the ball out of Lebron James' hands and in Russell Westbrook's because Westbrook can't be used off-ball?"
"Players who aren't that naturally athletic use it. Steph, Kyrie, Trae, CP3 are four little guys that use the bank. For bigger guys PG13, Russell Westbrook use it too. They don't use it the way Tim Duncan, Scottie Pippen or Dwade used it as THEIR shot, but they use it a fair amount."
Russell Westbrook got me into the game of basketball.  His hustle and his dedication is the way I like to play.  I will cheer for wherever he plays until he retires then I’ll go back to my hometown team.
"John Wall, Andrew Wiggins, D-Lo, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Kristaps, Kevin Love...  It might be more rare to get dramatically better after getting a max contract than it is to stay exactly the same (or worse, due to injury, lack of motivation, or age-related decline)."
"The guy's main point was that Buddy would be more valuable for this team than Westbrook.   Westbrook doesn't have to be as bad as he's been in the preseason, but he has been consistently bad in the playoffs for years now..... these takes aren't formulated on a few preseason matchups. Literally has not been a positive in the postseason going on 5 years now  In last seasons playoffs in fact...his TS% was 46, on 5 turnovers a game. The Wizards on/off numbers were better without him through chunks of the season  Buddy on the other hand, is a high volume high percentage sharpshooter. So yea Russell isn't going to be 7 ppg 7 TO bad maybe not but chances are he'll more than likely be bad again when they need him not be"
"&gt; Does Russell Westbrook steal rebounds from his teammates? &gt;  &gt; According to Carmelo Anthony, the answer is a resounding yes. &gt;  &gt; En route to averaging a triple-double last season, the league’s reigning MVP drew criticism and praise alike. Some saw his amassing mind-numbing numbers as the result of an obvious pursuit to accumulate stats, while others credited him for having tremendous game impact. &gt;  &gt; Along the way, onlookers began to notice that Westbrook’s teammates would often box opposing players out and essentially clear the way for him to get an “easy” rebound, while others openly opined that he would “steal” boards whenever he got the chance. &gt;  &gt; Lightheartedly, Anthony confirmed what many have said about Westbrook—he’s a tiny bit of a kleptomaniac on the glass. &gt;  &gt; “He steals,” Anthony said with a smile on Tuesday. &gt;  &gt; “Sometimes, I wanna fight him a little bit and push him out the way.”  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2769810-carmelo-anthony-russell-westbrook-steals-rebounds-from-thunder-teammates"
"I don’t see how anybody could consider a team that has Russell Westbrook on it and playing a large role in 2021 as favorites to win the Conference.   I think Phoenix and Utah are co-favorites, and I have the Lakers/Blazers as the solid 2nd round teams but nothing more."
The mystery team is offering Russell Westbrook and Talen Horton Tucker. I wonder who the mystery team could be!
A pleasant interaction on a reddit thread about Russell Westbrook. What is happening
Why are you acting like he isn’t playing with LeBron James and Anthony Davis? It’s a guarantee that the Lakers are an easy contender if they’re healthy. Russell Westbrook as your third best player means that your team is in a great place.

"Russell Westbrook, huge fan of analytics and a darling of the analytics world, clearly made that calculation before trying to draw a foul under the old rules."
"Because russell is a top 20 nba player who averaged like 24/11/11 last year and pulled the wizards to the playoffs..   Poole averaged 12/2/2 last year and has had a good preseason.... I get he’s a “a good shooter” but he’s not even close to the level of Westbrook, even if russ is “washed”...    You said specifically to ignore contracts which makes it especially dumb. Russ is making like 5x what Poole is"
I love Russell Westbrook the person. He seems like such a genuinely good dude. I just don't think his style of play leads to winning basketball (at least in the playoffs)
Because a combination of 2 top 10 players who’s skill sets fit together along with Russell Westbrook who is still the same level of player as derozan isn’t worse than the bulls with AD. It’s really weird how you say people aren’t arguing about preseason games. Do you not see what this entire thread is about lmao. Judging this team based off preseasons stats and play. When it’s their first time playing together and they aren’t even playing an actual full intensity game. Fit doesn’t have more value than talent. Especially when the best talents  (lebron and AD) fit together. And the only thing that needs to be worked on is synergy with Westbrook. Which is far from impossible like you make it seem.
You think Russell Westbrook isn't competitive?
"Shooting sub-40 from the field and sub-20 from 3 and up 1 against LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook without Steph or Draymond (or Klay).

"Think about what Russell Westbrook was in 2017. Subtract some rebounds and playmaking, add some more scoring ability."
"They had different skill sets but he reminds me of Russell Westbrook in some ways.   Both guys play really hard, but not with the most efficient use of that energy.   He was a bad defender. You could say that Iverson played hard on defense but it was trying to get in the passing lanes and get steals at the cost of being out of position.   He was a talented scorer and would absolutely battle at that end. But he was very inefficient. And he wouldn't fit in well with others.   The '01/02 season sums up Iverson.   44 minutes per game. Lead the league in steals and points... but he averaged 31 points per game on 49%TS. That's insane. And he was getting to the line 10 times per game, so he was shockingly inefficient outside of his FTs.   He was scoring 23 points from the field on 28 shots and averaging 4 turnovers.   They were the 23rd ranked offense in the NBA. They managed to win 43 games because they had Mutombo, Snow, Mckie and Harpring making a top 5 defense."
"Stein makes 32 selections.

Russell Westbrook averages 10
You can't appreciate the horror of Russell Westbrook until you watch him play for your team over a full season. He is the most unwatchable player.
"You’re right, but westbrook has been criticized his whole career for his team’s shortcomings which aren’t completely wrong but when the lakers struggle this year westbrook will be the prime target. I hope he wins a chip so he can get one but idk if my russell defense is up for what is to come."
"https://theathletic.com/2848702/2021/09/27/superstar-shopping-lebron-russell-westbrook-and-the-lakers-summer-of-recruiting  it's the athletic, so yeah."
"Should have worded it better. He was extremely efficient for Russell Westbrook. Set a career high in FG% and was dominant inside. When Russ puts his head down and commits to being an inside scorer, he’s excellent. 27 ppg on 47% FG is great for a guard no matter how you slice it. You would always take that on any team from one of your stars."

"Russell Westbrook Syndrome exists. A thread is ""infected"" when a Westbrook triple double is mentioned, and people on /r/nba start to become confused about what it means to be good at basketball.

"Hey, I amended things by saying he might be helpful as a 6th man.  I'm just saying, even at his absolute best-- his MVP season-- he took his team to what, the 6th seed and a gentleman's sweep in the first round?  How is this impressive at all?  Why would you want Russell Westbrook on your team if at his best, he can't even get you HCA?  He needs to be the guy with the ball in his hands to be effective.  If he doesn't have the ball in his hands, he's not effective.  At his most effective, his teams still aren't anything special.  There's literally nothing to gain, or no winning to be had by having Russell Westbrook on your team, unless you think 47 wins and shallow triple doubles are wins.  I guess you can argue that I'm glossing over his time in Houston, but I still think the money spent on him there would have been better spent surrounding James Harden with better talent, and I feel the same way now about the Lakers."
i can make fun of his poor shooting percentages and inefficiency  pretty much just russell westbrook except with much worse rebounding

McHale had the advantage of being the 2nd option to a top 10 player, but the others, including Zion, did it with the defense focused on them. They are outliers. An argument can be made that this era makes it harder because you couldn't quadruple team a driving Kareem like they sometimes did to Zion. But I think that doesn't really matter. These were all massive outlier seasons in the era they played in Zion included.   But back to the Barkley comp.  Is Zion better than Barkley was at 20 and 21? Yes. Is he better than Barkley was through their first 82 NBA games? Yes. Comparing a second year player to the peak of one of the all time greats is pretty disingenuous.  Maybe he doesn't improve at anything from here on out, but it would be shocking if what Zion was last year is his peak. No one else in his tier of players has peaked at 21. But he's had one really concerning injury he already recovered from and a couple of annoying injuries. Maybe he never gets healthy. But that's the only way he doesn't improve.  And no, not every prospect has that 2% chance. Going off the Pelicans roster Kira's peak if he develops what he is good at will still never be Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook, other super fast point guards. Kira's absolute potential peak is probably around 2nd or 3rd year De'aaron Fox, not even an All-Star.  Jax's ceiling is unusually high for an 8th pick.His floor is also unusually low for an 8th pick. The dude can be special if the game ever clicks for him. Also, and I didn't make this clear at all, even at his 2% peak he'd still be just below AD in terms of tiers and he'd likely never get an MVP vote."

"he’s a floor raiser. no team that has russell westbrook will be genuinely bad because he is too talented and too involved in the game to let that happen. in the same breath, his style of play limits how good a team can be with him on the floor, especially in recent years with his ability diminishing. he can’t be defined as a winning or losing player because he is truly the first and only player of his kind, for better or worse."
"My thoughts exactly.  Use Westbrook as an innings eater and then flip him to, for example, the Wolves for Beasley or Russell or somebody who isn't a floor raiser like Russ but helps them make a playoff push like he did in Washington last year."
&gt;absolutely pathetic  Russell Westbrook
"He might not be the most efficient shooter or best decision maker, but Russell Westbrook for damn sure doesn't fucking suck at basketball."
And the deadliest sniper in the game Russell Westbrook
"Westbrook helps the lakers win about as much as Schroeder did. Lebron makes a big difference, but a ball dominant guard with a bad shot and a tendency to turn it over is a big problem too.  Russell Westbrook is an extremely dangerous x-factor. His performance is going to cost the lakers more games than he gives them and it probably won't be close."
It really is insane we were able to get out of the Russell Westbrook contract with decent assets that turned out to be amazing because the Lakers thought Brodie was an excellent point guard that didn't need the ball in his hands 24/7
Wiz about to be 4-1 and Lakers are 2-3.    I love Russell Westbrook the player and the personality but goddamn that man just isn’t conducive to winning basketball.
Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook was probably hangry. Good time to get a snickers, bruh."
Russell Westbrook needs to be a sixth man
"'Russell Westbrook is better than Chris Paul"""
Russell Westbrook had the greatest season of all time to go without any All-star or All-NBA recognition. People 10-15 years from now will look at the season he had an be completely stunned that he didn’t even make an all-star team.
Probably anything about their love of Russell Westbrook and/or the Lakers.
Russell Westbrook is good at defense
"It’s not just about the stats, it’s the fact that he basically willed his team to 47 wins that season. When Westbrook wasn’t on the court that team was STRUGGLING. Russell had an on-off points per 100 possessions of +63 vs the rockets. Westbrook just meant more to his team. Without Westbrook that team was garbage and is likely the 12th seed"
I think what separates Vince from other high flyers is just that he can take off from any position. Like you couldn't imagine Dwight Howard jumping off of one foot and floating for slam and you can't imagine Russell Westbrook taking off from a 2 foot standstill and destroying the rim. But Vince could do it all
"It's weird, since I would agree on the basic concept that you lay out, but Russell Westbrook is unfortunately a player where number are not kind to him even when you do put them to the context."
“Chris Paul is better than Russell Westbrook right now”
"Malik Monk, THT another year of growth, Russell Westbrook"
"Russell Westbrook, known playoff choker, and was bad for most of the regular season last year, he’s certainly gonna be a fit with the 37 year old and the injury prone center come playoff time"
Russell Westbrook should have been MVP last season (sorry Big O)
"Russell Westbrook.  Also, now I know that Davis Bertans and Westbrook have the same birthday. Must've been a nice moment in the Wiz locker room finding that out"
"&gt;Harden was on a much better team and all he did was shoot.   Harden averaged more assists than westbrook did.  &gt;westbrook did everything hence the triple double  So because harden only averaged 29/8/11 compared to Westbrook’s 30/10/10, he somehow did significantly less? They both played 81 games. I mean don’t get me wrong, it’s really impressive how westbrook scored 200 more points on 400 more field goal attempts but at the end of the day, we value winning right? If we were handing mvps to players in low seeds for carrying then AD’s trophy case would be littered with em.   So statistically, if harden and westbrook had basically the same output in terms of counting stats (unless you wanna make a big deal about 2 extra rebounds per game in a season where everyone knew and acknowledged he was getting handed them), but harden won a lot more, had a better seed and played the same overall games, I can’t see why it should go to Russell."
"And you guys sent away your whole depth from that team to watch Russell Westbrook stink it in the playoffs, just like this year."
"No contract is untradeable in the NBA.  Chris Paul (multiple times) and Russell Westbrook are recent examples that come to mind. Though I suppose given that logic it might make more sense to keep Simmons to use for trades given his age, and... *sigh*... upside."
People can disagree with his opinion but I do think that people are underrating Russell Westbrook severely on this app.
Hot take: Russell Westbrook 2021-2022 MVP Year coming up!
"I don’t think players who were eligible and had played the bulk of their careers the last time should be added. If their peers and people who actually watched them didn’t add them, I doubt people looking up their stats know better.   **Next 25:**  1) LeBron James  2) Kobe Bryant  3) Tim Duncan  4) Kevin Durant  5) Stephen Curry  6) Giannis Ant.  7) Kevin Garnett  8) Dirk Nowitzki  9) Dwyane Wade  10) James Harden  11) Russell Westbrook  12) Paul Pierce  13) Ray Allen   14) Chris Paul  15) Jason Kidd  16) Carmelo Anthony   17) Steve Nash  18) Dwight Howard  19) Kawhi Leonard  20) Gary Payton  21) Tony Parker  22) Dikembe Mutombo  23) Pau gasol  24) Anthony Davis  25) Klay Thompson  Honorable Mentions: Alonzo Mourning, Derrick Rose, Tracy McGrady, Reggie Miller, Chris Bosh, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Ben Wallace"
I think prime Russell Westbrook is the most athletic point guard we will ever see (DRose might have had a shot but we all know what happened).  So somewhere below that.
"Two things:  1.  &gt;Noel says that Paul had nothing to do with Noel then signing with the Oklahoma City Thunder and that, instead, Russell Westbrook and Paul George recruited him to join them for that franchise. Noel signed a 2-year, $3.75 million league-minimum deal with the team, and Paul was paid a 2% commission.  Paul doing zero work and taking $75K is nonsense.  2.  &gt;Noel allegedly learned from Brett Brown, who was coaching the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, that the 76ers front office had been trying to contact Paul to discuss a potential deal and that Paul refused to respond. This was purportedly the case with other team representatives who were reaching out as well.  If this is true, then thinking Noel has a case, as this is neglect/failure to represent your client (aka doing your job)."
Russell Westbrook is a top 5 point guard in the NBA.
You really think 1 out of every 5 (or 1 out of every 4) players in the NBA are more athletic than Russell Westbrook?
Russell westbrook should be a shooting guard. That's what he played in college
Russell westbrook never missed a game until pat bev dirtied him
1. Ben Simmons  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Russell Westbrook
"&gt;Noel said Paul had nothing to do with Noel then signing with the Oklahoma City Thunder and, instead, Russell Westbrook and Paul George recruited him to join that franchise.  Again, I think the more likely scenario is just that he signed with Klutch, got hurt, Klutch got bored/lazy/busy/etc and then tossed him on the backburner; this is all just tin-foil speculative conspiracy fun based on an ongoing lawsuit and NBA Fan’s obsessive boredom during free agency/offseason"
"Forgot about Walton and didn't know about Russell, I wonder why Wilt never played winning basketball as much as Bill Russell. He's got the Russell Westbrook syndrome, very talented Brodie, but I'm going to have to pick up Gary Payton instead, sorry."
"aaand this is where we get into why Westbrook was a huge question mark of a target and where all the fit questions come into play.  I find it incredibly odd that the response to the mileage LeBron has is to...move him to a more physical role on the floor? You do realize that LeBron's playmaking evolution is one of the byproducts of his high mileage?   Quarterbacking the offense and dictating pace is probably the best thing for a 37 year old...not setting screens and rim running -- unless you're suggesting LeBron takes the ""stand on perimeter, wait for 3"" role, which would be an absolute disaster.  I'm sorry, but there's just no universe where I would take the player with better court vision, more efficient shot selection and less TO prone and take the ball out of his hands.  Russell is going to work best as an extra passer. To believe in the opposite, I'd really have to see it before I believe it."
I don’t agree with the regular season impact. Russell Westbrook took the Wizards to the playoffs after taking the wizards 17-6 on the final 23 games of the season to make the playoffs. Westbrook is a regular season player and I think he should be ranked over Simmons since Simmons isn’t even the second best player on his team.
Ben Simmons - 34 playoff games   13/8/7 on 57/0/52 splits and 57 TS%  Russell Westbrook - 24 playoff games  22/9/8 on 38/30/75 splits and 47 TS%  Stats are from the 2017-2018 season up today because you said “Simmons has definitely been better in the playoffs while he’s been in the league”.   I would say you’re right. I wonder how Simmons would do as the main guy on the team tho.
"Lakers are the only one you can say he handpicked. Heat and Cavs were mostly assembled in an even manner between the front office and the players.  And none of those guys are Russell Westbrook, who at this point is not a good player, that's just how it is. I honestly think it's fair to say they got worse than last season, just by acquiring Westbrook. Lakers are gonna struggle next season."
"No … those numbers are flat out great…But I’ll use dates this time specifically for when Capela got hurt.   From December 31st 2019 (the day Westbrook took the tape off his fingers), to January 29th (the last game Capela played before he got hurt), Russell Westbrook averaged 32.2/8/8 on 57.68% TS.   These are GREAT numbers. The numbers you even posted are GREAT numbers as well. He was averaging 30/8/8 on above average TS in both instances, which is, again, some of the best basketball of his career. This shouldn’t be an argument."
Russell Westbrook will be an All-Star this year.
"It was also the weakest period in NBA history and the story with Wilt at the time was he was only really concerned with those records which makes them a lot less impressive if you ask me. I don't deny that he is a physical monster (The Terminator called him the strongest person he had ever met) but I dont think it makes sense to have him higher or say he's better than Russell seeing as Russell has more MVPs, wayyy more rings and Wilt had a 39% win rate against him including 4-8 in the finals, when he was on some nasty Laker teams. Wilt being this unanimous top 10 has me thinking about where people will rank westbrook 50 years from now."
"It was pretty historic when Adam silver announced the NBA season was suspended. First one to do it in the US, made Covid feel real to me. Reminiscent of when he banned Donald sterling.  Russell Westbrook averaging a triple double for 3 years in a row at least.   There’s gotta be some whacky stuff from the bubble. Players missing games cuz of Covid protocol."
"""Russell Westbrook throws the ball off Brandon Knights nuts to get the easy layup""  FUCKING LOL!"
"Russell Westbrook. ATK: 3000  Link -3  This card gains 300 Atk for every NBA player that was link with this card. All cards that were linked with this card increase or decrease their level by 3. After your end phase, you can move this card anywhere in the field."
1. Stephen Curry  2. Damian Lillard 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Trae Young 5. Chris Paul 6. Ja Morant 7. Jrue Holiday 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Ben Simmons 10. Russell Westbrook  That's their top 10
"The fact people think Damian Lillard is a top 10 player is ridiculous when he has only played 3 great playoff series in his career (2014 first round, 2019 first round, 2021 first round).  Even Russell Westbrook and Paul George are better playoff performers for their careers.  Dame is borderline top 15 tbh and guys like Jayson Tatum and Trae Young have already proved more in the playoffs at this point in their careers."
"There are some players I like solely for their off the court actions. Such as Russell Westbrook. Love his mentality and seems like a great guy, but boy I wouldn't want him on my team."
"Wow, nobody said Russell Westbrook. Really guys?"
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
"Tom Brady has a better record of winning Superbowls in seasons he's played (7-21, 0.333) than Russell Westbrook does of hitting a 3-point shot (career 0.305)"
Russell Westbrook burned my house down and stole my first born child as well bro
You’ll get Russell Westbrook and you’ll like it.
"lebron wasn't a great player during the 2011 finals, lemme guess he's not a great player  russell westbrook has underperformed in the playoffs, lemme guess he hasn't been a superstar all these years  you really just used those metrics to evaluate how good their bench was lmao  they were a superteam, ofc they rely on their main 3 more than the bench  that has nothing to do with how good their bench was  i'm not even gonna look at the stats  if you're gonna downplay allen/battier/lewis/UD/birdman, you didn't watch ball then"
"In 2017, when Russell Westbrook won the controversial MVP in his first triple-double campaign post-KD (I also had Harden as my MVP), he shot 34.3% from 3 on 7.2 attempts/game and Harden shot 34.7% from 3 on 9.3 attempts/game.  Kinda shows that raw numbers really don't make a lot of sense if you're just staring at them in a vacuum."
Russell Westbrook is better than Dennis Schröder
"Although they became teammates, Lebron and Lance Stephenson talking about their playoff battles (unless they already talked about in LA). On a similar note, Lebron and Joakim Noah  Zach Randolph and Blake Griffin  Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard  Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and, Russell Westbrook, to get the real scoop"
Russell Westbrook no question what the fuck
"lol really?  As a starter in the front court he’s not popular than  Lebron, AD, and PG.  As a reserve he’s not getting a forward spot over Jokic, Rudy, and Zion.  He’s not eligible at guard which I’m assuming is penciled in for Steph,Luka, Dame, and Chris Paul (?).   Which means (barring injuries) he’s competing for one of two spots with Russell Westbrook, Devin Booker, Ja Morant, Mitchell, Brandon Ingram, Fox, CJ, KAT, and  Draymond"
"Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge (maybe) will be split among 2 teams."
Russell Westbrook will be averaging a triple-double. He will make the all-star team.
"You probably didn’t mean to do this, but this about to become a Russell Westbrook roast session"
"&gt; I love these random one off seasons like this   Darrell Walker had a completely forgettable ten-year NBA career, except for when he averaged almost a triple-double for the 1990 Wizards (9.5 p/g, 8.8 reb/g, 8.0 asst/g).  The rebounds and assists were by far career highs.  He quickly dropped off again.    He was the franchise leader in triple-doubles until Russell Westbrook broke that record in his sole season."
When discussing the legacy of Russell Westbrook why does nobody talk about how in his 13-years career there's only ONE year where he's not coached by either Billy Donovan or Scott Brooks?
"B+ :  \- We finally stopped the whole ""chase the 8th seed at all cost"" and picked a direction, we'll have a high pick  \- 2 of the 3 rookies looked great  \- the ""bets"" we made on Grant, Jackson and Plumlee all trned out better than I expected  \- despite being bad, we were competitive for most of the season, the games weren't unwatchable  \- I didn't have to watch Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson think they are Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook while actually being Erick Dampier and Jeff Teague  \- If Hayes looked better it would've been an A"
"While Westbrook blames the rule change for his FT% decline, the evidence isn't all that clear.  The rule change would only affect the second FTA, and [Westbrook's biggest drop has been on the first FTA](https://theathletic.com/2463204/2021/03/19/wizards-russell-westbrook-free-throw-shooting/)."

Russell Westbrook has the shortest memory in the league. He could be 4/20 for the first 3 quarters and then still shoot 10 times in the 4th. You love to see it
Perennial playoff winner Russell Westbrook
"Yeah, because those people are casual fans who don’t know shit when it comes down to it. Russell Westbrook was not trash for half the season *because* his CARMELO was bad (if that’s even a real stat). That hypothetical advanced stat is merely an attempt to qualify the quality of his play.   The fact that brain dead morons who think “he’s clutch!!!” is a good point and rank Kobe Bryant as the second best player ever don’t use advanced stats means fuck all."
"Funny stat about his scoring: He has a better True Shooting Percentage (52.6%) than Russell Westbrook (50.8%). Draymond is just at 6 FGA + 1 FTA per game, while Westbrook is at 19 FGA + 6 FTA.  I tend to believe that when you're that far below league average, you're better off passing or setting a screen instead of chucking up shots. But that's just me"

"&gt;How can you possibly know that  Oh no!! You’re right, I can’t possibly know that NBA players are biased towards their own coaches, especially when they’re talking to media. How could I ever know that without first consulting with Russell Westbrook?"
"Steven Adams [missing](https://youtu.be/c5V-9OZvl1c) a free throw, getting his rebound and passing out to Russell Westbrook for a long three   It was just beautifully designed and perfectly executed"
"Oh sorry, you’re right. Us brainlets shouldn’t be discussing basketball here. If we are in a discussion mood, we should simply look to Russell Westbrook to tell us what to think"
Life or death if I make the playoffs or not. First player I am taking is Russell Westbrook.
"That's fair. No need to downvote. But if we're going to interpret things technically and compare seeds, then Steph still did not do what Russell Westbrook did in dragging his team to the playoffs, because Westbrook's team was the 6th seed that season. It's looking like Nick was Wrong, but it's not like it hasn't been cutting it close by the Warriors."
Zachary Lowe is an idiot. He’s always wrong about everything. He said he wouldn’t trade Luke Kennard for Russell Westbrook. Biggest clown in the media.
Russell Westbrook - Ja Morant
I made one on another topic a few days ago when someone was outraged that Wade is not universally acknowledged as a top20 all-time player.  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaquille O'Neal * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Karl Malone * Jerry West * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Charles Barkley * Kawhi Leonard * Scottie Pippen * James Harden * Elgin Baylor * Isiah Thomas * David Robinson * Chris Paul  That's a quick and dirty top30. Who does Westbrook replace?
I want it known that the Wizards are my bandwagon East team this year. Russell Westbrook is so fuckin’ cool
"That entire post is ""Steph analysis"" masquerading as an insecure defense of Russell Westbrook which is part of what makes it more comical."
"It's not about the number, it's about the rates. Doncic needs to increase the percentage of games in which he triple doubles by over one third to be on pace to beat westbrook.  Not only that, but his numbers are universally down since his all-nba season last year. He's two rebounds and two assists apart from averaging a triple double. The only people in the last twenty years to add on +2 in 2/3 TD cats (pts, ast, or reb) after making an all-nba first team are james harden (all three!!) and russell westbrook. Both of them inproved after their all-nba seasons, neither saw significant statistical declines (-1 ast, reb) until they were over 30. Doncic has *already* seen a significant statistical decline.  Based on that, there is little to no reason to expect doncic's triple double numbers to increase by a full 33(!!)%. The difference is that westbrook was no where *close* to as good as doncic at 22. There was clear room for improvement. Doncic has already been top 5 mvp voting, played years in euroleague - he really isn't far from being an mvp already so there's little reason to assume he's gonna pull some unprecedented stat changes out of his hat after this year."
I can say something like “I personally don’t think Russell Westbrook is the greatest athlete ever and shouldn’t run for president” and i’ll get 90 downvotes and blocked by 4 ppl.
Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook
"Couldn't be more proud of Long Beach own Russell Westbrook.   He reminds me of Kobe in many ways and I'm glad he got opportunities to show that his greatness wasn't situational. He has balled out on every team he has been on and just wont quit.   In KOC's words, can't take him for granted."
Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook both shot less than 26% on threes in their second seasons. I think he’ll be fine.
"&gt; Efficiency is not the end all be all.  A good scorer is an efficient scorer at volume. That’s literally what should be the definition.  You are not wasting needless possessions that could otherwise be given to teammates scoring on higher efficiency. It’s simple basic mathematics and that is why the league has been trending the way it has been - because Volume scoring at low efficiency loses games, aka bad scoring.  The scoring list is a matter of being first option, longevity and volume, nothing more. Not a single GM doesn’t pick Kawhi Leonard over Russell Westbrook all time as a first option scorer despite one not sniffing the scoring list because of his efficiency.  I’m a fan of Westbrook. But he just is not one of the best scorers of all time."
Russell Westbrook in shambles
He is amazing. But this sub has lost its mind if they think Russell Westbrook is one of the greatest scorers of all time.  If we did a all time redraft and your first pick had to be your primary scorer not a single GM would pick Westbrook in the first round.
No and it shows how overrated he is. He has less scoring titles than Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook.  That’s how lol
It’s when Westbrook kinda took over coaching no joke. Westbrook had an intervention asking each player what’s your role?  https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/team-meeting-led-russell-westbrook-and-bradley-beal-helped-spark-wizards
"  Kevin Durant: The rookie who became a hero. The hero who became an MVP. The MVP who defied a Champion. Striking story! But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Champion himself in the great arena?    Russell Westbrook: You would fight me?    Kevin Durant: Why not? Do you think I am afraid?    Russell Westbrook: I think you've been afraid all your life.     *Wizards sweep the Nets*"
Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal
Russell Westbrook is the greatest sportsman of all time
Another fun one to pull out is Russell Westbrook was +63.9 against the rockets (5 game series OKC ended up losing) during his MVP season.
If he does get in I’d say Russell Westbrook should induct him. Russell helped create Steph into the player he is today. Westbrook was stephs inspiration going into the league so I think it would be amazing and really honorable to have his hero induct him.
Russell Westbrook. Why not?

Efficiency usage curves matter.  Read this article.  He upped his usage rate to insane amounts and still held the same efficiency which made him a late game juggernaut.  He absolutely deserved that award.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/
That year was Russell westbrook playing nba2k IRL.
"&gt;Westbrook's advanced stats were almost unanimously better than Harden's. I don't know where one can say Harden was definitely the better player.  What fucking advanced stats were u looking at??  &gt;Although, Westbrook winning MVP as a 6 seed was far from the norm there is precedent, most notably Kareem winning MVP without even making the playoffs.  That was literally in the stone ages. Did they even have a 3pt line at that time?   &gt;If we go by record, Kawhi has the best case for MVP.  He definitely had a better case than Russell...I would've had no issue with Kawhi winning it"
Part time center Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook style - stat pad and grab defensive rebounds from your teammates /s
"That's like saying the Houston Rockets had James Harden and Russell Westbrook, and now they're out there looking for players like James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  The Pels are just looking for some sort of voodoo that can heal our broken team (which we may have found fingers crossed) and Valerie Bertinelli to introduce Zion to Weight Watchers..."
&gt;Whichever clowns were saying he's the worst MVP in the last 20 years  Did people actually say that? Did they forget Russell Westbrook has an MVP?
"&gt;who cares, only the denver nuggets should give a shit about something like this. or whatever team he plays for.  Who cares about Nuggets or Jokic outside of Denver wah wah wah.  This is an NBA sub.  Lets talk about NBA stuff like THT or Avery Bradley or the Lakers record or Russell Westbrook ...  ... oh but, just in case the Lakers get Jokic someday, it will also be ok to care about Jokic too lol."
"The $m/year difference between the players that the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook and what they're now paying Russ per year was about $6m/year, the salary bump Caruso was asking for (and deserved) was eaten up in that trade and they wanted Caruso to pay for it and not THT.   I'm happy for Caruso though, he's thriving with the Bulls, the energy on that team is great and I think it'll only lead to better things for Caruso"
"Oooh ohh reverse psychology! OK OK I got this.  Um, The Lakers won a championship 2 year ago. Two years LOL. There have been many to be proud of.  Oh wait, you are a Thunder fan. I see what the problem is. You have no idea what an NBA championship is. Let me help.  At the end of the year, 16 teams play each other in a tournament. The team that wins in the end is an NBA Champion. Some teams, like the Los Angeles Lakers, have done that 16 times. SIXTEEN. Could you imagine that?  Check this out.... This one team had Kevin Durant, James Harden  and Russell Westbrook at the same time. And they STILL SUCKED AT BASKETBALL LOL. Could you imagine having those guys and STILL SUCKING?  I would probably troll teams that have won 16 championships if my team did that. WOW"
"And Russell Westbrook, right? The process worked very well for OKC and then they got cheap."
"&gt; Against all odds, it is Anthony—not Anthony Davis, not Russell Westbrook—who is keeping the 7-5 Lakers afloat while LeBron James is injured.  Why does the media hate AD so much ? I can't imagine that if any other superstar was going bonkers to keep his team alive with his best teammate injured, that the media would be hyping up a bench player as ""the real reason they've done ok !"""

Russell Westbrook would disagree with that.
"Because we see how truly unfiltered and dumpster booty juice Russell Westbrook really, truly is"
"A trade for Russell Westbrook, they should give the Lakers Murray and salary filler. That will help the Lakers get to title contention… i mean Spurs"
"This should be it. There's plenty talent. AD, Russell Westbrook, should I continue? Most teams don't have either. I'm tired of hearing about how bad this roster is."
"The Kevin Durant / Russell Westbrook, etc Thunder teams between 2010 and 2016 made it to the Finals once, WCF three times, and had a season where they missed the playoffs with 45 wins as KD was out."
We have one Russell Westbrook if they are interested
"&gt;When did I say he was a good shooter? Show me word for word where I said that.  You arguing in favour of him shooting threes is you saying he’s a good shooter.   If you know he’s a putrid shooter then you wouldn’t be crying about people saying he shouldn’t shoot threes. If you actually believed he was a poor shooter then you would understand exactly why he shouldn’t take them. Since you’re arguing in favour of him taking them, it’s only logical to think you believe they’re one of his strengths. Why would you want a player to do more of something you believe they suck at? It doesn’t make sense.  &gt;The team would be better off if he never shot 3’s at all? Lmao you don’t watch the Lakers play if you think that. Im not talking to someone who very clearly only follows this subs hive mind and doesn’t actually watch the games  Nah I watch every team, I’m just not a biased homer who convinces himself black is white because a player on my team is involved. Defenders don’t even bother to close out when he shoots. Just so you know, there are statistics that keep track of this stuff.  Westbrook hasn’t taken a single [three this season](https://go.nba.com/vz85) where the defence is considered “very tight” (0-2 feet away)  He takes 0.1 [threes per game](https://go.nba.com/8025) where the defence is “tight” (2-4 feet)  In contrast, he takes nearly [three a game](https://go.nba.com/9821) that are considered “wide open”.  The eye test supports all of this. Arguing that Russell Westbrook spaces the floor is like arguing the sky is actually purple."
This would’ve been an instant contender for one of those RUSSELL WESTBROOK MOST VIOLENT DUNKS compilations a few years ago. Still an insane athlete but such a bummer he’s lost that step
"Simmons is the worst. You’re paying 33-40M to Tony Allen with an attitude problem. I think his playmaking is overrated and his only truly elite skill is perimeter d. People think he’s better than he is because his ballhandling is excellent for someone his size and because he’s very athletic. Also, I think he has hit his development ceiling, even if people will deny this for the next couple years.  KP is the second worst. 35M over the next three years for a player who puts up 15 ppg with zero D and is perpetually injured. Probably the single largest factor preventing the mavs from making serious moves towards title contention.  Russell Westbrook getting paid 45 M for the next two years to play on a win now team is probably the third worst. His counting stats will probably look fine at the end of the year but he’s 33 and is turning the ball over at an insane rate."
If you wanted to try it you could trade untradeable  Chris Paul for untradeable Russell Westbrook for untradeable John Wall.    Well you probably couldn't.  It takes a special talent.
"1. They are playing great defense. No it’s not other teams just missing shots. They are defending the perimeter tightly and rotating to prevent paint points.  2. They are moving the ball/themselves and making the right play on offense. It’s not the Brad Beal/Russell Westbrook iso show anymore. Kuz, Gafford, KCP and of course Beal are hitting daggers late in games.  3. The bench mob is the best in the NBA. 6 man of the year (sorry Tyler Hero) Trez Harrell, Raul Neto and the Deni Avdija come in and pound other teams’ benches into oblivion."
Guys like Tatum and Jrue bring something on the defensive end. Fox is on a not so good team and carries a large part of that team on his own. Fox has never been the face of efficiency. MPJ and Lillard have been getting absolutely hosed. MPJ is injured rn. People partly excuse Lillard because he hasn't looked right since back in the Olympics so there's an assumption that an injury has been nagging him.  On top of all this Russell Westbrook has always been a polarizing player. Now he's on the Lakers who do a good job at being a hated fanbase so ofc everyone is clowning them for sending away so much to get Westbrook. Westbrook is also paid more than everyone else on the list.   Lastly I'm just going to point out that it's silly to bring this up like people are looking up True Shooting % and deciding which players they like and hate based off of that stat. It's the reverse they watch and don't like what Westbrook is doing and then look up statistics to confirm what they're seeing.
"Michael Jordan,LeBron James,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,Magic Johnson,Larry Bird,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan,Shaq O’Neal,Hakeem Olajuwon,Wilt Chamberlain,Bill Russell,Kevin Durant,Stephen Curry,Dirk Nowitzki,Dwyane Wade,Kevin Garnett,David Robinson,Jerry West,Charles Barkley,Karl Malone,John Stockton,Russell Westbrook,James Harden"
Rubio is the type of point guard the Lakers needed along with Buddy Hield as a shooter. What they got instead is a Russell Westbrook that’s losing them games. I’m not mad though. It’s just bad that redditors can make a better roster than the Lakers GM.
Russell Westbrook wants a word.
they somehow traded Russell Westbrook for 3 solid players
"I don't want to downplay some of the other good moves the Wiz made, but my goodness is Russell Westbrook taking a huge L so far this season. The team he leaves is #1 in the East and the team he joined looks super disappointing."
Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis are worse than Kwame Brown and Luke Walton?????
Ingram may be traded for Russell Westbrook
Russell Westbrook
"&gt; Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook  Oh I missed when Luka won the MVP"
Russell Westbrook? Nah.
They went to the finals in 2012 and lost to the superteam Heat. Harden left the season after when OKC wasn't willing to pay him. KD couldn't control that. Russell Westbrook is nowhere near as good to play winning basketball as we have seen recently on the Lakers right now. He's always been like that.
Well he did have Russell Westbrook a good portion of those years. Kobe was also carried by Shaq those first 3 rings.
Did you seriously?  Will I get banned for agreeing that Steph Curry is a better shooter than Russell Westbrook?
"Was trying to name 20 point guards or ""combo"" guards better than him all time. Could only get to 18.      Stephen Curry   Chris Paul   John Stockton   Jason Kidd   Steve Nash   Allen Iverson   Dwyane Wade   Isiah Thomas   Magic Johnson   Russell Westbrook   James Harden   Damian Lillard   Gary Payton   Jerry West   Oscar Robertson   Walt Frazier   Bob Cousy   Nate Archibald"
"Steph is a positive defender now, and before he was merely average. Russell Westbrook has a case to be the worst defender in the league.   Not really out on a limb, here."
"Darko  millic is a floor raiser. Drafted and his team wins the next year. What a legend.   Kyrie obvious reasons. Karl Anthony towns. Looking like Zion as well   Carmelo Anthony prime caused a lot of friction.   Russell westbrook.  The 2000s top of my head Kenyon Martin, Tracy McGrady could of been bad luck as well,"
"&gt; You clearly aren't old enough for this discussion if you think Pippen ""failed to perform on offense"" for 3 title teams.       And you clearly need to rely on ad hominems when Scottie had a worse TS% over the second threepeat than notorious underperformers Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan over their playoff careers."
"I just wanna like kinda correct this  Russell Westbrook is a better defender, however curry just tries harder lol. I remember watching Westbrook be an absolute menace defensively with OKC in the playoffs"
"We took a title team with the shortest off season in post season history where continuity was going to matter more than any season prior and we dumped/didn't bring back:   Danny Green, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, Avery Bradley, Rondo   and instead of get what we needed - shooters - we brought in:  Harrell, Schroder, and Gasol cause it looked good on paper. Then we spent an entire season with no shooters and playing small cause of Harrell.   And now there's this last off season ... where we mortgaged every last asset we had for Russell Westbrook. FFS."
Now /r/nba is convinced that RUSSELL WESTBROOK isn’t putting effort into his game. Russ is literally famous for going all out when he plays.
"In the third the Lakers started Westbrook, Bazemore, Bradley, Ellington, and AD  The Wolves started Beverly, Russell, Edwards, Vanderbilt, and KAT  Couldn't find the rest of the lineups for the quarter.   [3rd Quarter highlights.](https://youtu.be/40qLx_kxADk)"
Russell Westbrook
Clearly Russell Westbrook is in these comments 😂
Russell Westbrook is the bipolar disease of basketball
"the problems with that:  1) derozan would be an S&amp;T so lakers would be hard-capped by getting him, you need to keep total payroll under $143M in that case.  he got paid $26M, lebron is $41, AD is $35, buddy is $23M, kcp is $13M--that's already $138M, so basically it wouldn't be possible.  2) since it's an S&amp;T you need spurs FO to cooperate, they have to want whatever lakers were offering in the trade.  they weren't sufficiently interested.  https://theathletic.com/2848702/2021/09/27/superstar-shopping-lebron-russell-westbrook-and-the-lakers-summer-of-recruiting  &gt;Sources said Pelinka and his front-office group strongly considered executing a sign-and-trade for the 32-year-old DeRozan, giving up Kuzma and Caldwell-Pope in the process, but couldn’t come to consensus terms with the Spurs in free agency or a suitable contract number for DeRozan. What’s more, sources say the DeRozan option never advanced to the point that it was presented to Buss."
Russell Westbrook just reminds me of Tyler1.
"The Lakers are officially a disgrace! Look at how they’ve disappointed an absolute legend like “Big Game” James Worthy, just disgusting. We all know what needs to happen, the Lakers must start rebuilding around Russell Westbrook and DeAndre Jordan. AD is way too injury prone for us to trust, and LeBum is practically a senior citizen! We need to trade them for some picks ASAP. Coming from an honest Lakers fan btw."
You had a very solid defensive identity that dominated in the paint + transition with tall-quick-energetic guys that helped you win the ring and decided to blow it up lol   Kuzma-Pope-Danny-Caruso were all so crucial. Losing Danny was still okay but Kuzma-Caruso-Pope was straight up bad. If there was a badly needed upgrade it was shooting and your FO got Russell Westbrook as the biggest Laker piece in the offseason
Yo I swear I'm not in the mood for fucking Russell Westbrook apologia.
There is probably a 50/50 chance whoever is reading this comment is a better defender than Russell Westbrook.
Russell Westbrook in this game simply showed why his stats mean nothing

"Man, you better watch what you say. You just made Russell Westbrook turn the ball over again."
"I think we have different definitions of what ""defending"" something is. Either way you have no idea if that person is from Oklahoma lol they are literally a transplant franchise from Seattle, one of the most liberal cities in America. Maybe that's how they found out about them. Maybe they are a person from LA, another super liberal city, who followed Russell Westbrook to OKC and became a fan after his long career there.   Or maybe it shouldn't fucking matter because making assumptions based on stereotypes is wrong."
"If this wasn’t AD, Russell Westbrook would have gave him that meme “wtf” look lol."
Russell Westbrook is probably the first word said at the top of those threads lmao.
Russell Westbrook is a game-time decision (burnt pinky finger)
"Yea there was the same discussions with Lakers fans about Luke Walton having Brandon Ingram play point. Russell WestBrook became the player he is today from playing so much point too, he was a 2 on ucla."
"How were Russell westbrook, Derrick rose, James Harden, or Allen iverson MVPs if that were the case? What about Garnett or Kobe in 08?"

"For me it was Game 4 vs the Mavericks in 2021. The Mavs were up 81-68 going into the 4th, and then Harden looked completely unstoppable down the stretch as OKC outscored the Mavs 35-16 and came back to win 103-97.  &gt;&gt; Oklahoma City kept picking and rolling, and James Harden kept making plays.  &gt;&gt; Instead of giving in and being content going home for a Game 5, the Thunder now are waiting for their next series. Oklahoma City rallied for a 103-97 victory on Saturday night to complete a first-round series sweep of the defending NBA champion Dallas Mavericks.  &gt;&gt; Harden scored 15 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, including seven in a row and nine in the Thunder's 12-0 run after they trailed by 13 points with 9:44 left.  &gt;&gt; ""I got into attack mode,"" Harden said. ""I was determined to make plays.""  &gt;&gt; After the Harden-fueled surge over 3 minutes got the Thunder within a point, they finally took the lead -- and kept it -- when Russell Westbrook stole the ball from Dirk Nowitzki and passed to Serge Ibaka for a two-handed slam that made it 92-91 with 5:17 left.  &gt;&gt; ""He beat us in individual drives, beat us in pick and rolls. He got up a head of steam and was great,"" Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said of Harden. ""We tried everything, five or six different coverages going. We needed to be better but it was more about how good he was.""  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201205050DAL.html  https://www.espn.com/nba/recap/_/gameId/320505006"
Some guy really had a post earlier saying Russell Westbrook is having a better season then Lowry LMAO
"Advanced defensive metrics are almost entirely based on box score... so if you ain't got a high  amount of blocks or steals or rebounds then your defensive advanced stats look bad.  For example Brown and Tatum both have negative dbpm this year despite being two really good defenders. Same thing with Klay for most of his career.   It's like yall don't know how these things work. If a player has a low percentage of steals/blocks/ rebounds compared to other players on the team then you're going to have a negative dbpm no matter how good you are at defense. Look at Russell Westbrook, who is objectively a bad defender, who has a positive dbpm because he usually leads his team in steals and defensive rebounds. Other players this applies to are KAT, Harden, Whiteside, Drummond, Cousins,  and plenty more.   So Klay/Wiggins/whoever that share heavy minutes with Draymond and Steph, both of whom are good rebounders and good at getting steals, are going to have a hard time having a positive dbpm. That's why when you look at the Warriors current dbpm, there's Steph and Dray who are positive then the bench where everything is more spread out so that they almost all have positive dbpm"
"When I say SLC I mean the Salt Lake Metro area i.e. people that attend Jazz games.  More importantly, that's who folks are claiming are not racist on this sub during the Ja Morant and Russell Westbrook situations"
and Russell Westbrook literally becomes a negative role player in those playoffs
"Bertans is a plus for any team on the court(when you stop looking at his contract) in the NBA. Who provides more spacing then him in the league? Steph? Thats it. Also please have Rui come back and take KCP's minutes, because that man doesnt deserve more than 10. Also Thomas Bryant is an elite rim runner and finisher who shoots 40 for 3%. We also dont have fuckin IT ""walkin cone"" and Russell ""Revolving doors"" Westbrook at pg.   How tf that doesnt help the team? Man yall just talk shit for no reason"
"sick whataboutism, every city has problems, you're right. Jazz fans (especially in the playoffs) are getting a reputation of getting racist when they heckle players and their family. The most famous incidents happening with Russell Westbrook and Ja Morant. Granted this is far from ""all Jazz fans are racist"" but that's not a reputation your city/fanbase wants. Hopefully Donovan Mitchell being a positive role model is a step in the right direction."
Theoretically Russell Westbrook can finish his career a 70% 3 point shooter
Would you rather have Tyus Jones or Russell Westbrook
"Russell Westbrook lol.   Everything around him is so polarizing, let's add to it lol"
"John Wall for Russell Westbrook....  what a joke of a trade. Russ paid much better dividends than John Wall did.  Is John Wall glue factory health wise @ this point in his career too??? Salary based 100% on past glory, not future ROI."
"Lol, to me it is all bullshit, the fact Russ is in the top 75 made the list just cringe. He is not even in top 100. MVP was a fluke when journalists vote shit like that happens... of course he is not a first ballot HoF but to this day even been in the HoF doesn't mean anything.  Lowry would be in HoF too, had a ring more than Russ, played great in Finals and ECF, Russ could never be in that position.  Nobody remember OKC without KD the first time 2014/15 OKC missed the playoff with a team that otherwise made the conference finals the year before and after all thanks to Russ. Russ playing like shit in the 2012 finals cost OKC the only title chance they had in history, because fucking Russell Westbrook won't put any effort on defense and decided he had to shoot more than fucking KD which were just posting insane numbers in his first run to the finals.   People like you are just ignorant, like most Russ fans, you watched him screaming and pretend this is play hard. Russ playing all the ball on offense and posting triple double are considered by you a sign of greatness, not realising Russ produced less than an average player in both point and assist for most of his career. Grabbing meaningless rebound and making actual mistakes that cost games to his teams because he didn't cut out his man, making Russ for you a good rebounder.  What are we talking about?? Russ is 4 year removed from been an actual good player, not even a great player, he was BELOW average.  And you keep talking about fucking MVP. Dumbass. Talk about basketball, because except from playing huge ammount of possessions Russ had NOTHING more than Lowry. More athleticism that lead to worst % at the rim anyway, good job Russ!"
"KD and Harden as a duo are not even close to LeBron and AD. HarObese is a perpetual playoff choker who plays closer to Russell Westbrook come playoff time than AD.  Therefore, the Nets formula collapses without the cheat code that is Kyrie Irving. KD will have to carry  again in a losing effort if he doesn’t come back."
When will Russell Westbrook have a game with 0 turnovers?

Russell Westbrook is never going to win a ring as a starter. Never. Save my comment and come for my neck if I'm wrong.  **Never** *ever*.
&gt;Lakers team is built for the playoffs.  You do realise Russell Westbrook is on the Lakers right?
"It doesn't matter if they are short handed. That's a lame excuse. They had 2 defensive possessions down the stretch where they needed to avoid giving the heat a 3 point shot and they gave them exactly that. 2 wide open 3 point shots. A 5 second violation in overtime. Not boxing out. That awesome Russell Westbrook 3 point shot at the end of regulation. None of that has to do with being ""short handed"", it's just bad basketball, bad coaching and terrible execution.  Even with rotation players out, they have 3 of their 4 best players out there. It shouldn't be this bad."
At this point you just gotta accept that a few unnecessary turnovers comes in package with Russell Westbrook. But if he can have games like that those turnovers will be worth sacrificing for lol
"I'll give you the Heat, but you telling me a team with AD, Russell Westbrook, Dwight, Carmelo can't fucking beat OKC twice? Lmao"
ESPN: “Anthony Davis says teammate Russell Westbrook acts without ‘conscience’ and tends to ‘miss 20 in a row’…”  SAS: “It’s time to face facts: the Lakers have to trade AD for CJ McCollum and accept that this season is for the Warriors to win.”
RUSSELL FREAKIN WESTBROOK.   MALIK FREAKIN MONK.   Best win for the Lakers so far. Both teams played a hell of a game. Good game Miami.
One thing that really stuck out to me from that stat sheet is Russell Westbrook has played more games than Magic Johnson.
Russell Westbrook
Hence the prototypical Russell Westbrook game lol
You knew it was coming. MELO WAS RIGHT THERE. But it's Russell Westbrook.   You thought those 2 clutch buckets had no consequence? He got the confidence to think he shoots the ball like KD
The Russell westbrook experience will definitely be interesting
Two consecutive Russell Westbrook go-ahead mid-range jumpers. Is this real life?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK SLANDER WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED
"somewhat of an over reaction on the part of Russell Westbrook, after all it was just popcorn......."
Maybe Russell Westbrook is the problem. Call me crazy but when a guy gets into shit with fans in every fucking arena maybe he should take a look in the mirror
Why are people mad that a millionaire got popcorn dumped on him? Fuck Russell Westbrook
But is russell westbrook ok?!? Oh jesus god tell me he survived
This is a great idea. There’s not many humans that could stand in an octagon with Russell Westbrook.
"What does one have to do with the other? Russell Westbrook isn't complaining about a fan. How in the world can you defend someone throwing food at a player? Seriously, what's your argument here, that just because you don't think Westbrook is an all-timer he deserves to be treated with disrespect? Or is it that because most people see Westbrook as an all-timer (which he is by the way, easily top 50 all time, first ballot HoF, no questions about that), that some how fans throwing food at home  in Philly, or using racial slurs and calling out his kids like they did in Utah is somehow justified? I'm really trying to figure out how anyone can defend such blatant disrespect from a fan to a player. Look at what happened to Trae Young in MSG...are you saying that's okay too?"
"It’s is not okay, but you’re clearly using the Blake Griffin doing it in jest as an extremely false equivalent. Those situations aren’t comparable, the fan laughed at Blake doing it. Russell Westbrook wanted to put that fan in the hospital."
Fans in Philadelphia are going to beat up a fellow Sixers fan for throwing popcorn at Russell Westbrook? Please.
"Why is Russell Westbrook so upset? The fan didn't dump a liquid on you, it was popcorn! Run your hands through your hair and it is all over. You make millions, stop complaining over little things. Babies."
KD coming in support of his best friend Russell Westbrook
I dont think it needs to be said but he shouldn't have dumped popcorn on Russell Westbrook.   But I also don't really give a shit and don't think it's this massive deal. Its just some popcorn
"Stupid motherfucker. Honestly, I consider this worse than that stupid schmuck who dumped popcorn all over Russell Westbrook during the Wizards / Sixers game. Both offenses absolutely deserve to be banned permanently though. Hell, with the COVID nightmare going around, they could actually arrest this particular moron for assault."
That bitch ass dude is lucky he did that shit to Trae Young and not a dude like Russell Westbrook.
"That isn't fair. They should put him in the octagon with Russell Westbrook. If he wins, he keeps his season ticket holding status and gets free popcorn from 76ers arena for life.  And if he loses... if he dies, he dies."
"I mean, nobody at the Sixers vs Wizards game was chanting “fuck Russell Westbrook” yet he still got popcorn dumped on him. These things sadly just happen every now and then."
But keep talking about the Sixer fan who threw popcorn on Russell Westbrook. It's not like we're in the midst of a global pandemic or anything /s
"Hey dude, wanna go to the game next week?  nah man, no can do……coz I threw popcorn at Russell Westbrook and got my season tickets cancelled and banned from the arena   Idiot."
"Dude what the Fuck are you talking about?  Have you ever been disrespected like that in public. Has anyone does some shit like that before to you?  Shut the Fuck up man, stop hiding behind a fucking keyboard, you know you don't want that smoke with Russell Westbrook.  He'd kick your ass if you did that shit to him, and so would I. It's easy to be a tough guy when you can't be touched"

"That's why I say attack as in ""criticize"" not ""hate""  And you're comparison isn't really fair jus yet, since all the guys you listed have been retired for a while now (except Vince Carter being just recently retired) so they naturally get looked at through sweet rose tinted nostalgia glasses.  Try to open a thread claiming any of these guys is better than one of the top players today and you'll see all kinds of slander against those guys too.  In time, you'll see Russell Westbrook get the same love all those guys who were ""great but just couldn't get a ring"" (rightfully) get, despite the abscence of championships"

Russell Westbrook is not the reddit community. He is a person that was treated in a dehumanizing way. That deserves a response independent of what anyone/crowd on any internet platform thinks.

"Lol all the people in this thread saying a man deserves to be physically beaten by a professional athlete for dumping popcorn on his head. Yeah...that would just be straight up assault. Quit bitching it’s literally popcorn all it did was bounce off his head. Would’ve been way funnier if it was a beer or a soda, then at least he’d have something to be mad about. Still wouldn’t justify assault tho. Russell Westbrook is a whiny bitch and needs to shut the fuck up and stop crying like a little girl. “NBA doesn’t protect it’s players” it was fucking popcorn I’m sure it caused him so much physical harm. Quite evidently the ones who need protection are the fans when a deranged lunatic is trying to assault them. Grow the fuck up"

*Russell Westbrook records his first Olympic triple double in USA loss against France*
It’s crazy that they’ve been doing it for years and yet Russell Westbrook had the most assists per game that anyone in the NBA has ever had since John Stockton in 1995.
"All I know is it’s been fun seeing Rui Hachimura, Bradley Beal, and Russell Westbrook on the same team. Can’t wait to see them next season with a new coach.  &gt; It turns out that most people only react to basketball as entertainment and popularity contests instead of respectfully learning how the game should be played in 2021  And what’s wrong with that? The average fan dgaf about TS, VORP, offensive rating, etc. People just wanna see stars play ball regardless of analytics."
"I think the response is, if he was so great, why does he have only 2 rings? Why do Jordan, Kareem, and Russell have more MVPs?  He was often a selfish player who didn't understand how the game worked. He was the original stat stuffer before Westbrook. That's how he got beaten again and again, despite a great roster. To me, such a person cannot be the 🐐  Also, as every basketball head knows, Wilt's 50 ppg season in 1962 has to be put in context. He was taking 40 shots per night, plus 17 free throw attempts. The guy who just led the league in scoring this year: 21 shots, 7 free throws. Even when MJ averaged 37, he took under 30 shots per night.   The game was played at a breakneck pace back in the early 60s. That also explains Wilt's rebounding numbers. People wouldn't really set a half court offense well. They'd just run down the court, shoot, and brick, and repeat. Don't believe me? Wilt once led the league in FG percentage by shooting under 51%, meanwhile Shaq never shot under 55% in any season, and didn't always lead the league. Wilt's starting PG during his '62 season shot 36% from the field.  I don't say any of this to shit talk the Big Dipper. It's just that OP asked about an indisputable GOAT, and that's obviously not Chamberlain. People disputed that he was better than Russell during his career and with very good reason. People dispute whether he was better than Jordan, and again with good reason."
Russell Westbrook was one of the best players in the league the last half of the season. That's more than you can say for anyone else besides Stephen Curry.
I'm always going to enjoy guys who can get crafty in the paint and are electric athletes like D-Rose or Russell Westbrook.   Guys who can light it up and score in different ways. Watching KD is amazing. He really can do it all. Sometimes it's crazy how he crosses someone up and hits a step back or how he might post up and get a tough shot to go in.   On the defensive end I've been really starting to try to see what great team defenders do to slow things down. When Giannis is set and can move like a Swiss army knife it's pretty cool. Watching defense funneling into offense. Marc Gasol was amazing in his prime.   As for just regular Role Players. I love watching guys with an old man game. Andre Miller was exciting to watch especially when he dropped 52. Him or Zach Randolph just grinding it out down low. Watching someone get into the post and bully their way to 2 points is satisfying. Joakim Noah being herky jerky was chaotic but enjoyable.
"Yes. It would be harder but I was told no team could move Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook with those contracts and it happened. Twice for CP3. Some team will take on your bad salary if you throw in some other pieces or picks. If they want Westbrook, they can make those salaries almost match and give Washington Kuzma and a ton of picks to get it done. They're not getting CP3 or Westbrook without sending a nice chuck of salary in the trade.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-mulling-russell-westbrook-trade-for-kyle-kuzma-dennis-schroder-and-talen-horton-tucker-per-report/"
Russell Westbrook is my teams second best player.
"&gt;Are the Celtics going to offer him a one year max or something? Personally I think if all they're offering is a one year guaranteed deal, he'll sign elsewhere.  No they’d overpay him.   &gt;Who is going to want to trade for a player that they then stretch and waive for $5 million in dead cap every year for the next 3 years? The answer: nobody. It's not going to be as simple as just trading him like he's an expiring contract when he's not. Sorry.  The answer: the team that gets a pick in return.   Have fun with Russell Westbrook though! He’ll have some big shoes to fill wearing Kuz’s number."
"I’m a Mavs fan,and my favorite player is ever is Dirk,but Russell Westbrook played with so much heart it was so fun to see him get a steal and flash coast to coast and throw it down"
"Someone will take that contract. Every time I hear a guy is untradable (Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook) a team finds a way. Shroder is going to make the Lakers overpay to get anything for him. And if the Lakers want Westbrook, this is the way to do it. Match those salaries."
Yea but Neto is not Russell Westbrook or no where near Russell Westbrook otherwise he’d have started over him and their not just looking for solid point guard their looking for a star point guard and you keep saying shooting matters the bucks just won the championship and they shot horrible from 3 in the play off it’s more about size and defense and decision making more than anything you can do all that scoring but if you don’t have a guy that’s going get steal play d rebound or get guys open because you forget teams play harder d in the playoffs and it’s harder to get open shots and give you energy not many guys have all that but Russ does dude
Russell Westbrook ❤️❤️
I wasn’t only talking about missed games. He plays hurt more often than not now and sometimes it clearly limits him. His coach even said so last year:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/russell-westbrook-has-been-hurt-training-camp-scott-brooks-says%3Famp  We all know about quads now from Kahwi’s last few years. He turns 33 this year. I wouldn’t want that contract.
&gt; 2008  &gt; Russell Westbrook (4)  And now I am sad
Lakers FO outside after playoff exit:  We need more consistent outside shooting  Lakers FO approaching free agency: Let’s get Russell Westbrook.   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Russell westbrook dunks
"Forget about 10, every single GM would trade Simmons immediately for 4 future #4 picks, some for even just 3. Much better players have been dealt for less, and those were first rounders not a guarantee of a 4 pick which is insane. I don’t think you realize how crazy valuable 4 #4 picks would be to any org, let alone 10.  Because if you’d done the work of going a decade before you’d realize that’s where Chris Paul, Chris Bosh, Russell Westbrook and Mike Conley were drafted. But you didn’t and it’s a good thing you’re not an actual GM. Yeah have a good one, done with this."
can russell westbrook play with lebron and Anthony Davis? He demands the ball too much. Wasn't a big criticism of him with Kevin Durant was that he had the ball too much?
I think the Lakers with Westbrook are so damn talented the lack of shooting doesn't matter to beat the WEST.   The only true competition is the Nets if they are healthy.   And I would rather have Russell Westbrook against them in the Finals.   Why? Sheer force and determination. For whatever reason Westbrook plays out of his mind when he faces Durant he must be soooo hyped up.   Westbrook against Nets this season averaged 31 points 11 rebound 9 assists.   And wizards beat Nets 2 times out of 3. Westbrook is a man possessed against them and will ball out for Lakers when it matters the most in the finals against Nets.  Let LeBron and AD carry through the Western Conference we only need Russ for Nets
Bradley Beal had an over 2% higher usage rate than Russell Westbrook in the 2020-2021 NBA season. You just made this all up!
You haven't seen Russell Westbrook get himself and the entire crowd (home or away) incredibly hyped up before?
"Seems like shooting percentages are a big part of your rankings, imo efficiency isn't everything. Intangibles are real and basketball isn't played on paper. Middleton is not better at winning basketball games than Russell Westbrook lol. Everyone listed after Kyrie minus Jimmy is 100% debatable and I'd rather have WB than all of them"
"Kevin Durant: The rookie who became a hero. The hero who became an MVP. The MVP who defied a Champion. Striking story! But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Champion himself in the great arena?    Russell Westbrook: You would fight me?    Kevin Durant: Why not? Do you think I am afraid?    Russell Westbrook: I think you've been afraid all your life.     *Russ drops an inefficient 40 point triple double to sweep the Nets in the 2022 NBA Finals*"
I wouldn’t give up a stale churro for Russell Westbrook
&gt; no team **paying 40+ million dollars** to Russell Westbrook is sniffing a championship
Would you want to play with Russell Westbrook?
"Yeah, Westbrook can drag you into the playoffs. He's an unbelievable talent. But it seems like the problem KD, George, Harden, and now Beal have realized is that unfortunately no team paying 40+ million dollars to Russell Westbrook is sniffing a championship"
"&gt;$181M is literally nothing to Ballmer.  People need to stop looking at this like it's a question of whether the owner can afford it or not. It's not about how rich Ballmer is, it's a question of whether the contract is worth it because of the salary cap. Obviously a fully healthy Kawhi is worth the max. But if he really does decline due to age or injuries and he becomes an albatross of a contract the way that say, Russell Westbrook did, then it becomes a problem for the Clippers just because of how much cap room is wasted on a player who doesn't help you win.   Personally I think Kawhi will probably age fine unless one of these injuries really is debilitating (or he starts missing tons of time with injuries). But these takes about how ""Ballmer can easily afford anything"" just miss the fact that the salary cap can fuck with anyone, no matter how rich they are."
"not a nets fan just a Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, KD fan but the statistical facts remain"
"37 points, 10 assists, 11 Rebounds was a bad postseason for Russell Westbrook?"
facts i have guys tryna tell me that karl malone's waiter was better than gary payton and russell westbrook
Field goal % is a good tool to use because it does something that TS% doesn’t. FG% measures the percent time any given shot goes in. So when FG% is used it’s not used to determine the amount of value that a make creates (that is TS%) but rather it is a measure of if any value was generated from a shot at all. If there is a miss there is no value generated whether you shoot from 3 or directly under the basket. So Russell Westbrook for example generates value on a shot at roughly the same rate at Trae Young (Russ has a 43.9% fg% and Trae Young shot 43.8%).
"Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook"
"I think a lot of weaknesses on defense is similar to Russell Westbrook he goes for the home run play on defense and it leads to blowing assignments and giving up wide open threes. I think a lot of his weaknesses are due to rawness and a lack of build in his frame which will help him improve fighting over screens which IMO I think improved throughout the season based on the film I’ve watched of green’s defense for the ignite team. By all accounts the kid is a student of the game and in every pre draft interview I’ve seen with him he mostly talks about wanting to improve his defense and become a great defender. His work ethic, supposedly love of watching film and tools  and flashes makes me believe 3-4 years from now he can become a good defender"
It's the same thing with Harden trying to play GM in Houston and swapping Paul for Russell Westbrook.  That's the shit side of player empowerment; big guys calling the shots and wanting to dip immediately when they're the ones that caused the mess in the first place.
"What I am trying to demonstrate is that TS% is a finicky stat. Yes, Russell Westbrook has below average efficiency statistics but people need to be aware of why those stats are what they are. I think in general there’s an overweighting of TS% in this sub and an under weighting of FG%. Especially since, game to game, people on this sub talk about how a player shot from the field instead of the TS% they had that game."
If Russell Westbrook shot league average from the free throw line this year he would have a true shooting percentage of 53% and be averaging over 23 points.
i love this game  Mike James Thomas Bryan(t) Shaw(n) Bradley Beal(Bill) Russell West Brook Steppe(n) Curry  &amp;#x200B;  Mike James  James Thomas  Thomas Bryant  Brian Shaw  Shawn Bradley  Bradley Beal  Bill Russel  Russel Westbrook  Brook Steppe  Stephen Curry
"On MY team, specifically? Grizz is set right now at the 1 with hopefully a future superstar. So Klay would make a lot more sense for us to take a chance on because we could definitely use the shooting.  If we're asking generically who you'd rather take in a vacuum, if you genuinely think Russell Westbrook is a bigger gamble than a guy coming off two consecutive season-ending leg injuries then we've officially been circlejerking a little too long in this sub.  I can't say I've seen this take personally around here so I don't know if it's commonly thought that Klay doesn't rely on athleticism as much but just so we're not getting it twisted, the way Klay moves off the screen, cuts to the basket, cuts to the perimeter, hell just the way he set his feet so fast in catch-and-shoot situations so his shot gets off that much smoother, these all require a tremendous amount of athleticism in his legs specifically.  Of course it's more than possible for him to come back just fine from this (just look at KD and say Zach Levine for examples) but you're frankly dreaming if you think that isn't a huge question mark for Klay come opening night."
"&gt; e closest Mamba disciple in terms of mentality  Kobe [talked](https://lakersnation.com/kobe-bryant-says-russell-westbrook-reminds-him-most-of-himself/2016/08/26/) about Westbrook being the closest to him in mentality [in 2016]. Though WB isn't a Mamba disciple. Kobe also mentioned that there were young players who have that mentality, and time would show how they shook out  Giannis has shown that, I believe"

"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
Wow. Same day as Russell Westbrook Day in OKC. That’s disrespectful.
"Well yea thats what I mean. Him getting a ring has nothing to do with his ability. The preception of Jeff teague is not affected by a ring. If Russell Westbrook didn't get a chip, its a big deal, and people are bound to have opinions considering that he is such a great player. Nobody cares to shit on jeff Teague just cause he doesn't have a ring lol. People will continue that"
"The Rockets played Russell Westbrook, which makes it easier to defend in that situation. The Clippers played 5 excellent three point shooters at all times."
"yes he faced better teams. He literally beat the team that destroyed giannis that year….  he also beat james harden and russell westbrook, Jokic, and damian lillard. 3 of those players are mvps now…"
As in I think Tatum can be in the Paul George/Damian lillard/Russell Westbrook tier but I think Zion can be in the Durant/Shaq/Curry tier
He had Chris Paul  He had Russell Westbrook (twice)  He had Dwight Howard (who put in an All NBA season in a Rockets jersey)  He literally had KD before.  Nah. Harden's gotta show me
The Russell Westbrook Jr. the Third thing started with Dan Patrick I think
That’s some zero calorie Walmart brand sweetener  lol. THT and some late firsts are literally the only positive assets they would be sending out. Kuzma is on the books for 3 years and Schroeder would also have to be on the books for 3 years. They’d actually end up paying those two more in the long run than Russ.  Does THT and late firsts sound like a good return for Russell Westbrook?
Russell Westbrook Jr the Third- DP
His grandson gonna be Russell Westbrook the Third III?
His son’s teddy bear? Russell Westbrook III.
Russell Westbrook the triple
Trey Russell Westbrook the Third II
"Russell ""The Bookkeeper"" Westbrook"
Even better than that? His son is Russell Westbrook the Third II. Remarkable.
"You forgot the best part, fool. He’s Russell Westbrook *the Third*."
"I mean they really found themselves in the playoffs.  Giannis playing more like a true big and less like a 6'11"" Russell Westbrook is incredibly difficult to deal with.    With the normal offseason retooling I see no reason they can't enter next season as the favorites."
Russell Westbrook should be in consideration

Russell Westbrook
*Opens list with superstar rumored to Lakers*  Russell Westbrook: ✓
Idk dude he's just better at everything.  Russell Westbrook is like Kevin Johnson on steroids.  Maybe a slightly worse jump shooter per volume and a weirdly more erratic defensive player but early Russ was a great defensive player its only since post 2016 that he became bad on defense..
Literally every account from a Westbrook teammate is about how great of a teammate he is and how much he helps and inspires them through his mentorship and leading by example.  Also Russell never molested a minor.
Chris Paul  -  Russell Westbrook
That’s why you always build your team with Russell Westbrook.
"with what salary space? Russell Westbrook is on a supermax contract, this trade would be dumb."
  we are NOT trading Kuzma for Russell Westbrook.  fuck that shit FUCK IT.
&gt; he knows he’ll be back  He’s a great player but you never know. James Harden hasn’t made it back. Russell Westbrook hasn’t made it back. Barkley never made it back. You can be great but sometimes that’s your one shot.
Russell Westbrook easily
"I’m just wondering what does CP3 bring to the table that Russell Westbrook doesn’t?  CP3 is great no doubt, but I don’t see him as that top 5 of all time. Seems to be that everyone else does. That’s why I feel he’s overrated."
Russell Westbrook
"Bro, if the 2012 Oklahoma City Thunder couldn’t make it back to the finals boasting a roster of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka then going back to the finals isn’t guaranteed for any player or team.  All credit to the Suns but if they were going to capitalize on any season it would've been this one. Injured AD, Kawhi, plus CP3 already looks worn down. Every year moving forward he'll be far less then what he was the year before.   not saying the Suns can’t make it back to the finals, just saying it’s very likely that Book and the Suns don’t."
Russell Westbrook played in the finals I’m sure he had one
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
Giannis “Russell Westbrook” Antetokounmpo
He was thrilling to watch and that trumped everything. The Russell Westbrook of his time.
"Yeah he gave Westbrook props for the triple double thing recently but ever since I was a kid in the 90s and early 2000s almost every time I have heard Robertson talk about basketball he always came off as a grouchy old man living in the past.    Oscar and Wilt before he died just constantly gave out terrible takes about modern players in order to make their generation look better.    I wish everybody could be like Bill Russell, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor who all have just enjoyed and appreciated players of every era and don’t feel the need to disrespect modern guys for no reason."
"Completely correct about this year, but he consistently plays bad defense.  This and playmaking are the two areas he needs to improve but he’s young as fuck so he will get better no doubt.  Btw steals are not a good indicator of a good defensive player.  There are players like Allen iverson and Russell Westbrook who gamble for steals and get burnt all the time by the players they are guarding.  Both of these players have high steal numbers but would never be confused as good defenders. Jordan did the same thing early in his career before settling down and becoming much more disciplined."
"Russell Westbrook is another great example of this. He really is a phenomenal star, but because his playoff record is pretty ugly, people disrespect him like crazy."
"Bud is a bit like a coaching version of Russell Westbrook.  Huge talent but those few limitations can be extremely frustrating and sometimes they're overblown.  However, that talk will die down if the Bucks close it out tonight."
