"When you thought guarding Jamal Murray was bad enough, then they bring that triple ISO in your ass"
"No but OP is bringing up the losses to show why these regular season wins the Jazz are racking up aren’t exactly impressing Shaq to the point where Jazz players are free from criticism.  No it’s not salty hating, you could argue that Jamal Murray had just as good a series in those 7 games and I don’t see anyone calling him a superstar. The actual point Shaq made (that Donovan doesn’t do things other than scoring well enough to be considered a superstar yet) isn’t just hating. The argument he’s using is fairly reasonable, so just dismissing it as a old head “hating” is weak.  He had a great series in the bubble, but his team also lost that series despite being up 3-1. His playoff series vs the Rockets in 2019 was terrible. Then he had a good debut series vs the Thunder in 2018, but again struggled in the 2nd round vs the Rockets. To act like 1 great playoff series he had (played under special circumstances in a unique environment) makes him immune to criticism isn’t it."
"Jamal Murray, Garry Harris, Michael Porter Jr, Bol Bol, Nikola Jokic."
Man I remember I said something last year about Luka being the biggest bitch ass whiner in the NBA and I got downvoted into oblivion. Sorry I saw it sooner then most of you. It’s just irritating as hell. The dude can have the cleanest layup ever and Jamal Murray might look at him wrong and he’s gonna cry about it. Fuck off Luka. You are easily the Philip rivers (most hated player of all time) of the NBA for me.
Jaylen Brown was from the KG PP trade.  Jamal Murray was from the Melo to NY trade.  Dame was from a trade for Gerald Wallace.  Kyrie was from a trade involving Baron Davis and Mo Williams.
FVV is such a beast. What a steal for the Raptors to have him on such a cheap contact when far inferior players like Jamal Murray get Max contracts lol.
Not enough of a winner to beat Jamal Murray
"Westbrook, Ja, Luka, Kyrie, Jamal Murray, etc are not definitively worse either. You could realistically argue him in the 20-25 range or even lower."
"I do think it was a fluke because I don't think jamal murray will ever replicate his playoff run. Jokic has played well every year in the playoffs, he's just incredible"
"God that first one was terrible. Jamal Murray traveled on his way to a shot that sent it to OT where Book gets hurt, Cam Johnson starts to cramp up, Chris Paul had a scare with knee to knee contact, and Ayton fouled out. Fuck."
"Jamal Murray. He's the same player he's been the rest of his career. The bubble was a special situation with no travel and no crowd.   Honestly I think Dlo is better than Murray. At least Dlo is more consistent (believe it or not). Murray has too many of those 30 point games and then single digit duds. Dlo has just been very unfortunate and has played only 8 or 9 games with an All-star caliber teammate (Steph and KAT) while playing under dumb and dumber and dumberer in Byron Scott, Luke Walton, and Ryan Saunders. Jamal was drafted into one of the best situations an NBA player can have."
 it’s literally only 4 guys    Michael Jordan - VS Cleveland 1988  Allen Iverson - VS Toronto 2001  Jamal Murray - VS Utah 2020  Donovan Mitchell - VS Denver 2020
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray I don’t think will ever play as well as he did in the first round
stop using 1 year as a sample size. This sub predictably looks like morons for thinking jamal murray was entering super stardom.
he is as special as Donovon Mitchell and Jamal Murray look at these players numbers. You have no idea about basketball if you think he could average 34 on winning team or he is even close Tatum level
"2016 class lowkey stacked.  Jamal Murray, buddy hield, and sabonis also in lottery, other role players throughout the draft, and guys like siakam, levert, dejounte murray, Brogdon went super late, not to mention a few good undrafted guys too"
Jamal Murray in the playoff bubble put up better numbers than Jaylen. Now he’s barely mentioned.   Jaylen is doing this in the regular season with no fans for a quarter of the season. That’s not even as impressive as Murray fwiw.   Jerry Stackhouse averaged 30ppg for one season but no one compared him to MJ.
"Lakers fans truly are the worst. You could literally do this to any player. If I told you that Davis is having one of his lowest scoring and rebounding years and failed to crack 20 points from the 12th of January to the 21st of January, despite being LeBron's second option, that would make him sound fucking awful, but that isn't how this works. Its clear that Davis is important, even if he has a bad game. Its the same with Gobert. Plus, if you watch the game, you can see that Jokic just dominated, regardless of who or what was in front of him. That happens from time to time. It happened to Donovan and Jamal Murray in the playoffs. This is one of Gobert's best seasons, and even if he has this one bad game, he has still proven himself to be a defensive force.      Let's do this for your best player and see if I sound like a babbling idiot. Ready? Here goes.          ""On the 18th of January, Lebron, who is supposedly an MVP candidate and frontrunner, played against the Golden State Warriors, a fringe playoff team at best. Lebron scored only 19 points, only got 5 assists, and 5 rebounds on 37.5 percent shooting. Lebron, despite being seen by many as the greatest basketball player ever, put in a terrible performance, but in spite of his poor play, the Lakers still won, thanks to the efforts of the best player on the team, Anthony Davis.""            See, I sound like a fucking idiot, and you do too."
"MPJ is so talented. Guess that’s why so many people can’t wait to have him take all the shots or start, at least. Currently he lacks BBIQ though, which he will improve through *more playing time* (hopefully Malone gives him more chances in easier games).  Jamal is a great PG, good fit with Joker. I can see them three all playing really well together. Dynamic trio. Not overlapping. If anything, the team needs a better defensive wing.  I do understand why people have that debate. We haven’t seen the peak Jokic. MPJ, if he stays healthy and gets more comfortable with his back, right now is only like the beginning of his growth. On the other hand, Murray, everyone thinks the bubble Murray was his peak. The best he can do is to get back to that form or closer."
"Murray played amazingly last playoffs, but Jokic was the one who put the Nuggets on his back in game 7 vs Utah, when he scored 30 of 80 points, including the game-winning basket over Gobert. He did this while shooting 52/40/100 that game, whilst Murray only scored 17 on 33/16/100. Jokic definitely stepped up when needed.   Jokic also was the guy at the end of the game against the Clippers due to their lack of big men and against the Lakers, where he would have had another game-winning basket if it wasn't for the stupid Plumlee/Grant error on the game-winner from AD.   Jamal stepped up which brought them farther, but he wasn't the catalyst. He has to show consistency first. Jokic is the catalyst of this team, without Jokic this team is for sure a lottery team. Jokic is the system in Denver, for good reasons."
"I respect that. I don't know if LeBron is a way better scorer than Jokic. To be honest I think they're very similar in that regard. Jokic doesn't finish above the rim like Bron but he executes everywhere else at an automatic clip, maybe better than LeBron  There's no arguing LeBron is a better defender.   The actual champions were a much better team than the Nuggets and getting to the WCF when your running mate is Jamal Murray on crack is impressive."
Jamal Murray threw the ball at Malone because he was mad he didn’t let him go for fifty haha Jamal was offended on Joker’s behalf
THE MEZMERIZING TALENT OF JAMAL MURRAY
Why can’t Jamal Murray be brilliant like this more consistently?
Jamal Murray
Yes same thing goes for TJ Warren and Jamal Murray. For this reason most NBA fans don't take the 2020 Disney Playoffs seriously.
Lmao Jamal Murray with that Collin Sexton two for one defense
Shades of Jamal Murray
Booker is 47TS% in the 4th. Bradley beal is 45 TS%. Jamal Murray is 44 TS%. Donovan Mitchell is 52 TS%. Kawhi is 49TS%. AD is 51%. Lebron is 53TS%.  Jaylen Brown is 48TS%.   I will tell them their stats don't matter if they aren't efficient in the 4th lol.
"To be fair we were 10 before both the Pelicans and Hornets dropped 21 threes on us on an average of 46 attempts.  With that being said, there’s only one reasonable scapegoat:  Bud  I don’t understand how you don’t defend the three in an era where it’s everything and you yourself direct the offense to be one of the best shooting team in the league, and especially when other teams like with AD and Jamal Murray were/are benefitting from the environments"
"Id say at worst 4th then.   Comparing ayton to gobert and embiid is difficult because their strengths are in totally different areas.  Aytons is a solid rim protector whereas the other two are the two best in the league.  But ayton imo is arguably the best center in the league at defending the perimeter.  Bam has an argument and giannis isn't really a center so I'm not including him but aytons switchability and versatility on defense are truly astounding.  When the suns played the nuggets a few days ago he was destroying jokic defensively.  They switched him onto Jamal murray and he clamped him too.  Making the argument that he's top 3 is tough because of small sample size,  but his defense this year has been legit all defensive team level."
"That’s exactly why Bud needs to switch it up. In any other season our defense would be amazing, like it was before the Bubble.  But we’ve seen the likes of Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis, Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, etc all improve as a product of the bubble and the Bucks are caught in the cross-fire.  The heat are an excellent shooting team, but they do not hit those many threes when there’s fans, especially as the Bucks have HC advantage"
"Well lets count the west.   Booker,  Doncic  PG13,  Mitchell,   Jamal Murray  Dame  McCollum  Steph   John wall  SGA  Each one of these players have a right to be in the All Star.  If you ask me these players are in front of CP3 (not in any order)  1) Doncic  2) Lillard  3) Curry   4) Mitchell  5) Booker  6) SGA  7) PG13"
Jamal Murray is garbage
"Mate let's say the Utah Jazz. They are #1 seed in the west while also #1 in 3pts shot. Say Rudy Goburt can slow down Giannis, wtf is the bucks gonna do? Mitchell of Donovan, Boojon Marijuanavic, Clarkson are all 3 pts specialist that can get hot and drop 30 pts at any time. What the frick is Buds gonna do? Instead of doing the right thing and start contesting 3s, just camp the paint out. This isn't the era where big ass centers can't shoot 3 anymore. You got AD, KAT, Embiid, Jokic, Vucavec that can shoot 3s relatively well. Now think about the guards that can shoot wells, Jamal Murray of Roy, Curry, Dame... I can go on and on. Not DEFENDING the 3 pt shot is not how u win games, not in this era. It may work when Shaq was still on the Lakers, not now."
Jamal Murray?
Don’t forget Jamal Murray
Pretty sure the dude who had 2 50 points games in one series was “dominating”. Give Giannis that Jamal Murray and he’s dropping 28 14 and 7 besides him because the Heat can’t guard both
The Headmaster Jamal Murray
"Top 10 !?! Right now ? Uh lets see Curry, Dame, kyrie , cp3, john wall , ben simmons , trae young , ja morant, deaaron fox , kemba, jamal murray are all better rn"
"I love Jimmy Butler but look at the follow up that this guy was saying. He was saying there were no championship level teams in the east last season and that was absolutely untrue  Donovan Mitchell is totally capable of being that jimmy butler level guy for the Jazz in the playoffs, where he seemingly turned on god mode last playoffs. It literally took Jamal Murray also going god mode to stop him."
Gary “Gary Harris” Harris  Also not sure if this counts but Jamal “The First NBA Player” Murray
“The Glitch” Jamal Murray
"What the fuck are you even saying when one Murray just closed the nuggets out?   Jamal is clutch, so is dejounte. That’s not exactly quantifiable or a huge factor to be honest with you. Defense is something dejounte is objectively elite at his position at."
The bubble lol. I guess Jamal Murray is Steph Curry then too

"Respect for your Murray, but Jamal's last 3 or 4 games have shown us a Jamal who's finally waking up after snoozing through most of December and January. Malone needs to let him rest for a couple of games to heal, or else he'll suffer a bigger more long-term injury. They're gonna lose against the Jazz anyway."
Jamal Murray averaged 30 in the bubble
"His stats in the playoffs were the same in the regular season.  And six games isn't enough to tell anything about a player.  Shit, in 20 games Jamal Murray was a top five player in the playoffs.  That obviously means nothing now"
"There’s a lot of players who tip the scale in big moments without being full time superstars. The concept makes me think a lot about Andre Iguadala in 2015-2017 with the warriors, Draymond Green on and off, and in modern years Jamal Murray. I think it depends too much on your definition of a superstar.    To me a superstar is the number one option on a team or an mvp caliber player. Hard to say Rudy is the most impactful of the players left out of that group."
"I just learned that New Balance has both Dejounte Murray and Jamal Murray, maybe they're trying to collect all the Murrays in the league, are there any other Murrays that they need to get?"
The real Murray.  Tbf Jamal playing injured but dejounte still outplayed him
To add insult to injury during this 5 game road trip mpj hasn’t cracked 30 minutes once even tho he was playing great. Meanwhile Jamal Murray who has been injured this entire time has been playing 35-40 minutes every night (minus the night he was acting out).  To add even more insult to injury this is a team with plenty of guard depth and literally little to no wing depth. So he has all the resources available to be giving Jamal rest and even more reason to be forcing MPJ minutes.    Malone is one of the most suspect coaches in the league being rewarded for having a generational talent with a higher basketball iq than he has. And that’s no exaggeration.
"Jamal is injured and clearly playing hurt, top player   That said nuggets should trade Murray Hampton and picks for Beal"
Jamal had a great game as well. Yes Dejounte is playing great right now and he's a great player but say this when Dejounte puts up a performance like Murray did in the playoffs.
Ooohhhh....naw im going jamal murray sorry...
Jamal Murray is getting eaten alive defending DeRozan
"Jamal murray EXPLODED like he did in the first round ... guy, I’m a fan of jocic ... I hope he gets a dirk like championship...I really think he is a great basketball player..just please wake me up when he at least makes a finals appearance and doesn’t get waxed...which should be soon because he is UNSTOPPABLE... pro tip:  no one is unstoppable...even Gary Harris"
Using bubble status to prove “he can put up dame stats” is sooo dumb. By that logic Jamal Murray can put up curry stats then
honestly im not gonna watch this game. it's too depressing to watch jamal murray be so inconsistent.
"No, you clearly don't. Jokic doesn't even have to touch the ball to be effective. They literally have been running plays for him off ball. He drags the opposing center out of the paint by his presence. Why do you think Jamal Murray was able to explode like he did? Like 5 different nuggets had huge games in the playoffs, cause all the defense focuses on jokic. The Lakers had a phenomenal defense last year and basically had to outscore the nuggets most games cause they always got theirs"
Lol you want Jamal Murray or booker to get it this year
"No they can't lmao.  MPJ is the only valuable asset that the Nuggets have. Obviously he goes in any Beal trade, but the rest of the salary match is mediocre. Gary Harris? Will Barton? Paul Millsap? What does Washington need with those guys? And there's no way in hell Denver would give Jamal Murray for what could be a Beal rental.  Because of salary match GSW would offer Wiseman, Looney, Oubre and their first. It's a decent offer, but Oubre would be a rental. It's essentially two high firsts for Beal.  Atlanta has the most assets that can be offered and the 76ers have the best player available in Simmons. Tell me how Denver and GSW outbids them?  Go away nephew."
"More than anything I’m just disappointed by specific players. I thought Jamal Murray turned a page in the bubble, but he’s back to the same old guy. MPJ has missed a ton of time which has been disappointing (obviously not the nuggets fault). The bench has looked a lot worse than last year, and the absence of Plumlee has been more noticeable than I thought it would. The records fine, but for teams who want to make the conference championship, there are more important things than those two numbers in the W/L column"
Jamal Murray slaps Tim Hardaway Jr in the nuts: Ejected  LeBron James dangerously pushes Joel Embiid midair: Stays in the game
You think Jamal Murray is a PLUS defender?
Anybody that watch the playoffs last season should know Jamal Murray.    Plus the toppy too.
jamal murray the nuggets pg who got head from his gf and posted it on his insta story
idk but jamal murray is shooting 91% at the rim
Jamal murray is shooting 90% at the rim with 12% of his shots there
What role player averages 18 a game? Last year was the first year that Jamal Murray averaged over 18 a game. Is he a role player?
"dame, christian wood, jamal murray, caris levert, beal, vucevic, the list goes on.  i don't think people realize that underrated means people DONT talk about them, it has nothing to do with all star recognition or anything like that. beal got snubbed last year, but that doesn't make him underrated. people are now calling him the second best SG in the league. if anything, that makes him OVERrated."
And Jamal Murray gets ejected for a cheeky sack whack
"The real problem with the ""Is he worth so-and-so many dollars?"" has a great inherent problem. NBA max contracts are cost controlled. So every single team in the NBA can have 2 (maybe 3) max contract players. And upper tier players get these max contracts during free agency. So at any given time there are around 45-50 max contracts out there. And many free agent players will get those available slots. Mike Conley was the highest paid player in the NBA 3 years ago. Why? He wasn't the best player but he was due for a new contract and got the max. As long as the salaray cap goes up the newer max contracts will rise too. So in 2 years you might see Jamal Murray getting a 250m contract or John Collins getting one. They are not the top talent in the league but if you're among the top 50 or considered by one GM to be in top 50 you'll get these contracts.  If there was no cost control then Kawhi, LeBron, Steph etc would get around 60 and Gobert might get 15. But not in this salary structure.  Also Gobert definitely deserves that. He is a top 30 player in my book."
Imagine being Jamal Murray ready to take the ball up and right when you’re about to get it you see it get yeeted over your head across the entire court.
Jamal Murray will be receiving some hefty fines
Damn bro you showed him. Jamal Murray is in shambles now
Don't make things easier for Jamal Murray
"Holy crap. What's up with Jamal Murray. Dude refuses to catch and shoot 3's. Jokic or Montre set him for an open catch and shoot 3. Instead, Dude does an unnecessary dribble and lets the defender close in"
"I have no idea what you’re repeating back to me, unless you think Jamal Murray sack-tapping THJ is the same thing as someone fucking up and getting life in prison and that I will forgive someone for whatever dumbass hypothetical you’re trying to use to prove your point. It’s a dumbass comparison you’re trying to make."
&gt; 2 Balls  Jamal Murray says no.
"Jamal ""[Buddy Hield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxl8Xi8nh8w)"" Murray"
Jamal Murray would know
Guess which character Jamal Murray likes to use in Mortal Kombat!?
Jamal Murray
It sucks because cock blasting was my justification for hating CP3 but I like Jamal Murray. Do I turn away my love or open up my love further to accept cock blasters? Only my heart and balls know for sure but they aren't talking.
*Jamal Murray has left the chat.*
"Jamal Murray is 23, does he count?  I'll take my guy."
"He still might come up short since Curry, Dame, Luka, and Mitchell are basically locks at guard.  If only 6 guards make it, you can only pick 2 between CJ, Booker, and Conley.  Biggest question mark to me is CJ since he just got injured, how many games missed is ""too many"". Pre-injury he was lighting the world on fire, like 1st or 2nd team all-nba fire.  There's also Paul George who probably can be a guard or forward?  Guys like CP3, Jamal Murray, SGA, and Fox will get tons of fan votes too even though they don't really deserve it."
&gt;  Murray has a hard time taking shots over bigs.   Jamal is playing hurt
THE ASTONISHING TALENT OF JAMAL MURRAY
I’m so fucking sick of Jamal Murray playing so damn well against us. I never want the Suns to have to play against him again
Jamal “headmaster” Murray iykyk hehe. Guy got game
Jamal Murray is the only player in the NBA. That’s what
Fucking Jamal Murray man!
".. more talent ""for sure""? We have an actual MVP candidate, plus Jamal Murray, MPJ, etc. I really like your team but let's I don't think you can say that at this point."
Doesn't negate what dude said.  Jamal Murray clutch.
Or jamal Murray. Dude is the most inconsistent piece of trash until He plays us
I mean the game *did* go to OT on a Jamal Murray travel. I don't love blaming the refs for everything but that was a pretty blatant missed call.
Jamal Murray
"Emerging big 3?  Production per 75 possessions when all three are on the floor...  Nikola Jokic: 27.3 PTS, 13.1 AST, 12.1 REB, 69.8 TS%  Jamal Murray: 21.6 PTS, 7.3 AST, 60.3 TS%  Michael Porter Jr.: 16.5 PTS, 11.0 REB, 60.5 TS%"
"No. Its not just Embiid. If you saw the insane jump some people made un the bubble last year, I think having small crowds is producing a similar effect.   So I think he can keep it up personally as long as civid rules remain in place. Feel the same way about Jamal Murray."
Jamal Murray and y'all know why
Imagine jamal murray in conley's position
Jamal Murray is all hype
Dreaming of seeing him paired with Jamal Murray and the other Canadians coached by Nick Nurse in the Olympics 😁
I don’t see Jamal Murray mentioned in this thread
"Jazz defense struggles in the playoffs is a made up narrative. It all stems from when The rockets beat us two series in a row and their offense was worse in that series than it was both regular seasons. Truth is they were just a better team. Nuggets beat us in 7, Jokic is the better center and Jamal Murray had the flukiest playoff performance of all time. And then we have a playoff loss against KD Warriors. We beat lob city clippers and Russ/PG Thunder. Every playoff series as lower seed. (Referring to playoff years with gobert)"
"I’d take Devin Booker over Jamal Murray, does that make things ok between us?"
He's a bad rim protector   Jamal Murray said it himself
Is that why his shooting splits are subtantially better than Mitchell's depsite playing injured for all of Jan?   And if you don't think it effected him than take a look at his FT% which was hovering in the mid 70s despite him historically being one of the best FT shooters in the entire league.  Like to act like Mitchell going 7/22 for 20 pts is better than Jamal going 5/11 for for 12 points is just dumb. AND the former has been more common than the later since roughly January of 2020 (which is when Murray began to take his leap).
Jamal Murray
What about Jamal Murray though? SMH bias against small markets
Jamal Murray is in that JR Smith tier of inconsistency so I’ll take D Mitch
"The nuggets have been hurt nearly all year lol   Jamal and Jokic are basically the only ones who didn’t miss time.   MPJ had to miss like 10 games at the start of the year due to contact tracing, Gary has been out for a while, Millsap has been out for a while, Dozier was out for 6 games, etc etc.   Basically every starter on the team besides Murray and most of their rotational players have or will miss 10 or more games so far.  That’s huge"
"&gt; Gobert's responsibility is to protect the paint, not guard the three-point line; there's not much he can do if he cuts off a path to the basket and Jokic passes out of the post to an open man. Gobert isn't a switch heavy player, he isn't going to be doing duty on Jamal Murray."
Jamal Murray being 5th in dpoy race
"Gonna tie it with Simmons at this rate, you know when the media stops saying Jamal Murray and LeBron are better defenders than Embiid this season."
"One game very good sample size. Ofc Harden will neutralize Ayton, name a single 7 foot player that won’t get completely cooked by Harden. I’m gonna look at his much bigger body of work including giving Jokic his hardest games all season and impressively switching and guarding Jamal Murray on the perimeter."
"&gt; 1) Jamal Murray  &gt; 2) Jamal Murray  &gt; 3) Jamal Murray  &gt; 4) Jamal Murray  &gt; 5) Jamal Murray  I don’t get it, why is it all Jamal Murray?"
I don’t see Jamal Murray on your team.
"i don’t remember who,  but someone put out a DPOY ladder and it has Jamal Murray 5th"
Bro you gotta forgive me for this but can you please explain the Jamal Murray DPOY joke lol
Why is Jamal Murray over him in DPOY rankings I demand a recount
"Booker gets tossed last night  Mitchell gets tossed tonight  If the pattern of a talented young guard from a top West seed getting ejected continues, welcome Jamal Murray to the club"
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
"Find a flair.  ...and a new slant. This ""Jamal Murray is a cocky idiot"" thing is so 2018."
Playoff bubble Jamal Murray man hit some of the nastiest jumpers in those couple 50 pieces he dropped.  But Klay Thompson when he destroyed the Indiana Pacers and had 60 something. I believe he broke the 3’s in a game record that game if I’m not mistaking but it was pretty incredible to watch.
alternate title: Jamal Murray looks to his right and has virtually no reaction to someone losing their balance
"But at the same time Jamal Murray has looked like his bubble self again, so Jokic doesn’t have to carry the scoring load as much.          I would say Denver looks to be improving from their early season days as a teamz"
"Who would you say the best Canadian player in the league rn? Between Kelly Olynik, SGA, Jamal Murray, Cory Joseph and RJ Barrett? Tough choices if you ask me"
Anyone ever notice how similar Jamal Murray looks to Mo Salah...
"**Scenario Example:**  *You have O'Neal and Gobert back on defense. Gobert is already retreating under the rim, arms up, ready.*  Say you are the Kings; with Fox, Barnes, and Heild running the floor. Heild sprints to the corner 3, while Fox and Barnes attack. Fox is stopped by O'Neal--pass to Barnes-- who meets Gobert at the block.   Were still on a 3-2 fastbreak. Should Barnes take this contested layup or should he pass it out to Buddy Heild for a wide open 3?   What if its Jamal Murray? What if its Zach LaVine? Is Jimmy Butler hitting a trailing Duncan Robinson for a wide open 3pt still a bad shot?   **CONTEXT**"
When Jamal Murray has a better DFG than your superstar center lmfao
"Or if you’re Jamal Murray, every single time he takes a fast break 3 it’s going in, he did it twice against us the other day"
Lmao that's even worse  Got people thinking Jamal Murray was playing defense like LeBron rn
"and take Jokic out and the Nuggets simply don't have an offense. They have MPJ who don't know how to select his shots by himself and Barton who thinks is Jamal Crawford, and also Murray who is a really streaky scorer. Nuggs late game action consist of Jokic literally controlling everything"
"Why not? Bam is still a top 10 defender in the league whem accounting for versatility.   And no WAY should murray be over Embiid, Bam, Lowry, OG, I could go on and on with players who should be over Jamal Fucking Murray in a top 5 defender list for the year lol"
Yea your point went to shit when you mentioned Jamal Murray with those dudes. He isn’t even in the same stratosphere of those guys. You should’ve picked lesser tier players. That last sentence is hilarious though I ain’t hating on the next man never spoke on his money or nothing like that.
"Do you think most players could score 50 points on 21-25 shooting and 8-10 from 3 with no free throws? Oh that’s right they can’t because Jamal Murray is the only person to do that in NBA history...  Do you think most players could score 40 points in 3 consecutive playoff games? Oh that’s right only Michael Jordan and Jamal Murray have done that   How many players have had any stretch of games where they average 31/5/5 in insane efficiency? Not many   Jamal has been inconsistent throughout his career but when he’s at his best most players can’t touch his level  31 PPG on 55/50/90 over his past 9 games Bedford this one, give the guy some credit"
I just can’t get with Jamal Murray bro is so arrogant
Jamal Murray
"Yup more often than not that's been the case. Sixers are great at home is part of it probably and just a really good team all around. Tricky matchup too if Jamal Murray doesnt really show up.   It doesnt even really do it justice either as the matchup data doesnt show who guarded Embiid when he got his buckets... Rotation wise, Brett Brown always used to sub Embiid out at the 6 minute mark and sub him back in with 3 minutes left in the first, traditionally when Jokic sits until ~8 minutes left in the second quarter. Embiid would just feast against Plumlee and then Jokic would come back and have to try to get him back under control."
Defense statistics are also fucking inconsistent and  LeBron is limiting opponent FG% by a fuck ton but so is Jamal Murray by the same metric  Problem is that this year Bron is playing All NBA Defense while Jamal Murray is just lucky the shots aren't falling on him
..that is named Jamal Murray
"Embiid because I always wanted to know what would happen if they switched places  Jamal Murray and Embiid and Ben Simmons and Jokic would be pretty sick duos, right?"
That's not consistency that's Jamal Murray. He's like a wave of really big highs and lows.
Jamal Murray is averaging like 28 PPG in the last 11 on great efficiency. Is that consistency I see? 👀
"Yes that's what Jamal ""5th in DPOY"" Murray can do"
Would a DPOY Jamal Murray be a top 5 player?
"Jamal ""Kyrie Irving"" Murray. He really reminded me of Kyrie in the Bubble."
Jamal Murray is the truth. Been unreal the last 6 months.
"Ah yes, Jamal Murray and Trae Young putting the league on notice defensively"
The best defense is scoring 14 points in 13 minutes. I understand the Jamal Murray DPOY thing now.
Jamal Murray’s all time mixtape is already insane and he’s only 24  Edit: If you want a treat search Jamal Murray posts and sort by all time
"Actually you know what... we’ll give you Alec burks, taj gibson, Obi toppin and Derrick Rose for Jamal Murray... deal?"
You have Jamal Murray... shut up
"We lost jerami grant and torrey Craig mpj has been a disappointement and looks to be only good as scorer without any basketball iq,gary harris offensive decline has been a lot steeper than expected jamal murray has returned to his inconsistent self and will barton has forgotten how to play basketball"
I'd love one jamal Murray right now please  Enes Kanter is second on the team in win shares right now
Lol let’s not pretend like Jamal Murray isn’t good enough to be an all star. There are maybe 4 or 5 teams where he wouldn’t be the second best player
Jamal Murray? That’s a funny way to spell OG Anunoby
Jamal Murray ahead of Giannis  I won't even comment on this any more than that
TIL Jamal Murray is 5th in defense in the NBA.  And his averages have been bubble Murray great for 5 weeks now.  The best timeline
WHERE THE HELL IS DORT. How is **Jamal Murray** on this list and not Dort. This is an extreme miscarriage of justice
"What happened is he doesn’t know jack shit, got the list with the typo on it. And made some shit up cause he genuinely didn’t see anything wrong with Jamal Murray being in the conversation lol. Mf was like “mmmkay aight if yu say so, I can write a lil blurb np”"
"Jamal Murray is a lock for DPOY, don’t @ me"
"I watched all lakers games this season and if Lebron James won an all defensive award. I would call bs. He is one of the worst off ball defenders in the league and not an exceptional on ball defender really.   He gives up open three point shots because he doesn't like to rotate and run to contest. If any other do this, they would be fucking clowned.   Lakers success on defense is more of a team effort and Vogel.   They got jamal murray on this shit. Shows to you how inconsistent this list is.   I know Im getting downvoted by lebron stans lol"
Jamal Murray aka Mikal Bridges defensive instructor
Ben Simmons over Rudy... and Jamal Murray?? This list is a joke
huh? i assure you i only think of jamal murray when his name is explicitly mentioned in the thread....
They should just give DPOY to Jamal Murray for the memes
"Rudy Gobert is a top 2 defensive player in the league, and he ain't #2.  Also Jamal Murray fucking lol"
"Most likely Gobert wins this award. And the reason to me is simple: they have the top defense (or close enough it changes often) and he is by far their best defender. But moreso than that they have been the best team in the NBA most of the year and have a good chance at being the number one seed in the East, while having absolutely no chance at getting MVP for anyone on their team.   The Sixers have Embiid and if we finish top two in the East and he continues his torrid pace he will receive serious consideration for MVP. I think voters will want to reward the Jazz for their amazing season and this makes the most sense. Gobert, Simmons and imo Embiid (not sure why he's not mentioned over defensive stalwart, Jamal Murray) all have a very good claim to the title this year. But two of those guys play on the same team and to this point their defense still isn't as good as the Jazz's.   Ben might deserve to be number one on this Ladder but he isn't the leader for the actual award."
Because he’s trying to get across the point Jamal had a slow start and the last 3 weeks he has played very well. So if you’re extrapolating for the rest of the season the individual difference may not be significant.   When you factor in the chemistry Jokic/Murray have and how well Jamal played in absolutely huge moments in the playoffs it’s not some forgone conclusion you would even want to make a 1 for 1 trade. I wouldn’t.
"Rim protecting doesn't have to be the most important thing, draymond and Kawhi are fantastic defenders and thats not their main thing at all. I do think Jamal Murray being on this list over Joel is...... something else though."
"&gt;5. Jamal Murray  Is this a troll? He gets targeted almost every time by the opponent and barely does anything on defense  &gt;  If they just wanted a FILLER for that irrelevant number 5 spot, they could have just put Giannis or someone like that. Still would have been a better choice. Putting a ZERO defensive threat anywhere on this list is a complete joke"
"The answer is no, as long as Jamal Murray is guarding them"
I don’t think Simmons is controversial at 1 but Jamal Murray and bron is ehhh
"Strange, it's almost as if I cannot make concrete assessments of players less than halfway through the season. Looking at you Jamal Murray"
At this point it’s a two man race between Jamal Murray and lebron
bro i wish jamal murray is the 5th best defensive player in the nba
Because Jamal Murray &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; duh
MAKE WAY FOR YOUR NEW DPOY JAMAL MURRAY
Bam needs to start chasing blocks. Dude is anchoring a top D that starts Duncan robinson and Jamal Murray is making a top 5 over him SMH.
"so fucking silly, defensive metrics absolutely have a place but blindly using Dfg% is so ridiculous lol, it’s so noisy  people are missing shots near Jamal Murray...is he....an elite defender"
I dont think perimeter players really ever deserve the award but it would be cool to see simmons win. Rudy is unquestionably a better defender though  e: Jamal Murray? the fuck?
Kinda wanna see Jamal Murray fuck around and win DPOY now
Jamal Murray at 5 lol what the hell
"Gobert should probably still be #1, but Jamal Murray? Surely that's a mistake right?"
I refuse to believe that an actual article on the nba official site put jamal murray as a top 5 defender
Jamal Murray???
I was about to complain about Simmons being #1 and then I saw...  JAMAL MURRAY?????????
Uh since when has Jamal Murray been a DPOY contender
Jamal Murray?
"Jamal Murray, noted DPOY contender"
Is #8 on all nba ceiling referring to Jamal Murray or dejounte Murray? They’re both 24 and have the same last name. I’m assuming ur referring to Jamal but dejounte has been the real deal as of late so I’m not sure.
"&gt;Im glad you found a small 10 game sample size that can be shoehorned into your argument.  I'm just literally so fucking sick and tired of people on [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) constantly moving goalposts for Jamal and trying to create this narrative that he sucks this year. Like when he's playing well people always have something to say to criticize him or negate the stats he's putting up.  &gt;and hes outplaying Jamal this season.  I told you why I'm only using the last 10 games to compare them and why it's not fair to compare Jamal and Zach for the whole season when Jamal spent the first part of it being banged up, injured, and still reeling from the bubble, when Zach didn't have to do any of that. If Zach continues to play at this great pace after getting to the Eastern Conference Finals and then having a shortened off-season before beginning the next season, then we can talk.  Zach's playing amazing this year, but you don't have to take digs at Jamal just to prop up Zach.  &gt;If Murray performs well again in the playoffs, Ill shut up. But lets wait and see.  Well, Jamal has already shot better this past February than he did in the playoffs, [look it up](https://twitter.com/DNVR_Nuggets/status/1366504420645638146). He's also literally known for raising his game and averaging better stats in the playoffs.  Until Zach gets some playoff experience I don't think you have any room to try to downplay what Jamal did in the bubble."
jamal murray then proceeded to punch someone in the balls for no reason
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Probably the Nuggets     I think Jamal Murray can carry the Nuggets.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't think a Lebron led Lakers team makes the playoffs tbh.
Jamal Murray maybe? Jaylen Brown? Donovan Mitchell? Devin Booker is probably the one
"Tbh I actually think of it the other way around. I think a lot of these older guys are more soft than the younger guys now a days. I look at DBook and DMitchell and Joker and Jamal Murray and Trae Young and all those guys are hungry af and they seem like they genuinely look like they want to create a culture. I mean look no further than the Jazz/Nuggets playoff series, that was intense basketball, and all these guys have a fire I’ve seen in 90s/2000s basketball that I’ve felt NBA post 2015 has lacked. A lot of the “all stars” or today are ring chasing, whether that be LeBron or KD (really anyone on the Nets) or Kawhi (personally don’t consider clippers a super team but whatever) or even Draymond himself when Warriors got KD. The more “experienced” guys seem to be worried less about creating a culture and more about winning a ring, which I get that’s the ultimate goal, but there’s a difference between being someone great like AI or Chuck or Reggie Miller or Dame who stuck with their teams and all those guys who joined up with other all stars to get a ring imo."
I would agree with this if it was about Jamal Murray or CJ McCollum   This is kyrie. We’ve seen him do this in the finals
"This year he is averaging 21.3/4.0/4.8 on 48/41/86 splits (.595 TS%). In the bubble he averaged **26.5**/4.8/**6.6** on 50/**45**/90 splits (.626 TS%). He is averaging the best *regular season* numbers of his career so far this season, but literally every counting/efficiency stat was better in the bubble lol. Murray is playing GREAT this year, but 5 more points, 2 more assists, 4% better from 3, and 2% better TS% is definitely, overall and all around, better than this season. I know you weren't talking about Donovan because, same situation, best regular season of his career stat-wise so far, but a HUGE (bigger than Jamal) drop-off from last playoffs."
"Jamal Murray pulled off some of the most insane tough shot making for 3 games. You can just pretend stuff happens that didn't for an argument but Murray was not getting good shots a lot of the time, he was just on fire hitting everything."
I don't know how you can watch Gobert and not think his feet are slow on the perimeter at times. It's not like what Jamal Murray did to the Jazz in the bubble doesn't count as evidence.
"Lebron, AD, Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray"
"I never said Westbrook is as good as Harden. The point was that great players can do great things if they’re on a team like that. Your whole argument on Harden being a better scorer was based on his seasons with the rockets, so it has everything to do with your position. Apart from that you said he draws fouls better, and I said I would rather take Kyrie’s skill set over Harden’s ability to draw fouls. And with Jamal Murray you’re ignoring the two man game he plays with Jokic and how much better he makes everybody around him. Murray still has much to prove if you’re gonna mention him with these guys"
"Lmao westbrook averaged 31 on 55% TS. He wasn’t nearly as good as harden  Harden was on a team that enabled him to that. Yes. That has nothing to do with the fact that harden is the better scorer, or else I’d just argue jamal Murray can do what kyrie does if given the same chance"
"Okay, Jamal murray is just as good as kyrie at scoring too. You take more shots, you score more points"
Maybe Jamal Murray
Yeah he's nothing like known lockdown defender Jamal Murray
"You mean when we lost to the Rockets twice, who were considered the one ""true"" contender to the KD Warriors?  And we're just gonna act like Jamal Murray didn't have the biggest anomaly of a playoff series in history lol  Bruh you and your lack of basketball comprehension smh"
"Jazz Lakers Clippers Nuggets  Jazz are my choice to come out of West. Lakers have a good supporting cast but AD this season before the injury wasn’t playing to his normal standard for some reason, if that continues combined with rust when LeBron comes back I can pick them to come out of the west.   Clippers are better this year, but these occasional blowouts against teams that aren’t better than them scares me, makes them somewhat unreliable.   Nuggets are a scary team but Jamal Murray was the deciding factor last year, I believe the bubble elevated his game to a degree. Also as impressive as it is to come back from 2 3-1 deficits, you should never be in a 3-1 situation in the first place, it’s too risky and your luck will run out I.e conference finals last year."
"Trae isn’t as lethal as a shooter as he is exaggerated to be, but I guarantee Jamal Murray gets a lot better looks from three than Trae because he has an even better playmaker than Trae on his team.   Trae is THE playmaker and has had the ball consistently for all of his career.  Jamal Murray is a better shooter statistically, but he has a slight advantage over Trae.   However, I’ve also seen Jamal Murray get hot and literally make any shot possible so I won’t discredit him"
"Oh, it wasn't because of elite play from Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray? Guess I was wrong."
"After those videos, I have decided, Paul Pierce is my GOAT, Jamal Murray SGOAT."
"I'm assuming this is from that other thread, so I'll just throw my own two cents for discussion.   First of all, imo saying Lavine/Trae are a level higher is not an insult to Murray, it's just recognizing roles.   With similar stats, I would always consider the players that have less help, face more defensive attention, and are the primary player on their team a level higher. You can't dismiss playing yearly on a contender with an MVP caliber player versus playing on a bottom tier team where defenses absolutely key in on you. It's not discrediting Murray's numbers, it's providing context.   Lavine has put up the same splits as Murray is recently all year without any help before the Vucevic trade. Murray is stile an elite scorer, but we don't and can't know how he would fare with very little help and without multiple scoring threats around him.   Trae literally carries an entire offense on his shoulders, he's responsible for a ridiculous amount of their scoring through points and assists. Lavine isn't a great playmaker but is scoring on insane splits for his volume. Trae and Zach are slightly over 30% usage versus Murray at 25% and are dealing with much more defensive attention. There's so many intangible impacts that come from the difference in roles that can't be captured by stats only (fatigue, adapting to opponent gameplan, defensive effort, spacing from teammates, etc)   If it makes the argument any better, I'm not saying Jamal ISN'T on their tier, it's more that we don't know that he's on that tier yet because he hasn't had to be. So based only on what we've seen and what we know, I'd argue Trae and Lavine are one tier up.   One thing to add: I'd say at his hottest, he's easily on these guys' level, maybe even higher at times like the playoffs. But consistency matters, 25 game stretches don't indicate a full player"
Like taking Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray when you already have Rubio?
Darn you Jamal Murray!
"Jamal Murray, snow flurry, dog in a hurry... Lakers in 5"
"I'm not the other guy who said that.   But also Jamal Murray deserves more credit from YOU.   Jokic is good, but Jamal Murray is too"
Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell
Well technically he’s just having the most efficient season the way Steph was more efficient than Jose Calderon. Guys like Mitchell Robinson or Jamal Murray have insane splits at the rim on low volumes
"Trae Young is much better offensively than Lavine, because he can get to the line a lot/playmakes really well  Jamal Murray put up 40 points to win a game 7"
"Lavine and Trae are a tossup, I give the edge to Lavine. Cut Murray. Sorry Jamal."
"Kentucky born and raised. Huge college basketball fan of course, always loved the NBA but never had a team to root for. In 2016 I jumped on the Nuggets bandwagon right after they drafted Jamal Murray with the 7th pick and never looked back. I know I missed out on the years of struggle but I’m here now repping like crazy in the KY. Full believer that the Nuggets are taking the west this year. I drove to Nashville right after they announced the Aaron Gordon trade and put 100 on a +1200 future bet. Lakers fans will hate but their time of reigning West Conference Champion is coming to an end. They better be praying we don’t see them in the 1st round. Would hate to ruin Lebron and AD’s legacy with a 1st round exit!!!"
Can you imagine if Giannis had Jamal Murray dropping 40 points in the playoffs?
"That’s incredibly hard play to stop. They run that play from the corner as well multiple times a game as well. Jamal back screens for AG. AG dives and Murray pops. They almost always get something out that. If teams switch it, it’s an easy duck in for AG and if they don’t It’s difficult to stop AG from diving or Jamal from popping. When they played the Hawk’s AG got like 3 dunks out of it because the Hawks obviously weren’t going to switch that action with Trea."
"Nikola Jokic when guarded by Deandre Ayton this season: 13/34 FG (38%), 3 TOVs, blocked twice, zero free throw attempts.  Nikola Jokic when guarded by other Suns: 18/27 FG (67%), 11/15 FTs.  Jamal Murray when guarded by Ayton: 8/24 FG (33%), 1 TOV, blocked once, zero FT attempts  Jamal Murray when guarded by other Suns: 22/39 FG (56%), 8/9 FTs."
Motherfucker went for the horse-collar on Jamal Murray when game 7 was already decided
I mean I would rather have Jamal Murray than Ben Simmons for sure and Tatum is debatable
"Ayton loves playing Jokic as well. No more Gary Harris or Torrey Craig to harass Book either.  So far the season series has gone like this:  Suns win the first one in a game where CP3 was clutch in the fourth. Nuggets were without MPJ, due to covid I think. Suns were playing on the second night of a b2b, the first game was in Utah and the second in Denver.. probably the most difficult b2b there is.   Second game went to OT. Booker got hurt late in  OT while the Suns were winning, Denver ended up closing it out in a really fun back and forth game.   Third game was the very next night. Without Booker the Suns lost in double OT. Ayton was having a good game but fouled out in the first OT. Jamal Murray controversially traveled on the shot that sent the game to OT, so a lot of fans feel like this one was stolen. The Suns blew a pretty good lead in this one though so you can’t blame it all on the no call."
"It's very strange what Jamal turns into against the sun's, no matter what point if the season, how injured he is, whether he's hot or cold jamal just turns into a monster against the sun's. I'd love a playoff series to get the combo of clutch murray and sun's murray the combination would create the greatest PG  of all time l."
"1: Jokic was 25 to start the season, so kind of ridiculous take. This isn’t harden in the “prove it or nothing” stage of his career   2: Jokic was still better than Jamal overall in the playoffs even though Murray had some crazy performances. Their overall lines and splits were really similar. The team runs through Jokic 100% of the time.    3: idk why you’re acting like series wins aren’t series wins, and they only had one rest day before the Clippers series. Once they settled in they dominated and likely would have in fewer games if the teams had equal rest. Regardless, doesn’t even matter. They also played the Lakers closer than pretty much anyone, ppl forget that would have been a 6 game series without Plumlee’s blown defense for the AD buzzer beater    Just a dumbass take all around. This type of attitude is why players form super-teams and why it’s increasingly rare for home grown teams to make it past the conference finals"
Nah jus this subs recency bias coming in. Like when jamal murray was a top 15-20 player or PG wasn’t even top 30
"Guy is just a Mavericks fan I guess, I mean if Porzingis is on top 10 young players at 25, why not Jokic or Jamal Murray."
I think offensively speaking Jokic is slightly better.  But defensively it isn't really close at all. Jokic has improved a lot but embiid is still elite as a rim protector and can definitely rotate out it the perimeter better these days as well.   I'd argue both embiid and jokic are probably better suited as 2nd scorers on a championship team these days despite how dominant they are. I think Jokic is better suited as a number one though.  Also nuggets were better last post season I the sense that Jamal Murray had turned himself into the GOAT in those playoff runs where he was averaging like 38 a game or something stupid. But ultimately they lost because of defence. Also not sure hwo you can argue last season was better than 2019 for embiid. Where they lost by 4 bounces to the eventual champions in 7 games. Presumably they would have gone on to win the championship that year.
"Nah Jamal Murray was just as good in the comeback as Jokic was. He’s not as good, but he lit the world on fire."
SGA is/will be better than Jamal Murray ￼
"That Jamal Murray is extremely underrated at this point because the media made a big deal of his early season (injury induced) struggles but then turned out as he got healthy and found consistancy.  If winning playoff basketball is the goal, i would take him over Fox, Simmons and Ingram. And think he, SGA and Mitchell are all equals. (With Booker getting a slight nod above them)."
word so we can agree jamal murray is a top 5 player then
"Jamal doesn't iso every time.  And yes, when you have a top 5-10 NBA player to draw attention from the defense you get more favorable match-ups and better opportunities to score, even when you iso.  Murray can iso &amp; the defense can't help because they still have to pay attention to Jokic &amp; MPJ.  Who on the Blazers is drawing that kind of attention?"
Do you think Jokic is giving Murray easy buckets when Jamal just ISOs every time?
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray gets called all of these things regularly and none of them fit even though he is probably the best current Canadian player.
Jamal Murray
"I will say Jokic neutralizes a lot of what Rudy Gobert does. He is able to stretch the floor and take Rudy away from the rim on defense where he plays best. I think it’s a close matchup but if I were the Jazz I would be scared to play the nuggets. Jokic is going to put up his usual MVP numbers and Rudy has never really slowed him down. MPJ is one of the best shooters in the league and can pull up against anyone. Jamal Murray elevates his game, plays better under pressure, and has proved this season to be clutch. Then you throw in Aaron Gordon, who is proving to be elite at cutting to the rim and get easy looks with his athleticism.   I think the nuggets win the series 5-6 games. Jokic neutralizes Rudy which is the reason the Jazz have such a dominant defense. Then you have 3 players that can hit off balance and difficult shots at a high percentage. And on top of this Jokic and Jamal Murray have arguably the best two man game in the entire NBA. The playoffs is a much slower, more physical, and half court game and the nuggets two best players both excel in this environment."
MPJ's numbers in 15 games without Jamal Murray:  18.9ppg 9.6rpg and 1.5apg on 52/49.4/92.1 shooting splits.
"MPJ's numbers in 15 games without Jamal Murray:  18.9ppg 9.6rpg and 1.5apg on 52/49.4/92.1 shooting splits.  The numbers don't really support your narrative. Every elite scorer benefits from playing with an elite playmaker obviously but MPJ is just straight up an elite shooter. Most of his looks are assisted but they aren't always ""open"". His size gives him a KD-lite ability to rise up and shoot over defenders."
Jamal Murray. Hes a great player and gets slandered way to often.
"Can't believe you wrote up this long of a write up going over the differences between Jamal Murray and PP. I wrote ""we're used to guys like Pierce being able to do this"" meaning it wouldn't have been a big deal at all if he were in the NBA, obviously him working for a family friendly company like Disney is different. It's just not something this sub is used to, as a basketball sub.   I do get the confusion though, I didn't clarify that."
Jamal Murray is a positive defender at this point but was a work in progress when he signed the max so you are half right?
DPOY Jamal Murray obviously 😂
"Jamal Murray defense is trash, but he still got the bag."
"RoCo  I also think Jamal Murray doesn't get enough credit as a player who does a lot of little things on offense. Screening, playing off ball, selflessness, constantly cutting or relocating. He's as selfless as any player in the nba"
Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell.  They're both lightning in a bottle and put on that epic scoring duel in the bubble.   And Mitchell was almost a nugget too since nuggets drafted him originally.
"I think usually we all hear players post-game absolutely exhausted and sweating to get words out, and it breaks quite often and sounds deeper, like they’re crying.  In a normal circumstance (which we usually don’t have access to), all the players sound different. AD and Jamal Murray are prime examples, listen to their Post Game interviews and any other interview, such a drastic difference"
"No order: Lin, Jokic, Rose, Dirk, LeVert, D'Lo, Nash, Jamal Murray, Billups, Steph"
"Yeah re-thinking it he should probably be above Ingram. I have concerns about Ingram's ability to close games, and Murray already has a leg up on him with that.For comparison to Fox, its a little more difficult for me because Murray is playing with much more talent is a second option to an MVP candidate and top 5 player. I know it shouldn't all be about who is a better first option, but I really like the possibility of Fox developing as a defender and a playmaker. Jamal is a shooter playing next to an elite playmaker and passer that helps him out a lot.  MPJ is a whole lotta potential, with a little bit less effectiveness right now. Everyone can see the talent, but I can't put him above an already all-star in Sabonis and if Morant can work on his jumpshot, it would go too well with his ability to get into the paint and playmaker. MPJ is mainly just a scorer, and I personally am not so confident on him developing other facets of his game that much."
Murray is too low. Call me a homer if you want but Jamal has proven more AND has a higher ceiling than Fox and Ingram and is better suited for playoff success than Simmons.  MPJ is also probably too low.
This is like the best list we had in a while from this guy at least. We have had tj McConnell top 5 last week and Jamal murray the week before aswell top 5
"Lmao dude. When was it ugly for Shai in the playoffs? Last season when he came into the bubble with an injury? This season SGA is averaging more points, rebs and assists than Jamal Murray on better efficiency while playing less minutes per game. That’s not even mentioning the fact that he isn’t playing with someone as good as Jokic (or even as good as MPJ). Jamal Murray is nice don’t get me wrong but to have him ahead of SGA on this list would just be wrong."
"I mean the Jamal Murray  thing was an obvious accident. It also makes no sense to pretend a famous basketball player is anything approaching the same as Greg from accounting. Their lifestyles are completely different. Not to mention that this wasn’t by any means accidental, he was on live.   With all that being said my overall point is that this isn’t a big deal and the people on here vilifying him with “omg think about his wife and children” sound fucking ridiculous. The people in his life either dgaf or they’re pissed. Either way who cares, it’s none of our business and you guys sound crazy bringing up his family to try to feel morally superior. Let the man do his drugs and watch some ass shakers."
"With the amount of dumb shit that people throw up on their socials that gets them divorced and fired, you still make this comment as if there is zero chance that he was fucked up and not thinking. Jamal Murray put a video of him getting domed on insta, cost him the relationship. Like shitloads of politicians and celebrities have posted themselves getting wild and paid consequences for it both with family and with jobs.   You may be totally right. But you also may be totally wrong, and one seems more likely than the other"
I’m taking Jamal Murray over CJ McCollum and Ja Morant
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"
Lmao Jamal Murray disrespect is out of hand
Lmao Jamal Murray should not be ranked higher than SGA
Jamal Murray is a DPOY candidate you heathen.
Give me Jamal murray over 6-10. Lamelo ball? really?
"how does fox and sga have a higher potential than jamal?   &amp;#x200B;  these mfers have short term memory, SGA has a shot if his shooting stays sustainable but murray is better than fox easily."
"Lol wow! I am a huge mikal bridges fan, but do we think he’s ever going to be able to be a 30ppg scorer on a western conference finals team?? (He’s ahead of Jamal Murray)"
"Ben Simmons wayyyy too high, Trae Young wayyy too low, also Jamal Murray is too low as well, feel like his lack of All-Star appearances hurt him, he's been an All-Star caliber player this year when he's not injured and he was a superstar level player in the bubble.   Also just LOL with LaMelo over Tatum."
Whereas Jamal Murray from the same draft class just turned 24 two months ago
"Nah, this it's because we're used to guys like Pierce being able to do this. This a basketball sub, Jamal Murray posted a video of him literally getting his dick sucked and nobody gives a shit."
Jamal Murray releases a bj video on Instagram and still goes on espn smh
Keep thinking Jamal Murray three point hot streaks are a sustainable model for playoff success LMFAOO
"Jamal Murray probably. He’s great, but people on our sub talk about him like he’s Steph"
those new balance jamal murray commercials are ass
"You might not like Jamal Murray, but not as much as you don’t like playing in the conference finals..."
"Honestly, he's been a good enough playmaker to bring the ball up the floor, especially on the fast break. Our fast break offense was legit horrible because of how slow Jokic plays, the only time we score of the break with him bringing the ball up the court is when he hits those long bombs. Jamal Murray can do it, he just rarely ends up with the ball because of his size. AG, while not as good of a playmaker, is probably THE guy to improve this aspect of our offense. I'm sure it'll become more prevalent once he's actually practiced with the team instead of just winging it."
"&gt;Controversial 2nd star player: Jamal Murray  Being a dumbass and posting an IG video isn't controversial, its just being careless lol.  Mpj is the controversial one"
These new nuggets line up has some nice size. And all of them can ball. Going to be a scary team in playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  Jamal Murray 6'3  Will Barton 6'6  Aaron Gordon 6'9  Michael Porter Jr 6'10  Nikola Jokic 6'11
"Yea, but scary just isn’t as fun to say lol  And I’m not sure if we’re terrifying yet. I need to see slightly more consistent bubble Murray from Jamal and we might be there"
I bet you don’t like Jamal Murray.
I personally don't like Jamal Murray so this clip rubbed me the wrong way 😠
Jamal Murray is not a superstar player.....PERIOD!
"Uhhh, I’m taking Jamal Murray way over Sabonis"
1. Simmons 2. Brown 3. Ingram 4. Sabonis 5. Jamal Murray 6. Siakam 7. Brogdon 8. Dejounte Murray 9. Levert 10. Beasley
Just doing the lottery:  1. Brown 2. Simmons  3. Jamal Murray 4. Ingram 5. Siakam 6. Sabonis 7. Brogdon 8. LeVert 9. Dejounte Murray 10. Hield 11. Beasley 12. Poetl 13. Zubac 14. Dunn
I'd take Ingram and maybe Jamal Murray over Simmons
Jamal Murray
You say you’re worried about “many” players over Mitchell. I’d love to hear who they are thats also on a team you think would compete with the Lakers in the west. I can think of Kawhi and possibly Jamal Murray. If you’re including big men than I guess Jokic. But with how well Mitchell has performed in big games and the playoffs he’s proven he’s a crunch time player
Yes TJ McConnell but where’s Jamal Murray?
Why is Jokic a MVP candidate when he has jamal Murray who basically does the same thing with 6 less PPG? Is that 6 extra points where we draw the line on who is considered MVP?
Jamal Murray was +16 in 44+ minutes in a playoff loss to the Lakers
"Pretty much. I feel like there’s basically be three tiers of teams.   -	one superstar like LeBron or KD and a bunch of scrubs -	Two medium stars and a meh roster around them (say like Jamal Murray and Tobias Harris or Simmons and McCollum, guys who teams won’t throw the bag at because they can’t carry by themselves)  -	One star and a good roster built around them. Could a team be successful building around, say, Middleton or Gobert or Tatum?   I think it’d be really interesting to see what team composition is the most successful. LeBron might be eating up 70% of your cap; normally ring chasing vets would come play, but other teams could easily offer five times as much to them, would they still go for cheap? I’d tend to say no."
"Typical answer, but Jamal Murray went from a promising youngster to a bucket machine these last 2 playoffs."
"Take me back to the 2016 off season before Thibs was hired. We'd have had a core of KAT, Wiggs, Lavine and Jamal Murray with Shabazz Muhammad coming off the bench.  No defence all offence"
"You’re overrating some aspects. DLO is not a top 10 pg. 10 point guards that are better than him are Curry, harden, dame, luka, Westbrook, CP3, Ben Simmons, Fox, Trae, and Jamal Murray.   Also, I very much doubt they’re going to be a top 6 team next year. That means they’ll have to be better than teams like jazz, suns, clippers, nuggets, lakers, 76ers, nets, and bucks. That just won’t happen. Timberwolves sound good on paper with KAT, DLO, and Edwards but other teams sound good on paper too. Heat for example check off basically every point that you stated. Bam is one of the best centers in the league. Butler is one of the best forwards in the league. Tyler herro was one of the best rookies as well. They have solid role players with nunn, dragic, robinson, igoudala, etc. were they a top 6 team this year? Nope. Granted they were riddled with injuries in the beginning of the year but still even when healthy I don’t think they were a top 6 team. T-Wolves have a nice big 3 but I don’t even think their big 3 is a top 10 big 3 in league for next year either. I have embiid, Simmons, and harris; giannis, middleton, and jrue; harden, Kyrie, and KD; bam, butler, and oladipo; Zion, Ingram, and lonzo; CP3, Booker, and Ayton; Jokic, Murray, and MPJ; Dame, CJ, and Powell; Steph, dray, and Klay; Lebron, AD, and Schroeder all as better big 3s"
that time against the nuggets when he turned his back on jamal murray taking a wide open 3 to wait for the rebound which never came
If they're a 2nd round exit and the Lakers and Clippers are on the opposite side of the bracket. Are the Nuggets with no Jamal Murray expected to make the conference finals? Or is Luka in just his 3rd year already expected to make conference finals already 🤔
"Keep in mind, none of the 3 are main options on the Nuggets and Gordon wasn't the main option on the Magic, Vucevic was.  Until he got injured, Jamal Murray was averaging 21.2 pts, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists.   Aaron Gordon is averaging 12.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.3 assists while playing easily the best defense on that entire Nuggets team.   Michael Porter Jr. is currently averaging 19.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.1 assists and will be an All Star next season or the season after, especially if he continues this pace."
"3 of their 4 other starters. Jamal Murray (before he got injured this year, obviously), Michael Porter Jr., and the trade deadline pickup Aaron Gordon."
You’re thinking of Jamal Murray
But Jamal Murray is the first player in NBA history.
You mentioned that if Denver had Jamal Murray they would swept Dallas. With that information I immediately knew you have no idea what you’re talking. And on what fact can you conclude that they have an advantage? Dallas is 4/2 in the last 6 matches. And I remember that Jokic was relatively neutralized in couple of those matchups. And you say they’re a bad matchup? It’s the playoffs for god sake. You won’t play versus Cleveland and Detroit-everyone is a bad matchup.
that Melo trade brought them Jamal Murray to be fair
"""I mean, that's really up to the play calls, that's really up to the coaches, who they want to put the ball in whose hands,"" Porter said. ""We kept going to [Nikola] Jokic and [Jamal Murray], and they're two amazing players, you can never get mad at that. But I just think to beat that team, we gotta get more players involved, we gotta move the ball a little bit better. We can't be predictable against that team.""  Maybe he wasn't wrong"
In the real world the NBA is a guard/wing ran league. In the real world Rudy Gobert gets ate alive by any above average guard and wing in the post season. It’s why y’all can’t get out of the first round of the playoffs. Your best defensive player is not great in space at all and when an NBA coach is given the chance to gameplay to take advantage of that y’all get smoked. Why do you think Jamal Murray was giving y’all 50 every game last year in the bubble?? Get Gobert out of the paint and he’s a liability. Every guard/wing in the league thinks that guy is food. You know who they don’t think that about?? Draymond green. Lots of guys SAY they can guard 1 through 5. There’s only one guy who actually DOES IT EVERY GAME. Good day.
"Feels like he was saying Herro doesn't have an excuse because someone else played through a worse injury. At the end of the day lingering Injuries will make players worse  They kept saying jamal Murray had a banged up elbow and shoulder for the first 2 months and I honestly just thought ahh this is typical jamal. 27 ppg player in playoffs, multiple 50 pt games etc, then back to his 18.5 in first 22 games of  regular season.   Turns out he was actually injured and playing, once he was healthy he averaged 24 on 51/46/93 splits over his last 25 games."
"I wouldn’t say so but they are pretty close.  Both are damaging scorers so it depends on do you value Russ being a better shooter (lowest of bars) and maybe a better finisher (debatable) with better rebounding and passing over Simmons much more elite defense.  For PGs I’d have Russ clearly below Steph, Kyrie, Dame, CP3, Jrue, Trae Young, Jamal Murray, and it’s debatable if he’s better than Ja Morant, Lowry, FVV, Ben Simmons, Conley, Kemba.  He falls somewhere in that range.  I’d personally have him 11th behind Lowry, Morant and Simmons but you can argue he’s better than those guys.  Ultimately it’s his efficiency tha hurts him because even his bad defense can be excused as a guard but I’d feel much better about him if he shot less and just focused on more of his awesome rebounding and playmaking."
Yes considerably   6 years in LA together   Cp3 18.8 ppg 4.2 rpg 9.8 apg 2.2 spg   3x All-NBA 1st   5x All-NBA   6x Allstar   6x all-defensive 1st   2 top 5 MVP finishes   2x assists leader   3x steals leader   Blake Griffin   21.3 ppg 8.8 rpg 4.2 apg 1 spg   4x All-NBA   5x allstar   1 top 3 MVP finish   Deandre Jordan   10.6 ppg 12 rpg .8 apg 2 bpg   1x allstar   3x All-NBA   1x All-NBA 1st   2x All-Defense   2x Rebound leader    Only  jokic is going to make it close i don't see a scenario where Jamal Murray or MPJ are any where close to Griffin or Jordan
Like when he put Jamal Murray as 5th in the DPOY race. That’s some next level click bait trolling.
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
"Barton said he thinks he'll be back in the playoffs.   But.... this is also a dude who consistently says he's about to return and then doesn't. He always believes and tells fans and the press that he's closer to 100% than he is. He's just being optimistic and keeping that competitive spirit. Murray does the same stuff, I bet this offseason Jamal will be telling people he's aiming for opening day next year."
yea it's pretty unreliable. When you got Jamal Murray Joe Harris Mike Conley top 15 but Dort LeBron Anunoby Butler and Draymond are not even top 30 it's definitely a joke. Probably at least has half of the players wrong but at least it's right having Gobert the clear #1   And Jokic has a higher DRPM than AD lol
"I know that they're nowhere near the summit of this mountain right now. But hopefully once Jamal Murray comes back from injury, the Jokic/Murray duo can work their way up this list"
"Paul George, Bradley Beal, probably Jamal Murray"
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray (albeit small sample size)
"This might be controversial... but Jamal Murray. I think Canada will remember him, but being on a team with Jokic makes things interesting. Especially if the Nuggets never win the title."
PG13 in danger of this.   Bradley Beal  Jamal Murray   Karl Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons.   Aldridge.    Donavan Mitchell  Draymond who?   Oladipo   Kemba Walker
Played 2k never liked basketball but the first time I played MyCareer on 2k17 me and Jamal Murray got drafted to the Nuggets. After looking it up Utah and Denver are pretty close to Nevada so I ended up choosing to follow Denver and I haven’t looked back since.
"that's too many ifs, you can't look at sports that way.  Curry was not the only star to miss games, theres too many variables.  Like sure if curry was healthy, your scenario could be true.  But what if lebron was healthy?  AD was healthy? Jamal Murray, mitchell, etc etc.  You cant look in a vacuum and say if this star on this team was healthy he could have done this."
I thought the nuggets defense would collapse when DPOY candidate Jamal Murray went down but turns out they have a 2nd DPOY candidate
yeah Jamal Murray was playing 21.5mpg his rookie year in 82 games and Jaylen played 17.5 in 78 games
Every conference final contestant has suffered hugely consequential health issues this season.  Bron and ad have both missed at least 20 games. Bron will likely not be 100% for the rest of the season.   Jamal Murray is out for what could be 2 seasons after playing banged up all year  Heat seem to have been the luckiest regarding injury. Herro has missed some time and so has dragic I think but nothing too crazy(as far as I remember). Butler missed a big chunk of time due to COVID though but as far as injuries it feels like he’s missed a normal amount of games.  Celtics have been banged up all year. Smart first and now brown.
"You really don’t see how the Lakers bucks Celtics Raptors etc didn’t have a huge disadvantage from bubble and how the heat benefitted from that same scenario? It’s not that hard of a concept  It’s one thing to hit huge shots in the bubble, it’s another to do it in TD Garden in game 5.   You have to atleast wonder how TJ Warren, Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell etc were putting up MJ/Lebron stats in playoff games last year and maybe think the bubble has affected gameplay"
and we still punked yall AND jamal murray had a better postseason run 😂🤣🤣🤣
"Of the 2016 draft class, Jaylen Brown is #1 in total games played (398). Buddy Hield in 2nd with 383.  In terms of minutes, Jaylen Brown is #2 in the class (11,083) behind only Jamal Murray (11,645)."
Why not the person (jokic) that encompasses all of those qualifications?   The nuggets have a better record than the bucks and 3 games away from the 76ers. They are also in the west so they play the tougher teams more often. Jamal Murray went down and they still have been above .500. Also jokic stats are historic. Last comparable mvp was Russell Westbrook and jokic has a much much higher efficiency.
"Let us not get ahead of ourselves. I don't mind losing as long as the players give it their all. I mean it would still hurt but you know what I mean.  The West is always a bloodbath but even more so this year, shame Jamal Murray got hurt.  🙏"
"Yeah all that is circumstantial dude. We’re talking about talent and potential not accomplishments at a certain age lol. Durant was the number one option on a bad team. MPJ is on a well structured offense with an MVP level player, and Jamal Murray. He doesn’t get as many shot attempts as KD had but since he became the second option he’s averaging 25 on insane efficiency.   Their accomplishments at 22 don’t determine whether MPJ can reach KDs level, this is MPJs second season. He just became a starter lol.  KD at 22 did more than Larry Bird at 22"
"""Nick wrong lol"" - Jamal Murray"
"I said without Durant.   And Bron honestly only had 1 good game against Denver for his standards, which was game 5. In the game 2,3 and 4 4th quarters he was shooting awfully and had hella turnovers. He was getting outplayed by Jamal Murray in games 3 and 4 especially"
Sure Jamal Murray is good but we are comparing him to LeBron fucken James
"You might want to look at the Nuggets injuries the second half of the season... it's really only been Jokic and MPJ. 90% of their guards are injured and their basically signing guys off the street to play significant minutes. Will Barton, PJ Dozier, Monte Morris and Jamal Murray have all been gone. Campazzo is literally their third best player now and I'm not even exaggerating. He's even out playing Gordon( who also missed time)"
Did you see bubble Jamal Murray? That was a top 5 player during that run
" &gt;you're doing what you're accusing others of smh  how?? asia has no collective culture. it's a continent. jamal murray is technically half asian then. middle east is a region not a continent. also, there are dozens of ethnicities in the middle east... there are black people, brown people, white people, and people with asiatic features in the middle east."
That trade landed Denver the pick that would become Jamal Murray
I had no idea Jamal Murray was half Arabic.
"That Jamal Murray injury, it would have been a way better playoffs to have him in it."
"This def flagrant 2 worthy imo, but the dudes on here working overtime trying to pin Luka as a dirty player over this single incident are hilarious. If he had a history of it I'd be down for it but he doesn't so trying to compare it to someone like Pat Bev makes no sense. I'm curious on if they consider Jamal Murray a dirty player for his nut shot earlier in the season too if that's all it takes."
"Zaza had an even worse reputation than Draymond my dude, and deservedly so. Not a race thing.  Jamal Murray did something like this to Hardaway earlier this season and nobody calls him dirty either, because he’s not."
yes luka hit sexton’s groin area. that’s usually an obvious flagrant 2. same call happened to jamal murray earlier this season.
It’s kinda like earlier this season where Jamal Murray inadvertently hit Tim Hardaway Jr. in the nuts and got ejected
"&gt;You think the West was better last year? What?  Yes. Did you not read it correctly?   &gt;Utah got way better. The Nuggets got better. The Clippers gained experience and got better. The Suns made a huge leap forward. Dallas got better. Portland are comparable.  Utah improved but still isn’t a real threat. The nuggets are considerably worse because Murray is out for the year. The clippers improved but they were still a title contender last year. The Suns improved but still aren’t a threat. Dallas didn’t really get better, I’d argue they’re the same but Luka is just more experienced. Yeah, Portland is about the same. They’re just healthy.   The west was better last year. This year is just deeper with teams who have no chance of winning.   &gt;Of the contending teams really just the Lakers and Rockets got worse, and I'd argue that all of the West's top 5 teams this season are better than last year's Rockets who never looked likely to go far with Westbrick.  Ah the Lakers, the defending champs who raped the western conference last year...just the Lakers lol. The nuggets got considerably worse, that’s the two WCF finalists last year.   &gt;This Western conference is in the top 10% or so of conferences all time. Super deep with at least 5 if not 6 contenders.  There’s one contender in the west right now and it’s the Clippers. The Lakers will be the biggest threat if they get rolling though. Nobody else in the west is a real contender   5 to 6 contenders? Lmfao that’s delusional. Even if you argued Phoenix and Utah were contenders (they’re not) that’s the absolute max at 4. There’s no way you can say the Mavericks/Blazers and the Jamal Murray-less nuggets are title contenders. You have delusional expectations for what a title contender is, that’s why you’ll be crying when the jazz get exposed.   &gt;The Hawks had noone as impactful as Mitchell, Gobert, or even Conley. That team had literally zero players who had ever scored 30 in a playoff game going into those playoffs. Utah has a player that has done in 9 times in just three years. Utah also has an all time great defender.  It was a joke dude holy shit lmao take a deep breath. Both teams are just regular season wonders who will get exposed in the playoffs."
"The deal is though is unless they are playing the Jazz…Pretty much all the teams they could potentially, be going up against are at 💯 strength.  It won’t be like the bubble where the blazers, rockets, and nuggets were either missing crucial players or finding out one of the crucial players was dealing with a bad injury (in regards to Jamal Murray) so they couldn’t play at full strength."
Jokic plays in a tougher conference and has played a lot of those games without Jamal Murray. It's still jokic
"Are you nuts? They’ve missed half a season each...  Jamal Murray will have missed 24 games by the end (1/3rd of the season)  Oh Porzingis isnt even good anymore? That’s just bonus points for my argument lol  Says a lot about the state of the league when your 2 main competitors are the fucking Grizzlies led by a sophomore, and the negative record Spurs  Such quality"
"Lebron and Davis have been absent for like half the season.  Harden isnt out west anymore, and neither is KD, or Westbrook.   The Blazers have been missing Nurkic and CJ for SIGNIFICANT parts of the season.  The Mavs have been missing Porzingis.  Paul George and Kawhi have been taking turns resting.  The Jazz dont have Mitchell.  Jamal Murray is out for the season.  Unsurprisingly, the top 2 teams in the West are the only ones with non-significant injuries.  Not to mention the fact that this is a shorter season (each game missed means more), and they've introduced play-ins to benefit teams like GSW, New Orleans, and Washington.  &gt; maybe I will change my mind.  Soemthing tells me you wont change your opinion regardless of the information you receive."
"Curry's season &gt; Jokic's season individually don't even try to make the case. Jokic is winning it bc of team success, the warriors this season lost a hall of famer, not jamal murray who's never been an all star."
remember 4 weeks ago when Jamal Murray tore his acl playing garbage time?   I do. Steve Kerr does.
Voters are still going to remember that Jamal Murray has been out for this last stretch of the season
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
Unlucky. Jamal Murray injury starts to show in big games. Still proud of this team this season. Hopefully we can make big noise in the playoffs regardless
mpj is better right now than jamal murray has ever been. 66% TS!!
"Feel bad for Denver losing Murray. They can still go far in the playoffs, but it will be a lot harder without Jamal."
"A ton. Devin Booker, DeJounte Murray, Jamal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas to name a few."
"Idk about that. They've been incredible regular season games for sure.  But, with no Jamal Murray, Bogey playing back at his pre-wrist surgery level, &amp; a (presumably) healthy Conley &amp; Mitchell, I just don't think Denver has enough to hang with Utah in a series."
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
"The mutual respect both teams have for each other is beautiful. I remember back when the Rudy COVID ordeal occurred, Jamal Murray was one of the very few players that gave his well-wishes to Rudy."
"&gt; Lakers are injured, Denver is not.  LOL, Jamal Murray tearing his ACL isn't an injury in your book.  Ok bro.  Thanks for confirming my point.    As an aside, if a bench warmer had an ACL tear on LeBron's team, we'd hear about until the end of the season as such a tragic and injurious loss to the poor underdogs that, again, LeBron is always on.  Hell, I remember people droning on and on about Mike Miller being injured during the Heatles years."
"Idk.  I feel like a lot of those guys were great because they were unique and one of a kind for their era.  It’s easier to stand out when no one is li,e you.  Maybe Kirilenko would be phenomenal because a wing with legit rim protecting ability of a center still is rare these days, but his offense wouldn’t be as good.  Odom is another who wouldn’t look as good because we have so many 4s who can handle and play make these days and his shooting wasn’t good enough to stand out.  He might be a great center in today’s game though, but defensively he wouldn’t hold up as well either.  Raja Bell is a great one if he just played d and shot 10 3s a game.  Mike Bibby would probably be awesome with his shooting and pick and roll ability.  He’d be great in the handoff game.  But we already have Jamal Murray who is a superior version of Bibby.  Quintin Richardson is someone especially in his one PHX year that actually was a legit 3 and d guy before he forgot how to play defense with the Knicks."
I'd believe this if they hadn't lost Jamal Murray
"I know it's been said a million times, but Jamal Murray getting a torn ACL is tragic. Y'all really deserved better. At least MVP Nikola Jokic is working hard to keep the dream alive."
"You should fucking thank us trash ass team for drafting a trash ass player like Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray, else your ass would have been in the same dumpster tier as ours."
"Whole point of his video is that talking about Jokic and the Nuggets does NOT bring in ratings. He’s put his end goal right there for all of us to see, if we didn’t already know it: Ratings  So what does he do? Makes a video while sitting in his car that looks like he really truly believes in the point he’s making about Jokic. Maybe he does or doesn’t, it doesn’t matter. People are talking about it. Jamal Murray replying is the best possible thing Nick Wright could ask for, other than Jokic himself calling Wright out.  Say what you will about Nick Wright, but he’s doing his job pretty well."
JFC now they’re all Jamal Murray. They just don’t miss
"zion aint a good example of young all star level, hes more like all nba and a franchise guy.  try someone like jamal murray or jaylen brown, its still probably the all star level guy though"
Nuggets are missing 4 guards all starters at some point including Jamal Murray and Barton. Dont complain about backcourt issues.
"Jamal Murray: ""Just quit bruh u sound more of a fool than u did the day before""  Average /r/nfl user: ""Can someone translate this into English for me? I have no idea what he's trying to say."""
"If anyone is bubble boy, it’s 100% Jamal Murray."
"Yeah, how are people missing this entirely? AD was already a great playoff performer in the limited games we saw of him with the Pelicans. Stick him on a team alongside LeBron James and it's not so ridiculous that he'd be even better with the best spacing of his career AND having improved in two years. He's one of the most talented two way players in the league, how is it unthinkable that he'd be able to take his game to another level when healthy AND playing alongside one of the greatest of all time?   Unless he's literally playing in the same exact circumstances, you can't just go off a spreadsheet when making a conclusion like the OP. Anthony Davis shot incredibly well throughout the postseason, but it's not like it was some extreme outlier ala Jamal Murray for the Nuggets."
"If you recall correctly, the Warriors GM was fuckin crying on the stage and blaming himself. Everyone knew that they were pushing KD for an early comeback, and look at what happened. The Warriors should have simply not played him at all. I’m not saying this because it would have been an easier season for the Raps or some shit, I’m saying it because NBA fans lost out on a healthy KD all this time. It was a BAD management decision, no wonder KD left. The same type of thing happened to the Nuggets and Jamal Murray this season when he should have been resting a while longer. You’re editing and adding to your comment, I’m responding to your original comment. Yeah, I don’t think anyone was beating the Raps that year with the way things were going that post season. It was miraculous and it was truly historic. The NBA needed a team like the Raptors to win because people are sick of the super teams. You don’t gotta believe in fate, idgaf about the downvotes but yeah no one was beating the Raps that year. The Warriors were overplaying their players, when you do that you are more liable to injuries. You casual NBA fans don’t realize how great of a defensive team the 2019 Raptors were. Reality is; that we didn’t get the opportunity to see a completely healthy Warriors team with KD play the Raptors so we will just never know. But we do know that Klay played 5/6 games (the majority) and the Warriors won chips without KD. The Raps beat Steph, Klay and Draymond. Take that how you will."
"Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Ben Simmons, Myles Turner. Two guys who are great ball handlers in Murray and Simmons, great scorers in Booker and Murray, and some lockdown defense from Bridges, Simmons, and Turner."
Tbf both of those teams were blown up or missed key players for huge stretches (i.e curry out majority of the szn)  The teams OP listed will have all their key guys for playoffs with the  he exception of nuggets missing jamal murray and potentially some role players
But what about jamal murray snapchat game?
"&gt;I’m skeptical with the way that AD’s been playing that he’s going to re create it. He’s heavier and less mobile than last year and his shot hasn’t looked anywhere near what it did in the bubble.   This year, thats probably fair analysis. Hes been super injured this year and hasnt looked the same as he did in past regular seasons  &gt;1 playoff run is too small a sample size. If we go by that then Jamal Murray should be the next face of the NBA. If AD can do it again this year then there’s a pattern.  This I don't agree with. Players tend to get better and add skills to their repertoire as they approach their peak. There is no reason to believe AD cant shoot around league average from 3."
I’m skeptical with the way that AD’s been playing that he’s going to re create it. He’s heavier and less mobile than last year and his shot hasn’t looked anywhere near what it did in the bubble.   1 playoff run is too small a sample size. If we go by that then Jamal Murray should be the next face of the NBA. If AD can do it again this year then there’s a pattern.
"A PG lines up at the 1 position and primarily guards the opposing team's PG. That is the criteria. While LeBron does line up at the 1 from time to time, this is not his nateral position and he often does not guard the opposing team's PG, especially against younger quicker guards.  You can call LeBron a ""point forward"" but he is not a guard. You don't have to be the team's primary facilitator to be a PG. Steph and Jamal Murray are great examples of PGs who function more as scorers in their respective offenses than facilitators. Racking up assists does not make you a PG. Otherwise, we'd have to consider Jokic, DeRozen, Sabonis, Draymond, Giannis, ect. as point guards, which I don't think anybody here would."
no that's Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray is one of the most underrated players in the league. Other guards like Mitchell, Fox, Booker, Trae, etc get way more love on this sub and constantly ranked higher. Jamal is better than most if not all of them."
" 5)  All nba for guards this year is easier to make than last year.  Harden is a shoe in every year until this year because of injuries and a bunch of star gaurds like Kyrie, Jamal Murray, Pg13, Kyrie, Kemba, Ben Simmons all miss 10 plus games in an already shortened season.  Also an all nba regular Russel Westbrook is having a down year by his standards and isnt a top 8 team in his conference for the first time in forever.    At the start of the year if you told me cp3 would play more gsmes then all those players i listed i wouldn't have believed you.  Having said that Lowry deserved 3rd team all nba last year IMO, but I do think CP3 2021 is a better player than 2020 lowry personally."
The jazz are as good as Denver WITH Jamal Murray. You remember they beat us by  2 points in game 7 while we were missing our second leading scorer the entire series
"Yeah, consistency is the last thing to come. It's why Jamal Murray is an All Star level talent but not a superstar like Dame. Both can give you 50+ on a good day. But which can consistently give you 25+ and which might have days where they give you 18 on poor efficiency?   I think this is going to be a huge off-season for him personally working with Sam and having a full off-season where he isn't rehabbing."
I believe it's a Jamal Murray leaked dick pic joke
Jamal murray? This some leg injury joke?
*calls Jamal Murray*
"I've decided that you aren't an NBA star until you get name checked. Donovan Mitchell? Not a star. Mo Bamba? Star. Jamal Murray? Not a star. Lou Will? Mega star because it was Drake.  Giannis hadn't truly made it until Nicki and Wayne name checked him (and Weezy didn't even use Giannis, he managed to rhyme with Antetokounmpo)"
"You never know, it’s never to late to pop off in the league. he just dropped like 25 for nuggets, with Jamal Murray out he might be a contributor during their playoff run"
"But it’s such a shitty argument for showing who the better scorer is, Jamal Murray has more 50 point playoff games then both kd and kobe so does that mean he’s the better scorer now?"
"Lol if you wanna talk defense how can you not talk about Lebron shutting down westbrook and jamal murray? Lebron was a beast defensively last year especially during the playoffs. AD still played solid defense but nothing spectacular or DPOY-level during the playoffs. I would say that Lebron was as important to the defense as AD was.  Even if Lebron jumps from team to team, I think it's pretty obvious the common denominator is him. He's always been the crucial, most important piece on all of his teams I think this is universally agreed upon. Yes, he usually needs at least a second super star but which team that have won a championships havent had at least 2 superstars on it?  Sure every player deserves credit, but I think its pretty obvious that Lebron deserves the most credit lol. But I also dont see what that have to do when comparing the importance of AD vs Lebron"
Man Denver is having a cursed season Jamal Murray now Porter Jr.
1. Luka 2. Jokic 3. CP3 4. Jamal Murray 5. Seth Curry
Jamal Murray of course
"To be honest, for the hype, quite a bust.. even Jamal Murray has done more"
"It’s really simple maths. 8 teams were not invited to the Bubble, they got plenty of rest time, add to that the 6 teams that did not make it to the playoffs. So 14 teams out of 30, got a pretty long offseason. They were not going to give up a chunk of their salary for the teams that made deep run into the playoffs.   The teams that got bounced out of the first round also got a decent offseason (3.5 months), you can add them too. That’s roughly 75% of the league. Now on the best team you also had player who made vet min, or low salary (for NBA standard) and they did not get much playing time during the postseason. It’s safe to say that 80% of the league was not on the same page with LeBron.  It sucks for LBJ, AD, Jamal Murray, Kawhi or Butler but that’s how democracy works."
Jamal Murray was out with a torn ACL earlier this season as well. The Nuggets sure needed him this postseason.
Jamal Murray
"Lmao anyone who'd take Ben Simmons over Jamal Murray must be a crackhead. Murry is a baller, Ben is a stinker."
PG bout to get that Jamal Murray Glizzy Gawk Gawk Gladiator 3000 tonight
"There was a thread before the season started asking to rank these players in order: Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons. I was shocked that my ranking in that order was controversial."
How so?  Is extra rest going to prevent kyrie Irving from falling awkwardly and spraining his ankle??  Is the extra rest going to prevent Jamal Murray from landing on one leg and injured his ACL?  Jaylen Brown landed on his wrist after getting fouled. Had season ending surgery. Can these thing be prevented with rest?  These injuries are Accidents that happen when playing a game. Yeah we don’t talk about other guys on non playoff teams cause they aren’t the ones playing right now.
Jamal Murray is also a borderline all star. Trae ain't better than Murray.
Jamal Murray is waaayyy better than Ben that would be a downgrade for them
Jamal Murray is a much better player than Simmons.
"Jamal Murray is a far better player, IMO. First of all he shows up when it matters, and is an absolute killer in the playoffs. Generally very clutch. Varied offensive arsenal and great 2 man game with Jokic. Won't get shut down by the esteemed defensive stalwarts of Lou Will and Trae Young"
Yes  I'm done with pretending defense is about as equal in worth as offense. Jamal Murray would be better
Jamal Murray scored 50 points twice in a playoff series to save their season. Embiid would kill to have anyone on his team be able to do that
Jamal Murray is a better player
Got the same for saying I’d easily take Jamal Murray over him.   Not even close after this series.
Him and giannis are just taller and more athletic versions of draymond. They work well when they are asked to be the defensive anchor and point forward. You cant ask them to score for you in big moments though. They would look much better if they were next to a donovan mitchell or jamal murray type of guard.
Oh you mean they beat a half strength Lakers? And a jamal murray-less nuggets? Oh and chris Paul's out for a little bit lol
How the fuck is fox and ant there but not Jamal Murray
"Had Jamal Murray been there, we would be looking at a much different series."
Press F to pay your respects to Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard
"Kawhi and Kyrie suffered in-game injuries. So did Lebron, who wasn't load-managing (i.e. not worried about over-use) prior to his injury. Harden has a bad hamstring - he came into training camp in poor shape, part of trying to force a trade. Is anyone really surprised that this is lingering on for him?  You call me dense, but what exactly is your argument here?  NBA basketball comes with the risk of leg injuries. Kyrie came down on Giannis' foot and rolled his ankle. The same thing that happened to Donovan Mitchell. The same thing that happened to Ja Morant in the 2nd game of the season.  Kawhi bumped knees with Joe Ingles. Joel Embiid landed awkwardly.   These are natural basketball injuries. You cannot blame the schedule for them.  Yes, Jamal Murray hurt his ACL on a non-contact play, and AD seemed to have an over-use injury. They are two of the more injury-prone players in the league. I don't really think you should point to those two and say ""SEE, WE KNEW IT!"""
What agenda does Jamal Murray have
Bruh what ?   Jamal Murray - WCF   James Harden - 2nd round   Kawhi - 2nd round   Embiid - 2nd round   Lebron and AD - Finals   Brown and Smart - ECF   Conley and Mitchell - First round   Can you spot the trend here ?
LeBron was the first option but so much attention was focused on him that the second option became the de-facto first option. Like Jamal Murray in the Jazz series.
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
Jamal Murray is the true head collector
Jamal Murray sucks
"Hope you’re happy Adam Silver. Lebron, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, CP3, etc. etc.  Just had to rush back didnt ya"
"It's definitely not a joke. This is his first year back from a fucking Achilles tear, and he missed most of the regular season with a calf injury. Do we *really* want him having to play full 48 minute games with no rest?  We're already missing Jamal Murray for most of next year behind this bullshit, and now possibly Kawhi as well. Who else needs to be sacrificed? How smart is it for Embiid to keep playing on that knee?"
"Lebron isn't right though. These players had hella time off in the middle of last season and didn't even complete a full season when they came back. Why would they need a full offseason?    Kawhi and Embiid have known injury history with their knees, Anthony Davis is injury prone, Lebron got his ankle destroyed by Solomon Hill, Kyrie landed the wrong way. Those injuries have nothing to do with the offseason. I don't know the details of Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown's injuries. The only injury I can contribute to the offseason is Harden's because he is an ironman."
Lebron’s injury was not overuse related.  AD has been injured for 10 years now. Jimmy Butler always misses games.   One guy on the Celtics? One guy on the Nuggets? Most teams have a guy suffer a serious injury every year. Jamal Murray in particular has missed huge amounts of time with leg injuries the last couple years. Not surprising to see him suffer a major leg injury.  This really isn’t that telling.
"This is the worst NBA season ever. So many injuries and season ending injuries, from Jamal Murray to now Kawhi Leonard.  Hopefully this is a lesson to people in NBA management that this type of condensed schedule should not be repeated."
"cool tidbit:    Bridges is one of the league’s most versatile defenders, with the physical tools to match up with players at all four perimeter positions. He was the highest vote getter not to make an All-Defensive Team and is the tip of the spear of a top-10 defense. There were no off nights for him this season. [His top five most frequent assignments](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628969/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) were Brandon Ingram, Damian Lillard, Jamal Murray, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry. "
When we all think of the true legendary stars of the NBA today the first few players that come to mind are Mike Conley and Jamal Murray.   Oh wait they don't? They are just extremely good players that play a vital role to their playoff team?   Huh...
"Fellow Nuggets fan living in northern CO here, but Imma play devils advocate and say that the Suns were lucky that Jamal Murray ended his season early lol."
This is what its like when Jamal Murray is on fire!
All the guys who are injured were injury prone anyway except for Jamal Murray but that type of play happens and Harden who is paying the price for the extra weight he's carrying.
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
"Man…  Cp3 out with covid, Kawhi possibly out with an acl injury, Embiid with a torn meniscus, Jamal murray acl tear, Klay with the Achilles rupture just before the season, and both Bron and AD hobbled by injuries through the regular season into the playoffs. This season…is this enough blood for you commissioner? What more do you want?"
"Klay, Jamal Murray"
"Yep, it's 100% due to the shortened off-season. And notice how the players who went deep in the playoffs last year either got hurt late in the season or in the first round (Jaylen Brown, AD, LeBron, Jamal Murray), and now we're seeing the guys who were eliminated in the second round last year get hurt (Kawhi and Harden)? I can't help but wonder how many other injuries we're gonna see as these playoffs continue. Let's hope we don't see any truly career-altering injuries so we can just get past this madness without totally screwing over next year as well.   Oh wait, this off-season is going to be almost as short as last year's was! 🤦"
"The Hawks not being in the bubble and succeeding is literally furthering my point. They had more than a full offseason of rest and are now overachieving.   Entire teams’ season were shifted due to large portions of the team’s players missing time, Boston/Miami/Toronto come to mind, Tatum and others struggled from coming back with Covid, Embiid’s injury likely cost him the MVP, Jamal Murray went down as the season was nearing an end, Kawhi missed significant time and is out again, and LeBron and AD were both injured and likely cost a trip to the finals.   This isn’t a regular season, and pretending the shortened offseason has nothing to do with the amount of injuries we’re seeing is just wild."
"True to form, these playoffs will really be a war of attrition.   AD, KCP, Donte, CP3, Doncic, Embiid, Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Robert Williams, Ibaka.   Even the players who were out previously or recently injured, Lebron, Tank Bryant, Oladipo, Spida, Jamal Murray.  Now Kawhi could be out. Harden, Kyrie, Embiid, Conley have lingering issues. CP3 Covid-positive."
Idk I think if either the jazz or clippers without Kawhi get through they have to be the favorites as long as Conley is out.  Then if they make it to the finals an injured Embiid against Ayton or hobbled Harden and Kyrie is also a great matchup   That and not having to beat Anthony Davis and Jamal Murray seems like it’s shaping up to be the most fortunate playoff run ever.   Yes he might miss a game or two but if I’m the suns I take that
"I thought you were talking later in the season when Utah was getting pushed by Phoenix. I don't think them passing Utah right after Utah gets first is meaningful.  Comparing Conley to Schroeder is a bit ridiculous. Wasn't the concencus that he was hugely dissapointing?  He looked awful in the playoffs. Schroeder is closer to someone like Bogdanovic (Utah one) than he is to Conley.  I wouldnt argue that you take Conley over Harden, Kawhi, AD, etc. But he is still a top 30 or so player and a big loss to a tem in the playoffs. He is a better player than Jamal Murray imo, though I'm sure his ceiling is not close to what Murray did in the first round last year."
"Literally made the all star team this year after multiple injuries c’mon man lol. Jaylen brown made an all star team this year - what? He made it as a reserve - not as an injury replacement either.   Jamal Murray showed up in the playoffs. I consider him the breakout player from last year’s playoffs. He’s inconsistent as hell during the regular season tho. If you don’t want to include him above, you don’t have to. Conley is not in that class of guys.   Look at it this way. Who says no if you offered Conley straight up for any of the guys I mentioned? I think everyone says no to y’all. Do you say no to any of them?"
Did everyone forget Jamal Murray?
I got downvoted for saying injuries suck about Jamal Murray smh
"Kawhi got injured in game 4 though. Most of the rest of the injuries in the playoffs have been contact injuries. Only big name that has really been lost due to regular season grind is Jamal Murray, no?"
They cant keep zooming in on KD's head. I keep getting flashbacks of Jamal Murray getting sucked off
Jamal Murray
I look at Kevin Durant’s head and all I see is Jamal Murray.
"As the great Charles Barkley once said, ""If my Aunt had stones, she'd be my uncle.""  If you're talking about Luka, Donovan, Trae, Jamal Murray (not saying he was able to, but the team has a bright future,) then yeah, I agree. But, dear fucking god. KD? Harden? Kyrie? Saying ""fuck it! we'll be healthy next year!"" is about the dumbest thing a basketball player or fan could say. And that's not even a knock on them. KD and Harden are really old by basketball standards. Kyrie is entering his 30s. Age/mileage/injury history doesn't magically improve in your second decade in the NBA."
Luka Trae Tatum Mitchell and Zion if he stays healthy. Jamal Murray is another one who merits inclusion.
Imagine had the 76ers drafted Jamal Murray. He would have fit so much better.
In one fucking game in overtime no less. Jesus christ you guys are so fucking stupid. Using this logic Jamal Murray could probably be considered a hall of famer because he went super nova during 2 playoff games.
"? I dont give a fuck about jokic. I just understand basketball and that if Jamal Murray was in the series, the nuggets probably win, or at least take it to 7. My team hasn't made the playoffs in 3 years.  The sixers are playing with their full, healthy roster barely getting past a 3rd year point guard.   Embiid is overrated."
Jamal Murray getting healthy   /thread
I hate his game as a Sixers fan. He’s the only PG in the league who brings the ball up and turns sideways to pass every time. Sometimes he doesn’t look at the basket as if that isn’t the objective of the game. He’s a good playmaker but if he could shoot/ create it would open the floor for everyone. His aggression isn’t even there. Giannas avg 25+ ppg and he can’t shoot. But he’s aggressive in attacking the paint. Simmons was compared to Lebron (Mistake) &amp; has yet to avg more than 16 going on year 5 smh. We drafted him#1 overall the same year Murray came out. Calapari said he’d be the best player in the draft I got killed for telling local radio stations we should draft Jamal Murray we need a guard who can shot create and shoot to space the floor for Joel.
Jamal Murray
Clippers would be favorites. It’s funny that everyone is forgetting Jamal Murray is out. And they beat LA without AD
hawks need DA. he had impactful plays last series so him being out is almost the same as jamal murray being out
He was never an all star but Jamal Murray belongs on this list
I believe you need at least 2 seasons of superstar level production to be a superstar. Jamal Murray averaged 30+ in the first round but I wouldn't call him a superstar.
"If there’s no AD and no Donovan Mitchell and no Jamal Murray and no Harden and no Kyrie blah blah blah injuries happen, taking risks on great players who get injured is part of the game. The hypotheticals and the imaginary alternate universe of what team should have won doesn’t exist"
I swear were better then this.....except your the lakers or in a jamal murray jersey...
Most of the top teams do hve two all stars. Mitchell and gobert. Booker and cp3. Davis and lebron. Kawhi and pg. Tatum and brown. Nets obviously. Simmons and Embiid. The only contender that might not have a second all star was the Denver nuggets with Jamal Murray just not making the cut.
My man chose to protect his jersey over his head. Real Jamal Murray fan right here.
There wouldn't have even been a window if AD and Jamal Murray are healthy lol
the window is this year because anthony davis was injured and then jamal murray and now the nets are completely broken when they were looking to be the finals matchup you'd have if you got past clippers or jazz.
(Not in any order): 1.Dame 2.steph 3. Trae  4.Luka  5.kemba 6. Lowry 7. Ben Simmons  8. Brogdon 9. Jamal Murray 10. Kyrie 11. Paul 12. Ja morant 13. Mike Conley 14. Lamelo ball 15. Jrue holiday  16. Shai Alexander  16. Fox &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Westbrook
You just don't trade a guy like Luka so it's almost not even worth asking. He's still on his rookie contract for 2 more seasons and then he's a restricted free agent.    And there is literally no trade haul you can offer almost that makes any sense. The top players in the league and rookie's are always underpaid.  So even if you got multiple young players who are even all-star caliber (i.e. Jamal Murray) you wouldn't be getting as much bang for your buck. and there's no picks you can really offer that would be remotely worth it.  I honestly just can't imagine a situation where there's a trade haul with equal value to him.
"Again, 22 and 24. Jokic is 26. They can afford to wait one season for Jamal, trading for Lillard on the super max is extremely shortsighted. Plus Lillard is a sieve himself on defense. I don’t think that a healthy Lillard makes this team better than a health Murray and Porter do, so really it’s just while Murray is injured (which might just be for the regular season anyways).  If the Nuggets really wanted to go all in for a season or two, they should wait until Murray is healthy instead of trading him at a low point in his value.  Sorry I know the Blazers would love this deal, but I don’t see it happening."
Not sure Jamal Murray is enough to make up for a sweep but you do you buddy
He was playing like one before getting hurt and was easily one of the best players in all of the playoffs last year.    The injury plagued start (first month of the season) to his year masked how good he was this season while healthy-- basically 23/5/5 on 50/44/90 between the start of February and mid-April...  The fact that I am being so heavily down voted right now shows how underrated he is on here.  Murray is far closer to Mitchell/ Booker than Nurk is anywhere to being the level of player Jamal is.
I’m still just shocked the nuggets got swept. I know Jamal Murray being out weighed heavily on the team but I thought jokic and MPJ would ball the fuck out. Oh well I guess. Denver put up one hell of a run this season…
"Jamal Murray will take the leap next year or the year after, assuming he comes back from his injury at 90+%"
Put Jamal Murray on this team and the results are a lot different
"Lol, but i thought Jamal Murray meant nothing to the team? At least that's what the band wagon fans were saying since his injury.  Bye bye jokic, better luck next time!"
And i guess frustration as well on what could have been for this season had jamal murray not gotten hurt.
"&gt;I understand everything that was going on but I still want him to run back on defense.   Again, you're not being realistic tho and you know you're not. The guy couldn't even take breather for a minute without his team giving up a 7-0 run. It's comments like this where people show how unrealistic their expectations are and refusing to admit it.  &gt;If you are on the court I don't think there is really a good excuse to make your team play 4v5 for a whole possession.  So again, you're telling me you wanted LeBron to defend Ayton on defense. Bring the ball up on offense, drive and kick the basketball for his teammates to miss a shot. Then switch on defense and defend Booker. Bring the ball up *again* on offense. Drive the basket to the hoop and get a basket. Run back on defense and guard either Ayton or Booker *again*. Bring the ball up on offense. Post up on the block to get your teammates an open shot for them to miss.  He has no AD to guard Ayton to take the pressure off of to relieve him of offense. So he's just supposed to do everything like he's some spry LeBron without miles on his body, right?  Did you watch the bubble when he guarded Jamal Murray for some possessions but he actually had Rondo to bring the ball up and initiate the offense, so he was able to expend energy of the defensive end because he wasn't also working on the offensive end. He didn't have that.  Seriously mann, you people expectations versus realism is severely lacking and it makes it where you guys can't even be objective when viewing something.  If you saw him literally gasses when he checked out and you still saying, ""I wanted him to run back on defense..."" then you choose not to understand how tired he truly was...but hey, anything to feed any negative view about LeBron tho.  We've seen him play full quarters without being taken out. He did that in the whole 2016 Finals run without Kyrie and Love but since he was the whole offense, they had him guard Iggy...so he took off in defense then but basketball fans knew why he was. Without Kyrie and Love he couldn't play both sides 100%. Same thing here, Without AD he couldn't play both sides, either you want him on defense guarding Ayton and Booker or you want him on the offensive end, which one?  The unfortunate truth is that at 36 he can't give it to you on both ends...but whatever. The expectations are so high for the guy that he can't win. Even in 2018, where he singlehandedly carried the Cavs to the Finals, he took plays off because he was only source of the offense. This isn't new so I don't get why people are acting like it was...but again it's LeBron so gotta trash the guy."
With Jamal Murray? And PJ Dozier.  This is a long series
He almost paid homage to the late Jamal Murray
&gt;Has there ever been a player whose had a larger positive impact on any team's culture than Chris Paul?  Anthony Davis and Jamal Murray not playing have had as big an impact on the Suns as Cp3.
"Yes.  It not only would add Murray, but it would just help our entire rotation immensely.  Everyone was essentially playing a role they are not really supposed to be or are used to playing.  Murray is amazing in and of himself but it also just had to change the way everyone played and all of our rotations.  We are an entirely different team with Jamal."
Probably thinking of Dejounte Murray not Jamal Murray
"The Denver Nuggets were 13-3 before the playoffs and were playing some of their best basketball WITHOUT MURRAY. Though I do agree that they would definitely be a much better team with Murray, it wasnt as if they were a lottery team before the playoffs, especially after they got Aaron Gordon.  Fans should just appreciate what the Suns have done:  ""The Suns are in the midst of one of the most dominant stretches in recent playoff memory. They are the only team to take a 20-point lead in 5 straight playoff games in the last 25 seasons. They've led by double-digits 58% of the time during that span.""  7 straight playoff wins by an Average of DOUBLE DIGITS IN THE PLAYOFFS should be impressive regardless of who they were playing. The fact that they did it over the defending champs with one of the best defenses on the NBA even without one of AD or LeBron and a sweep over the no 3 team in the West with this year's MVP amd one of the best records going into the playoffs WITHOUT JAMAL MURRAY, is something that should be recognized and not placed with quotation marks or labelled ""mickey mouse"" etc...the Suns are playing beautiful basketball right now and I hope the next generation of basketball youngsters get to learn from these Suns because thats how basketball should be played...  Heres to the Suns first Championship :-) Go Suns!!!!"
"Especially since having Jamal out there opens the game for the rest of the guys. That’s one more threat you gotta always pay attention to, making Jokic, Barton, MPJ, etc. much more dangerous.   That Jokic-Murray 2 man game was also damn near unstoppable"
Are you fucking serious?  You don’t think a team starting Campazzo and the ghost of Morris/Barton wouldn’t have been more competitive with Jamal Murray?
Lol with a small sample size for losers anyone can look good 🤣 Jamal Murray was better no?
"They're obviously legit. Very nice offense, shooters everywhere, and above average defenders at every position. But CP3's injury is not comparable to both James and Davis being injured, and Davis actually missing games. CP3 played every game.  More importantly, Cam Payne is a better replacement for CP3 than Facu for Jamal Murray and whoever the hell is supposed to backup Ad on the Lakers."
"A fully fit and firing on all cylinders Jamal Murray changes the landscape of these playoffs entirely for the Nuggets.  I’m not saying they definitely would have won, but it would have played out very differently..."
We are just going to pretend Jamal Murray actually played lol. Insert Murray in this series and remove Booker and where are we right now?
"I'm not saying Nugs win, but with Jamal at least their entire offense isn't played through Joker. If Joker doesn't touch the ball for them, they hardly score. With Murray it's different."
Yeah I absolutely think so. Denver’s offense goes so stale against good defenses when they don’t have Jamal to play the 2 man game with Jokic. The games got out of hand when the suns started clamping down and the nuggets couldn’t find reliable shots which is exactly what Murray brings. Not to mention his heart and absolute will to win games which looked like the nuggets sorely missed this series
Must be nice to pretend that Jamal Murray and Anthony Davis don't exist
"CP3 isn’t ready to go out just yet. Father Time got his ankles broken.  Denver needs Jamal Murray badly. I think with him back, they might have had a chance to win the West, at least.  Commendable effort from their other guys post-Jokic ejection to go down swinging.  Could the Suns go all the way? I think they ultimately don’t have enough to beat whoever the East rep is, but what a turnaround from last year’s 10th seed finish."
"Nuggets fans, you didn't really think you would win this series without Jamal Murray.. right?"
"Jamal Murray super emotional, you hate to see it, so unlucky."
I think recency bias is really effecting how people look at this team. Jokic-murray 2 man game is our bread and butter in the playoffs and outside of that we need competent defenders and shooting.   Our starting 5 with jamal barton mpj gordon and jok was one of the best in the league in net rtg prior to jokic's injury. if Murray returns to his regular season form we are competitive with every team in the west
"It's just so presumptive to assume that the Nuggets win though... there's no way of knowing, and the regular season isn't the bets analogue for how things go in the playoffs (plus you can't cite Jamal being 13-2 against the Suns when they're absolutely a different team now than they were in previous years, plus Ayton has made a leap in the playoffs)  I'm not saying the Suns would win (also, I'm not a Suns fan), just saying that people are being ridiculous by assuming that just having Murray back would definitely make them win the series.  It'd be much closer, for sure."
You played against Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers. Force CP3 or Booker to play any sort of defense by having a healthy Barton or Jamal Murray and that’s a different series. Not to mention dozier who’s their best guard defender. Barton won his minutes lmao even if he were fully healthy that’s a lot different series.   Jamal is 13-2 against the suns while going off he feasts on Booker and wouldn’t lose to the suns 4 times.
"Thanks for the context. I agree with the take (minus Jamal Murray being the difference between being swept and winning the series).   The Suns still have major contributors (Ayton, Bridges, Johnson) on rookie contracts next year and can save more if CP3 opts to sign a long term contract...but they'll still be close to capped out. I don't trust Sarver to navigate paying Ayton and Bridges big contracts and keeping everything else intact so this and next year may be their window."
"Oh Im blaming everybody to be clear, Tillman sucks but the entire league dropped the ball. Sam Amick said the Nuggets refused to include Jamal Murray in Harden trade discussions which even before he tore his ACL was asinine."
Jamal Murray posted his wife throating him for like 5 whole minutes
Next year will be jamal murray hopefully
This is a joke.   The Lakers did not win a single game in that series when Chris Paul was healthy enough to actually play in the Second half of a game.   The Nuggets aren't going from a sweep to a series win because of Jamal Murray  Maybe the Clippers win with Kawhi but it's still probably a good series.
"So the Suns SWEEP the Nuggets without Jamal, and they think we wouldn’t have a chance to win in 7 with Jamal? When did Jamal Murray become MJ?  Lol these takes are atrocious"
I agree with you but I didn't know people overrate Jamal murray
Jamal Murray isn't a sg.  I'm so confused by this as well.
Now  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Devin Booker  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Jamal Murray  6. De’Aaron Fox  7. Ja Morant  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander     Ceiling  1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Ja Morant  4. Donovan Mitchell  5. Devin Booker  6. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  7. De’Aaron Fox  8. Jamal Murray
I missed playoff Jamal Murray this year :/
"Can some one explain to me how a nuggets team that got sweept with really no close games would win with the addition of Jamal Murray? It's not like this team was unprepared, he was our months and they just beat the Blazers. I didn't know Murray was the MVP of a team with the literal MVP"
"They were also missing the next two guys who would replace Murray, so it was a lot more severe than just Jamal out. If their starting backcourt all series was Barton-Dozier they could have had a realistic shot of winning the series even without Murray."
"The Nuggets literally won the Barton minutes over the series even with two of his games being blowouts and the third the BS Jokic ejection. The suns were struggling to contain/keep up with Denver’s offense when he was in the game even without Jamal Murray, and without Dozier, their best perimeter.  They’d have gotten torched against Denver at full strength, they just don’t have the firepower to keep up with them."
"Playoff Murray is so different tho. Even not in the bubble, buddy got a 22 point 4th quarter and multiple 30 points games in the playoffs. Jamal Murray is the difference. Also have u seen murray against the suns these past coupe years?"
"Holy shit people on this thread overrate shooting percentages so much, how can you say traes overrated when he lead his team to the conference finals averaging 30 and 10. He’s overrated yet you say he isn’t a superstar and your also replying to a guy that says he’s worse than sga and Jamal Murray."
"Eh, Mitchell and Murray share similar efficiency numbers the past couple years while Booker is a bit ahead:  Mitchell shot at 56.7% TS this season, a career high for him. The previous two seasons he put up 55.8% TS and 53.7% TS. (He's been in the league 4 years)  Booker shot at 58.7% TS, which is down from his career high of 61.8% TS last season and he also shot at 58.4% TS the year before. (This is Booker's 7th season)   Jamal Murray shot it at 59.2% TS this season, after shooting 55.9% the previous season and 53.8% TS the year before. (He's now been in the league 5 years)   Should be noted that Murray took a real leap this season after people were attributing his success in the Playoffs last season to the bubble"
"Dame is better, but I don't think the gap is all that big with Jamal Murray, and one dude is on the upside of his career and the other is likely at the tail end of his prime.  I don't know that I would do Murray for Dame."
"I feel like that Jamal Murray take is a stretch, like we can’t say that for sure. Nuggets are great when they are healthy but I just don’t want to discredit the Suns like that they have been a great team.  Both teams have benefited from staying relatively healthy compared to others but they also played very well."
The Jamal Murray point is total bs
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
They are all 24 years old for the record   Booker- Mitchell-Murray   Book is an amazing shot creator. He really is incredible and I think this finals run is huge for him and his development   Spida incredibly talented and explosive and I look forward to his development. He’s also 5 inches shorter than book  Jamal is incredibly streaky but still amazing
"I hate sports media so much. Sooooooo much. How long are they gonna harp on this narrative? I get it.     Okay, Clippers with kawhi, we definitely could have lost that series. Maybe even in 6 or less games. But the Nuggets? You're telling me that Jamal Murray is gonna make enough of a difference to turn a sweep into a series win for the Nuggets? One guy? That's ridiculous.     As far as the Lakers series is concerned, they wouldnt have even BEEN a 7th seed if injuries didn't plague them. See how long this argument can go on for? Injured all fucking season and everybody expected them to just show up, round 1, against the 2nd best team in the NBA, and stroll right to the finals."
Did u watch Jamal Murray last playoffs? I’m not saying he will replicate that historic performance but he’s got to be better than fucking Austin Rivers and Compazzo. Austin Rivers is absolute shit. I would argue that the entire Nuggets offense relies on Murray. Without the Murray Jokic pick and roll Jokic is so much easier to guard. There’s also less spacing for MPJ without Murray. Nuggets beat Suns in 7 with Murray in my nephew opinion.
lmao this guy definitely doesn't watch the Nuggets play.  Jamal Murray was the best player in the NBA last playoffs.  [His highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJiCzGNi71w) are like prime Jordan and his stats in those playoffs were even better.  I'm not saying he would replicate that amazing run but he was unstoppable and the disrespect he gets on here is annoying.
Jamal Murray does not turn a Suns sweep into a Nuggets win I'm sorry.
"Dude all 3 regular season games were extremely close, with Denver winning 2 of them including a game tying 3 by... Jamal Murray.  Maybe it doesn't get Denver a win in the series, but that series goes from a slaughter to a thriller with Jamal."
True! The best part of the melo trade is the nuggets got Jamal Murray from it (he’s the only piece from the trade on either team)
"Jamal Murray and Jokic pick n roll IS the nuggets offense. Literally 50% of half court sets are just a Murray/Jokic pick n roll and nothing more.  You’re acting like Murray doesn’t have a big impact, but did you watch last playoffs?"
"20% chance of a franchise player at each pick (so 40% odds that between the two picks, at least one guy is a real franchise piece) actually represents better odds than I would've guessed offhand. Given that TOR has some of the best scouting &amp; development in the league, the odds are probably better still. Not to mention that Wiseman represents a third (purely development-based) roll of the dice.  Now compare the odds of a positive outcome with the pick(s) and/or Wiseman with the odds of Siakam ever being a core part of a Raptors title run (or even ECF run) again. It's harder to quantify the latter, but I can't really think of any reasonable path for a return to contention for TOR anytime within Siakam's prime. The odds of that are far slimmer than at least one of #7, #14, or Wiseman being as good as Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ, or Julius Randle -- though of course part of getting rolls of the dice is the possibility that you could hit multiple times and have a home run on your hands.  But so what if only one player works out and they're not actually as good as Siakam (or even if it's the rare, total-disaster outcome and TOR bungles all 3 assets)? What great achievement would TOR be potentially missing out on in that scenario? It just doesn't really make much sense to keep Siakam if a team were willing to give good young/draft value for him, and a package like this from GSW would be phenomenal value for him. It'd be an overpay that GSW should absolutely not offer."
I understand the Lakers and the Clippers one bit Jamal Murray doesn’t change a 4-0 sweep with three of the games being blowouts into a win for the Nuggets.
"The Nuggets got *swept*. You’d think Jamal Murray was a rich man’s Steph Curry the way people talk about his injury, it’s not like they were anywhere close to winning that series."
"* Luka Doncic * Devin Booker * SGA * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Trae Young * Ja Morant * De'Aaron Fox  Anyone who doesn't put Luka #1 is on crack. SGA's length makes me love him for the defensive aspect of his game more than a few others, even if they're a bit better scorers. It's crazy how Fox is last cuz I think he's also great."
"Bro tbh that’s some recency bias out the ass there is no way Murray should be over fat or Thompson his highest honor is all rookie second team.. Thompson scored 73 points in a game before the 3pt line 4 time 4 nba all star 2 all nba first team 2 times, Thompson literally inspired MJs style of play and was one of the biggest freak athletes of all time, and fat was a multiple time all star and 2 team defensive, Jamal is a good player but he’s not an all time great yet especially considering his knee injury as there is no telling how he recovers and there simply isn’t anything to warrant him being above others at the point"
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
Micheal porter junior is not Jamal Murray
I’ll take Jamal Murray over Simmons any day.
"I think Jamal for dame instead of mpj is better for all parties. Denver doesn’t have to sacrifice a year, Portland can super tank a year, and mpj seems like more of a sure fire fit next to dame and jokic. Mpj still has more potential than Murray imo as well.   Denver can’t punt a year if they go get dame. You can’t waste any of his prime and jokic should have contending talent around him every year."
Jamal Murray or MPJ + Bol Bol &amp; alot of picks
Is there a reason Jamal Murray is over David Thompson for the Nuggets?
"Offense: G Jamal Murray, G Monte Morris, F Will Barton, F MPJ, C Nikola Jokic  Defense: G PJ Dozier, G Shaq Harrison, F Aaron Gordon, F Paul Millsap, C Javale???"
"I'd be interested to see your proof of these alternate timelines. Of course it might be harder for the Bucks and Suns, but nobody knows how Kyrie or Harden or AD or Jamal Murray might have played. All of those guys have had bad series in the past."
Yeah cause the Blazers stink. Not because they’re the same team with Jamal Murray out
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
I think that only happened because Jamal Murray tracked him down to hang out with him
"But then we factor in Jamal Murray being back, Lakers being healthy, the warriors being healthy and have tons of assets to make win now moves.   The west is gonna be tough next year if everyone is healthy."
"My dude the suns played against clippers missing KAWHI LEONARD AND SERGE IBAKA..   Kawhi was having a legendary post season before he got hurt..ibaka would've made it even easier for kawhi to score cause ibaka would force ayton to the 3 pt line.     Nuggets were missing JAMAL MURRAY who was having MULTIPLE 50 POINT GAMES last post season.. and who had an INJURED MPJ..  lakers had LEBRON KCP AND AD ALL injured..   I'm sorry but when 2 of 3 of the best players in ur last 3 series are hurt, those stats don't mean shit lmao"
"Look, durability is an ability. Suns can't help it if the Lakers signed chronically injured AD and Old Man Bron. Suns can't control that the Clips based their team on load managing PG and Kawhi. Jamal Murray didn't get hurt til late in the yr. Suns still won 50+, I respect it, that's all I'm saying"
"Super Dario &gt; no AD, Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard"
jamal murray lol
Not NBA but I could’ve swore Jamal Murray and Booker played in college together
"Call me a homer but I would rather keep a young Jamal Murray than an over 30 Damian Lillard, especially when Jamal's had more impressive showings in the post season."
"So, when the Bucks win in 6 does this crack the top 10 in worst chokes in NBA history?    No AD when down 1-2, no Jamal Murray, no Kahwi, up 2-0 on the Bucks and had a 9 point lead late in Game 4 and still can't win"
"Damien Lillard for Jamal murray and bol bol trade scenarios, you mean"
"Dame for Jamal Murray + Aaron Gordon  Nuggets don't lose their 2 year window before MPJ hits RFA, Blazers get a really good young player who is basically going to miss 2 years which gives them an automatic tank  It fixes the biggest problem for each team: Nuggets need a guard who can run DHOs all game with Jokic and fast before MPJ gets expensive. Blazers get one of the best players under 25"
I don' think CP3 missing 2 games compares to Kawhi and Jamal Murray missing an entire series.
Grant was just on a team with Jokic and Jamal Murray. He averaged 12ppg
"If he’s going to do it, it’s next season. Watch for him to go nuclear with Jamal Murray out for at least a good chunk of the season."
Didn’t say it wasn’t impressive. I just don’t think it’s that big of a deal. Jamal Murray went off in the bubble last year too. It still didn’t mean he was a superstar. He’s a good scorer but he’s on the same level as Booker. Star players that need to take any extra step before being considered superstars. Mitchell isn’t capable of putting a team on their back like Paul George did and that Clippers-Jazz series was indicative of that
"It’s not, your post is just upvoted because the subreddit has a memory of a goldfish. Your telling me Middleton’s the 15th best player in the NBA? I’m not saying he doesn’t deserve a max but all the contracts you listed are known to be overpay/bad contracts and Jamal Murray is clearly a step above all of the players listed above. You just said he’s a second option, which would make him not top 15 at all.  He’s a great second option don’t get me wrong but would you rather have Klay or Middleton as second option? Harden or Middleton as second option?  I understand that he’s doing great for himself but if he made 24-28 million that would be much more helpful than 33 million."
I forgot teams don't matter. Jamal Murray averaged 23 points on 44.7 FG% and 6 assists as the second best player. THJ averaged 17 points on 41.6 FG% and 1 assist lol
"It's absolutely fair. There's literally nothing more you could ask of a second option. There's guys being underpaid to be better but Khris has 100% earned his salary.   He's making around what Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Tobias Harris, and CJ McCollum are making, I'd put him at the same level as all of them."
"This kid's handles look so inaccurate and just slow in general, if he plays the same kind of ISO - slash n' shoot game he forced in college but in the NBA, he's going to just get eaten alive.  Check out like college highlights of Jamal Murray or Lamelo in Euro league if you wanna see how sloppy this dude looks. Even Jaylen Brown in college looked cleaner. He's maybe a great guard one day with some work, but having this much hype on yourself when you don't got the ball on a rope ain't a good sign."
"If this is true… holy shit, the cost to get him… The best rn is Jamal Murray, Michael Porter AND all the picks (some protected maybe). I don’t think any other realistic package beats that"
"Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, and a 1st?"
"I wonder what each side would say about a trade centered around Jamal Murray (with a shitload of future draft compensation going to the Blazers)?  Nuggets get a big three Dame, MPJ and Jokic. Jamal Murray is going to miss most of next season, which is going to be a massive load to carry for Jokic.  Blazers get to tank this year for a high pick (they would also trade CJ in this scenario) while Murray recovers, and then roll with Jamal Murray, whatever they get for CJ, and high draft picks in '22-'23"
"I mean, they *could* do it, they just never would. Like, I don’t see the Blazers saying no to Murray, AG, and MPJ plus picks. (Money actually works on that.) But there’s no way the Nuggets offer that. Would be a net negative for them.  Would be a filthy Portland team tho. Jamal/CJ/AG/MPJ/Nurk with Norm/RoCo/Kanter off the bench is a killer eight man rotation"
"Would Portland be interested in trading Dame to Denver for MPJ, Bol Bol, Will Barton, Monte Morris and a couple 1st rounders? Dame and Jokic?!?!? Watch out. Then Jamal Murray comes back from injury and the Nuggets are looking scary."
"Just looking at Dame swapping in for Murray, that is *not* a sizable downgrade on D. Jamal Murray is a mediocre at best defender, but he has improved on that end after gaining muscle mass"
"He’s been loyal. When you’re averaging 35+ in a playoff series and your team still can’t get past the Nuggets with no Jamal Murray in the first round, it should tell you a lot. Warriors, Nuggets, Lakers, Mavs, Jazz, Suns will all be better than that next year"
"Yeah he’s good, and so is Jamal Murray, who is a lot closer to Booker than Booker is to actual centerpieces. People just have him in the wrong tier"
He absolutely does not belong in the top 15. He’s borderline top 20. He’s way closer to Middleton or Jamal Murray than he is to any top 10 player.
"He’s not a “winner” more than most top 30 players lmao, he’s made the **playoffs** 0 times in his career without an MVP candidate on his team. He’s much closer to Jamal Murray and Khris Middleton than he is to any actual top 10 players"
Jamal Murray for Lillard? 👀
About two months ago a buddy told me that Jamal Murray was better than Jokic.
1.  Nikola Jokic 2.  Jamal Murray 3.  Michael Porter Jr. 4.  Monte Morris 5.  RJ Hampton :/
"they're just talking about this finals lmao. I havent been less interested in a finals since I started watching the NBA. I think with the injuries to Kawhi, AD, Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown people just know it's not the 2 best teams in the finals"
"Here are some I’ve heard. Drummond&gt;valanciunas this year. Lamelo ball is better than SGA, Fox, and Westbrook this year. Ja and trae are both better than curry. Ayton&gt;jokic. Jamal Murray&gt;luka."
"He would have a way worse shot in the West, whatchu talking about?  Dudes like Jamal Murray, averaging 22 a game on great efficiency this year, didn't even sniff the all-star game.   Same with SGA.  And Fox. Like these dudes are not even considered snubs because the west is so stacked at guard.  Sexton would have no chance.  His best hope is trying to lead the Cavs to a respectable record"
I could say the same to you about Jamal Murray. Nuggets fans talk like he’s a legit second star but his highest PPG in a season is 21 lmaooooo. His max contract is gonna look so bad in a few years.
The nuggets should trade Jamal Murray to “Keep Jokic happy” - Paul Pierce
"&gt;I’d argue he’s in the Jamal Murray tier of #2s.  Much better defensively, though. That matters."
"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot—and Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee’s impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven’t won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship résumés, seeing all these new faces on the league’s biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul—these Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we’re getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography—elevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it’s a “down” year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he’s not among the NBA’s peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he’s only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he’s playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis’s signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday’s game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it’s astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis’s blunt power—these stars may be dissimilar, but that’s why they’re such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it’s tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee’s, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on “Booker game” everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points—though playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they’re now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn’t see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There’s no asterisk to this title. There’s been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I’d take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the “bubble tournament” in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the “bubble title,” or this one. Come on. Don’t be absurd.   I have no idea what’s going to happen here, and that’s great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday—thanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I’ll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim—it’s hard to get a read on where it’s going. Phoenix’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don’t, and that’s the exciting thing. There’s nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there’s none here. We truly don’t know for sure who’s going to win it, and that’s the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He’s really something else."
"They’re under max contracts which is exactly why Denver won’t be able to pay MPJ, Aaron Gordon, or anyone else who’s going to demand a larger salary. Same reason why they lost Jerami Grant, because they couldn’t pay him enough to stay. Nuggets are so fucked with Jamal Murray being given a max contract."
Jamal Murray
"That's exactly my point. No one is saying the loss of Saric doesn't hurt depth wise...it's jut not comparable to the likes of AD, Jamal Murray and Kawhi let alone the Will Barton and Ibaka's that were also out.  Ayton has been in foul trouble one game this finals and Saric was playing around 10 mins a game these playoffs. The loss hurts Phx no doubt but it isnt a series altering injury that validates blowing a 2-0 lead if Bucks win"
"I feel like Khris is a 1.5 - He's definitely not in that KD/Kawhi realm where you can count on him playing well every single game, but I feel like he's a level above the traditional #2 like Tobias Harris or CJ McCollum. Guys like Jamal Murray, Booker, Westbrook, and *maybe* PG (who may be a legit #1 after this post-season) fall into  this category. I don't think any of these guys could be the #1 option on a championship team, but they're more valuable than a lot of the guys most often thought of as #2s"
"Similar to Jamal Murray is my understanding           Edit: a similar trait, not trying to start a deep dive player comparison"
The clippers were the only team on their level in the west if both teams are fully healthy lmao I dont know if u just dislike the lakers or cant see that. The nuggets got ripped last year with Jamal Murray what makes u think they would have done better without him 😂
"He’s in many ways the perfect #2 because if he’s on, he’ll swing a game for you, but if he isn’t, it’s not absolutely essential to the outcome. I’d argue he’s in the Jamal Murray tier of #2s."
"Dog this ain’t last year, Lakers are not as good matching up against the other western teams when healthy. Want to talk hypothetical? You beat the suns, and move on to Denver. With Jamal Murray and their Injured wings, that’s a championship team. But lets say you beat them. Now you move on to the clippers. With Kawhi, ibaka, Morris, and zubac healthy? That’s also a championship team. It wouldn’t have been that easy my guy."
"I just think most of what you said in that comment also applies to Jamal Murray, who I fucking love and is awesome, and was insane in the playoffs last run (better than Booker in this one IMO), but I’m not out here saying Jamal is the next Kobe. Superstar definition stuff is pretty subjective so not a lot to talk about there imo."
"Definitely his last and best chance. If he doesn’t win this his only chance will be to join Lebron or another superteam and hope to win. If he stays in Phoenix or goes to NY since they’re desperate enough to offer him 100 Mil at his age he’ll never win a ring. Every lucky break went their way this year. Next season Klay returns, so does, Jamal Murray, AD, Kawhi, Kyrie, etc.  I don’t think Phoenix wins with everyone healthy. They miss out on this it’s a wrap. They had a 2-0 lead no excuse to blow the series with home court advantage."
"Booker is next up on the Tyler herro, Jamal Murray list"
"Lmao, you put Jamal Murray and Tyler Herro in the same class. kekw.  Solid bait post 5/7"
Booker is just another Tyler Herro and Jamal Murray. Wait for next year. Sucks because you won't see him in the finals ever again to prove I'm right..
Well Denver fans will buy a Jokic jersey or a Jamal Murray jersey.   Ja Morant is the only jersey to buy in Memphis
"Hear me out:  Dame to Denver, CJ and Porter to Philly, Simmons, Jamal Murray, thybulle and 2 firsts (one from Philly and one from Denver) to Portland"
Ya but mike malone is also a complete idiot. he played jameer nelson over jamal murray for like an entire season.  he took 1.5 seasons for jokic even though everyone else already knew like half a season in.
With Jamal Murray still out a chunk of the season 25 ppg for Porter is very viable good take
&gt;I'd definitely have Jamal Murray in my top 10 if he was healthy  You saved yourself
Where'd Luka go? And im taking Jamal Murray and Kyle Lowry over Westbrook too
Only nostalgia.    The league today is far more skilled further down the roster than it has been in the past. Take Jamal Murray as an example and think of how skilled he is on both ends of the floor. Yet where would you rank him against active players? Top 20? 30? Maybe.
Jamal Murray did this.
"Current league, no Warriors:  PG: Jamal Murray  SG:  Zach Lavine  SF: MPJ/ Middleton PF: Giannis Antetokounpo C: Nikola Jokic   For all time: PG:  Steve Nash SG: Kobe Bryant/ Ray Allen SF: Scottie Pippen PF: Kevin Garnett C: Tim Duncan"
Jamal Murray is surrounded a lot better players lol.  Jesus Fuck dude I can't take this stupidity anymore.  I'm done.
If your standards are that low for a supposed superstar i don't know what to tell you. Jamal Murray played way better against the same team. Harden was also infinitely better when played against the same team.  It's not looking good if that's your best series vs a contender.
"Bubble Jamal Murray is who made me love basketball, and I’m not a Nuggets fan."
"Honestly, Simmons in Denver would be pretty nuts.   The amount of playmaking on that roster is crazy, and the Nuggets have a real 1 in Jamal Murray meaning Simmons can play the 4 while getting space from Jokic.  Jokic’s only real weakness is defense which would be completely nullified by having Simmons playing next to him."
Probably because there wont be Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray
Jokic gonna surprise a lot of people in this sub when the Nugs without Jamal Murray are a top 2-3 seed come MVP rankings in the spring.
“Oh! A spectacular move by Jamal Murray!”
"The only teams standing in front of the Warriors with a healthy Klay are the Lakers, Suns, Nuggets.  Warriors will win any matchup against the Jazz. Luka is a one man army, but it’s obvious he needs a #2. Clippers don’t have Kawhi. Lillard and McCollum ain’t enough.  Grizzlies are no matchup with a healthy warriors squad.  It’ll come down to the Lakers roster age and injury history. Nuggets won’t have Jamal Murray at 100% and I highly doubt they’ll throw him into the fire. Cp3 is going to be 37 and I’m sure warriors matchup better than them.  Took two years but we’ve assembled I believe the best team we could have assembled for title contention. Only team we have to worry about really are the Nets."
"He is top 5 right now, but that status is getting more precarious by the second.    You could make a strong argument that Brown, Ingram, Sabonis, and Siakam are all better than him right now, and the book isn’t closed on guys like Brogdon, Murray (both Jamal and Dejounte), and LeVert.    Simmons was by far the most NBA ready player in that class, and he’s still got the elite playmaking, slashing, and defense that he was drafted for, but it’s very easy to make the case that he’s still basically the same player that he was in year 1 while all of the other guys have been steadily improving.  I would not be surprised if Ben Simmons was not seen as a top 5 player in his class in 2-4 years."
"&gt; That makes less than zero sense. So you're going to discount wins against the Bucks, Suns, Jazz, Mavs, Grizzlies, Nuggets (twice) in the last month of the season because they also played games against lottery teams around the same time  you don't even know what you're talking about lmao just putting the mavs in there shows that. i already explained what the issue was: majority of the wins (**post all-stat break**) come from non-playoff teams, but also as i already said they can only play who is in front of them so it's not like they controlled that and i can't fault them specifically, but i can't **personally** say 'yeah GSW should've been dominant all year look at how they did in the second half'   now for your teams they beat, which i didn't shrug off:  - they beat the bucks by 1 - they beat suns by 6 - they beat jazz by 3 - **lost** to the mavericks by 30 post asb (not sure why you think they beat them?) - they beat the grizzlies by 12 (again only to turn around and lose to them in the play-ins) - and the 2x they beat the nuggets could easily be credited to losing jamal murray (in the 1st win is when jamal got injured and the 2nd win was without him)  so what are you bragging about or trying to hold the warriors up as better than their record? a few single possession wins that can easily be explained by late game fouling? lol"
"Thats only if you believe that the only stat that determines first option, second option, etc is fga. I think it’s a lot more nuanced than that. Just because one player takes the field goal attempts doesn’t mean the play was their entirely. Things like usage, assists, and generally how much defensive attention and game planning a guy gets also matters when discussing options. In their 2020 run, Jamal Murray took more shots than jokic in every single series(not just the one he went crazy in). However, anyone would tell you that jokic was always the first option, would you argue otherwise? You’re not as smart as you think you are buddy, so maybe try being less of a condescending asshole."
Jamal Murray is overrated as hell lmfao. Jrue and Khris would clamp his ass up
Jokic and Jamal can both score from anywhere pretty efficiently. Draymond cannot that’s why the Jokic Murray 2 man game is much harder to defend imo.
Is Jamal Murray back by then?
"A lot of people have seen Bev be exposed as a dirty player. The Westbrook incident is one of many, he was shoving Jamal Murray and Luka too. More fans catching stray dirty moves by him now"
"A lot of people have seen Bev be exposed as a dirty player. The Westbrook incident is one of many, he was shoving Jamal Murray and Luka too. More fans catching stray dirty moves by him now"
I'd love to text this hypothesis and see Jokic play with Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver instead of Jamal Murray and Gary Harris
Jamal Murray - never an all star  Thybulle - consistent starter  Ingram   Draymond green - 11 ppg  AD  - 7 games
he doesn't make his teammates better like Jokic. Jokic was playing with G league guards to close the season last year and the nuggets won just as much as when they had Jamal Murray and Will Barton
"Jamal Murray put up numbers in 3 different series. How does Fox ""lead the Grizzlies to take 2 games"" if Morant's small sample size is still him playing extremely well at 30 PPG and putting up 47 in a loss? Are you actually using your brain, or are you trying to somehow cope with the fact that you're overrating Fox and the Kings suck"
How is Jamal Murray relevant?
Uhh…Jamal Murray? Siakam has played better than BI as well.
Ben Simmons is hyped cuz he was the first pick he’s not a real all star n Tobias isn’t an all star Jamal Murray and mpj are better than both of them and it’s pretty obvious
"I remember someone tweeting after they came back from 3-1 against the Clippers: ""The only person to finish Jamal Murray off is his girlfriend"""
"Idk Lavine, Ja Morant, Bam, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Mitchell, Jamal Murray, SGA, KAT,"
Look like Jamal Murray
"Just for some context, that poll was conducted 1/3 of the way through the season when the Lakers were 20-6 and the Nuggets were 12-11.   The Lakers would then go on to an 8-7 record in the games from that point until LeBron was injured while the Nuggets went 35-14 from that point until the end of the regular season (with Jamal Murray missing almost half of the remaining games)."
"Jokic might repeat tbh if Nuggets get a top 3 seed without Jamal Murray most of the season  Luka doesn't have the supporting cast to be a top seed unless he does a next level carry  LeBron, Durant, and Harden are all on Superteams   The Blazers suck sorry Dame pls leave   Don't think the media likes the Sixers enough anymore for Embiid but if they put it all on Ben and he leaves and they still finish a top seed I could see it   Giannis love is at an all time high right now but I think the Bucks might coast a little bit in the regular season and not worry about a top seed   Curry is a wildcard because their ceiling really depends on factors outside of him like how good Klay will be, Wiseman and the Rookies' performance  I'll say, Jokic, Curry, Giannis, and Embiid as my contenders unless someone comes on the scene by surprise. Not in that order but those names"
Jamal Murray about to sue Nike for using his pubes without his permission lol
wait jamal murray was in a sex vid? lmao
"Aight now someone do the Friends &amp; Family exclusive ""Jamal Murray edition"""
"I mean it’s hard to justify Jamal Murray over steph, harden, dame, and CP3."
Honestly our same team except we have Donovan now  PG: Jamal Murray  SG: Donovan Mitchell  SF: MPJ  PF: Zeke Nnaji  C: Bol Bol
Deff getting more Jamal Murray pubes vibe
Jamal Murray bro.
"Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray killed the playoffs too but they didn't win a thing. The only things that matter in the GOAT conversation are the MVPs/FMVPs, the finals performance and the rings and at 26 Giannis has equal or more than MJ and Lebron."
"""Look at their stats excluding the period of time jamal Murray did things Colin sexton has never come close to doing and it's clear"""
"Your entire argument is backwards. Jamal murray on the Cleveland cavs would objectively have a higher ppg, saying somebody scores MORE points as the 2nd option on a good team vs the first option on an awful team is absolutely ridiculous man, I'm cracking up"
"sexton is a better scorer without a doubt, and their passing isn’t that much different  glad Jamal finally had 1 year around Sexton’s efficiency, but i doubt he would keep that up as a #1 option as compared to the 2nd/3rd with Jokic and MPJ.   if murray can increase his free throws like Collin did, maybe we can debate it  but Murray is two years older so idk, especially with the injury"
"If Murray looks like his old self by playoffs, I think Nuggets can make a run in the West. They have never had a run with Jokic/Jamal/MPJ all healthy."
"Um, no? MPJ's numbers in the regular season with Jokic sitting are perfectly fine. His usage rate goes up but his efficiency actually marginally increases. He's one of the few players in the Nuggets roster that have a positive on/off impact while Jokic is on the bench (even Jamal Murray does not have this).   He plays perfectly fine without Jokic. He still struggles to create his own shot, so he still needs someone to play-make for him, but his stats aren't being noticeably inflated by Jokic's passing."
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
"terry is not a top 10-15 starting guard lmao what   Off top of the head Curry, Dame, Kyrie, Lowry, Chris Paul, Booker, Harden, Jrue, Trae, Fox, Morant,  FVV, Brogdon, Westbrook, Conley, Mitchell, Jamal Murray are all easily better and that’s not even counting point forwards   his last contract looked like an overpay and then he played at the level of the contract, that doesn’t mean he should get overpaid *again*"
"&gt;They made the 7th seed even with both LeBron and AD injured last season.  Right...   So the best team in the West nearly missed the playoffs because your two stars were injured?  One of those stars is getting older and starting to miss more and more time to injuries. The other star has been injury-prone his entire career.   So banking on them being healthy isn't a sure thing.    &gt; Lmao how the Nuggets a safe team? Jamal Murray literally has a torn ACL.   Yeah and the Nuggets were still the 3rd seed... They don't need Murray to be a playoff team, that's why they're safer.    Which is the part of this you don't seem to understand. I'm not saying the Nuggets are a better team than LA but the odds that they make the playoffs is higher.   Healthy LA beats healthy Denver but there's a lot more that could go wrong for LA.   Jokic can carry them to the playoffs on his own and he's a lot less likely to get injured than LeBron/AD."
jokic has had jamal murray who is better than anybody kat has played with since jimmy...  ffs he had to put up with wiggins being his 2nd best player for a majority of his career
"&gt; Lakers: Could easily miss the playoffs and almost did last season. They're reliant on the health of their stars, who have all had questionable health lately.  Terrible troll.  They made the 7th seed even with both LeBron and AD injured last season.  &gt;Jazz/Suns/Nuggets: I would say they're probably the safest 3 teams, even if they're not necessarily the best 3 teams.  Lmao how the Nuggets a safe team? Jamal Murray literally has a torn ACL. You think a solo carry by Jokic is safer than a super team?"
"no way the nuggets will be the 1 seed with jamal murray missing time. and i’m biased, but i definitely believe we will make the playoffs next year."
Genuinely surprised Jamal Murray hasn't been an All-Star yet
"AD shot 49% from midrange in the bubble. It's not that he got hot he just benefitted from the new environment.  Just like how jamal murray didn't become an allstar this season, AD does not have a reliable mid range jumper"
"Serious question, would this many of you really take Fox over Jamal Murray?"
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray was night and day in the bubble. From pretty good in the season to dropping 50 burgers left and right in the playoffs.
Pg. Jamal Murray  Sg: Shai  Sf: MPJ  Pf: Tobias Harris  C: Ayton
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
Jamal murray
"Jamal Murray is perpetually underrated. I remember when everyone was talking for years about how Dame was underrated - he's obviously not now, and I guarantee you Murray will be the same within 5 years"
"&gt;	the Raptors have never had an edge signing Canadians  The best Canadian players are still on their 1st or 2nd contracts, like Jamal Murray, SGA, Andrew Wiggins, and RJ Barrett.  The Raptors really haven’t had any opportunities to sign Canadian star players because until very recently, they didn’t exist (besides Steve Nash)."
"What if the super team is all Canadians. Jamal Murray, SGA and RJ Barrett?"
"Her strongest stories were about Boston, and I wouldn't be surprised if she retired because Danny Ainge, her main source, is no longer with the team. But she wrote plenty about other young players outside of Boston.  I remember she wrote this awesome piece about Jamal Murray a few years back and now she consistently brings up the Nuggets. Same with a Trae story recently. Once she does a write-up of a player, you can hear how often she stays in their corner.    Of any journalist who consistently appears on ESPN podcasts, she gives the most leeway to young players."
Or when he tried to injure Jamal Murray in game 7 last year after the clips had already lost
I don't know how many players are better than Heat Check Jamal Murray when he's on. Dude becomes a superstar when he's on one.
My introduction to her was through ATH on ESPN and I felt she was pretty fair on there. Not great in podcast format but her writing was pretty solid.   &amp;#x200B;  The piece she wrote on Jamal Murray in late 2018 is one of the better profiles on a player I've read on ESPN to date. Wish her well in retirement.

Jamal Murray is going to be top 20 in two years or less  -Jamal Murray fanboy
Problem is Jamal Murray probably won’t be there. Clippers didn’t get a game either. I think it’s fair. Nuggets got swept by the Suns so they’re playing the night game. So while they could play the Jazz in Utah the NBA simply chose Luka over Jokic and PG13. Not a terrible decision for ratings or game quality
Yes  They were far better in the playoffs without Kawhi than Denver was without Jamal Murray
Shit talk is fine. What I don’t like is his dirty plays such as injuring Russ (and almost doing it again years later) as well as other close calls like almost injuring Jamal Murray after the blown 3-1 lead.
No Jamal Murray  Plus probably a reward to the Jazz for having the best record last season

Only Gobert and like Jamal Murray were actually giving him props for his performances in the Finals.  It was just a thing that people online noticed
"He is currently my favorite player in the entire league. Love his attitude, his ability to communicate his feelings and thought process, and most of all how he seems like just a genuinely great person.  My list goes:  1. Matisse Thybulle  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Lebron James  4. Larry Nance Jr.  5. Jamal Murray"
"I think the Jamal Murray injury plays into their ranking a lot, and LA's not as certain due to old age/injury concerns. If Bron has something happen and AD gets a three month injury it might be game over. I still feel they'll both make it, but if I had to bet on any one team making it, it'd be Utah. Kept the core, good upgrades around the fringes, sure I don't know how I feel about them getting to the Finals let alone WCF, but making it to the playoffs? An absolute sure thing for them, consistency will win out here"
"If it involves Murray, nope.  Rather have 1 leg Jamal than Ben"
"What difference does that make ?? The argument was about the easiness of a ring. How does the level of team affect that? If anything a better team has an easier chance at a ring. And the lakers dodged LAC who were the other top dog in the west. And the playoffs are about matchups.   Russ literally had a major injury on his lower body. Yeah he’s not ordinarily a great playoff player but he was still a lot worse than usual. Usually he just has awful shot selection and bricks all his jumpers. In the rockets series his athleticism and speed, his bread and butter, were clearly hindered. He also had no time to shake the rust off. Can’t just ignore context cause a player generally underperforms lmao. You also can’t ignore an entire 25% of the series’ a team faces in a finals run to suit your argument. That’s one of the stupidest arguments I’ve heard. And coincidentally Miami was the defending conference champions while Portland was a fringe playoff team with injuries. Not surprised you ignore the series where the clear advantage was milwaukees comp.  I’d agree Denver &gt; Atlanta but Phoenix &gt; both. Idk why people are so low on Phoenix but they dominated in the regular season and backed it up in the playoffs with excellent 2 way play. And in the Atlanta series giannis missed like half of it. That would be like the lakers missing Lebron for half of it. Obviously the comp gets more even when the team gets handicapped like that.   And your point is reliant entirely on your own subjective rankings of those teams which aren’t at all accurate. The clippers were better than the Nuggets, the nuggets just matched up very well against them and the clippers had a historic choke job. Houston was not a top 4-5 team, they won by a single basket against okc and then added a crippled Russ. And Phoenix was absolutely the best team in the west. They established themselves in the regular season and backed it up in the playoffs. And again you can’t call Atlanta injured when Milwaukee was more injured lmao. If Jamal Murray is healthy maybe it goes 6 instead of being a sweep. Jamal Murray isn’t the difference between complete domination in a loss and a series win. Thoroughly awful argument all around. Clearly just excess Nets salt"
"Dw I know it's not a serious thing. If I separate the individual voices out most fanbases are kinda chill. I like hanging around in the team subs and most of them are pretty cool; I like post-Harden Rockets fans generally, Raptors fans are cool on their sub and Hawks fans are generally fantastic people and honestly made the reddit fun as a Bucks fan even during the conference finals.  The Nets sub got *very* ugly when Giannis got injured (had a post telling people to stop celebrating injuries, a lot of its comments celebrating the injury as much as you can while avoiding a ban), but it also feels like Nets sub has two groups where one has been around for a while ('I'm just happy Brook Lopez got a ring') and ones who migrated with Harden/superteam fans ('Giannis deliberately injured Kyrie'), so I think the worst is just a product of a large gathering of stans and less so representative of the teams fans generally. Anyway I feel like Bucks fans, including myself, have got just a level of defensiveness that is definitely taught (Jamal Murray being injured does not make the Bucks frauds, Nuggets got swept with 3 blowouts, most Nuggets fans don't even seem to think that he puts them in the finals), but is still obnoxious so eh."
"the difference is that the lakers were actually the #1 seed and best SRS/net rating etc.. So they played against likely the #2/3 team in the playoffs in denver who beat the clippers.    And you can't attribute all of westbrooks poor play to his injury. he typically sucks in the playoffs and lakers defense stifled him. 1st round series really dont matter in terms of  difficulty so ill just ignore tthem.   Then the miami injuries defintiely hurt them a lot, so ill agree they were an easier challenege than likely the suns. but still denver was ahead of both the suns and the hawks in my opinion.  Regardless my point is that when you're the top team they likely plaeyd against the 2nd best team in the playoffs in denver, and then a top 4-5 team in houston.   The bucks played against an injured hawks team, injrued nets team, and then likely the 6-7th best team in phoenix. yuou can easily argue that the nets/lakers/clippers/bucks/utah were better than the suns if healthy. Then if denver had jamal murray thats a completely different series as well. The bucks basically beat nobody and the top 3 teams that were consensus better than them all got hurt. its definitely an extremely weak championship"
"Yep you're right, they took out him and Jamal Murray."
"Kawhi is literally out for next year why would he be over Jokic? Jokic averaged 26.4/11/8 on 57% with Austin Rivers playing significant minutes at PG. He led the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to 3rd spot at 47-25 in a competitive West. Harden had 24.6/8/11 on 46% with better teammates on lower efficiency and less games played. Luka isn’t as good as Jokic yet idk why you’d even mention that. Embiid had a great season last year but considering the issues with the 76ers, there’s no way you pick him to have a better season than Jokic."
That’s one series. Otherwise we’d be saying that Donovan Mitchell with his 36/5/5 on 70%TS against the Nuggets and Jamal Murray with his 32/6/6 on 69%TS against the Jazz last year were better than Harden
Jamal Murray
Sure and I'm not surprised anyone would not want to move Murray and I dont think that is a wrong opinion at all but it's worth thinking about.  I dont think they have the leverage to ask for Jamal either even being injured so there would need to be more to that.  For me Gordon for Ben is kinda a lateral move and in some sense I actually think that trade is less likely to improve the team as much as I think Jamal is a star.
What would Phili have to add to get an injured Jamal Murray back for him?
"This was the series that got me back into basketball after 15 years, I had no idea who Donovan Mitchell or Jamal Murray were at the time so it blew my mind when they started trading buckets like that"
"Stopped looking like 10 guys in...Jamal Murray, and Clint Capela impact winning waaayyy more than Siakam and VanVleet who are rated higher. List is trash."
Jamal murray makes that series go from a sweep to a 4-2 loss. I don’t see him winning them that
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
Jamal murray doesn’t change a sweep into a win
"Well Denver was missing Will Barton, Jamal Murray and, Pj Dozier. Barton came back for the last 2 games and played ok but the Nuggets lost their 3 best gaurd defenders and the only 3 other guys that can create their own shot"
"2016 Steph Curry - 30/5/7/2/0 on .669 TS% and not even a top 50 defender.   Giannis 2020 must be better than Steph 2016 then? If only ranking seasons was as easy as laying out statlines and comparing numbers. Your entire concept is flawed.  2019 Giannis wasn't even deserving of the MVP, so let's talk about the 2020 version. An All-Star in Khris Middleton, 2 All-Defense teammates in Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe. Weaker Eastern Conference. Giannis got the DPOY too because of a superior record and his team being defense-oriented. The majority wanted AD to get the award instead.  2021 Jokic did not have his best teammate in Jamal Murray for the business end of the season, and even he wasn't an All-Star. Without Jamal and basically any other guards, Nuggets somehow started winning more games. Finished 3rd in a stacked West, leaving behind legit contenders like the Clippers and Lakers.  Apart from all of this, Jokic almost had a 50/40/90 season as a big, which is almost impossible and unheard of. He couldn't miss games because Nuggets would lose every game by double digits otherwise. This should be reason enough to consider his historic MVP season over Giannis'.   Jokic is a shooting big while Giannis is a paint presence, and yet Jokic had a better TS. 2018 Harden is debatable, but both of Giannis' years were not that impressive, atleast not more than Jokic's."
"MPJ. Considering what he put up as a third option and his numbers w/o Jamal Murray, yea I’m confident in MPJ’s chances this year since he’ll have a bigger role."
"Has to be MPJ. If Jamal Murray ends up missing most or all of the regular season, he could legitimately become an all star if his scoring output increases enough and his defense becomes okay."
"Think Jeff is an upgrade over Millsap.  I’m fine with jamychal playing center in today’s nba.  Definitely in win now mode but next year likely won’t be the year unless Jamal is superhuman with his recovery.  To have a good chance at winning a title next few years I think you still need Murray or porter to take a leap to all-nba caliber(top 15) which is a lot to ask.  Also wondering how much depth gets sacrificed once porter gets his extension and jokic signs supermax.  Nuggets fans won’t love this hot take but I think Morris gets traded by in a season or two because they have guard depth, will have a really tough time resigning him for market value, and could save some money.  Will have to rely on young guys they get late in the draft but those guys usually don’t contribute much to contenders"
I like the Aaron Gordon signing. Its a lot of money but he brings a lot to the team. His defense is solid and his slashing ability is elite-ish. Im curious to see what level Jamal Murray comes back at. Hopefully MPJ continues to get better.
"To be clear I'll rely on one of those metrics the day I doesnt see stuff like :  \- DRPM : Julius Randle, Joe Harris,Duncan Robinson and Jamal Murray in the top 15  \- DWS : Julius Randle, Jokic , Russ and Tobi Harris in the top 15  \- DBPM : Mason Plumlee, washed up Iggy, and TJ McConnell in the top 15 (Won't even mention who is 16th because it's hilarious)  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah for now I'll rely on my eye test, as flawed as it is, it's still better than total BS like that"
Jamal Murray doesn't injure his ACL
"I honestly feel like Jamal is Better than Jaylen because of scoring and playmaking, Jaylen is obviously a better defender but I feel like the scoring and playmaking is more important in a guard and that’s why I chose Murray"
Who knows 1.  When is Jamal Murray coming back?  2.  How good will he be at that point?  3.  Why hasn't MPJ resigned yet?  4.  Can we create on the permeter?
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
Yes but he played college ball at Murray State which pretty much confirms Jamal Murray taught him to play so he's better.
Replace Jamal Murray with let’s say…. maybe Austin Rivers. Where have I seen this before?
This is literally what happened to the nuggets previous season when Jamal Murray got hurt
"Didn't Jamal avg 26.5/4.8/6.6, come back from 3-1 twice in the same run, and was 1 Buzzer beater from going up 2-1 on the eventual champs in the 2020 playoffs, including having a 3 game run of 50,42,50 on the 1st 3-1 come back? Didnt he do a 360 layup around a 3 time DPOY in that come back? Didnt he do a fake up and under reverse in those playoffs around Lebron James who most consider to be top 3 all time? Who tf do y'all think Jaylen Brown is God disguised as Jaylen Brown gtfo. If Jaylen Brown was Jamal Murray you would havr won a ring in the last 5 years. They said Jaylen not Jason Tatum."
"&gt;Yeah and the Rockets and Warriors aren't dominating anymore lol. The West is not particularly different than it was then in terms of overall strength, even if the names are different  The Rockets are the only team that dropped whereas tons rose. My point stands lmao.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Our roster now is completely different than it was to start the year lol. We didn't even have Powell back then.  Same with the Nuggets and Warriors.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Just tell me you don't know our injuries. Did you know Murray played more games than either CJ or Nurkic did last season? That's 2 of our 3 best players lol. And Dame himself was playing injured for 15 games (a stretch where we went 4-11, so not much different than when Curry was just out).     And are either CJ or Nurkic better than Murray? Plus PJ and Barton. Curry missed 9 games and played the rest of the season injured, far worse than Dames injury.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I won't be surprised if the Warriors are better - though the age argument is dumb, considering both Draymond and Curry are older than either one of Dame/CJ, and Draymond especially is already clearly trending downward whereas both CJ and Dame are the best they've ever been - but acting like Klay isn't a question mark is silly.     Alright then. That's simple enough.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You're only using context for your own team lol. Like Simons and Little are 21 and 20 respectively. You think they won't improve too just like Wiseman and Poole?     Alright, I won't pretend to know much about those 2, but Poole took a massive leap last year and Wiseman was the 2nd pick for a reason, he's tremendously talented. Feel like it's a fair assumption to bet on the 2 guys for the Warriors.  &amp;#x200B;  You agree for the Warriors, that's fine. For the Nuggets, it's as simple as this.  The Nuggets have the best 1st option, the best 2nd option, the best 3rd option, and relatively equal depth.  The Nuggets convincingly beat the Blazers while missing their 2nd option and 2 key guards. They were literally missing 3/4 of their backcourt and still won in 6. No improvements the Blazers made changes that. The Nuggets DOMINATED in the regular season and the first round while heavily injured, they're better. None of the Blazers additions are equal to Jamal Murray, let alone the other 2 guards."
"I think its a stretch to say that hes better than jamal murray and jrue holiday RIGHT NOW, those guys are proven and have performed at the highest levels, but i feel like a lot of nephews here saying that hes the worst out of the players you listed are only saying that because they either a. dont watch the grizzlies whatsoever so they have no frame of reference or b. they only watch his highlights, assume that people think hes good only because his highlights are flashy, and convince themselves they are basketball analysts because they somehow ""know"" he doesnt have advanced stats numbers that matchup with the flair he has for the game.   People that actually watch games and grizzlies fans know that ja is special, and I would even go as far to say i think he will have a better career and be a better player than zion. Ja was the spoon that stirred the drink for memphis this season, and actually led his team to a playoff berth. Furthermore, along with zion, hes one of the most efficient players to come out of college since the likes of lebron james, steph curry, and anthony davis.    Yea he is still young, but put some respect on the guys name. De aaron fox is good, but I dont think he is on the level morant is even now, never mind in the future."
"As long as a future team change isn't too controversial he's close to a shoo in  He's the Nuggets first franchise MVP  The second player to make all nba 1st team (Thompson being the first)  And just 5 years into his career he's 7th in points (8360), 6th in rebounds (4437), 5th in assists (2697), and 1st in triple doubles (57)  He gets even better in the playoffs  Jokic is already 2nd in playoff points (1114), 1st in playoff rebounds (485), and 2nd in playoff assists (277).   The playoff points record is 1540 so he needs 17-18 games averaging around 25 points to beat that record but the assist record is only 280 so he can get that in a single game. Assuming a long career Jokic can annihilate the Denver Nuggets postseason playoff records like how LeBron dominates Clevelands.  Jamal Murray has been to 2 postseason's and he's already 5th in points and 4th in assists.  And for fun, just looking through stats randomly I saw that Chris Webber was only 12 points away from overtaking Oscar Robertson as the Kings all time playoff scorer. Durant is already the Nets 7th highest playoff scorer in a single 2nd round exit. Dwight is the Magics career leader in Points/rebounds/blocks for both the regular season and postseason. In Derrick Rose's short Bulls playoff career he already reached 5th in playoff points and 3rd in playoff assists. The Charlotte Hornets playoff history is so ass that in only 11 games Kemba Walker was already 7th in all time playoff points with #1 being ... David Wesley."
"He’s a super athletic guard who is also a pretty decent playmaker. Idk about him being better than Jamal Murray, holiday, or Zion but you could definitely make an argument for him being better than fox and jaylen brown."
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Joel Embiid  Bench  LaMelo Ball / Jamal Murray / Austin Rivers / Lu Dort / Jae Crowder / Robert Covington / Clint Capela  I legitimately think this team can go 82-0 if injuries are not a factor.
"Jamal Murray will miss most of the season with his ACL injury, and will probably need some time to knock off the rust when he does return. Michael Porter Jr. is an excellent player, but if he’s still a liability on defense, the Nuggs won’t win the title."
Jamal Murray will be injured for most of the season and we need to improve defensively
Jamal Murray blocking Lebron(I think it was Lebron) but ad hits the game winning three over Jokic
Assuming everyone is healthy all 82 games like the post mentioned  PG: Jrue Holiday SG: Bradley Beal (all star) SF: Paul George (all star) PF: Kevin Durant (superstar) C: Joel Embiid (superstar)   Bench PG: Jamal Murray SG: Malcolm Brogdon SF: OG Anunoby PF: Christian Wood C: Clint Capela
"A big who can handle the ball like jokic and a 2 way guard like kawhi for all stars i would have two athletic guards like Jamal Murray and Mitchell. For the role players id have jae crowder, joe Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr, javale Mcgee, Duncan Robinson, and Caruso. The end of the bench could be Grayson Allen and Jah"
"You need guys who can play almost every game, so Kawhi, LeBron, and AD are out for me. I think the logical two superstars to build around are Giannis and Jokic. They both cover each other's weaknesses, and the league is deep with guards so I feel better not taking a superstar there.   I need time to think about my other picks. I'll edit this post when I do.  Ok, here's my depth chart:  PG: DeAaron Fox, Jamal Murray  SG: Beal, Mikal Bridges, Bogdan Bogdanovich  SF: Kris Middleton, Tobias Harris  Pf: Giannis, Thad Young  Center: Jokic, Valanciunas,  Jarret Allen  This lineup has offensive and defensive versatility,  veteran leadership, and the ability to put floor spacing lineups out that don't sacrifice athletecism and defense.   I don't think any team could go 82-0 in today's NBA.   Superstars: Jokic, Giannis  All Stars: Middleton,  Beal. I chose two guys who could space the floor and move around Jokic.   Edit: Dropped FVV for Jamal Murray."
Other way around: it's amazing how Nuggets fans convinced themselves they would've won no matter what with Jamal Murray
I thought this was just reserved for wigs but then people kept saying it about Jamal Murray like???
I'm not defending this guy but that's not true at all lol. It's just annoying when Nuggets fans think they are Jamal Murray away from winning the series when yall got beat in 4 games by an average of 18 points
I will believe you when he shows what he got in the playoffs. Till then I respect Jamal Murray more.
Bro a week later he was traded and you got Jamal Murray for your troubles.   Don't be salty over shit from a decade ago.
I want the Jamal Murray experience
"We can have an actual discussion if you want. I understand injuries happen every year. What doesn’t happen is the literal most injured playoffs in nba history. [It’s not even an exaggeration.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/basketball/nba-record-all-stars-playoffs-injuries.html). It broke the all time record for most all stars missing. Not just that, it gets even worse when you consider exactly who was missing. You have Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden all either leaving early or playing on one leg. That’s 3 of the top 5 players and another top 10 player. Then you have Kyrie, Jaylen brown, Jamal Murray. All great players that would have changed the tides of their respective series. It’s clearly not just another “an injury happened” year. It’s very rare for both the eastern and western teams to make it through because the best teams in the conference all suffered major injuries. Most years the clear cut best team in the league wins, some seasons the second best team wins because of an injury, but it’s very rare for the 4-5 best teams in the league to Duke it out because 1,2, and 3 all got hurt. That’s all I’m saying."
"Yes, dude is a deadly shooter, all he pretty much has to do is improve his handle and he immediately vaults up to near superstar status’s it took Jamal Murray 5 seasons to become a 20ppg scorer, MPJ essentially became a 20ppg scorer in 2 seasons with low usage and shots a game. The guy can easily be a 25+ PPG scorer on great efficiency"
"Jamal Murray would not be a household name because he is not a top 5 player unlike K.D... At least bring up Jokic's name instead. Media can only control so much. Lakers have such long lasting history and fanbase and same with teams in New York that you can't just blame it on media unless you have no idea how any of it works.   K.D on thunder did not have as much spotlight because it was in a smaller market, i.e less fans. Media does not make the fanbase bigger. Stop with this nonsense. Media talked a lot about Lebron when he was on cavs and media is constantly hyping Luka and Trae Young, both not in super large markets."
Do you know why that’s a thing? It’s because that’s all the media jocks. The nuggets would get more fans if they were in the spotlight more. Do you think the nuggets personalities just aren’t as popular as Nets and Lakers players or is it they’re just in a market the media refuses to cover.   If Jamal Murray played in a large market he would be a household name. Same as Jokic. And I love how you blatantly ignore my question as to what will the league do when the Lebron KD and Curry retire? They don’t build up other players Giannis has two MVP’s more recently than any of those three mentioned. TWO. But you wouldn’t know it based on the Way the media talks about the bucks and Giannis
Against who would they get ousted by? Suns? Nuggets without Jamal Murray? Jazz with Mitchell missing a game?
Jamal Murray 50 piece with no free throw attempts
Kawhi and Jamal Murray
Irrational? Jamal Murray
Man the Jamal Murray IG video day was absolutely WILD
"Denver does not have the length, defense or athleticism to compete with a lot of the top teams. They're also flat out-worse than a bunch of teams in their own conference at key positions like Wing and PG.   MPJ had a strong end to the regular season but has clear flaws that got exposed in the playoffs, especially against teams with elite wings. I also don't think he will mesh well with Murray upon Murray's return.   Jamal Murray had 3+ dribbles or more on over 58% of his possessions in the bubble. 56% of his shots were Pull-up Jumpers. He surprisingly hits around 50% of his closely contested shots. He is at his best with the ball in his hands being a volume scorer. MPJ needs plays run for him, but Murray isn't a true play-maker nor is he a spot up shooter. Nikola already has to set the table for the team and set himself up for points. Are you going to decrease his shots to spur the development of MPJ?"
Denver nuggets are a championship team with healthy jamal Murray. And jamal Murray is a GOD
&gt;Nuggets played 2 months without Murray and played better without him  LMFAO   Dog are you really saying the Nuggets benefited from not having Jamal in the playoffs because they won some regular season games to end the year?
"Jamal Murray. People act likes an All-Star talent when healthy, which just isn't true. He's good, and has All-Star potential, but isn't there yet and that injury isn't helping his chances."
Do you want some more fun facts? SGA is minus 77 in the playoffs. Jamal Murray is plus 76.
Healthy Denver Nuggets and Jamal Murray
"DMitch, DBook, Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Fox, SGA, Simmons."
"Derrick is probably a better all around player than Dejounte and in the 2019 playoffs, outplayed Jamal Murray. Injuries and COVID derailed his last season, but he's every solid player....when healthy."
"Nets are the tier 1 contender.  After Nets, Lakers/Bucks probably tier 2a.  Having won it all kinda gives a bit of a boost.  Lakers have somewhat ill-fitting roster and some not great vets, but also have most championship pedigree and you can't count out LeBron.  Bucks probably gonna be deeper than last year and have gotten over the hump.  Tier 2b is Utah and Phoenix.  And Denver if Jamal Murray comes back strong.  Really great teams, just have to get over the hump.  Rest of the teams are dark horses, but there are a ton of teams out there that could easily upset the tier 2 teams, absolute boat load of tier three contenders.  76ers with a good Simmons trade absolutely tier 2, I just didn't rank them without knowing what the trade is."
"For this year, likely.   There team is really built around the Embid-Simmons duo, which really shows when you look at how much they rely on Curry to be a volume shooter like his brother.   I think the exciting part about the NBA is that by finding the right running mate for Embid, they can re-make this team over the course of the off-season. If I were Morey, I would focus more on “assets” for when the next perimeter playmaker comes available (maybe Sexton, Jamal Murray if they pick MPJ over him, or Cole Anthony if he really shows out and gets crowded out of ORL)."
"Jamal Murray had one hot bubble run, that's it.  He's a streaky shooter and hasn't really proved anything else.  Same with Ingram, he's a decent shooter but can't do much else and hasn't really proved anything as of yet.  In a hypothetical situation, if you had those 4 guys lead a team as the #1 guy and the teams were perfectly constructed for their strengths, I believe the Simmons led team would go furthest.  Even without a jump shot or FT shooting he can still fill the stats.  The issue is him and Embiid operate in the same area so he seems worse than he actually is"
"It's with regulars that's why, but a very unpopular take I have is Jamal Murray is one of the most overrated players in the league"
I think the Nuggets know the Gordon deal isn't what they'd want but they got screwed a bit by the Jamal Murray injury and if they want a real look at what the group they have can do they're forced to overpay a little.
"Jamal Murray is one of them. Dude can go nuclear, but also puts up a lot of very pedestrian statlines."
Jamal fucking Murray ladies and gentleman
"AG gives Denver the length needed to match up with the best in the West. After losing Grant to the Pistons, Denver needed someone to replace the role that Grant played for Denver: putting him against guys like LeBron and Kawhi, who the Nuggets will realistically face in any kind of road to a championship  Grant was gonna get paid $20m/yr who was a worse fit on this team compared to Gordon. AG plays better defense but is worse offensively, but also fits the team’s culture. Grant wanted to be ‘that guy’. AG already had the opportunity to try that, and it didn’t work out well for him. On a team with Jamal Murray, MPJ, and Jokic, that’s not an issue. He knows his role in Denver and he’s got all the right tools. He’s a perfect fit for this team, and considering that Denver couldn’t replace his contract since we’re already near-capped, especially with MPJ extension coming, this is a good deal for both sides.   For any other team? No, but that seems to be the one caveat a lot of people can’t really understand. All they see are his ppg on some website and think this is an overpay for some scrub lol"
"The Jazz I have lower than consensus. They got exposed in the playoffs and was the 1 seed last season. I expect them to regress to the mean which is a 5 seed.   The Heat I have lower than consensus. I just don’t think an out of prime Lowry will move their needle too much. Probably another 1st round out if they fall on the lower half of the Bracket. And with the rise of ATL and the star power of Boston, BKN, and Milwaukee, it’s likely inevitable.    I expect Denver to overperform off of the back of MPJ’s improvement. I expect him to have a breakout year and help Denver to secure a top 3 or 4 seed even with Jamal Murray out.    TWolves I can see making the play-in. I’m banking on Ant’s improvement as well."

nah just grew up in Canada watching bball and wondered why TSN never showed Spurs highlights but always had a boner for Steve Nash.  but yeah I grew up and know why they did it now. Wish they highlighted Jamal Murray as much as they did Steve Nash
You mean Reggie Miller and MJ’s son Jamal Murray?
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"It blows my mind that Kobe is even considered in the same stratosphere as West, let alone better. West revolutionized the game as he was playing. What's Kobe done that relative scrubs like Donovan Mitchell or Jamal Murray haven't already been doing, just taking a lot of shots?"

"obviously???? very differently??????? come on dude seriously what wouldve been so different. jamal murray isnt lebron or kawhi like other teams missed. they had their mvp. i said before i think series goes to 6 max if nugs are healthy. lakers and clippers on the other hand, they 100% wouldve won in 5-6 if it werent for like i said lebron AD and kawhi out"
"I agree with your earlier comment that KD is vastly more switchable than Curry.    But Curry is legit better than several on this list: Schroder (by a LARGE margin), Jamal Murray, Rubio, Lillard by a MASSIVE margin, Westbrook without a doubt, Luka on a good day and Sexton too.    You're massively massively overrating the defense of several folks on this list."
"Chris Paul  Smart/Schroder  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons   Kyle Lowry  Harden (or Kyrie)  Lonzo  Conley  Dejounte Murray  Devonte' Graham  Jamal Murray  Patrick Beverley  Brogdon  Rubio  Terry Rozier (or LaMelo)  Lillard  Westbrook  Luka  Sexton  who here is Curry objectively a better defender than?  because if he's not better than at least 4 or 5 of them, he is below average.  that is how average works lol"
Surprised no one's saying jamal murray
Denver wasn’t that good. We would have ended it in 5 if they were healthy. Jamal Murray doesn’t change the way we dominated them
Jamal Murray &gt; Brandon Ingram
because of course jamal murray is the only difference maker between all 4 of the suns wins and they wouldve lost if he was playing even though they still had their mvp center... mins you the suns also won 3 of the 4 games by over 14 points... guys i know im a suns fan so i will seem biased but even if the nuggets somehow got past the suns (i dont think it wouldve gone past 6) i dont ever see them beating the clips or bucks.

Jamal Murray &gt; Ja Morant
"Cries in Phoenix Suns.  We took Dragan Bender 4th above Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield.  We took Marquese Chriss 8th above Domontas Sabonis, Paskal Siakam and Caris Lavert.  We took Tyler Ulis 34th above Malcolm Brogdon."
1.	Jaylen Brown 2.	Jamal Murray 3.	Ben Simmons 4.	Pascal Siakam 5.	Brandon Ingram 6.	Domantas Sabonis 7.	Dejounte Murray 8.	Fred VanVleet 9.	Malcolm Brogdon 10. Caris LeVert 11. Jakob Poeltl 12. Buddy Hield
I would go with either Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray or Pascal Siakam
"He was averaging better numbers this reg season than he did in the bubble.   Nuggets starting backcourt was Facu Campazzo and Austin Fucking Rivers, why are you acting like Jamal Murray wouldn't have made a difference"
Nuggets with Jamal Murray win it all? Can we stop this? It’s seriously not even funny anymore. Jamal Murray is at best a top 35 player in the league.
Jamal Murray is never dropping 50 in the playoffs ever again lmaoooo
"not a doctor but just love to learn about biomechanics and stuff of that nature, to answer your question really just certain muscles overcompensating for others that are hurt/fatigued, one example of this is last year if you go back and look jamal murray was out before he tore his *left* acl. he was out prior to this with a sore *right* knee, with how these guys utilize explosiveness, being careful with one side can lead to injuries on the other"
"KNICKS GET: expiring Carmelo Anthony contract (he was going to sign with them in the offseason anyway since he telegraphed that they were the only team he wanted to go to... but he wanted to play for them immediately and New York catered to his wishes)  NUGGETS GET: Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, Raymond Felton, draft picks (including Jamal Murray)."
The pick in the Bargnani deal almost became Jamal Murray. Even so that pick ended up being significant piece in the Kawhi trade.  Managing to turn Bargnani into a ring is nothing short of sheer wizardry.
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it’s guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc… fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they’re my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
Ice in the vines is sick I can’t believe the “he didn’t even stretch tho” kid came up with that  I also love the wesley Mathews/Jamal Murray arrows after the 3pt shot
"Nuggets. Nikola Jokic (Incredible and unique in his excellence) and Jamal Murray (Canadian), and I have a soft spot for Colorado sports anyway because I grew up very close to Nathan Mackinnon"
Nobody mentioning Jamal Murray Blue Arrow?
And Jamal Murray
If only Jamal Murray was healthy. I miss the rivalry between Mitchell and him
"&gt; Lavine isn’t as good a playmaker as Beal, Booker, Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, but he’s a better scorer than all of them—  K  But you started by saying they were worse, so who the fuck has the shorter attention span?"
Jamal Murray in shambles
"I like the new guys: Booker, Mitchell, Tatum Jokic and them. Really hope Jamal Murray comes back and joins that group."
"Jamal Murray, SGA, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Clint Capela"
"Lavine isn’t as good a playmaker as Beal, Booker, Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, but he’s a better scorer than all of them— especially if he gets to play off the ball. He’s the scoring guard every superstar— especially the heliocentric types— would kill to play with. I’m not sure the general NBA public understands the guy is just a paragon of efficiency."
The nuggets even with a healthy Jamal Murray isn’t a serious title contender. Second round exit team.

What Jamal Murray vid does your username reference?
Jamal Murray = The Blue Arrow
"Zach Lavine: he almost seems to glide with his movements. And every finish of his seems to be reminding everyone of his athleticism.  Kawhi Leonard: its just something about his jumper that makes you almost picture the path of the ball from his hand to the basket. His shot is like one of those oddly satisfying videos on the internet, you just know that everything will fall in place.  Jamal Murray: that man can almost walk on air with his layup package."
I think Jamal murray is Canadian. He's gotta be on the team if true.
It real nice but it aint [Jamal Murray 360 off Gobert in playoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPg7fBt6X7I&amp;ab_channel=KevinJames) nice
Jamal Murray Esque
Always thought Jamal Murray had that smooth feel
Shortly before the bubble a video of Jamal and his girlfriend spending some *quality time* together surfaced  KDs hair is very similar to what Murray has going on
[Here' a great impression of Jamal Murray ](https://i.imgur.com/zI2wMY5.jpg)
That's a good point but you also have to consider Doncic doesn't have any reliable second options. If he had a Jamal Murray or CJ McCollum he might not gas so hard.
"He avenged 29.5/14.5/4.5 for the third place Nuggs who were missing Jamal Murray basically the whole year. I’d say that’s an MVP year if you ask me, but what do I know you are obviously the expert here."
Jamal murray
I’d say Jamal Murray has done more for his bid than CJ. Tough being out west.
"Oh, you must have forgotten OG finished with 32 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists with 7 steals on 12/16 from the field, 3-6 from three, 5-5 from the line and 87.9% True Shooting. All while defending Jamal Murray through to Nikola Jokic. When Miles Bridges has a season better than OG's last season, then we can talk.  They are both basically splitting it so far. FVV is the primary ballhandler but in terms of shots against the Celtics it was 18 for OG vs 10 for FVV, against the Wizards it was 17 vs 20 and tonight against the Mavs 17 vs 15. Pretty much even, and that comes with FVV chucking up a couple of shots that he shouldn't such as trying to lay it in through two defenders of a drive or getting the ball off an offensive rebound and immediately throwing up a deep three with a defender in his face."
You mean Jamal Murray lol?
"Everyone shot well in the bubble for whatever reason, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell were trading 50 point games off in the playoffs.   Those two seasons are gonna look weird."
Just wait til Jamal Murray back
"Take it. 80% of the Jamal Murray we saw last year + MPJ's likely improvements + MVP Jokic + AG, and health for everyone else probably still would be enough. 80% of last year's Jamal Murray is still a really good player."
"Let's put it this way. Lakers probably have the highest star power on top. LeBron and AD are two superstar level talent. Only duo who beats them is KD and Harden. But their bench pieces are incompetent compared to the other good teams in the West. Like sure Lakers could win in the first quarter but when LeBron sits, it looks grim. And you're underestimating Playoff Spida too much he elevates his game in the playoffs. Suns are too stable of a team to be knocked off by LeBron and AD alone (yes I said LeBron and AD alone because unless they fix their chemistry issues, LeBron and AD and Rondo isn't gonna trio squad Ayton, Crowder, Bridges,  CP3 and Booker). I think Lakers got a good read on Denver but Jokic has better pieces this year with Jamal Murray coming back and a much more improved MPJ.   LeBron and AD is fine. I'm just worried about Westbrook and the bench."
"We are hoping that once Murray comes back after the all-star break we can alternate Morris and Barton with the bench unit, given that Jamal can play both guard positions. Also we will see how the Bones-Rivers situation develops, given that Malone has said that Bones has done enough to get minutes in the rotation, and Rivers is not playing well right now.  At the end of the day it probably won't matter, the playoff rotation will need Murray at an All-star level to really be 1st tier contenders, and if we are healthy we alredy have the 9 men rotation with Murray/Barton/MPJ/AG/Jokic and Monte/Dozier/Green/Green off the bench, with Campazzo for certain matchups, and maybe one of the young guys breaks out at some point."
"What do the nba rules say, cause if you go and search for the landing rule on Nba video rulebook you can clearly see that shooters land 1-2 ft in front Look at this video, full of shooters landing in front Curry, Joe Ingles, CJ, Patty Mills, Graham, Jamal Murray, Beasly. https://youtu.be/IUDJpB9UbQc  In FIBA they state that your cylinder lenght is lenght of when you put ball in front of you with your arms half bent on your elbows, but in NBA that is in practice a little more. https://youtu.be/mMaAAANyP8Q from same game his foot moves for more than one shoe lenght which is easy more than 1ft."
&gt;Nick Wrong  -Jamal Murray
"And got salty when Jamal Murray called him Nick Wrong. That crew that pale motherfucker works with is nothing but cringe, they have a football guy talk basketball with zero fucking knowledge, and they all seem to pretend that he knows his shit. But that may have some sense into it, because no one but probably Broussard and Lowe (who is there occasionally) know anything about basketball. Wrong even boasted that he didn't start with covering basketball, but boxing. And he's making six-seven figures off of that jack-shit knowledge. Proof that anyone can make it.  The funniest part is that Broussard and Lowe have the MVP vote and for a good fucking reason. And they all turn on them when they say something that actually makes some sense. It's ""wrong answers only"" shitshow."
Its Jamal Murray from the sidelines demanding more plays for Facu.
If only the Lakers had Jamal Murray healthy
"Losing Caruso (and KCP) and replacing them with the corpse of Trevor Ariza + Kendrick Nunn was uh... not a good move, to say the least. Nunn has never been close to the defender KCP or Caruso are. Ariza was literally unplayable in the playoffs (but the Heat had to play him because he was the only other wing they had). Ariza *is not a good player anymore.* This idea that the Lakers are favorites in the West just because they got Russ and a bunch of poor fitting pieces is lunacy to me. They might win a lot of games, if healthy. But I dont think I'd pick them over the Jazz, Suns, and certainly not over a healthy Nuggets team (with Jamal Murray at at least 85% operational ability)."
Probably the Nuggets if they can get Jamal Murray healthy
If Jamal Murray was fully healthy I would have to pick the Nuggets.
It's a pretty mediocre draft but I think it goes -  1. Jaylen Brown 2. Jamal Murray 3. Ben Simmons 4. Siakam 5. Ingram  With Dejonte and Sabonis right there
"Fam Dame played the nuggets (without Jamal Murray) lmao not the 2004 pistons Jesus. Dames direct matchup was Austin rivers, Facu Campazzo and monte Morris"
If Jamal Murray can come back fully healthy by the playoffs the nuggets are legit title contenders.
"Nah, Jamal Murray was about to dominate the playoffs.  Would've been a Nuggs - Clippers WCF with Jamal hitting the buzzer beater to advance.  Nuggets would've swept the Bucks and Giannis would leave Milwaukee to play for Denver this year.  Duh."
"I'm going to throw a few bullshit names at you, and out of curiosity, (ignoring contracts), who would you 1-for-1 Ben for?  Colin Sexton  Brandon Ingram  CJ McCollum  Jerami Grant  Demar Derozan  Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray  Malcom Brogdon  Domantas Sabonis  Chris Lavert  Fred Vanvleet  Kemba Walker"
Idk how I feel about calling Murray “Jamal”. Doesn’t sound right
It wasn’t just Jamal. We were also missing Barton and dozier. You saw how dominant the starters looked last night when we weren’t forced to start facu and Austin rivers.  Murray should be back around the ASB
MPJ was injured in the suns series. He and Aaron Gordon were both playing through injuries because the team couldn't be down both those two and a number of their guards (not even including Jamal Murray).
"Ignoring this saga completely, suppose you did a 2016 redraftables...just based on on-court stuff.   Even then, I don't think he's #1 anymore, is he?   I think you'd still take him over Brogdon, at least due to age. I'm not totally convinced he's a better player than Dejounte Murray. DJ has shown more development, and is nearly the same class of defender. I'm not totally convinced he's a better player than Sabonis. I think he's *clearly* behind Jaylen Brown. What about Ingram? Siakam? Jamal Murray? I think he's better, but not by much. You can talk yourself into ""Ben Simmons is not a top-5 guy from his draft class."""
The suns have been memeing all year making fun of the Jamal Murray narrative while failing to realize he wasn’t the only guy we were missing.  It’s a world of different when you don’t have to start facu and Austin rivers.
"If Jamal Murray was playing, we'd be down by 25"
Hornets vs bulls. The athleticism both team possess is fun.   Hawks verse the nets this time around to see two draw foul gods go at it in trae young and harden.   Nuggets when Jamal Murray is fully healthy against the warriors.
"Harden is a good one. That’s the main knock on him too though. And hey, if you wanna pick Blake Griffin, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray and whoever else over KD, Harden, Beal, PG13, Ibaka, Oladipo, Adams, Melo, and potentially LeBron and AD this year be my guest. I would take the second group personally."
"CP3 played with Harden, Booker, and Blake Griffin  Harden played with KD, Russ, Kyrie, CP3, and a fuckload of quality roleplayers   Jokic has one of the best offensive rosters in the league and Jamal Murray was their best player in the 2020 postseason"
"&gt;The Clips without Kawhi were far better in the playoffs than the Nuggets without Murray and Kawhi is far superior to Jamal  you know they were missing more than just murray right?  they had to play austin rivers 40 mins and he was picked up 3 weeks before the playoffs lol  &gt;they wildly overreacted to some 7 game win streak in March about the Nuggets.  the ""7 game win streak"" was actually a 23-7 after the gordon trade, which is a 63 win pace over a full feason  &gt;Same team that needed multiple 3-1 comebacks just to win playoff series in the bubble before getting punked by the Lakers  ...are we shitting on a team for getting to WCF and losing to prime lebron + AD?  &gt;they really arent that good and no Aaron Gordon really doesnt change as much as people claim he does.  pretty sure people are projecting them as a contender mostly because MPJ is entering his 3rd season looking like a 6'10 ray Allen   OP asked for spicy takes, not ""I haven't watched a game in 3 years"" takes"
"I have an old tweet where I trashed the Jaylen Brown pick. I wanted Jamal Murray at the #3 spot.  Every so often someone digs it up like “HMMMM????? HOWD THIS WORK OUT”. I still stand by feeling that way at the time, I’d still take Jamal Murray."
"538's 5 year value estimates of various players (not be-all, end-all, just a reference point):  - Simmons: $156 - Brown: $129m - Jamal Murray: $143m - Ingram: $100m - Siakam: $72m - Sabonis: $107m - Brogdon: $54m - Levert: $53m - Dejounte Murray: $103m  I'm taking Jamal Murray."
For philly probably Jamal Murray and then keep their pick in the next draft and go with Tatum
Jamal murray or brandon ingram
"The only similarity between Bender and Luka in any way is they’re both European. That’s like saying teams should’ve passed on Shai or Jamal Murray because we saw another Canadian player in Anthony Bennett become a bust.   Also Bender sucked in Europe. The reason him and most euro prospects get drafted is the potential they have based on the skill they showcase and their physical characteristics. Luka was nothing like that, he was literally their MVP. He was playing at an extremely high level at that exact time and wasn’t some low floor project player"
"The ""healthy"" Nuggets are the most overrated team in the NBA and still wouldve lost comfortably in 5-6 games last year even with Jamal Murray. The Clips without Kawhi were far better in the playoffs than the Nuggets without Murray and Kawhi is far superior to Jamal, people just dont hold the Nuggets to expectations of top market teams and felt sorry for them due to the Jamal injury. Same team that needed multiple 3-1 comebacks just to win playoff series in the bubble before getting punked by the Lakers, they really arent that good and no Aaron Gordon really doesnt change as much as people claim he does."
2010 Magic  Jamal Murray (Jameer Nelson)  Caris LeVert (Vince Carter)  Torrey Craig (Matt Barnes)  Nicolas Batum (Rashard Lewis)  Clint Capela (Dwight Howard)
I wouldn't trade an injured Jamal Murray for Ben Simmons
"The guy above is being a huge douche, but I have to respectfully disagree. The warriors were only play-in last year because Steph missed a critical stretch of about 8-10 games (all of which were very winnable with Steph, but of which the Warriors lost all but one) which moved them down by about 4 seeds. Also, they had to deal with Wiseman's struggles in the first half of the season, Oubre's horrendous mismatch with the team's offense, and Brad Wanamaker leading the second unit (among a host of issues).  This year, the team is SO much better than last year in roster construction with or without Klay. For instance, Mychal Mulder was starting games and getting serious minutes in our play-in games last year, and was third in line for our 15th spot this year. And even with last year's roster we would've been about 6th seed if not for Steph's injury.  Meanwhile, the Clippers (Kawhi out) and Lakers (many reasons) look worse than last year, and Nuggets don't have Jamal Murray for now. I'm definitely biased, but I think barring more bad injury luck, Warriors are solidly a playoffs team even before Klay gets back (in my mind, mid-tier playoffs team)."
"Ayton was their only consistent inside scorer and interior defensive presence in that playoff run.   MPJ’s scoring prowess is easily offset by the likes of Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, AG, and Will Barton. etc. MPJ may have the bigger hype but his skillset was easily replaceable on the Nuggets compared to what Ayton brought for the Suns."
"Currently and at full health?   LeBron, KD, Giannis, Steph, Harden, Kawhi, PG, AD, Jokic, Embiid, Tatum, Luka, Trae, Kyrie, Jamal Murray, DMich and DBook"
"I'm saying because they have that perception people try to be contrarian and karma farm by defending them. Look at the top 5 most underrated, its not teams like the lakers, even though their over/under is only 4 games better than the nuggets without jamal murray at 52 wins which seems low af, or the nets or the bucks which they should be according to your logic of everyone hating the jazz and small markets, its all small market teams (and the knicks, but they might as well be small market lol).  Defending small market teams will always be easy karma here, and the perception of them I've noticed is always higher here than on other nba mediums or general public thats all I'm trying to say"
Sorry you're so mad lol. I was just pointing out a flaw in your argument. I don't actually care since we roflstomped u in the finals  1 player played in the series (dbook) Another didn't (Jamal Murray b/c of a real injury ;) )  Way to portray yourself as an idiot and asshole
Was Jamal Murray playing?
"&gt;he got cooked on defense because he was literally the only option with Jamal Murray out, and had to carry the team on offense to even keep it respectable.  Nah, they picked on him on every possession, just like I've been watching been done to him for years. He's simply too slow to hedge on screens well  &gt;and calling something hilarious because you don’t feel like finding out ur wrong, is in fact, hilarious.  Bruh, no offense...but you have no idea at all what you're talking about. You just told me that DeAndre Ayton, who didn't even play half the season, and missed the playoffs...was a more impactful defensive player than Anthony Davis. So I'd say 'hilarious' is a mostly fitting term"
"he got cooked on defense because he was literally the only option with Jamal Murray out, and had to carry the team on offense to even keep it respectable. and calling something hilarious because you don’t feel like finding out ur wrong, is in fact, hilarious."
There is porn out there that is more NBA related than this WNBA post.  Jamal Murray getting top
"The Jazz have a glaring perimeter defense problem, and there’s no way Jamal Murray is the difference between getting swept by the Suns and winning the finals."
"For those saying wiggins is a good contract, let's look at the contracts within 3 million of wiggins aav.   KAT  Klove   Brandon Ingram  Jamal murray  Cp3  Gordon Hayward  Wiggins  Embiid  Jokic  Dlo  Julius Randle  Kyle lowry  Demar derozan  Al horford  Jaylen brown  Of these players I think there's only kevin love and al horford that wiggins is definitely better than"
Yeah I believe 1st half of the season when Jamal Murray was healthy he was in the “club” but after he got hurt and Jokic had to take over the offense more so his 3pt% dipped since without Murray it made it easier for defenses to focus in on Jokic.
How about when lebron was assigned to Jamal Murray in 2020?
I’d be all for that because it means either Jamal Murray or Kyle Lowry get a ring and both of those are excellent outcomes.
Did he not guard Tony Parker for the 4th quarter in game 6 against the Spurs in 2013? I distinctly remember him guarding Parker that last possession before OT when he threw up that off balance shot. He definitely also guarded Jamal Murray in the 4th quarter of one of the games against Denver in 2020. He did a good job both games so I’m not sure where your conviction that he couldn’t guard 1’s is coming from.
Jamal Murray comes back in March &amp; Nuggets win the finals
"They are! The Suns are a good team but Jamal Murray is coming back, if Klay comes back healthy as well those rosters are simply more talented and deeper than the Suns."
"Nah, sorry that is bullshit.  I agree that the Raptors most likely don't win if the Warriors dont get decimated.  But last year was a real outlier for playoff team injuries, particularly important/star players.  Just off the top of my head:  Clippers: - Kawhi Leonard (best player on team) out injured  Lakers - LeBron and AD out or dealing with injuries   Nuggets - Jamal Murray, Will Barton, PJ Dozier  Nets - Crippled Harden playing on one leg, Kyrie out.  Hawks - Trae Young tweaks ankle in game three against Bucks  Jazz - Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out or dealing with injuries.  All the serious contenders suffered injuries to one or more of their most important players.  The Bucks did great and earned that ring. But to suggest that injuries played no part is dishonest rubbish."
"You don’t think nuggets have a legitimate chance of out seeding the mavs? Bruh. Even without Jamal Murray, Nuggets are favorites over the mavs by most of the community. Also, Clippers will def get worse with no kawhi but I’m still putting them at mavs/blazers tier, they def have a chance to outseed mavs. Blazers are a legit toss up, I prob favor mavs but there’s not a huge gap btwn them in my eyes. Bullock and Brown are decent additions but it’s nothing special and I also don’t like the coaching shift of Carlisle to Kidd, I think it’s a downgrade and this is coming from someone who is not a huge fan of Carlisle."
"LMAO what a fucking joke. You're biased because your a Bulls fan that wanks off to the early 2010s when Thibs ruined your chance of a title. Jimmy Butler trade would have worked if Butler wasn't a selfish cunt and you know Thibs was a half decent talent evaluator. Want to know how the Thibs thing would have worked out? If Thibs would have just drafted Jamal Murray to pair with KAT, Lavine, and Wiggins. Instead Thibs threw away draft picks and grabbed every over the hill former Bulls player. Thibs is absolutely a garbage player evaluator."
"He drafted Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray, he fucking sucked dude."
"Well that Heat team doesn't exist anymore as they added 2 starters to their squad since then.  I just like how each of those squads has a guard, wing, and a big who could be considered All-Star caliber, Heat have Lowry/Jimmy/Bam, and when Jamal comes back Nuggets have Murray/MPJ/Jokic  Plus Miami adding Lowry and Tucker reminds me of Phoenix getting CP3 and Crowder last year."
"i actually can't. ain't no way Kyle Lowry is worse than VanVleet, Fox, and Morant. Don't get me started on Jamal Murray. No fucking way you believe that. I'd agree on Trae, I forgot about him.   Your list makes me think you prefer guys with a flashy bag of tricks. Also insinuating that LaMelo comes close to Lowry is just wrong, dude's done nothing yet in his career. In 5 years, yes he'll likely be better than Lowry."
"He averaged more potential assists per game than Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic last year, and about the same as Jamal Murray. If the rest of the Cavs could actually hit open shots, his assist numbers would be a lot better."
"Just imagine if the Warriors had a healthy Jamal Murray tonight, tho."
"Not true, Jamal Murray don't play for them."
They would lose all these games with Jamal Murray healthy
"Yea, but if Jamal Murray was playing..."
Lmao Jamal Murray has become a meme for Suns fans and dude hasn’t even been on the court. Poor guy
"Means nothing, Jamal Murray wasn't healthy."
No they got lucky Jamal Murray and AD weren't playing.
League better hope Jamal Murray returns soon or the Suns might be taking the west again.
No Jamal murray
If they had Jamal Murray they would blowout the suns
Smh. Warriors would've dominated if Jamal Murray was healthy
Still not getting too excited. Tying franchise record of 17-game winning streak? So what?   Suns only winning coz Jamal Murray aint playing yet..
If Jamal Murray was healthy they woulda won
Doesn't count. Jamal Murray and AD weren't healthy.
suns would’ve lost if Jamal murray was playing
"When the Suns get Jamal Murray Back the Warriors are done,"
"And Jamal Murray also didnt play. Suns too luck, Jamal would have tipped the Warriors over."
Jamal Murray isn't playing so it doesn't count
When Jamal Murray tore his ACL I had a comment up within like 13 seconds saying that  Murray had torn his ACL
When Jamal Murray tore his ACL he had a video up within like 20 mins saying that Murray had torn his ACL.
We’re Jamal Murray now :(
Book wouldn’t have gotten hurt if Jamal Murray was healthy!
What about Jamal Murray?
"Sorry, prepare for a long one....  MPJ was amazing for the 18 games after Murray went down, yes. But in the playoffs he was basically a 3&amp;D role player. Had some really great quarters, some really bad games (game 3 (or 4?) against Portland he scored just 3 points for instance). Put it this way - MPJ to this point in his career has not shaped a playoff series in the way that Jokic completely controlled the series against Portland, or against LAC / Utah, or Portland and SAS 3 years ago, or in the way that Jamal Murray completely changed the Utah series / Game 7 vs LAC, for instance. Hell, MPJ's never even affected a playoff series in the way that Aaron Gordon has (back with Orlando he actually did a good job defending Kawhi in their series vs Toronto, Orlando was just so overmatched it didnt really matter).  So to your point - there are a lot of guys stepping up in ways that they werent able to last year. Aaron Gordon has been terrific all year. Defensively he's been incredible, guarding 5 positions and usually the best player on the opponent. Offensively he's really blossoming in the last two weeks since MPJs injury - he's punishing switches when he has a smaller wing or guard on him (which is most games), and getting to the rim relentlessly. He didnt really get a chance to show that stuff last year. Will Barton is CLEARLY much healthier than he was in the playoffs against PHX - people will say he and Monte were healthy against PHX but they clearly are moving better, more explosively this year, etc. It's really not close. So until Jamal Murray comes back the big fill in's for MPJ will be AG and Will Barton who have been terrific all year, again, and some others here and there.  Bones is fun because he gives them a dynamic off the bench that Denver just hasnt had, maybe since JR Smith? Or since Will Barton was much younger? He can come in and immediately just fill it up and score in bunches, plays with such enthusiasm and energy. They definitely didnt have a guy like that last year off the bench.  Last point to be made as well - right now, they're starting Jeff Green at the 3/4 in place of MPJ and while the ceiling is *so much lower* for what he can do and what those lineups can do compared to the possibilities with MPJ, the frontcourt of Gordon, Green, and Jokic is something like +26 in net rating so far - 130 offensive rating, 104 defensive. That rating will come down. But Green as a smart vet who's been around just understands how to play on both ends. Understands where and when to cut, and he's enormous, and can also punish switches just as AG can, which opens more avenues for Jokic and Gordon. MPJ is more talented than Green. No doubt. But MPJ also very clearly doesnt really understand 5 on 5 basketball yet for whatever reason, at least not consistently... That's part of why he has had stretches where things look great, and stretches this year where things look bad and super clunky because he doesnt really know where to move without the ball to open things for himself or his teammates. Or he's hesitant which makes it a beat too slow.  So all that said - the Nuggets really just need to hover around 4th-6th until Jamal Murray comes back. My bet is he's back in March. And when he's back, they'll go on a big time run (partly because he makes them that much better, and partly because after ASB, the Nuggets have 23 games, 14 of them at home, and only 2 b2bs in that stretch... it's the easiest schedule in the league post ASB)."
"And even if we beat full strength Warriors, they would say it was because Jamal Murray is injured"
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
"hahah, I would never.   Jamal Murray honestly doesn't get enough love for his floor general skills, most people just think of him as a 2 playing the 1"
"Still PG dominant league: Steph, Luka, Trae, Ja, CP3, Dame, Harden, Jamal Murray, Kyrie, Fox, Jrue, SGA, Dejounte Murray, FVV...  Teams winning a championship without an elite calibre point guard is still the exception, not the rule. GSW wouldn't be where they are w/o Steph, Suns wouldn't w/o CP3, Bucks don't win until they land Jrue, Raptors w/o Lowry, so on etc."
Remember when Jamal Murray tried to get 50 on the Celtics after smacking them all game and Kyrie got upset and threw the ball into the stands?  When do you think Nike puts out a clown shoes version of Kyries?
"This year is just like Book's year was last year for Zach. The Bulls were pretty good last year, but not quite a playoff team (partly because Zach caught COVID at the worst possible time and came back and couldnt find his range for a bit).  The year before last, the Suns were not very good, but then they were the Bubble darlings. Then they got CP3 and Ayton matured and they got Jae Crowder and everything fell into place, and they had a very fortunate playoff run. Not taking away from their accomplishment, but that's a fact. I am *not* saying they wouldnt have made the Finals if Jamal Murray / Kawhi / AD/Bron were healthy. I am just saying they took advantage of that.  This year the Bulls are on a similar path so far in terms of... They might not go to the Finals, but they're a really, really damn good team with a ton of weapons and options, and Zach and DeMar are clearly the head of the spear, just as Book and CP3 are for the Suns. Vuc+Caruso+Lonzo makes for a really good supporting cast around those two, just as the Suns supporting cast works really well for CP3/Book.   If you just compare the stats head to head it's really not that close between LaVine and Book, and Book did nothing before CP3 arrived in PHX.  Last year:  Player A: 27, 5, and 5 on 51/42/85, .8 steals, .5 blocks.  Player B: 26, 4, and 4 on 48/34/87, .8 steals, .2 blocks.  this year:  Player A: 25, 5, 4 on 48/39/87, .5 steals, .3 blocks.  Player B: 24, 5, 4 on 45/41/85, 1 steal, .3 blocks.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Player A is Zach. Objectively the better shooter/scorer, objectively the better athlete. His team was worse last year but he was the better player."
"And he doesnt even have his second best player/partner in the two man game/the heart of the team in Jamal. Think about that.   He is one great shooter away from the game being so, so incredibly easy for him. One Jamal Murray away."
"Well, he's never lost in the first round in his career so far... and the team right now is better than the one that beat Portland because of Bones, Barton being healthy, Monte being healthy, AG being more integrated/doing more stuff for them. They're also just game out of 3rd (if the Clips lose today, because the Mavs lost as well today). Think if he gets a top 3 seed with this roster and this many injuries, there'll be more respect put on him.   Also I think he's really just one elite shooter away from the game being just so, so easy for him. One Jamal Murray, you might say."
"It's sad that the nuggets got destroyed by injuries. I mean even with Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr out, they still have Barton and Gordon who are good players. If they were fully healthy, they're contenders."
"The thing with the Jokic is that people are going to keep saying ""best player on the best team""... but Denver lost MPJ early, Jamal Murray will be out until March and Jokic missed half a dozen games so the team had lost a bunch in a row when Jokic was out which is why the Nuggets are 10-10 now.... :("
Nuggets didn't have Micheal Porter Jr. or Jamal Murray...
"Sorry brotha, before the season started, I had my doubts about you guys with Jamal coming back from injury but I figured a Jokic/MPJ would still be scary AF.. Here's good luck to Murray coming back 100% and rip apart the league. Long live the true Maple Jordan"
"Grant wanted a bigger role with more usage. Nuggets wanted that role for MPJ so Jerami found a team that would give him what he wanted. Denver offered to match the deal but he said no.  Nuggets mismanaged that whole affair.  &gt; Jerami Grant on leaving Nuggets: “My growth as a player is extremely important to me” &gt; In their sales pitch, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant to help develop him as a player, a source said. It didn’t matter. After Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr., **the best the Nuggets could offer him was a fourth option in a budding offense**. They believed that was compelling enough, in addition to the opportunity to play for a title contender."
Well they only have that large winstreak because Jamal Murray is injured /s
"&gt; zero sources for your claims, which are weak at best  What argument is weak? That Raw Plus / Minus is one of the worst stats available? People who aren't casuals know that, it's not debatable.  &gt;Steph had the highest plus minus last year with a team that was far from super, so again, your rebuttal actually helped my claim  You're straight up lying now. And you just proved I'm wasting my time here, you don't know what you'e talking about.  [Here.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PLUS_MINUS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) Sort them by +- and find Step @ #44. He has a worse +- than his brother even lmao. See now how you can't have a good +- on a bad team and it means more for the team than it does for the player?  &gt;Denver with Jamal Murray healthy would've crushed the Bucks, The Nets with a healthy Harden OR Kyrie would've crushed the bucks  These are your new argument for why Steph is better than Giannis? Bro you're really bad at this. Giannis averaged 35 in the NBA finals while playing Draymond's level of defense. Your golden boy can't ever dream of that.  &gt;The Bucks won on a fluke because better players in the league played for injured or worse teams  The GSW only won without KD because 2 of the 3 best player of the Cavs were injured. Then Steph and Dray needed to beg KD to carry them and he did, getting 2xFMVPs in the process while Curry has 0 LOL  &gt;Curry/KD/Dray thing works better than the Bucks ever have  lol really? That's crazy! You're saying KD is actually better than Middleton?!?!?  That proves Steph is better than Giannis how exactly? Damn, you're failing non stop.  Steph needed a superteam to win, or an injured Cavs team. At least the Bucks did beat a healthy Suns team that is the best team in the West."
Mate Jamal Murray ain't turning around a 4-0 slapping
"You've explicitly excluded the superteam years, you've also included zero sources for your claims, which are weak at best. Steph had the highest plus minus last year with a team that was far from super, so again, your rebuttal actually helped my claim. Also, with your claim KD is better but also claiming Steph isn't great because in the past 3 years he missed a season...there's something you should know about KD. Honestly, Giannis is the only one to perform over the past couple seasons and that was because of injuries to the teams of the other players you have on your list. Denver with Jamal Murray healthy would've crushed the Bucks, The Nets with a healthy Harden OR Kyrie would've crushed the bucks, who only beat the Nets due to KD's toe being on the line for that last shot after 2 out of 3 stars got hurt. We know damned well the Curry/KD/Dray thing works better than the Bucks ever have. The Bucks won on a fluke because better players in the league played for injured or worse teams. Your arguments are garbage and have helped prove my point, thanks little kid who thinks 3 years is an entire era."
"Til lebron, Jamal Murray, and ad were injured during the playoffs and not before."
Honestly even one of my friends who was a transplant in the bay was saying Jamal Murray was as good as Steph now. The slander was wild. Murray was great in the bubble but cmon.
people think they know more than they do then. most of MPJs back surgeries have been only for maintenance.  its like Saying jamal murray is never coming back from his acl.
i agree judging on the number of titles is stupid. but you have to acknowledge that last years was one of the weakest of all time. there were 6 all star level players that essentially missed it. kyrie/harden/davis/kawhi/jamal murray. Then embiid and lebron were banged up pretty heavily and then trae young also got hurt. like it was just an unprecedented amount of injuries.
Unfortunately I don't know if we'll be good enough for him to be seriously in the MVP race.  With our injuries it will be really hard to finish top 4 in the West. Would basically need Jamal to come back from an ACL as full-on Bubble Murray
Now there's an idea. But the Nugs already have too many point guards even with Jamal Murray out plus the offense runs through Jokic.
"Nd again a lot of ppl in this sub started watching basketball when curry won his first mvp so they wouldn’t know much about 2000s basketball the first finals the mavs and heat played was beautiful , lakers vs celtics was amazing , the iq was high and the game was just pleasing to watch , no inflated numbers &amp; 70 3s a game , that’s not appealing , that’s why I watch certain players that give me that 2000s vibe like klay , kd, kyrie , Chris Paul , devin booker,  demar , &amp; even melo at times, Lou will ,&amp; Jamal Murray , the mid range is the most deadly shot in the game , n can make you almost unstoppable if you can take it to the whole and have a respectable 3 , nothing will ever beat a two dribble pull up or one dribble pull up &amp; that’s why steph is so revered bc his doing that at the 3 point Line which is insane"
"True, they'd be below .500 if Jamal Murray played"
Jamal Murray is pretty damn good on defense.
"&gt; Nah, they pretty much had whatever they wanted against those two  lol ok buddy  &gt; Surround Jokic with quality teammates and watch him go back to back  I saw Jokic play with a version of Jamal Murray that looked like 2016 Steph and he got clapped in 5 by the first contender he faced, so, no, I don't think so."
Being bitter and hoping Ayton or Book tear their ACLs won’t bring Jamal Murray back lmao.
My friends who insisted Jamal Murray was better than DeRozan
Nets didn’t have Jamal Murray either so it’s a fake win
Suns are just lucky that Jamal Murray didn’t play.
"Yeah, but neither of those teams had a healthy Jamal Murray."
"Bith things can be true, the suns being good, and denver being a fucking top heavy team (since two years ago they started becoming less and less deep) and losing jamal murray meant losing their second best player. It’s a valid point but obv not an excuse, just a reason as to why Jokic was the best player in that series but still lost, it happens/happened to lebron and kd a lot of times."
Yeah but if the Nets had Jamal Murray...

But did they have to play Jamal Murray?
"It was at the top of this sub with thousands of upvotes and all the comments were the typical bullshit we always hear (they’ve played injured teams, last year was their only chance, no Jamal Murray etc). We’re just rubbing it into the faces of the Lakers bandwagoners, Lebron fanboys and the casuals that dominate this sub."
And the Jamal Murray comments.
"&gt; Jamal Murray would’ve beat him   Y’all swep the Nuggets in the second round as the higher seed, please don’t get too toxic Suns fans. I like y’all."
Only because Jamal Murray wasn't playing
"I'd like to give a special shoutout to jamal Murray, without him being injured this wouldn't be possible"
empty stats cp3 carries him can't play d jamal murray would've beat him
The Nets would have won if Jamal Murray played.
Suns are now 17-3 in games Jamal Murray didn't played. They are getting lucky.
Only because Jamal Murray is hurt
"Suns fans, don't get too excited. 16-game winning streak? So what?   Jamal Murray isn't even playing yet.."
So what? Jamal Murray didn't play tonight.
Ok but was Jamal Murray playing?
Doesn't count. Jamal Murray wasn't in the lineup.
Thank god the nets didn't have jamal Murray at the end there
Lucky ass Suns. They keep facing teams when AD and Jamal Murray are both out.
"wait till jamal murray gets subbed in, then it’ll be over for the suns"
Let's calm down. Jamal Murray isn't even playing yet
"Gotchu   Curry, Trae,Luka,Harden,Dame,Ja,Fox,Brogdon,Russ,Lamelo,Lonzo,Dejonte,Jamal Murray,Ben Simmons, DLo,Garland,Jrue,CP3,Lowry, Conley, FVV. There’s 21 guys I see clearly ahead.   Then you could also say Cole Anthony/Maxey/Schroeder/Dinwiddie"
"&gt; The suns were killed for being a “weak” western champ   No, they were killed for being gifted a pathetic route to the Finals:   \- Anthony Davis got injured and missed a chunk of the series + LeBron James was clearly nursing an injury as well  \- Jamal Murray misses the whole series  \- Kawhi Leonard misses the whole series  And before any of you idiots and/or Suns fans come at me with the ""b-b-b-but they didn't choose their opponents!"", don't. No shit they didn't choose it."
Well we don't have to worry about that until Jamal Murray comes back
Knicks woulda won if jamal murray was healthy
With Jamal Murray coming back the suns are not winning a game again.
"They always struggle with efficiency. Dug this up from when I looked into this in the past about some guards. This was through their first 27 games, so a bigger sample of bad play and  more time for the guys I'm about to list to actually turn the corner so unfair to the current crop:  Trae Young: 16/3/7 with 4tos on atrocious 38/25/78 splits   DLo: 12/4/4 with 1.5 A:TO on 40/31/71 splits   Lonzo Ball: 9/7/7 on 33/27/49 splits   De'Aaron Fox: 10/3/4 on 41/30/68 splits   Jamal Murray: 10/3/2 on 38/36/83 splits  Throwing in some more guys now through 20 games(\~what today's rookies have played so far):  Darius Garland: 11/2/3 on 48%TS  Ant: 14/3/2 on 47%TS  One-and-Done guards are going to play horribly out the gate. We go through this cycle of being shocked every year. Stop being shocked. The guys who came out the gate notably well in the past like Luka and Ja are not only the exceptions, but also come from a different background one having played pros and other being a sophomore."
Only if Jamal Murray and Kawahi Leonard aren't playing.
"Whoa, whoa...easy there. ESPN, NBA.com and Fox Sports will remind you that last season was a fluke. We're only good in all 16 games that Jamal Murray didn't play in this season."
Just wait until Jamal Murray comes back.
Watching the nuggets makes me miss Jamal Murray man
Luckiest team ever. How do they keep playing teams when AD and Jamal Murray are both out.
&gt;Anthony Davis will have to shoot the ball outside the bubble.   So will Jamal Murray
You really think Jamal Murray is a better play than Paul George lol
"#7  Steph  Bernard King  Chris Mullin  Julius Randle  Nenê  With Rip Hamilton and Jamal Murray off of the bench  Edit: also I’m not saying this is the best combo of any pick, just the best of the 7th picks. This would be a fun fun team to watch though. Big man would be the biggest issue"
Jamal Murray charge
"Wow, that Jamal Murray dunk, only has 37K views? It was awesome."
Give Kawhi Jamal Murray and watch them sweep the entire playoff bracket
Mfs act like jamal murray wasn’t playing like prime d rose combined with steph lol
"Fair enough. I think the way I'd justify it is if the player will spend most of the 2022 season in their age 24 year, then they are fair game to be included. So since Bam and OG are summer birthdays, they can be on this. Wheras someone like Jamal Murray is less than 3 months away from 25."
As a nuggets fan welcome to the life. If you remember Jamal Murray had a similar murder called an offensive foul and well jokic of course.
Jamal Murray had a crazy dunk that got waved off
Shades of [Jamal Murray](https://youtu.be/WJwRlDFQNq8)
"They’d have to be willing to part with Jamal Murray and MPJ. Jokic + KD would compete with LeBron + AD for best duo in the league, so I’d make that trade if I were them"
I can't believe I'm starting to unironically regret trading this man for Jamal Murray

"I think he has the skill level of some of the guards that have made the all-star game in the past, but the problem is that we are in such a guard-heavy NBA that many great high-level guards won't make the all-star game.  Just look at the point guard position in the west you have Dame, Steph, Chris Paul, Jamal Murray, and John Wall."
Pretty sure Jamal murray averaged more points and assist in the bubble playoffs than Jokic.
"Which is why I think they're not trying to tank, they seem to be to have a solid core of starters that just need more time to develop. If you look at some of the top young players like Donovan Mitchel,  Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro they've been mostly mid first round draft picks. I feel OKC loaded up on draft picks so they can trade picks that work for their teams chemistry rather than getting  the best possible pick."
"I’m from Lexington and it seems to happen every year that a UK player goes either late In the lottery or first round because they didn’t shine in Coach Cal’s system, then they blossom in the NBA. Some recent examples include Bam, Shai, Tyler Herro, devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and hell even Tyrese, Quickley, and maybe even Hamidou."
"A couple of misses in the top 10, but the top 3 are pretty much spot on? Plus Jamal Murray in the top 10, Sabonis at 11, Malik Beasly at 19, Levert at 20, Siakam at 27, Dejounte Murray at 29, Brogdon at 36. It's not the deepest draft but it's not as bad as you're making it out to be I think."
"I've been saying since last year that the Nuggets need to shake it up to really contend, and we're all seeing their deep seated issues so far this season. I think Washington needs a shake up too, they have good players but they just don't fit together well. I came up with this trade, which works on the trade machine:  Denver gets:   * Davis Bertans  * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * Jamal Murray  * Paul Millsap  * Bol Bol  * RJ Hampton  * 3 1sts (2021, 2024, 2026)  * 2 pick swaps (2022, 2025)  Denver runs Beal/Harris/MPJ/Bertans/Jokic, great spacing for Jokic to work with, and Beal adds consistent star power, which Denver needs to pair with Jokic, he's not enough by himself. Second unit of Morris/Campazzo/Barton/Green/Hartenstein  The Wiz get a very promising young PG in Murray, two talented projects in Bol and Hampton, Millsap is expiring financial filler who provides a veteran presence for a year, and several picks/swaps to help the rebuild."
"What about Simmons, jaylen brown, cj, Jamal Murray, cp3, Lowry, Mitchell, Shai, Paul George, ja. Not saying they’ll make it but they all have at least a chance"
"he is easily the 2nd option and maybe 1st if he keep improving. idk why r/NBA hates efficient volume scorers and Jamal Murray this past playoffs showed that a very good volume scorer who can get hot in the playoffs is an extremely valuable asset. what the fuck are y’all on calling him a 3rd option, lmao"
"As a nuggets fan who watched lebron maul Jamal Murray in the WCF, I feel no sympathy for him not getting calls."
"It would be postponed, doesn’t matter if it’s LeBron, Paul George, or Jamal Murray but most likely the player would just play with covid"
Jamal Murray
"Uhh you're really saying DLO is on the same level as multi time all stars?  Even though he is much more inefficient?  Ja Morant is better, healthy john wall, Zach Lavine, Jamal Murray, Malcom Brogdon. Sorry bro DLO is like 20-30 range for starting PGs.  He is not worth that contract in any way."
Man Jamal Murray went great after dropping his tape Kyrie can do the same.
The only Maple Jordan I've ever seen is bubble Jamal Murray
"KAT has the talent and skills to be the best offensive player in the league but he is not a leader. He just doesn't have that quality, same with AD, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and AD. Kentucky, or John Calipari to be more accurate, doesn't teach kids to lead."
I agree with most people saying it's hard to be superstar level if you're inconsistent. Or else Jamal Murray would be a legit superstar.  Exception? Jeremy Lin.
I used to compare Zach and Jamal Murray in terms of equalish play and impact. But it’s clear now that if Zach was on the Nuggets instead of Murray they would be a much better team. Zach getting looks from Joker would be pure death to any defense.
Trade for Beal or Harden. You can't count on Jamal Murray and MPJ to compliment Jokic. Murray hasn't proven ajything outside the bubble
"Come on, Jamal Murray isn't an MVP candidate"
"Yo, if you are from Canada you gotta support Jamal ""Blue Arrow"" Murray and the Nuggets.   Just be warned, not much D being played in Denver"
"How many games is necessary to say that though lol you said Curry was the best player in the league right now, not that he’s currently playing the best. Was Jamal Murray the best player in the league when he went stupid in the first round of the playoffs?"
Really considering the nuggets. I *love* Jamal Murray as I’m Canadian.
"Beal for Jamal Murray, who says no"
I think it's time for the Nuggets to make a splash in the trade market this year  Jamal Murray just doesn't seem like he's gonna cut it as a second option
"so Klay Thompson is down a season and the Warriors are one of the worst west teams...  if Jokic was to go down, the core of Jamal Murray would not make the Nuggets a likely contender, and easily at the Bottom of the West. Ya think that’s crazy? Do you watch Basketball? Murray put up insane numbers in the bubble, but so did Jokic. Jokic is consistent, Murray is still a bit streaky."
you wrote that as if pre-bubble Jamal Murray was an allstar... jamal averaged 24 pts in bubble and that got his season average only to 18.5
Dejounte isn't an elite defender. He's a little above average. Jamal Murray is clearly far better than him.
Why does it matter having a point guard? Jamal murray is less of a point than lebron who's a forward. Really doesn't matter
"Not sure but remember Jamal Murray couldn't guard Mitchell, he's not dropping 57 on dejounte even though he isn't scoring 50 himself either"
Jamal is not even the best under 25 Murray taken in the 1st round of the 2016 NBA draft
"Since you are talking about two people named Murray in your post, you should call Jamal Jamal instead of Murray."
"100%.  This smells of 2016. Apparently, people at the time thought it was a ""weak"" class, but it ended up producing some amazing starter-caliber players. Siakam, Brogdon, Simmons, Murray (Jamal and Dejonte both), Sabonis, Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Hield, LeVert, Zubac, and so on. Heck, Fred VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith were *undrafted* that year."
Ok what is up with Jamal Murray? He does not look healthy at all to me
Let's just say the dude is doing his best Jamal Murray impression on reddit.
Is Jamal Murray more of a 2 than a 1?
Remember when everyone said bubble Jamal Murray was the new normal and that it wasn't an outlier
Does Jamal Murray even want to play today? Dude looks uninterested as hell. He’s always with his hands on his waist .
I wish it were in better circumstances but I'm glad Tyrese has a chance to run the offense and play extended minutes today. I've been high on him since Kentucky. Look for similarities between him and Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray
Jokic keeps surprising me that man Ia a chunky basketball deity and if we had s better record I'm sure he could be mvp. Campanazzo has also been a great surprise he brings a lot of energy defensively and has some of the sickest passes i have seen in a while.  Disappointed pretty much everyone else from the team Jamal murray has struggled offensively more than usual i don't expect him to be bubble murray but at least 20 consistently. Will barton last year was one of our best players and now looks washed in some games and we haven't gotten back his defense. Mpj is good at basketball but a moron and is suspended for not following the covid guidelines for about two weeks. Gary harris is not being phenomenal.
So far he scores more points on the same efficancy (59 vs 60% ts) as Jamal Murray. Maybe he should have had a bigger role on the Nuggets..  Also I think it's a big leap to completely change your role and still maintain your efficiancy. Going from playing as a 4th option to being the 1st is always going to be a struggle for most players. He's doing it seamlessly
"You forgot Jamal Murray (Jokic) , Devin Booker (CP3).. Both those guys are over Porzingis at least. And I'm not so sure Beal is the second option in Washington. I'd probably rather have him taking the last shot than Westbrook"
"I don't know if Trae can start playing that way out of nowhere. Curry can do it because he was a shooting guard before he was a point guard, so he's always played offball. Pretty much every guard who sometimes plays point and has a good mix of offball-onball play (e.g. Beal, Jamal Murray, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday) has always played offball their entire career."
"Where’s this excuse for Jamal murray, devin Booker, Mitchell? It’s obvious that most scoring guards in the league aren’t good defenders, especially when their offensive load is that high. But when they have solid defenders around them then they can contribute with at least neutral defense."
"Probably the most recent was the Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell duel. Man, they should have put Duel of the Fates over that one, it was pretty legit."
"in a perfect world, jamal murray. He steps up on the roller and Dozier plays two, then jokic comes back down to take WCS and murray recovers on the other wing"
Is the first Murray Dejounte too or is it Jamal?
"Yeah but look at how the jazz are doing compared to other teams in a similar situation. Jamal Murray who people say was overpaid absolutely balled out last year, and the other playoff teams all have 1-2 MVP candidates on their teams eating their max contracts, which Rudy is not close to."
"14-31.  Missed a lot of free throws, was trying to draw fouls too much. When he was fouled, he didn't get the calls.   He was CLUTCH as always, and obviously Jamal and everyone else have to play better.    But Jokic didn't play up to his standards. He got blocked a lot.    Jokic is an MVP right now, but he wasn't as good throughout the game as usual   Murray always starts out the season slow, so once he gets it going. Denver will be great."

Honestly when Jamal Murray is on one he might be the most clutch.
"Hampton and Nnaji showed at least get some opportunities  imo.   But if Jokic hadn't sucked or Jamal Murray contributes, Nuggets win."
"He was awful offensively in the first half, but to be fair Jamal Murray and Dorian Finney-Smith were the only 2 players on either team really that weren’t awful in the first half lol   His defense was great all game though, and his offense got going later in the game when we needed it most. I highly doubt we would have won this game without JRich"
Jamal Murray smoking Mandingo
Jamal murray and buddy Hield would have way better trade value than kris Dunn. Changes the dynamics of the Jimmy trade.
"So if Jamal Murray gets drafted, he's then traded instead of Kris Dunn  I don't see how that's ""even worse"", whoever got picked in 2016 was gonna get traded"
You’re right it’s even worse. You guys drafted kris Dunn when buddy and Jamal Murray were drafted right after him.
"Herro, Jamal Murray, Mitchell, tj Warren, the suns on the positive side   Siakam, Giannis and most of the bucks, kawhi and most of the clippers on the negative side (I'm fully prepared to get downvotes for most of this)"
"Jamal Murray it seems always turns it up a notch in the playoffs, with the last playoffs obviously being the biggest example of that."
Definitely over murray he already looks like the same old jamal. If I'm taking wiseman it better be with the twolves pick plus multiple distant futures from the warriors. And tbh simmons was clearly better then jaylen last year so I'd give it time before anointing jaylen.
Jamal Murray is disgustingly good.
what the fuck i was told jamal murray is overrated
"""Jamal Murray scored 20+ in 4 of last 5 games""   Isn't that like, expected?"
"Jamal Murray was hitting some Jordan-esque layups during their series with the Lakers. And before you call me reactionary, I’m aware that it was a handful of shots and not his whole career, that’s what sets Jordan and other all-time greats apart."
When Jamal Murray had a 3 game stretch averaging 47ppg on 64% shooting from the field it's not unreasonable to say he looked like the greatest player of all-time.
"Clearly Jamal Murray, and who else ?"
"or Jamal ""weird pubes"" Murray"
"I mean we neutralized  Jamal Murray both games we played the nuggets, and in the first game vs the suns we held booker in check and Fox clamped him down in the 4th quarter."
"how do you see dlo? dlo is such a slow and shifty player and coby seems so dynamic and direct, i see more jamal murray in him"
"Yeah because doesn't have Jamal Murray to pass too and isn't a better passer. I'm not talking about running the offense I'm talking about post scoring, 3pt shooting and basic offensive abilities which KAT is superior at in every category pretty much. I get it you jerk off to his highlights."
"Oh he was beyond terrible, at the time I was happy about the Jimmy move but everything else after that was just dumb. Looking back at it we should’ve drafted Jamal Murray, cause how many rookies say they want to be drafted by the wolves. Put you f core would’ve been Murray Lavine Wiggins Lauri (would’ve preferred Collins) and KAT. But besides that his coaching was average and old schooled and he struggled to keep egos in check. Again a lot of issues is the GM side"
"In one series, in the bubble. Or do you think that Jamal Murray is an all-NBA First Team PG too? Or that Tyler Herro and TJ Warren are franchise players?"
"he, like Jamal Murray, has always been a super streaky scorer. he isn't the reliable 20-30 every night guy. later in the season when he has like 4 40 point games in two weeks, the opinion on him will flip."
"Raptors literally won a series off a Kawhi buzzer beater, literally 1 thing goes wrong and the whole series shifts. No, losing Hayward isn't the same as losing KD and some of Klay but that series wasn't nearly as close as the Celtics vs Heat, you know, gotta actually scale it.  To say its not luck, you gotta show some consistency. As far as statistics are concerned, Tyler Herro has only had 1 stint of scoring 19ppg on 63% TS. Dragic starting 3 games the entire season and then averaging 20ppg  in that series. A couple months after the finals with a similar sample size to that Celtics series, how are those guys doing? Just as well as you'd expect them to perform relative to their regular season work, not their playoff performance. They have not shown consistency to prove that they could've gotten to the finals even 5/10 times. People literally did the same shit to Jamal Murray and you don't see anyone defending him like he's a full blown high tier star thats about to average 26ppg on 62% TS."
"Well call me delusional pal . Again, if talent is pretty even, the PG position is more influential than SF. Ie look at bubble Jamal Murray. Is Jamal Murray better than Brandon Ingram? Eh. Maybe , maybe not. But by way of the position he plays and the pressure he puts on the defense with the ball in his hands, that team went that far. They wouldn’t have with Brandon Ingram or any comparable wing.    If you replace Ja with Ingram on last year’s grizzly team they’re sniffing 20 wins."
"mostly, i mean jamal murray was def better for a couple of those games but he wasn’t their focal point"
"OUTSIDE OF JAMAL MURRAY IN THE BUBBLE, WHO HAS JOKIC HAD?"
"Jamal Murray in the bubble was peak Steph, it does not cancel out at all."
"Outside of Jamal Murray in the bubble, who has jokic had? Ad had jrue holiday so that cancels out right there"
"Hahahahahahahahahaha.... NO.  How can this be ""most talented non-usa team ever"" if best player here is Jamal Murray?  Like lets take  simple example : Slovenia. Doncic + Dragic already more talent than whole Canadian roster"
"The moment that Jamal Murray started dropping 40 point games, they won the series lol"
"he, mitchell, and jamal murray have all looked really off to start this season. I get its still really early (january basketball automatically triggers like mid season feelings in me) but its sort of disorienting how poorly they're playing"
I remember Patrick Beverly shoving Jamal Murray at the very last second in the 4th quarter in the bubble last season cuz he was upset Denver Nuggets eliminated them; trying to cause an injury. Just ridiculous he's allowed to do this again and again.
Jamal Murray averaging 45ppg was the best player on the Nuggets a lot of those games. They could easily have lost in the first round with Jokic as the best player on the team.
"Monte Morris by a mile. Top 20 pg in the league imo, plays backup to Jamal Murray. But nobody takes him from denver"
Remember when he shoved Jamal Murray in the playoffs even after the game was already decided? Dirty Bev
"Jamal Murray is a bit of an enigma to me, there’s plenty of games where I’m sure he’s the next superstar guard in this league, and he’s the 1b star of the nuggets. However there’s also games like this where he looks like a big net negative on the floor and looks straight up lazy and unfocused. I love watching him play well and I like the nuggets and I’m hoping this is something he can get over, but this inconsistency has seemed to plague him his whole career. There were tons of possessions in this game where jokic was out and Murray was in and he’d just stand in the corner with his hands on his knees the whole possession and not even try to touch the ball, it’s pretty infuriating to watch."
"I believe he’s top 30, but you could replace him with someone like Jrue Holiday or Jamal Murray  My point was just that the pacers def don’t have 3 top 25 guys"
That's fascinating. So the first half of the season is huge for the players right now. Hyper close evaluation. It'd be a mistake to trade Lavine for picks in my opinion. He's not perfect but a guy that good is hard to get. He's such a dynamic offensive player. No doubt in my mind that he is capable of doing exactly what Jamal Murray and Don Mitchell did this year in the playoffs. Really hope we get to see it. It's about time guys like Lavine and Booker get into the playoffs.
Dlo ain't a #1 on a team but he can be a Jamal Murray type to Jokic with Kat imo.
"Yeah that's the right way to play in pick-up ball, but this is the NBA and it's all about what the stats say generates the most points. Trae foul-baiting is an extremely efficient and almost guaranteed way to get 2 points on the board. If he takes the floater, it probably goes down 50-60% of the time.  A few extra points per game for y'all last year and you could've easily won a championship. But I guess y'all just care about what people think about the way you play.   Lastly, Jamal Murray is not nearly as fast as Trae. He couldn't do the move Trae's been spamming anyways."
"It wasn’t really talked about in national media or this sub, and I felt that those were 2 of the best performances of the bubble, ahead of even some of Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell’s games."
"This isn't directed at your comment at all but I get a little annoyed how some on social media want to make it about who's better, Curry or Dame.   They are both elite talents and two of the best point guards today. There are some really great point guards in this league, CPIII is still great even if he's showing his age, Ja Morant a great guard of the future, Jamal Murray growing into a perennial all star, Westbrook still elite, Kyrie Irving still dances with the ball on string, De'Aaron is likely De'Fastest guard in the league today, Trae Young is looking like a really special talent, I enjoy watching these guys do the things they do on a basketball court."
And what was LeBron’s? Jamal Murray? Get on somewhere lmao
"If you care about rooting for a fellow Canadian, perhaps the Denver Nuggets to watch Jamal Murray or the Oklahoma City Thunder to watch Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) and Luguentz Dort.   Or pick anyone else from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadians_in_the_National_Basketball_Association)."
"The only way those two would be elite at shorter heights is if we assumed they'd be more skilled, which clearly you're not assuming for giannis even though he arguably is a harder worker than both (although maybe not a smarter one). If we didn't assume that then Lebron and KD would be far from elite. Bron doesn't have the shot, footwork, or handle to survive as a 6'3 pg. At best hes athletic Ricky rubio. Not exactly sure what KDs height is but if he's not tall enough to be a SG then he would maybe be jamal murray"
Did you really put Jamal Murray in the same tier as Collin Sexton?
JAMAL MURRAY CLUTCH
crying for a foul should be an automatic technical i don't give a fuck if you're Lebron James or discount superstar Jamal Murray.
Jamal Murray always go off against the suns. Still pissed they took Bender over him
"JAMAL ""McMaple"" MURRAY"
Jamal Murray is the only player in nba history
That's bubble Jamal Murray.
Jamal Murray just did that shit though
You joke but bill simmons said during the last fiba run the USA should have Jamal Murray on the team (news flash he’s Canadian)
fox was a far better player when he signed his max than jamal murray was when he signed his
Sounds exactly like Jamal Murray. 53% TS on 16 shots a game with a -2.1 BPM
One of my best drafts this year was capela and im fucking feasting with him. Too bad i have oubre and jamal murray to balance it out 😂😅😭
The problem with using the playoffs is the sample size isnt big enough. Unless we are suppose to think Jamal Murray is a  Curry/Jordan Hybrid. Someone having bad playoff series or good playoff series doesnt necessarily tell us how good they are.
Thanks man. I hate tonight because I really like the Nuggets and especially Jamal Murray. I hope this doesn't become like the Suns and Jazz to where both fanbases just kinda hate each other because I also really like Spida but due to the way our fanbases have been to each other it's hard to find Jazz fans to just talk basketball with
Jamal Murray 😡🤬  or  A random bench player on the Wizards.... varies each game
"So if Devin Booker flopped on a Jamal Murray drive and it turned into a 5 point swing, with the Suns winning, you would be fine with this? Sue me for caring about my team"
Yeah I noticed that too but I'd rather take an off balance jokic shot that a Jamal Murray off balance shot
I was a bit confused by the nuggets team not giving the ball to Jokic in the clutch. Isn't he one of the clutchest players in the league. Jamal Murray needs to delegate to superiors. Monte Morris seems like a great player and I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes like a grant after leaving Denver
Jamal Murray sucking the oxygen out of the ball IS NOT IT!
How do Nuggets fans feel about Jamal Murray? It seems like his bubble consistency hasn’t carried over but clearly he’s a very talented player.
Jamal Murray left his talents in Orlando.
It's nuts that Murray is airballing 3s and nearly all Nuggets fans have talked about for the past week is whether Jamal should be playing through an elbow injury that he suffered at the end of December... and ESPN clearly has no idea he has hurt.  It's not like Malone or Jamal have been quiet about the injury either...
"Are we getting Jamal Murray back or whats going on here cause we 6-9 and ready to ride, baby"
"Y’all know that one time Jamal Murray got head from his girlfriend, recorded it, and posted it on Instagram"
Jamal Murray-esque
"He’s an amazing player,  they mentioned that.  You should be able to talk about someone who’s good and also have the conversation how does he take it to the next level.  I feel like there’s more talent in the league now than ever, so what does it take for someone like Mitchell to jump to superstar, what does it take for Jamal Murray to be an all star, etc.  We can love these players but ask what will or can they do to make that jump."
peak jamal murray
"It's Jamal Murray, isn't it?"
Nothing. He’s just Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray last year, Lebron in 2015/18"
and jamal murray is no where to be found...
"Its insane how you guys think, I dont mean to be a dick but the Jazz are not better than a SUPERTEAM   The Jazz literally have no chance at beating the Nets in a playoff series. The Jazz are not beating KD, Harden and Kyrie, and are nowhere close  Jazz are pretenders every year, we should know this by now. We said this last year after they blew a 3-1 lead to Jamal Murray, and after they got dropped off by the Rockets in 2 straight years, etc, etc... all after a real good “sleeper” regular season  Lakers, Nets, Clips, Bucks, Sixers are the top 5. Jazz are not"
Antivax = MPJ  Pubes = Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray must've left everything back in Florida
Bad calls in that game vs the kings.  The moving screen on Jokic and the offensive foul on Jamal Murray.     That was borderline rigged
"He is a high volume shooter without the elite efficiency part, except that crazy Denver series.  But the same thing is true for Jamal Murray, who also exploded in the bubble and these two will never repeat those performances because in reality even if you are a crazy efficient scorer like KD, Curry or Klay those three still bring something extra that is elite level (KD and Klay can lock in defensively and Curry is a playmaker). Neither Mitchell nor Murray are good playmakers, they don't go to the line often and they are not good defenders."
"Again. Third time I’m saying this now- Clippers held Jamal Murray to the second biggest drop off in ppg between consecutive series in nba history. There are seven games in a series, not one. Doc’s inability to sit Trezz and not play him and not making adjustments had an enormous impact on who won the series. With Zubac as the primary defender, Jokic shot 23-of-49 from the field (46.9 percent). With Harrell as the primary defender, Jokic made 10-of-14 shots (71.4 percent). I don’t see how you don’t get that that is coaching malpractice"
Lmaooo cause were talking about the clippers not being able to beat the nuggets and the players unable to hold Jamal Murray and the joker down. This whole conversation started with that or did you forget?
Jamal Murray had the second biggest drop off in ppg between consecutive series in NBA history
Quinn Snyder is one of the best coaches in the nba. They have an extensive playbook of sets to run and I think the bounce back year of mike Conley and the budding superstardom of Donovan Mitchell is the driving force. It’s nice to see him build off the bubble success as opposed to Jamal Murray not taking the step we all thought he would.
Donovan Mitchell is comfortably better then Jamal Murray. Donovan plays respectable defense too
"players from the 2016 draft I would definitely take over Simmons:  Ingram, Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray.  Brogdon &amp; Siakam are in the same tier as Simmons right now (I would put Simmons ahead of them in that tier), and below that is the Caris Levert, Buddy Hield, Dejounte Murray tier.  Simmons is closer to these guys than he is to the top of this class, and if he doesn't figure out a way to impact the game in the half-court I could see more players leap-frogging him."

"Yeah and there’s plenty of players that shine in the playoffs just to come back down to earth after and lose all the hype. See: Jamal Murray, Siakam, Herro, etc.  It’s almost as if every dude handles it differently. Weird."
"Exactly. Lavine hasn't had a single allstar teammate since getting traded to Bulls. Booker has CP3, Mitchell has Gobert and solid backcourt vet pg like Conley, Jamal Murray has a top 10 player in Jokic.   Put Lavine next to a star and the narrative changes completely. You could prob do the same for Beal as well"
Jamal “Pubes McGee” Murray
Cousins could pass brother. Obviously jokic is a better passer but cousins could pass. Cousins can play offense on the same level or higher as these guys his defense was solid and is playmaking was above avg for a big. Also The kings didn’t a second or third All star caliber players like Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons or Tobias Harris.
"The sexiest play I can think of is splitting a hard hedge off a high screen and roll, going downhill full speed , and making a 360 degree jelly layup over a weak side help defender. I feel like John Wall has maybe done this? Jamal Murray?  The way Jordan moved around the court was a thing of beauty as well. His fluidity and body control were second to none."
"i feel like not enough people talking about my man coby “crabman” white tho  i swear i can’t watch him play without my mind telling me he’s a future star, his game is so fluid and clean, reminds me of jamal murray a lot"
in his last 50 games he’s like 24.5 49% FG 44% 3P    aka way better than jamal murray and don mitchell
I think Sexton is more of a Donovan Mitchell/Jamal Murray type which isn’t a bad thing at all
Jamal Murray and Tyler Herro I was told were better than him
Wait I thought Jamal Murray was better than him
he’s better than Don Mitchell and Jamal Murray idc what anybody tells me
You realize players can play with nagging injuries right? Like Jamal Murray is playing with a bruised elbow or something and his game is suffering as a result in a similar way. Teams just can’t afford to sit out players every game for minor injuries.
Luka may well have done better in the bubble on a tiny sample size but we also know he’s a dude who will drop 28/8/8 on your forehead basically at all times. His bubble performance wasn’t that anomalous.   Jamal Murray is good but he’s not that guy.
"That was one of the issues, yes, but it seems we resolved that even during the Nuggets series. Conley and Clarkson were huge for us in that series, and now we got Bojan back too. I feel like that was moreso a concern when we had Rubio and Favors out there in our closing lineups. Donovan had to do just about everything offensively and now that's not the case  I think the bigger issue was our non-Gobert center minutes, which obviously we shored up with Favors. Right now, our biggest concern is perimeter defense. It seems like any given game any guard could torch us for 30+. Doesn't matter if it's Jamal Murray, James Harden, or Austin Rivers. Gotta be better there"
* Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Jamal Murray  * Chris boucher  * Dort  * Dillion brooks  * Brendan Clarke  * SGA * RJ * Olynik  * Tristan Thompson * Wiggins    Canadians have the talent to become a pretty strong player in the world basketball stage.
"Jamal Murray. I actually wouldn't be that surprised if he doesn't make an All-Star team in his career. He is too inconsistent and I knew the bubble performance was an anomaly.   Kinda agree with Mitchell too. If he can consistently get to the rim then he is a game changer. However, if that part of the game isn't there then he can't be as productive on offense."
Jamal Murray is ranked high and Dlo is ranked low.
Giannis and Gobert really not benefitting from no fans. The anti Anthony Davis and Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray is also incredibly inconsistent for a fringe ""superstar""."
"Current: Murray, Mitchell, Ja, Trae, Fox  Future: Murray, Mitchell, Trae, Fox, Ja  I can’t judge the other guys until they do it in the playoffs.   Jamal Murray defense has really improved, that’s why he also got the nudge."
"Current: Trae, D. Mitchell, Jamal Murray, D. Fox, Ja Morant.  I think that Trae gets the top, just due to his skillset as it stands today, were I to draft with a team that needed scoring, I don't think there is anyway to exchange him for the others, he's an offense unto himself.  On the other hand, I would take almost any of the other players given time to develop, I think that D. Mitchell and D. Fox both have a higher ceiling, and at the least, every other guard has better size or athleticism, or both. I'm Actually really high on Fox, but partially just because I love his attitude."
"Murray (I'm assuming he means Jamal and not Dejounte, even though the latter doesn't get enough respect) is such a wild card.  Like, obviously he's played worse than 3-4 of these guys, but two years in a row he's shown incredible things in the playoffs  How do you rate a dude who hasn't earned the right to coast, but seemingly turns it up  For what it's worth, I'm low on him since the Nuggets record isn't great rn and he hasn't played well.  If they were a healthy 2 seed or something, I'd excuse his play more."
Can we stop pretending Jamal Murray is a franchise player at this point?
Jamal Murray needs to grab a gear. Otherwise that was a solid game.
Jamal murray is a fucking confusing player
yet none of them could defend Jamal Murray in the playoffs. On paper sure they can but in reality they need to show it on the floor
Nah he got roasted by JAMAL MURRAY
That’s exactly why he can’t be the best perimeter defender because he’s not always engaged defensively. Even when he doesn’t completely shut guys down or even make them work twice as hard. Look at last years playoffs with Luka and Jamal Murray. I still have him top 5 he’s just not as engaged as a guy like Lu Dort who is always giving 100% on the defensive end
What's happening with Jamal Murray though
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
Jamal Murray had to do some Rock Lee things and take off his elbow padding at some point.
"I think guarding Jokic with Montrezl Harrell is completely different than guarding three perimeter stars with three great perimeter defenders (in the Nuggets series, Jamal Murray had the biggest drop in ppg between consecutive series in NBA history while being guarded by Kawhi, PG and Bev)"
I remember in the bubble when Jamal Murray kept on getting more and more banged up. Dude you got two more contracts to play for chill the fuck out and regroup next year.
"I feel like there’s a trade between Washington and Denver that makes too much sense not to get done.   A pick, Troy Brown Jr &amp; Bradley Beal for Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.  I don’t do a lot of trade research or discussion so this may be one that’s been talked about a lot, but I think both teams benefit greatly from this."
"I will watch the 1st quarter to see if Jamal Murray shows up. If he doesn't, I am not going to waste my time watching the game. It will be same ole same Nuggets"
"Real picks: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis   Edgy picks: Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray"
The only reason AD is a second option is cuz he has lebron on his team lmao. Obviously lavine is worst than AD u idiot. You replace someone like Jamal Murray or Middleton with Lavine and their respective teams are just as good if not better. Also shows that u don’t watch any bulls games if ur gonna complain about his defense when his defense has improved a ton this season and has looked like an average defender for the most part.
"Jamal Murray should be then too, plus health is a huge part of value"
"Not really, he's 28, most of the better guards are going to start to decline somewhat soon and there isn't a deep pool of clear cut future all-NBA guards.      I mean, you put Dipo after Steph, Harden, Lillard, Kyrie if he shows up, CP for one or two years, Westbrook, Beal. I think that Jamal Murray and Mitchell both are around his level of performance. Those are 7 players above him, 2 on a similar level, if any two of them has a dip in performance or Dipo has better team success with a similar season he gets into a 3rd team this year.      As they get old and start to decline, he gets to compete with the younger guys, and other than Trae and Booker I don't think there are clear cut superstars, Jaylen Brown has potential, Herro too, Fox, but those are maybes, they might peak at around Dipo's level and he gets a few all NBA's"
"How? Brandon Ingram is a border line all-star. I have no issue with his contract. A 25% max for a ~23 year old borderline all star is much much much better than ~$20M per year for a 25 year old RFA who is never going to be more than a 5th starter.  Look at the recent ones. Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, BI. All looking pretty good. Compare that to Buddy Hield."
Disney bubble ring which had Jamal Murray playing like Michael Curry.
"Probably wanted mpj and Murray together.   I’d say that Murray is a bit higher value than dipo given his hefty contract, and they needed 8 picks from that.   Maybe Jamal+mpj+2 picks gets it done?"
"Chris Paul, Paul George, Jamal Murray.  Their names are too plain. I think basketball players should have cool names."
Every player sounds weird or awkward in the post game interview.   See Jamal Murray.   They just went through 48 minutes of physical hell
Damn Bro Getting Neck For That Long 😳‼️⁉️ Jamal Murray Jealous‼️‼️‼️
In a similar vein - and this is coming from an American - I am MUCH more impressed by crazy layups (like the 360 and the switch hands layup Jamal Murray made last year in the postseason) than I am by dunks. Those wild layups are like magic to me.
Literally just drafting Jamal Murray instead of Kris Dunn (like everyone wanted him to) and not trading for Butler would have us in a much better position to win today .  I could go on and on but it really wouldn't take much to drastically change our outlook
"1st time All Stars should be De'Aaron Fox, Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine in no particular order off the top of my head"
"TLC is pretty solid for a a backup, hes shooting 37% from three and shot 39% last year. Shamet is a proven 3pt shooter and bruce brown again is another solid bench guy, hes shooting 57% from the field so far and is a legitimately good defender who locked up mitchell and jamal murray. Jeff green is a decent role player, hes shooting 45% from 3 and has decent size. He thrived last year with harden.  Its just our bigs are horrendous. we're gonna rely on claxton/perry to step up which is asking a lot. DJ is one of the worst players in the league right now. we just have zero bigs."
Arguments can be made for Jaylen Brown (esp if what he's been showing to start this season is his true sustainable new standard) and Jamal Murray
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
"Jamal Murray had 2 huge 50-point games over one 7 game series and then 3 games in that same series well under his season avg, did the bubble just selectively make him suck and shoot 16% that game seven? Of course not dude it was just a fucking streak, they happen all the time"
And like the blazers in 2019 they probably got too confident off a WCF run driven by unique fortunate circumstances that are hard to repeat. That Denver team was like 26th in defense from mid December on last year and guess what they can’t stop anybody this year. There’s a pretty large sample size now of this not actually being a real contender but hey relying on Jamal Murray to shoot like Steph Curry in the playoffs sounds like a reasonable strategy
I would rather keep Jamal Murray than have James Harden for a season or 2.
"So you think   1) Rondo making exactly 2 more 3's than his career average would indicate over the course of a playoffs  and  2) Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell, neither of whom have ever shot 38% in a season, made a combined 65 3's in a single series, and shot 52%.  Both of those guys in one series shot better than Curry ever has, Klay ever has, Durant, Dame, Harden, and the list goes on and on.    are comparable in how unlikley they were? Really? That's crazy to me.   &gt; every year u have someone massively over performing   Every year you don't have two good-not-great shooters have the 1st and 2nd best shooting series in NBA history in the same series"
"&gt; In a normal season, the Clippers don't choke a 3-1 lead. The Heat don't make the Finals. The Bucks don't nearly get swept. Jamal Murray isn't dropping 50pt games left and right.  I can do this with a year like 2011 as well  ""in a normal season, the Mavs don't win the finals, LeBron doesn't forget how to play basketball, Kobe doesn't get swept, KD doesn't shoot 23% from 3 in the conference finals"""
"Ok.. I will make it simple for u to understand...  Jamal Murray is a professional basketball 🏀 player who gets paid north of 25 million dollars to play. And he is very young and hence he can play at high level for a long time. Because that is his job. Jokic did.. and he is older and less athletic. Understood?  My second point was that u comparing me (a regular fan) to a professional player saying that I wouldn't understand because I haven't played ""sport"" is profoundly idiotic reasoning.  U could only make that argument if u are a multi-million aire nba player.. which I doubt considering your third grade level reading and toddler level understanding..  I hope you don't have to read it 5 times to understand this.  Have a fun day."
"I mean, y'all were trying to trap and either foul or steal  It's 100% on Murray. He was frozen once the ball got inbounded. Like either double O'neal and hope to get a turnover/foul, or float down to make the pass difficult or foul a bad shooter if it gets there  Jokic was covering the inbounds, so obviously Gobert is going to be open. It's not like Jamal didn't know he was there - he just zoned out and completely lost track of him. It made it extremely easy for O'neal to pass out without worry. He floats down and he probably just holds the ball and gets fouled"
It’s been CJ most of the time. Like Jamal Murray if he’s hitting jump shots he’s pretty much unstoppable. If he’s not he’s not super useful.   That had changed this season as he started firing up 10 3’s a game...
"I think there a lot of guys that start their career not doing it too much  One big reason Jamal Murray was so much better in the Bubble is that he started hunting fouls on drives. I remember hearing the same thing about Tatum.  There are probably only a few elite guys who can afford to leave that production on the table and still have a good career (Curry, Klay, Kyrie as mentioned in this thread)"
"In the bubble, doesn’t count. Crazy things happen in the bubble. Jazz probably don’t go up 3-1 without Mitchell exploding and then they probably don’t blow that 3-1 lead without Jamal Murray exploding. Maybe they lose but that was one crazy ass series and I don’t think the coach deserves that much blame for it."
have you seen Jamal Murray in the bubble? dude looked like the GOAT
Isn't Jamal Murray also on a max or am I mistaken? He's putting up 18/4/4
"Considering what happened in the bubble. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going off, Warren playing like MJ, suns goingn 8-0. This was clearly because of the bubble. None of that would of happened without the bubble, including the Heat making the finals"
"When u are 23 years old and are a generational rebounder who shows flashes of dominance and other skill sets with some flaws in your game there is a ton of hype. Just look at jamal Murray in the bubble for instance.   When u are 27 years old and you improved none of your game besides shooting free throws since when you were a rookie then well, yeah."
Jamal Murray: challenge accepted.
Is he worse than Jamal Murray? You have to overpay young guys.
"Random thought: imo Julius Randle is a big reason why Canadian Hooper's are making noise in the NBA. When he was in HS, Wiggins was already thought of as the best HS baller in North America, but it wasn't until Julius Randle Vs Wiggins became a thing that Canadians started being scouted properly.   Even after that guys like Jamal Murray still had to go off in the U-17 Olympics just to get drafted. But before that, players had to basically be Wiggins just to get a chance."
Jamal Murray literally jumps out of the way. Just horrible.

"I mean Jokic has led top 10 offenses for his entire career so far, when his second best player (Jamal Murray) really isn’t THAT good and is super inconsistent, then a bunch of roll players. It’s obviously too early to say right now but on a career basis but there’s really no reason to believe Jokic *couldn’t* end up being better over his career. Yes, he’s not as good dirk from 3 in most seasons so far, but he’s way better from midrange and an infinitely better passer, so it’s not hard to imagine his long term offensive impact being greater. Jokic has the potential to be a top tier HOF when all is said and done, it’s not a mark against Dirk at all. Just context for how good Jokic is."
"Play was great, especially for a 36 year old.  It overshadowed the better play 20 seconds before.  Jamal Murray putting a defender on his heels with a dribble move at the 3 point line, welcoming a second defender, and a rocket one hand pass under the basket to an open team mate leading to a foul.  It was ballet.  It was magic.  Chicks dig the long ball and the open bucket hammer.  But Jamal's play is why the Nuggets are a better TEAM."
"Nuggets are fucking sadists, man. They don't want to beat you. They don't want to win a game. They want to crush your soul and scattered your ashes to the wind. Hyped about your win streak? Jokic will rip it away from you and cast it into fucking Mordor. Up 3-1? Jamal Murray will laugh as he incinerates everything you love. Nuggets' chances of victory increase depending on how devastating their opponents defeat will be."
I’m rooting for bron and think he’s gonna win cause it’s been the narrative since before the season started. But if you think 27/11/9 from a center whose best teammate is Jamal Murray (not AD or Philly’s solid squad) means no shot cause they end up as the 4 seed than I’d say you’re willfully ignorant
He's better than Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray is the first player in NBA history
Jamal murray and jokic
"Man jamal murray is that guy that comes in for one last good head kick after the guys already out, actin like a clown"
Booker has been better than Murray for every single season of their careers. Kinda foolish on your part to expect Jamal Murray to be at his level.
I like RJs point. Jamal Murray has been really disappointing in general this year. Not even in the All Star conversation and his team is only 7th in the West. I really thought he’d be a perennial All Star by now
Does Jamal Murray have a fitness tracker under his wrist band? Looked like a silhouette of something in that shot of him on the bench.
"These are weirdly cherrypicked stats to make an argument. You picked starting lineups to compare individual defenders and did so by picking a lineup where we have old man Gasol? Who's just there because AD doesn't play the 4 all game all season?  Compare your best lineup to ours (Caruso, KCP, Kuz/Schroeder, LeBron, AD) and it'll look much better. Your starting lineup is your best defensively already; Bev, PG, Kawhi, Batum and Ibaka.  Also, why focus on Jamal Murray in the bubble? After all, when LeBron guarded him at the end of the game he got absolutely clamped.... but when Kawhi was on him he got put on a highlight reel  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7b7NQEzPFY&amp;ab\_channel=FEARKCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7b7NQEzPFY&amp;ab_channel=FEARKCP)"
Jamal Murray has averaged 18/4/4 the previous two seasons. He is averaging 18/4/4 again this season
Jamal Murray becomes JAMAL MURRAY come playoff time
"20-21 years old season comparison, Herro is just as good if not better  Jamal Murray = fringe star, Herro could be the same"
"First of all, Herro 100% isn’t outperforming Jamal Murray.  Second of all we are talking about Dejounte, who he also isn’t outperforming."
Jamal Murray is probably the best example. He can take over a game and out play superstars but he’s painfully inconsistent
"CJ Mccollum, Conley, De'Aaron Fox, Jamal Murray, Brogdan, Tobias Harris, DeRozan, Ja Morant, Zion, KP, etc. Guys like that, even if some of these guys will prob make a team this year"
"That’s a good point. It’d be interesting to look through the stats after this season though. I’m curious if COVID and the lack of training camp is gonna cause more wild swings than normal.   There’s also different kinds of good shooters. The first is guys that are super hot and cold like Danny Green, Robert Covington, or Jamal Murray (or me on a much worse scale, lol). The second type of guys who are just always consistently good, but don’t necessarily reach the same peaks as the guys from the first category, like JJ Reddick. I’m not sure which is more valuable."
"Herro was 20 two weeks ago  Murray is 24  Sexton 22 on a bad team where stats are easy to come by  Herro is outperforming Jamal Murray at the same age, wouldn’t be surprising if he turns into a fringe star"
Did you watch the series? Jamal Murray was also playing ridiculously good. He was hitting shots that he had no business making.
"Only Nets can win against Lakers. But i don't think Nets will make it to Finals. People don't know how to rank playoff teams. Utah, Boston, Nets, Clippers, Bucks, Suns, Nuggets are really good teams. But sometimes good isn't enough. They gotta win 4 times against AD and Lebron. And supporting cast looks even stronger than last year. Kawhi is unlucky because he has the weakest duo. I would prefer Jamal Murray or Rudy Gobert over PG.  Edit: or Devin Booker"
Man remember in the bubble when the nuggets won that game 1 against the jazz and then Jamal Murray filmed Donovan in the bubble hyping him up about his 57 points? Donovan was looking like “bruh...”. Shit cracks me up
"when was jamal murray a superstar? jokic has been carrying the nuggets this season, bubble murray was an anomaly - he hasn’t showed up."
Was it Jamal Murray?
There's always so much revisionist history after the playoffs. Last couple years the bucks were considered a contender because they were a 60+ win team with a superstar MVP and a coach of the year. They have one bad playoffs and suddenly Giannis was never a superstar and bud needs to be fired.   Jamal Murray has one good playoffs after averaging the same stats in the regular season for 3 years straight and suddenly he's always been a rising star.  Towns has one bad series in the playoffs and suddenly he wasn't a rising star anymore.  If we perform well in the playoffs people are gonna start pretending like they knew the jazz were contenders the whole time.
I can’t lie Mitchell shot a ridiculous 3 point percentage.. but Mitchell carries the Jazz offense all the time including in the playoffs.. Jamal Murray has never even averaged over 18 ppg... plus murray literally shot 75% plus from 3 like every game... that’s a lucky streak no matter what dude.
"May not be aberrational relative to the player. Is abberational relative to Donovan Mitchell, as well as Jamal Murray, who are not GOAT tier offensive players."
"Jokic doesn’t need to play with other “big men” play creators. He is the creator. Jokic needs play finishers.  Guys that know when to cut and can finish at the rim and guards/wings that can knock down open shots that he makes for them.  Jokic playing with a guy like Zion who he can create offense for is better than him and Draymond passing the ball back and forth to each other saying “you shoot it”. Draymond is an excellent play creator in his own right but an absolute turd of a play finisher.   Replace Jamal Murray with a more efficient and deadly offensive scorer like a Steph Curry, Dame, or Bradley Beal and the world might explode."
"Jamal Murray ain’t no robin, get outta here with that shit Perk"
I consider Simmons a very good player but I wouldn't call him a superstar. Jamal Murray is also not yet proven.
It was a bubble and Jamal Murray had the stretch of his life. Came down to a last second shot missed too. But they nearly beat that strong Nuggets team without Bogdanovic
"&gt;better stats (which alone is still arguable)=/= playing better, being an offball playmaker isn't inherently lesser than being an on all playmaker  It absolutely is; Curry stans are delusional if they think they can convince people running around screens is more valuable than running an entire offense unless you're a role player  Curry is the best at using off ball movement ever, and it's been valuable to his team, but Jokic's playmaking is far more valuable and impressive. The offense he's generating by himself as invaluable. Curry has to have a bunch of people setting the screens &amp; making the right passes to get him into position; there's much more dependence on Curry's teammates as Jokic has to create everything for himself and everyone else  &gt;nugs also have a much more reliable offensive cast, 8 10 PPG scorers to 4 (including Wiseman who is not a positive yet and Oubre who has been awfully inconsistent and either wins or loses them the game each game)  No, not much more. They're shooting poorly, they're injured, Jamal Murray is the only offensive player who can maybe create for himself and he's been terrible (and hurt), and Jokic is the one creating most of those points for those guys.   Jokic is ahead of the race right now"
"Jokic has a better record, better stats, and with the way Jamal Murray and the rest of his team is playing, has less to work with.  After their slow starts, Draymond, Wiggins and Oubre have been better than Murray and MPJ this year based on defense alone."
Jamal Murray is not a level above Draymond Green
"&gt;Jokic has Jamal Murray   No, he really doesn't.."
"I would say Jamal Murray, even though he's averaging 18.3ppg. Why? Cos after the insane playoff run last year, this level of performance is kinda not living up to expectations. In fact, all his stats *regressed* from last season: fewer points, fewer assists, lower shooting % across the board. Absolutely not the breakout that many people expected."
Jamal Murray
Damian Lillard/Jamal Murray
Ben simmons is leagues above regular season murray cuz ben is a defensive superstar and pretty good playmaker. Jamal murray averaged 26 in 40 min through 20 games.
He's better at basketball than Jamal Murray.  He's also not their 2nd option scoring threat.   2nd option =/= 2nd best player those are two different things. Ben Wallace wasn't the pistons 2nd option on offense.
jamal murray lmao
"Jamal Murray superstar AHahahahahahahahahahah Perkins has brains the size of a pea, with every take, always ..."
"Draymond Green is better than Jamal Murray, maybe Simmons too"
Certified superstar Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray is not a superstar lmao.
How is Jamal Murray considered a Robin this season?
"If we're making that case, it should be about Jamal Murray, not Mitchell."
Than god for this season's Jamal Murray.
Draymond is literally a more impactful player than Jamal Murray lol
Jamal Murray has been inconsistent. The Sixers should just keep the team they have.
The 76ers should trade Ben Simmons for Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray would probably be at the same, maybe a little less, value as Wiggins."
"I have to wonder how well you remember the 3 games between the Lakers and Jazz last season when you say all of this, because the Lakers absolutely abused Utah all three times last year. None of the games were even particularly competitive. Utah relies heavily on Gobert to protect the paint and on outside shooting. Anthony Davis always pulls Gobert away from the basket, which renders his defense far less effective, and the Lakers are one of the best at covering perimeter shooters. Just look at how masterful they were in the playoffs at absolutely locking down other teams' 3-pt shooting. For Donovan Mitchell the Lakers have a bunch of guys to put on him who are bigger and stronger than he is, in KCP, Caruso and even LeBron if they want to (just look at LeBron's defense against Jamal Murray in last year's WCF). And the Lakers can match his quickness with Schroder, who is also a great defender.   The Lakers weren't built with the Jazz in mind, but nonetheless the Lakers are perfectly equipped to neutralize everything Utah wants to do, and that was painfully evident last season. But on the other end, the Jazz have a *major* flaw when it comes to trying to defend the Lakers, as they have nobody to put on LeBron. They really don't have anyone to guard AD either, as he always roasts Gobert. I mean, [just look at their last meeting if you doubt that.](https://youtu.be/bOLwalTFgCA) The Clippers represent a much bigger threat to the Lakers, IMO (provided Paul George is ever healthy again, of course). I would love it if the Jazz could take out the Clippers in the 2nd round and leave the Lakers to only have to face Utah. That would be a very easy series for the Lakers, IMO."
"He's not a superstar but he's a certified Robin, imo. I think there is a solid step down from Ad to PG, then another from PG to Simmons, then another solid step down to a Jamal Murray, but Jamal is clearly the lowest on the totem pole."
"idk how everyone is acting like Ben Simmons isn't a top 30 or so player. he finished ahead of Embiid in DPOY last year and he's one of the games most efficient passers and finishers in transition. anyone who thinks, say, Brandon Ingram is better and contributes more to winning than Ben Simmons is wrong.   Jamal Murray isn't even close outside of one playoff run. if Murray could even be a regular star on a nightly basis, you might be able to talk but he isn't even that. there are a lot of guys who can blow up every couple weeks. he's the odd man out in that list more than Simmons lol"
I love Jamal Murray but Andrew Wiggins has been just as good as him this year. There’s a reason GSW and Denver have almost identical records.
"One of those things is not like the other...  AD: multi-time all star, 1st team all NBA and all defense  PG: multi time al star, former MVP candidate  Ben Simmons: made all NBA and all defensive team last year, one of the best wing defenders and playmakers in the league.   Jamal Murray... had a great playoff run last year, is averaging 18/4/4 this year"
&gt;jamal murray
&gt; superstar  &gt; Jamal Murray  &gt; Ben Simmons
"You’re completely missing the fact that game seven against the “Bubble Nuggets” came down to the wire in a series where Jamal Murray inexplicably could not miss. Then that same “Bubble Nuggets” went on to the WCF. If Murray hadn’t gone super sayan or if the series had been one shot different, or if Jazz weren’t missing Bogdonavic, that would’ve likely been Jazz in the WCF and your perception of them would be much different right now."
Less of a meltdown and more of Jamal murray playing like unanimous MVP curry and hitting even contested shots at a ridiculous rate
"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"
Do people really not remember last year’s playoffs where Utah went down to the wire in a game 7 thriller vs a Denver team with Jamal Murray in god mode? This team is legit and Shaq is gonna be salty af all season watching them ball.
Probably the closest thing to it being 2016 with Simmons Ingram and brown but siakam and Jamal Murray were also in that class who u can make a debate for being top 3
Jamal Murray tough as a two buck steak. Love him.
Jamal Murray
surprised jamal murray isn’t on here given that his shot selection has been some of the worst i’ve ever seen from a star player
"Jamal Murray went crazy as well, is Gobert a bad defender?"
"Almost everyone on here is saying he's mediocre.  Context matters. Dude has played a total of 8 or 9 games with an All-Star caliber player (Steph or KAT). He played under the dumb and dumber of coaches in Byron Scott and Luke Walton. He's also playing under arguably the worst coach in the NBA in Ryan Saunders, who is persistent on playing Dlo/Rubio lineups. He never allows Dlo to continue getting in a rhythm even when he's getting hot.   Believe it or not, Dlo is actually playing arguably the best defense he's played this season. He also happens to be shooting 40% from 3 on high volume.   I hate when people use the term ""overrated"" when they're using that term properly. If a player were overrated, he would be talked about in a positive regard on a regular basis. His team is trash and not many people talk about him. If anything Dlo is underrated on this sub.   A good example of overrated would be Jamal Murray. People here still living off that bubble performance and thinking he's a Top 30 player in the league."
My intention was not to shit on Jamal Murray
I am the gatekeeper of NBA truth and Jamal Murray played 19 games better than Kyrie Irving.  Bow to my superior wisdom you filthy peasant!
"I know the Playoffs were more than 2 weeks ago, but /r/nba does remember Jamal Murray playing like prime Steph Curry right?  Dude took over game-after-game until meeting the eventual champions ffs"
Playoff Jamal Murray is better than Kyrie Irving  Regular season Jamal Murray however...  I don't know if Coach Malone forgets he's there or something?
"Murray has elbow issues which has affected his shot. Murray also isnt really a bad playmaker, he's pretty good, he's just playing with a top 3 passer. Obviously Russ still a better playmaker, but jamal is still a better overall shooter."
"It's more Russ shooting better from 3 than expected, Jamal Murray is shooting nearly the same % as last regular season."
"I get your point and I'm not trying to disprove it as this is just a weird fact, but Russ is actually shooting a better% from 3 than Jamal Murray right now.  Edit: Like I said though yeah Jamal is obviously a better shooter than Russ"
The Jamal Murray take isn’t hot.
"1. The Jazz have the best roster in the NBA  2. Tobias Harris is the most important player on the Sixers  3. Kristaps Porzingis was the worst value of that trade.  4. Bubble Jamal Murray was, in fact, a fluke.  5. Bradley Beal is a bad team stat padder."
Why Alex Coruso and not Jamal Murray
"I'm literally giving you basic defensive scheme   Quinn Snyder got beat by Jamal Murray, because he didn't make adjustments EARLY ENOUGH"
"It's really true. If you look at the records of all of the conference finalists, they're all much worse than you'd have expected in a normal year (except the Lakers). Boston is 12-11, Denver is 13-11 and Miami is 10-14 after having even less rest than either Boston or Denver did. I think the short layoff really impacted all four conference finalists.   There have been a couple key players from those teams who haven't yet been impacted (LeBron, Jokic, Bam), but otherwise I think we're seeing a bunch of lingering effects. AD and Jaylen and possibly Jamal Murray are probably most prominent among them, though Covid of course has also decimated the Heat and the Celtics at times.  I think part of why the Lakers are the only one of those teams that's still doing well is because of both LeBron being superhuman, but also because they brought in a whole bunch of new players they are leaning heavily on so far this year who didn't play deep into the postseason. Schoder, Trez and THT have been key contributors for the Lakers this year, and none of them played beyond the 2nd round in the bubble."
Jamal Murray won’t have the pleasure of playing against Tony Bradley this time
Snyder didn't want to double Jamal Murray when he was TORCHING the jazz.    Idk if adjustments should be expected
"**2020**: Zeke Nnaji at 22, RJ Hampton at 24.  **2019:** Bol Bol at 44.  **2018:** Michael Porter Jr at 14.  **2017:** Monte Morris at 51.  **2016:** Jamal Murray at 7, Malik Beasley at 19  **2014:** Nikola Jokic at 41."
"The turnovers are bad but I think his shot selection is actually pretty solid, especially considering the role he’s often had to play in the bulls short handed offense this season.  I think everyone just sees that a lot of his faults could/would be papered over on a team where he didn’t have to do so much playmaking AND scoring.  Athletic two-guards with pinpoint accuracy are exactly the types of players who can tear up playoff defenses in the modern NBA. They’re offensive usefulness seems to even be surpassing the typical 6-8 power wing. Just look at who thrived in the bubble games: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, even Tyler Herro.  I salivate thinking about what Lavine would look like taking some pressure off guys like Giannis, Embiid, Jokic and Lebron."
All Star level not All NBA level. If his playoffs going forward look more like 18-19 than 19-20 then he is the PF Jamal Murray.
"We do like him. I’m personally a big believer in Coby but some fans have been frustrated by his inconsistency. People forget to take into account that he’s literally 20 years old and never got to play a full rookie season. And his partial rookie season was under Jim Boylen, who was probably the worst NBA head coach in recent years.   Coby will be fine, he just needs time which is totally natural. His play style/potential reminds me a lot of Jamal Murray fwiw"
"Curry, Butler, DRose, Derozan, Jamal Murray"
"Im glad you found a small 10 game sample size that can be shoehorned into your argument.   Lets just agree Nuggets have no way to obtain LaVine and hes outplaying Jamal this season. If Murray performs well again in the playoffs, Ill shut up. But lets wait and see.   As for Porter, I just think the off the court comments will scare any team from trading where he is the centerpiece. You cant invest all around a guy who has terrible injury history AND seems as immature as any young star today. Both of them combined makes him an amazing third option, a great secondary option and a really risky/scary core guy to build around."
Well I hope Charlotte enjoys some success with the Wilson Chandler they get. The picks might also one day become Jamal Murray.
False. Jamal Murray is a grown ass man.
Because you want to build around Jokic long term. Why do you want a 34 year old in that case? What? Do you think trading Jamal Murray(Jokic's best friend on the team) for a 35 year old Lowry(When Jokic is an FA)is going to stop Jokic from leaving in free agency? That is an idiotic decision to make. Jokic needs to know the contract he signs will lead to competitive play every year he plays
"Not as good as if they also added Jamal Murray, Seth Curry, and Sabonis...."
Is SGA the best Canadian in basketball right now?    Jamal was but this article tells me SGA is above Murray now.
"The most interesting question to me is whether feats in the bubble can be discredited because of this stat. I know that for some reason, whenever anyone tries to say the what happened in the bubble can’t be counted as much, it usually means that Lebron and the Lakers didn’t deserve their title. That’s not what I’m getting to at all, I’m talking about all the other anomalies that occurred within the bubble.   It’s practically unprecedented for the four conference finals teams to be performing this poorly, is that a fluke or can we trust that everything that happened in the bubble was legitamite, and therefore could happen again? It’s still a very relevant question that can help determine who’s a contender next year. How legitamite were Jamal Murray’s and Donovan Mitchell’s playoff performances? The Jazz are looking like a great team while lacking a top 5 talent, which is vital to winning a championship. Last playoffs, Mitchell certainly looked like a top 5 player, but can he do it again? That defends on if you view feats in the bubble as legitimate or not.   I know that discrediting team’s accomplishments in any way, shape or form is viewed at as being a hater, but we saw so many players take massive leaps inside the bubble; it just has me curious to whether or not they can repeat this. To tie this back to the post, if the four conference finals teams are just unlucky as of now and will get back to playing like competing teams, then that adds legitimacy to what happened in the bubble, and therefore we could expect certain players like Murray and Mitchell to shine next playoffs."
"Jamal Murray shouldn't have stopped to begin with, everyone kinda messed up honestly. But yeah, maybe MPJ was instructed to go to the corner...but someone needs to cut to the basket lmao"
"The bubble made Jamal Murray look like the second coming of Jordan  It only makes sense people take ""the bubble"" with a grain of salt.  \- Also I just thought it was a funny coincidence"
"Jamal Murray was frying Kawhi one on one , don’t even start with the “they call screens to get Kawhi off them” narrative."
There are 3 players in that picture. By that logic Jamal Murray doesn’t like any of the other 2 guys either.
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."

"I love Jamal but Boylen would destroy our offensive system, there is bigger gap Denver's best and second best player than most playoff teams so having Boylen is lot more damaging than not having Murray."
You know what else helps the team not concede points in the paint? Not giving the ball that lead to easy transition points in the paint for easy points in the restricted area.   For context Jamal's Assist to Turnover Ratio is less than 2. Which means he does not even rank in the top 100 in the NBA in terms of assist to turnover ratiol  It's not like Jokic was complaining when Jamal Murray was playing against the Nuggets until like 2 weeks ago. Dude's not consistent enough to call out the franchise player
"Dude, he was in only two playoff series in both of which he posted all time numbers. What are you even arguing?  &gt; Also, Jamal Murray was arguably the best player in most of the series they played last year  Murray wasn't even better in the Utah series where he posted most of his big numbers. Jokic decided that series in the 7th game."
"&gt;in his two seasons of playoffs   Key phrase. He's been arguably dominant, but not *consistently* dominant enough to put him among the greatest ever playoff performers.  Also, Jamal Murray was arguably the best player in most of the series they played last year"
jamal murray isn't good enough to be calling out his team left and right
&gt;  but Murray could've covered for MPJ's mistake  this would require for Jamal to know MPJ would end up being dumb and going to the corner tho
"Yo. Beal wasn't anywhere close to Murray when Jamal inexplicably picked up the dribble. It would've been an easy layup if he just went in.   http://imgur.com/gallery/OyFBVBK  Beal is 15 feet away, off balance, moving the wrong direction. If Jamal just angles very slightly into the lane, it's a dunk.  &gt;The goal is to force an open shot, which should be easy.  Yeah, and Murray had one that he gave up for no reason"
Last year was Jamal Murray man. Jokic was good but god damn Murray was killing it.
when they were talking about who was in the wrong on the nuggets play? he was right tho jamal murray did nothing wrong
Beal was standing inside the key when Jamal pulled up. If Beal kept backpedaling then he would have stopped the fastbreak and Murray would have been the dumbass forced to shoot a 3. The fact that the most basic give and go wasn't run there is insane.
Jamal attacks the lane he takes his defender with him therefore clogging the paint. Stopping at the top of the key left enormous space. Second Murray should not have even had the opportunity to stop if those guys just ran straight to the hole
For real. Jamal Murray drug the D out by stopping
That 4-1 was pretty damn bad. Then had Kenny saying it was Jamal Murray fault which was almost as dumb.
Kenny so wrong. Jamal Murray did the best thing possible by bringing out the defense to him
So by your logic Jamal Murray is a superstar.
I love Jamal Murray I hammered the wizards moneline both before the game and every time it got above +250 live in game and him not taking it to the hole like he should off just made me some good money
Why are some of you blaming Jamal Murray here? Porter Jr had a free lane to the basket right?
Wtf did jamal murray just do?? Why would you pass to a bench player to take the clutch shot instead of just going ot the rim
Jamal Murray jesus christ what are you doing
I’d like to apologize on behalf of the entire dmv for whatever we did to make Jamal Murray hate us so much
"Jamal Murray is averaging 19 points in the 4th quarter last 4 games. Guess we're in the bubble again. I actually like how everyone underrates us again, while ignoring that we have 70% of the roster injured all the season. Now with Murray playing great, can't wait for salt mines to get active again"
Him and Jamal Murray carried mostly scrubs against the clippers who people had as a clear favorite to win the chip. He's dominated the last two playoffs and people want to act like it doesn't count. But Embiid has had a nice 25 games and people want to call him top 5 and clearly better. Jokic still doesn't get respect
"Both teams get worse.   Bucks only won games recently with Giannis averaging something like 30 ppg and 8 assists because the Bucks defense was not very good after missing Jrue. Although Jokic can playmake better than Giannis, he can’t score as consistently, and his defense is worse. With the regression of Lopez, they kinda need interior defense.  Giannis on the Nuggets would remove the primary playmaker and lay even heavier burden on Jamal Murray, who is quite streaky."
"Who was doing most of the damage against the Jazz in the first round last year? It was mostly two guys in Jamal Murray and Jokic, correct? Do you have the belief that Bron and AD wouldn't do more damage? That's effectively how they won the championship with some decent contributions from the role players on offense and defense from time to time."
Jamal Murray.
"nah, Jamal gigachad Murray is a stud"
Jamal Murray sends his regards
"Am a Nuggets fan - I was in love with SGA for us if he made it to 14. Him and Jamal Murray together would be \*chef's kiss\*. Of course, happy with how things played out anyway, if MPJ reaches his potential he'll be a better player than SGA overall probably, when it's said and done. But SGA was the guy I wanted because I figured MPJ would be long gone by 14. Turns out SGA shouldve also gone way higher than he did though. He'd have fit in almost anywhere and been helpful."
"Based on last playoffs Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell are the best guards since Michael Jordan, Jimmy Butler is on LeBron's level and Anthony Davis is the best mid range shooter in the history of the league by a wide margin. I think we can safely say none of those are true and the bubble inflated offensive performance."
Well that’s more understandable given that players who show up when it matters most get a lot of the marketing. I’m getting Jamal Murray ads because of last playoffs. Deserved. Not so much Kawhi and PG...but idk how league pass app works   the media spins it around way too much.
i fucking love jamal murray
"Porzingis in the bubble was way better compared to my expectations at the time of trade. Also, unlike Jamal Murray and TJ Warren, his performance seemed natural.   I don't think I will ever doubt him even when he played like he did during our Covid crisis. Hopefully he will be back soon."
Jamal Murray
"Meanwhile I'm here screaming at Jamal Murray...  &gt; *""DAMN YOU, YOU COST ME 2 FANTASY POINTS IN MY LEAGUE""*"
Also don't forget that Jamal Murray is the first player in the NBA.
"So let me ask you this, would Jamal Murray have been intrigal to your playoff success if you had picked Nick Johnson in that 2014 draft over Jokic? Your flexing your Jamal Murray pick like you finessed for him when 90% of the reason your team is successful is because of a totally unrelated second round pick"
"It was a pick swap, to be clear.  &gt;The only real effect it had was that the Nuggets drafted Jamal Murray  It had a massive effect on the last decade of Nuggets basketball."
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
Jamal Murray? I wasn't aware bubble performances counted towards this year's all star votes.
"The way they were talking about the Melo trade was ridiculously annoying.   First off, they made it sound like Melo never wanted to leave Denver in the first place. “It was tough for him, he wanted to win a championship in this city but it never came together, so New York was the option that was open to him.”  Bitch, he forced his way out. That’s not a secret. Don’t make it sound like the big mean Nuggets shipped him out in a box with air holes poked in the lid.   Second, if you’re gonna go on and on about how huge the impact of that trade was, maybe talk about why?   The first time they started talking about it, they didn’t mention Jamal Murray (he was the last pick involved in the trade). The second time they talked about it, they said “and the last piece of that trade ended up being Jamal Murray. So things work out in the end!” and then they move on."

"Jamal "" Canadian Sex Panther"" Murray"
"Jamal Murray is the reason for our playoff success the past two years. Despite a lot of peoples' hate boner for the guy, he is VITAL to this team's success. Doesn't always show up in the stat sheet, but his chemistry with Jokic is outstanding.   There was a statistic I saw that Murray was actually top 5-10 in hockey assists. Those are things that don't show up on the stats that make a huge difference."
I think that has more to do with that second round pick out of Serbia than the Carmelo trade though. The only real affect to this current day for your team is Jamal Murray
"I mean it doesn’t really make a difference anymore. The only real effect it had was that the Nuggets drafted Jamal Murray with one of the Knicks picks, but that’s it"
"Well, if Jamal Murray rightfully gets called for a travel, and everything else plays out like it does, the Suns are in the 2 spot and not the 4 spot by the time the voting is done. Because they are ONE GAME behind the Lakers and the Clippers who each have 2 all-stars.  Does your logic change or do you only see ""4th in the west, my decision is made?"""
"&gt;Have you followed Jokic in the playoffs at all? Last year by the time we got to the WCF we were coming off two 7-game series and the whole team was gassed, so if those games were the only ones you watched you’d get a different impression. Jokic’s playoff advanced+traditional stats are completely insane.  Yes, I also remember he wouldn't be there at all and be out in the 1st round without Michael Jor- I mean, Jamal Murray dropping 50 multiple times to eek out a 3-1 comeback... Not to mention you won on a rim out game winner.   Jokic deserves credit no matter what, but that Jazz series had to perfectly go your way to win, moreso than any other series I've seen, that was insanely close and the story woulda been different if not for that. Murray was honestly better half of your playoff run  &gt;Dude is averaging 25/11/7 on 57% eFG in the playoffs (33 games). For comparison, LeBron’s career average is 29/9/7 on 53% eFG, Jordan’s is 33/6/6 on 50% eFG. Obviously huge sample size difference and not trying to argue that Jokic is better than the GOATs in the playoffs, but the fact that he’s in the same ballpark as those guys statistically (advanced stats incorporating defense included) is completely ridiculous.  Pretty sure AD's stats are monster too, but it's a small sample size and that's why I tone it down when fellow Laker fans call AD an all-time playoff performer solely because of it. You really have to take into context when dealing with playoff sample sizes  &gt;Embiid is awful in the playoffs- 43% career playoff eFG% is fucking embarrassing and the team has gotten slapped around too, even getting first round swept in a much worse Eastern conference last year. Almost half of his points last year came from FTs lol. They really are not comparable players at all on the big stage.  True, Jokic is clearly been better playoff wise, but you're missing context. He played alongside a bad fit in Horford and his 2nd best teammate/playmaker being out in last year's playoffs, had to go up against one of the best defenders in the league in Gasol the year before that and I remember him playing Horford in the playoffs (another great defender too). He's still worse than Jokic in the playoffs, but you're missing context  Genuine question; what's Jokic's stats vs the Lakers in the WCF when he had to go against AD and Dwight?"
"Yeah, no kidding Jamal Murray loves 4th quarters.   He scored 19 tonight in the fourth against Portland.   He scored 16 in the fourth against Atlanta.   He scored 20 during the fourth his 50 piece against Cleveland   He scored 19 during the fourth against Washington.   and that was all within the last week."
I’ll bet Jamal Murray feels like a real ass
Jamal Murray decided to win the game in the 4th. Cool!
"In the final 9 minutes, despite looking like he had a hurt shoulder and missing eight of his first 9 shots Jamal Murray scored 19 points on 6/10 shooting and made the clutch free throws. Credit where it's due, he stepped up when it counted most"
Jamal murray 2021 mvp😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
"Fam... I just named 4 guys who rose to the occasion just like him. Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, etc all rose to the occasion just like he did. And just like butler they all lost. What are you smoking? It must be strong as fuck"
"West is always a murderer's row trying to get into the All Star Game.  Like Booker not being chosen, Ingram (24/5/5 with good efficiency) not making it.  Spurs are 5th in the West and don't have anyone realistically even close to making it. Jamal Murray, KAT, Porzingus, Morant, Fox, SGA, all left out.  It's just brutal how high the bar is in the West."
I can't wait until he votes Jamal Murray All-NBA this season using this logic.
"&gt;20/28/29 ppg respectively in their first 3 seasons since 18 years old  I think his PPG will be capped around 30. Maybe early 30's like 32. In fact his scoring is the same this year as it was last year at 28.8 but he might make another jump soon. I doubt he will improve much on this end so he has to improve either his efficiency or defense to compete with the greats.  &gt;triple double machine  Guard/front court rebounding is one of the more pointless stats.  It is usually &gt;70% uncontested which is the case for all of them whether it be Westbrook, Luka, or Lebron.  &gt;shoots okay, his shot selection needs work but really he's shooting from the 3 like Beal isn't he?  His best year shooting the three is the almost as good as the worst year of Bradley Beal shooting the three in the sample size of half a shortened year. Even still, he isn't competing with Beal, he is competing with all time greats and most of them either shot much better or defended much better at an early age. He is on his third year now (on very high volume) in a row where he shoots below league average 3% and below league average ft%.   &gt;He also proved he can perform in the playoffs, the problem is can the rest of his team  They lasted one series. Not sure I can confidently say that as much as you with one series sample size. Jamal Murray put up MJ esque stats vs the Utah Jazz in their series.  Porzingis and Seth Curry were both playing out of their mind shooting around 50% from 3 and they still lost. I didn't buy the narrative that the Mavs were a bad team that was carried by Luka and I am not to surprised they are a losing team so far this year when their really good depth players to FA or injury.  Many think that Luka will improve his shooting and defense when he gets a lot of the load taken off of him. Often Lebron is cited for this. For every Lebron there is a handful of plays that switch teams and never improve defense significantly and actually those players don't mesh well because they are the type of player that needs the ball to be effective. I think Luka is the type of person who needs to have a lot of touches to take advantage of his skillset because he isn't very athletic defender or a very good shooter. I know he has high volume 3 point shooting but even when factoring that in, his 3 point shooting sticks out like a sore thumb. His catch and shoot 3% has been &lt;30% two years in a row now which is unusual and what people often use to gauge how a shooter would shoot if they are more open. Luka did have a good stretch of shooting this year so maybe he can continue that stretch for longer. We shall see."
Jamal Murray should be an all-star then
Are you ignoring the existence of Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray?
Jamal Murray
"Watson is such a clown, he was on Arenas’s podcast and was talking about how he wanted to draft Jamal Murray instead of Bender"
"Ok, but seriously Jamal Murray isn't all-star calibre, he's had a good stretch but played pretty bad for majority of the season so far. I'd take both Suns guards over him in the ASG rn, and I was joking about FVV."
"Jamal, as in Jamal Murray?   Guy has worse stats/impact than Booker or CP3 on a worse team. There is no argument for him."
Like if Jamal Murray was a Sophomore
"My buddy went to school with him! My claim to fame is being friends with people who have acquainted RJ, SGA, and Jamal Murray"
"I think that's the key. He has the *ability* to be top 5, but actual production matters. He certainly produced that way in the playoffs, but isn't this year.   Jamal Murray has the *ability* to be an all star, as we saw in the playoffs, but hasn't put together anything close to that type of season.   Really, outside lebron and maybe kd, Steph, and harden, everyone else has just been either too inconsistent in their career or hasn't done it long enough to be permanently in the top 5. Like, jokic and Embiid are def top 5 this year, but they gotta keep it up for years. Same with AD bubble performance, definitely top 5 level but now it's gone again"
"Oh and just in case you thought this was somehow an isolated incident:  [Here's a dirty steal attempt that tore Westbrook's meniscus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFPHntPCvEY)  [Then a similar play against the same opponent years later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3ITg0UvZ8)  [Here he is putting Conley in a ridiculous headlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-AXz-vlMfM)  [Another extremely dirty foul on Jamal Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-P_7QQgA8)  That's not all there is. This is a pattern and an obvious one. I respect players who play a hard game, get pesky, and put in defensive work. Nobody should respect players who routinely put other players at risk without a second thought."
"you guys should look into putting a trade package together for Jamal Murray, or Draymond. Have heard they have some to offer"
"&gt;You're referencing a 14 game sample size...  No, because he also had a lot of good games during the playoffs the year before the bubble. He literally was a big reason why they won the 7 game series over San Antonio to get to Portland in the second round.  &gt;I am simply saying overall during a normal NBA season, and not the bubble which clearly helped with shooting, Murray has been very inconsistent his entire career so far.  Yes but he's having a really consistent stretch so far, he's also averaging the best shooting percentages of his career this season shooting 47% from the field and 38% from 3.  &gt;People should stop pointing to bubble performances as if they're sustainable.  I'm not solely pointing to bubble performances as a reason why Jamal has a high ceiling. Jamal has proven time and time again that he can step up in clutch moments and make baskets when the Nuggets need him to, he's done it in the regular season, in the playoffs, and in the bubble.   People should also stop acting like Jamal is incapable of being a consistent performer or that he's incapable of having good performances without being in the bubble. He's had good performances before the bubble as well and, he's twenty-three turning twenty-four to claim that he's already reached his ceiling at this age is just insane to me."
I mean the Jamal Murray praise got out of hand coming into this season. People were calling him a top 10 player after he played well in the bubble environment.
This version of embiid needs to be like this for 2 seasons at least before we start saying hes better than a 2x MVP. Unless jamal Murray was the best point guard in the league at the time of the bubble??
"Wilson Chandler was a 23 years old guy who was averaging 16 on good efficiency while being a solid defender and who was a key piece on that Denver team that won a ton of games in 2013  Felton was in consideration fot the ASG that season, Mozgov was a starting caliber center for years after that.  And they gave up 2 first rounders, the 2014 and the 2016 one (a swap that became Jamal Murray not that it matters in that).  If you don't think trading all that for a guy who was gonna be a free agent 3 month after was bad asset management I don't know what to tell you.  And if the risk was ""he could sign elsewhere"" then you live with it."
"You’re right, what Jonas did was bad too. Doesn’t make Pat Bevs play on Jamal Murray any better. I agree his screen on Jeff Green wasn’t dirty but kicking out your leg on a defenseless player in the air, already at the rim with no chance of stopping him is 100% not a clean play. I’ve been undercut going to the rim unintentionally and seen people get undercut unintentionally and it does not look like that so idk what you’re talking about"
"&gt; KD has probably the best shot selection in the league other than Kawhi.  I wouldn't say they have great shot selection, I'd say that they both are excellent bad shot makers. They make bad, low efficiency shots really, really well. That bodes well for late game playoff situations where it's harder to generate offense and the game becomes ISO ball/mismatch hunting because teams want to reduce turnovers and put the ball in their best players hands to make a play. But you don't want to run your offense for a full 48 minute game like that.   The best shots are still the ones at the rim, Harden can get to the rim whenever he wants to. KD *used* to be able to do that, unsure of whether he can anymore after the injury.   &gt; don't compare either of KD or Harden to Dame and CJ ever again please.  You're missing the point, it's about different roles.   Engine of the Offense - This is Harden's role and he's probably the 2nd best player in the league at it behind LeBron. This role is about playmaking, running the offense, most of these guys average 8 assists per game or more, but they can also score when they need to, they're dual threats. Jokic is elite at this too, so is Dame, and then the 2 next gen guys who are elite are Trae, who is basically discount Dame, and Luka, who is basically discount Harden. Russ used to be great in this kind of role when he played smart. Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley were all great at this, all of them aren't able to carry that kind of load anymore, which is why they are sliding into a lesser role in order to let Booker, Mitchell, VanVleet attempt to take on this kind of responsibility. But this kind of player is whom you need to run your offense over the course of a 48 minute game.   Kawhi has taken on in this kind of role on the Clippers, although you can argue he should be in the latter role as that better suits him, and he's not good enough at this role, he's not elite.  The Drive Line of the Offense - This is KD's role and he's probably the best in the league at it. This role is about shot-making ability, scoring efficiently from all 3 levels of the floor, but most importantly the mid-range and 3-point line, because these are the shots that are taken at the end of games. They are your secondary ball-handlers and generally get around ~5 assists per game. Other great players in this kind of role are Steph, Kyrie, Middleton, Kawhi, PG, CJ, Jamal Murray etc. AD was able to be this for the Lakers last year.   Any great team needs 1 of each of these type of players in order to win a championship.   The engine of the offense type can do more alone in terms of regular season wins, but has a hard ceiling on it, and will stall out in the playoffs, typically around the 2nd round. The drive line of the offense type is more dependent on the engine of the offense type, but is the player that's necessary to take a team from the 2nd round to the Finals/championship.   Kawhi is a good reference point in this, he took a team with a very good and one of the most underrated engine of the offense type players in Kyle Lowry, a team that perennially made the 2nd round every year, and he was the difference in that team breaking over that barrier and getting to the Finals and winning a championship.   Kawhi is now trying to be the engine of the offense for the Clippers, but they lost in the 2nd round last year, because he's not elite in that role. And because PG wasn't good enough in the Drive Line role. Kawhi is trying to be more like LeBron, when he should go back to trying to be like KD, that's the best use of him. And in order for that to happen, Clippers need an engine of the offense type player."
"He also constantly try’s to injure other players as well. Like Jamal Murray for example, after the Clippers blew a 3-1 lead against Denver."
"Repeat from a similar post a few weeks back:  Kris Dunn over Hield and Jamal Murray hurts  Trading #19 (which was Kevin Huerter) for Adreien Payne and then taking Okogie at 20 (the back end of that draft was mediocre to be fair)  The Butler trade was a year too early and he clearly didn’t fit with Wiggins/KAT personality-wise  Some bad luck (missed out on Bam by two picks) compounded by bad decisions (taking Justin Patton with OG and Jarrett Allen on the board, drafting Culver with Rui and Cam Reddish available, could have stayed at 11 and had Herro/PJ Washington/Cam Johnson).  Missing out on two top-10 picks inside of 4 years will hurt any franchise. Add in poor player development and the “we’ve gotta make the playoffs!” mentality, and you’ve got a recipe for a disaster. The Wiggins trade was just another cherry on top"

"He also drafted Kris Dunn over Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Jakob Poeltl and Sabonis (though he was taken 11th so he would've been a bit of a reach)"
Jamal Murray and also Devin Booker.
"This may be irrelevant, but Jamal Murray is barely above 20 PPG even after that 50 and 30 burger. PPG is hard to maintain but I do love an aggressive Simmons, hes got the physical tools."
Usually top 10 players aren’t decided by a single postseason run. If we’re doing numbers for only that particular playoffs then Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell would bounce Tatum out of the top 10.
"Nuggets playoff chances depends on what version of Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr they’ll get. They could be anywhere between a first round exit and a finals team. I wouldn’t bet on it, but when everyone on this team is playing at their peak, they play like a true championship contender."
"I think you need to take a break from social for a while. I mean, the only people who know about that Jamal Murray video are people who are always on NBA Twitter/Reddit. Not everyone who watches the sport is active on social or trolls random players."

Team record isn't the best but with Jamal Murray waking up they could improve  Curry --&gt; he is like Dame but with an arguably better roster and less team success"
Dejounte Murray is one of the most overlooked players in today’s game  I presume you’re referencing Jamal
"I wouldn’t say he is worth that much, but then again there are very few people in the league who are actually worth 30m a year. I’d say his value is similar to what Jamal Murray is, so any team that is interested in him would be interested in dlo if he was available too"

Jamal Murray turning into Jordan helped lol. I think he outscored Jokic in 2 series

"he's a good defender. Nuggets are 15th in defense or exactly average with Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, MPJ, Will Barton, Facu, 36 year old paul millsap and Jamichael Green playing most of the minutes. Jokic is literally the best defeder on the Nuggets other than Gary Harris who has barely played this year."
Jamal Murray has now entered the mvp race
"&gt;I don't think this is dramatically impacting the game right now. I think this is just an example of outrage culture (a bad tech gets memed to death)  Totally agree. people purposefully take them out of context to shit on the refs. Sports Illustrated wrote an article called ""Suns' Devin Booker Ejected vs. Lakers After Bounce Pass to Ref"". The other angles showed he clearly said something and Bron and KCP had a strong reaction to it, but yeah let's pretend he got ejected because of the bounce pass. Reddit and twitter eat this shit up.  Of course there are some legitimately bad tech calls, but like you said it's not dramatically impacting the game. The first tech isn't a big deal whether it's warranted or not cause it's one Free throw attempt in a game where both teams will score 110+ (and they're disportionately called early in the games). As for the second tech and ejections, Idk if this is more or less than normal, [but Spotrac says there's been 20 ejections this season](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/fines-suspensions/fines/ejection/). That's over roughly 600 games (40 g x 30 teams / 2) and some of them were clearly warranted (Jamal Murray punched a guy in the nuts).   We should seek to improve this, but fixing egregious foul baiting and rip throughs is a way bigger deal."

"I didn't say anything about influence.  but I just disagree about Booker.  he's much like Jamal Murray.  Sometimes he looks like an absolute badass and other times he's pedestrian af.  Booker is not better than Chris Paul, either.."
Suns could have drafted   * Jamal Murray  * Domantas Sabonis  * Donavan Mitchell  * Luka Doncic  Instead of :  * Dragan Bender  * Marquese Chriss  * Josh Jackson  * DeAndre Ayton  to pair with Booker since. This game can be played with pretty much every team in the lottery.
Problem is Nuggets have pretty much all bad defenders. Jamal Murray and Porter Jr can't guard a garbage can. If they had 3 &amp; D wings they would be a lot better on D.  Having an average defensive rating is actually surprising to me considering their wings are bad defensively and Jokic is just around averagish on D and can be abused in certain matchups.  Its possible to compensate for Jokic's defensive weaknesses but the roster construction is fairly poor and they loss one of their key players in Grant for nothing.
That they are an average defensive team....? Keep in mind we have no defensive stalwarts either. MPJ and Jamal Murray start on our team.
Top 5 DPOY candidate Jamal Murray???
Same reason Jamal Murray was putting up prime curry numbers in the postseason. They got hot in a short span.
Jamal Murray was even hotter while PG and Kawhi played like shit. The bubble is wack
"That nasty Jamal Murray dunk last year didn't count tho, and it was a bullshit charge call anyway"
Jamal Murray? Tf outta here bruh
Jamal Murray
"For me?The same issues Jamal Murray [has.One](https://has.One) game can have 20+ points without effort,the other night struggling to get 10."
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
"Hes better than most if not all of the ""snubs"" people were crying about.   &amp;#x200B;  Hell I'd take him over guys like Zach Lavine as an overall twoway player.   &amp;#x200B;  As much hype as Jamal Murray gets SGA is the best Canadian player in the league."
Jamal Murray looks like an elite 3pt shooter but is only a career 36% 3pt shooter
Fantastic pick didn’t even think of him. Even Jamal Murray could have a shot but might be more of an in game dunker
"It depends, but perimeter defense has been a huge problem for the Nuggets the past few years, especially because Gary Harris has been hurt a lot. Every center is going to look worse when they’re starting next to guys like Jamal Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ. If Jokic had someone like Ben Simmons, PG or Kawhi on the court with him his numbers would look a lot better."
"People who blame Jokic for the defense of a team that starts MPJ, Jamal Murray and Monte Morris is bizarre lol"
People also thought Jamal Murray could play like he did in one series in the bubble and being dropping 50 every game.
Jamal Murray is as overrated as people think Simmons is
They also have Jamal Murray who I think is an okay player if i remember.
Where the fuck is Jamal Murray!?!
"Almost like the bigger issue is our inability to stop penetration from the perimeter and letting dudes get to the paint at will.  Dudes score at a high rate when they get in the paint, shocker. 68% is pretty high. So is the 60% that elite rim protectors like gobert and embiid give up.   Think I’d prefer to just not allow those guys to get to the paint in the first place. Some of that isn’t on Jokic and is on other guys putting him in bad spots. Another poster mentioned how jokic consistently ranks highly in defensive metrics, and a lot of that is due to his positional defense and high bbiq. If he can beat guys to their spots and force them to take bad/contested shots, or he gets a steal or deflection or forces another pass for a lower quality look etc he can be an effective defender, but outside of steals (of which he has been in the top 5 all year), none of those things really show up in a traditional stat other than on/off splits.  FG% is a little overrated for judging defense IMO. Just like that NBA.com article that bewilderingly had Jamal Murray as a top 5 defender because he had a high number of contests on jump shots that resulted in a poor percentage.  Defense has tons of different things that go into it and most don’t show up on the stat sheet. Little rotational things, leverage on how you body into a guy legally, switching on pnr action and trusting the rest of your team to make the right reads as well, KYP on going under/over screens, etc.   Defense is by far the hardest thing for fans to analyze correctly."
they never tried because they overvalued Jamal Murray because he got hot in the bubble lol.
&gt;LeBlowJob  You talkin bout Jamal Murray?
"Oh no I agree, when I said true PG I meant full-time point guard.  There's a lot of pass-first players out there who play the PG role but their position is fluid.  Trae is never moving to the 3 lol.    Honestly though I feel like ""pure point guard"", ""true point guard"" and terms like that are outdated in todays NBA.  When you have guys like Luka, Jokic, Lebron, and Bam essentially playing point guard out there it kind of changes that definition.  And conversely when the premier point guards of this past decade are guys like Steph, Westbrook, prime D Rose, Dame, Kyrie, it makes you wonder what a point guard is supposed to be. in 2010 a pure PG was Rondo, in 2021 it might be a guy a like Jamal Murray."
Jamal Murray in the bubble
"I mean he literally would. Look at bird play and look at harden play. Use your eyes. The game has evolved. Bird doesn’t have hesis or step backs. People weren’t even doing the euro step until the 2000s.  The game went through an evolution in the 90s with the popularity of Jordan and the street ball scene that followed after. Guard skills are better than ever. Look at someone like Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, not even a top 5 guard in their conference yet they have guard skills that the best point guards in the 80s didn’t have.   I’ll be downvoted to shit but I ardently believe this. Idc."
Talked shit about his defense iirc that's dpoy candidate #5 Jamal Murray
You’re really arguing that AD and Jamal Murray are in the same tier? Lmfao you’re a joke buddy.
"Thats not true.  Its just that what they do is often stupid.  Passing on Lamelo, trading up and drafting Jarrett Culver when at least the next 7 guys taken after him are much better, taking Kris Dunn with Buddy Hield and Jamal Murray on the board.  Just a few examples  These are things are not bad luck, they're just decisions made by people who are not smart"
"Nuggets have an average drtg and Jokic is one of the best players in the entire NBA for generating steals and deflections. Our best two defenders in Gary Harris and Millsap have missed a ton of time- you really think a team starting Jamal murray, MPJ and Monte Morris is gonna have a good defense? Jokic is clearly not the problem there."
 Jamal Murray has not been notably worse than AD when he’s played. So stop trolling.  And I guarantee you LeBron and a full season of Murray would be way higher than the 9th seed. But you won’t accept it because you’re salty af
Jamal “Kemba ‘Roy Hibbert’ Walker” Murray.
"Yah and the nuggets have been missing like 7 rotation players, your point? If the Lakers had fucking Jamal Murray instead of AD they’d be like the 9 seed right now."
Jamal Murray is Tim Hardaway Jr. on steroids.
Jamal Murray has to be one of the most volatile scorers in the NBA right? He’s either dropping 35 or 10
I’m totally sure he will. The Jamal Murray experience
Jamal Murray has 0 consistency and that's why I think he can't be a good second option or perhaps even a 3rd option for any title contender. His playmaking is meh at best. Dude needs to get better
Jamal Murray? That was like a month ago though
"Oh definitely, I could see it going to 7, I personally think Lakers have the advantage  Someone like Jamal Murray being on the Nets would be insane too"
"MPJ, old ass Millsap, Barton, Jokic and DPOY Jamal Murray honestly isn't the right recipe for good defense lol."
"Add Curry to the Lakers and that’s the greatest trio ever.   I’d add Jamal Murray and Myles Turner to the Nets. Nets would have an All-Time great trio, and Murray off the bench to easily be the best 6th man in the league. Turner would help with their defence and give them solid rim protection and he’s a solid shooter as well. With guys like Green, Brown, DJ, and Blake asked to do less they’re actually very solid role players.   I’d lean Nets but it’s still tough to imagine Curry/Lebron/AD losing."
DPOY candidate Jamal Murray
"Classic bad Nuggets game: Jamal Murray playing like a role player, MPJ getting in foul trouble and playing like trash, and then the team just mailing it in and chucking up threes.   They had so many opportunities just now to cut the lead to a manageable amount, but they kept chucking up threes and then not getting back on defense. I blame Malone for that. You don't claw back from a 20 point deficit with threes, you do it with good D and consistent offense."
"Ah yes, Jamal ""12 points on 40% TS or 30 points on 70% TS with no in between"" Murray strikes again"
to be fair I'm on here looking at overnight and filtering by new and I see people make idiotic comments like that all the time. this is the same place I saw people saying Jamal Murray is a top five player and better than Dame because of one playoff run.
Where the fuck is Jamal “5th best defender in the league” Murray?
How is Jokic even in the conversation. He has a worse record than Lebron and has MPJ and Jamal Murray. All Lebron has is Alex Caruso and Jared Dudley.
"I mean its pretty strong evidence that the horrible drafting is the main problem.  Draft Flynn and Rubio, Curry goes right after  Draft Wes Johnson, Demarcus Cousins goes right after  Draft Kris Dunn, Jamal Murray goes right after   Trade up and draft Jarrett Culver, the next 7 guys who go after him are easily better   When the Wolves hit on a pick, they nail it.  Kevin Love, Lavine, KAT.  All 3 players developed just fine on the Wolves.  But theres just waaayyy too many shitty picks mixed in between.  Like not even players who underachieve,  just straight up bad players with these high lottery picks.  And thats why they can't ever build around their all star talent  Would a guy like Greg popovich have gotten more out of , say, Derrick Williams than the wolves did? Sure, but youre still just putting lipstick on a pig"
"Losing a season at 23, he doesn’t have a ton of miles on his joints. Murray is the same age as Devin Booker, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell. All three are better players at the moment but none have reached their peak yet either. 17-18 season he earned NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to be named All-Defense. Now he’s figuring out his offensive game and this kid could be scary."
1st Team: Ben Simmons Fred VanVleet Jimmy Butler Giannis Gobert  2nd Team: Jamal Murray Dort Covington Bam Embiid
"because playoff runs carry way more weight than regular season stats.  Lebron coasts through the first half of most regular seasons, Shaq used to treat anything pre-all star break like preseason, post all star break as regular season, then absolutely demolish everybody in the playoffs.  Even the spurs cared more about rest and recovery than regular season points and wins.    If you watched Jordan, Butler plays with a somewhat similar mentality, he plays within the system for the majority of the game - even though he's not anywhere near as much of an offensive focal point as Jordan was - but then takes over outside the system when the system starts breaking down, which is what always in the playoffs.    We've seen Lebron consistently take over playoff games forever, we saw Kawhi do it repeatedly in Toronto, and last year we saw Butler and Jamal Murray of all people do it in multiple big playoff games where there was no question about it, they willed their teams to wins.  To me, that's way more valuable than if you can drop 40 against sacramento in game 20 of the regular season.  Butler's proved he's legit."
Jamal Murray too!
"1st team Simmons, Jamal Murray, Giannis, Bridges Gobert"
"If Jokic is able to get a top 3 seed, then there's an argument for him. If they stay at the 5th seed, then yeah I highly doubt he even has a chance. Also, this current Nuggets team is way better than the Lakers without AD. Jamal Murray would easily be the Lakers 2nd best player right now."

"Lmao bro I’m not debating if Jordan is better than LeBron. I’m just pointing out that it’s dumb as fuck to see a great play by Jamal Murray and then say “LeBron sucks, Jordan better”. You’re giving off skip bay less vibes"
I wouldn't exactly consider Jamal Murray a star
"Bradley Beal has much better stats than Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell has similar/slightly better stats and he is on a winning team.  This isn't difficult to comprehend."
"Normal star has a bad night,  Everyone: He just had a bad night.  &amp;#x200B;  Jamal Murray has a bad night,  Everyone: Wow Murray is soooooo inconsistent."
Jamal Murray is currently the most overrated in the NBA.
That's pretty much what I said..I didn't join the majority of r/nba after the bubble and was downvoted when I had an unpopular opinion.   ESPN had Jamal Murray at ranked 21 coming into this season. Ridiculous.
man Jamal murray is so flexible with his body control. He is a highlight machine.
Fuck Jamal Murray that piece of shit is fucking over my team in fantasy his trash ass on scored 3 points today
"How streaky is Jamal Murray, seems like he scores 50 one day then can't hit the rim the next at all."
Here's hoping Jamal Murray was just sunburned
Lmao wonder what happens when both Nikola “despite the loss” Jokic and Jamal  “despite the win” Murray show up in the same game
Jamal Murray went from Mr. Inconsistent to Mr. Law of Averages. He was having a string of good games so he had to balance out the stat sheet with this one (I'm just kidding around btw bad games happen).
Don’t forget about Jamal bubble Murray dropping 3 points on 1/14 🔥🔥🔥
Jamal Murray is the best icey-hot player in the NBA
Its Jamal Murray
Jamal Fucking Murray
This is terrible.   But I hope we get to see bubble Jamal Murray come back.
How is Jamal Murray not an all star
oh please Jamal Murray and MPJ score more than say  Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons. The Nuggets role players are at least at the same level as the Sixers.  Stop the nonsense of Jokic playing with a bunch of disabled children
I feel the same way about the nuggets apart from Jamal Murray (not because he goes nuclear against the jazz)
Jamal Murray little brother built different
Dudes were saying he’s better than Jamal Murray in some thread yesterday lol
"Oh, no: I understand why they exist. I just think they're stupid and don't benefit people. I also think the NBA, as the most forward-thinking major league in North America, should take this opportunity to nuke local blackouts.  That sucks about the Nuggets. Jamal Murray is money."
"&gt; Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  Second-year stats below Domantas Sabonis 11.6 57%TS Jamal Murray 16.7 58% TS Jaylen Brown 14.5 58%TS Pascal Siakam 7.3 55% TS"
"Lol everyone in the 2016 draft class was a late bloomer -- think about the other good players from that draft:  * Domantas Sabonis * Jamal Murray * Jaylen Brown * Pascal Siakam  Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  The only players that were good right away from that draft were Brogdon and Simmons.  Growth just takes a lot of time for some players."
Jamal Murray. Nugs are a bottom 10 team without Jokic but since Jokic is on the team Murray is seen as one of the leaders of a championship contending team. Without playing next to Jokic hed be seen as good but still worse than a Zach Lavine or devin booker and def wouldn’t have been paid a max deal and probably traded multiple times for being an idiot
You really think Jamal murray posted him getting that sloppy toppy shlurpidurp 9000 on purpose?  Or that this is worse?!
Nah cuz Pierce’s is more just sad and kinda weird. The Murray thing was more like “ok good job Jamal.”
"Jamal ""Headmaster"" Murray"
This is not even close to the Jamal Murray incident. Wtf lol.   The entire world saw this guys duck getting sucked by another semi-famous athlete.
Jamal murray incident??
"If I am picking top 3, why would I pick a guy that isn't a top 3 prospect? I am trying to pick stars.  Giannis as a prospect wasn't that good, wasn't even in top league in Greece. If Giannis was picked third, he wouldve struggled because  he would've been tasked with creating his own offense due to playing on a completely dysfunctional team.  Giannis development was standard for a guy who is a late lottery pick and has NBA skills. Most of development came when his body started changing and the ball was put in his hands. If anything, the Thunder who had the 12th pick should've drafted Giannis because they had the talent to take the risk of him flamming out. They drafted Steven Adam who had zero skills besides being big and strong. What's the difference between an unskilled 7 footer and a raw big wing with some guard skills?  Thinking raw players like Giannis will turn into MVP like players if you just put the time in is what leads teams to picking someone like Dragan Bender 4th and Bender actually played in a top European league, albeit off the bench. Suns could've had Jamal Murray, a guy that demonstrated he was clutch and capable of scoring at will in college.  I am taking that Jamal over some 7 footer that supposedly dribble and shoot but rarely get minutes.  My mentality is what leads the Warriors to pick LaMelo or Hali over James Wiseman. Lol, I would've even picked Patrick Williams over Wiseman if I wanted a project player. At least he plays the 3/4 wing, most important position in the NBA."
This tops the Jamal Murray incident.  Theres no way he did this on purpose lol.  He either doesnt know how to use IG or he was just too faded to think clearly
"So I was thinking to myself - what if Curry decided he really fucking hated Jamal Murray for example, and told our FO he would sign for the vet min but only if they benched Jamal Murray on the max. Like not just move him to the bench unit, like literally never play him.  Is one year of injury-prone, slightly-past-his-prime Steph Curry worth lighting the relationship with Jamal on fire like that?  Who is the best player where you still say yes to that?"
I knew it was a meme once u included Jamal Murray
Is this a Jamal Murray reference?
Thank god for Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic.
"&gt;So you're trying to ascribe value to Embiid for the team being worse when he sits - that's not how it works. He gets no credit for those games, his value is zero in each one.   This is one of the dumbest statements about a team game I've ever heard. I guess LeBron James has zero value to the Lakers this season because he's missed games. No. That shows how important a player is to their team. If your record gets 20% worse when a single player sits, they're quite valuable to your team. Moving on.  &gt;Even if Embiid is more valuable per game that he plays, Jokic is still very valuable, and because he plays more games his value will surpass Embiid's.   How? If Jokic wins more games. Sure. If he put up his current stats and goes on a losing streak, then I doubt we'll be having this conversation in a month. Someone else will become the front runner.  &gt;Value over replacement - Jokic is at 5.8, Embiid at 2.7.  &gt;Win shares - Jokic at 10.7, Embiid at 6.2.  I can't believe people still quote these stats. They're next to useless. Do you think Domantas Sabonis is the 19th best player in the league? Do you think Montrezl Harrell is the 10th best player in the league? Also, since we're using WS. Why not use WS/48 where Jokic .300 and Embiid is .295. DRTG where Embiid is third and Jokic isn't top. ORTG, where Jokic is 6th and Embiid is 19th.  You can use crappy stats to favor either side of the argument. Advanced stats in general that aren't player specific(RTG, WS, VORP) are mostly trash. I'm trying to imagine in what world someone would look at VORP and WS and be like Mikal Bridges is better than Jamal Murray."
"Randle is doing everything you described but his running mate is a 20 year old not Jamal Murray, you’ll be ok I promise"
Nuggets just aren't that good dude. Jokic is a very good player but is a he a superstar? No. Is Jamal Murray the most inconsistent 2nd option in the league? Yes. Other than that it's just a bunch of unproven guys. Definitely a solid team and could make it out of the 1st round possibly but that's about it.
"&gt;They have the 2nd best player in the world in Jokic, who has a good shot are winning MVP, they have a superstar scorer in Jamal Murray who’s having an efficient career year, another superstar scorer in MPJ who’s finally become an active threat on defense this year and is shooting 45% from 3!"
"Same reason Jamal Murray played with a fucked up elbow all season. It’s their job. He’s missed a lot of games because of it and prolly will miss more, but if these guys sat every game they weren’t fully healthy for they would hardly ever play"
"I got downvoted to hell for suggesting to deal Jamal Murray post haste, and had to hear why even Michael Porter Jr. wasn’t worth trading for James Harden since he’s so young and it would disrupt team chemistry. James Harden!"
Agreed. And I think peak Eric Gordon on the Clippers &gt; Jamal Murray so far
The thing is Jamal Murray would absolutely be an all star if the competition for the spot weren’t steph/dame/CP3. The league is so saturated right now it’s crazy
Tyler Herro is off the table! Jamal Murray is a non starter!  Even if those reports are bullshit all the fanbases who made arguments agreeing are morons.

jamal murray
"I must say Murray held his ground against Kawhi in three possessions. One, where Kawhi hit a hard fadeaway. Second, he had to dish out because he couldn't back him down. And third, he missed a tough shot. Good shit, Jamal."
"But he is a guard, isnt the ts% should be adjusted? The league avg accounts for those high ts% centre.   We even have argument dlo was better player than jamal murray before the playoff so i think warriors fans agree back then dlo was a positive player despite his max contract."
That unfortunately seems like it was the right move. Also excited to see a healthy DLO in that starting lineup. Particularly if he plays more like Jamal Murray instead of being as ball dominant as he was asked to  be before.
"It’s pretty obvious you don’t watch the nuggets or Timberwolves. Jokic didn’t “carry” his team to the playoffs until 2019 when the nuggets had a starting lineup of Jokic, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, and Will Barton. If that’s a poor supporting cast then then I don’t want to know what the Timberwolves roster is. Also you said Kat was not a leader because he was the second best player on the team when they made it to the playoffs. That was KAT’s third year in the league, when Jokic was in his third year, the nuggets didn’t even make it to the playoffs. Why don’t you hold Jokic to the same standard as KAT, if he’s on such a different level skill wise, shouldn’t he have been able to bring his team to the playoffs even if they were poor?"
So you hate Jamal Murray?
"KAT is a bad anchor. He's not average, he's below average. He can do well at contesting at the rim if he's in position, but in general he's just bad. There's no need to sugarcoat it.  KAT was in Thibs system for 3 years technically as Thibs was fired in his third season. You ought to list more because while it can take a long time for a player to learn schemes it still shows a lack of basic understanding of how to properly position yourself. To go more in depth, both the Bulls and Knicks defenses were greatly improved with the addition of Thibs.  And KAT's issues are not just schematics. He often had an awful habit of basically fucking up his feet movements, making him much slower laterally.  KAT can individually win on an offensive matchup and destroy Gobert, but the teams often also lose because every other perimeter player can easily feast inside the paint against the Wolves or just cause defensive breakdowns. Again without a good anchor your entire defense falls apart.  Harden is the worst matchup against Gobert and will toast everyone, but he wasn't the issue in those series generally. The Rockets had great 3 point shooting and Jazz were not equipped to match the offensive firepower of those Rocket teams. It wasn't just a defensive issue. Jamal Murray literally feasted on three point line and jumpers, not exactly much Gobert can do about that.   Mitchell is no longer a good defender and Jazz fans often cite his defensive struggles have increased year after year. Clarkson is still bad, as is Bojan. Ingles has regressed, but he's still a smart defender.   Wiggins has shown to be a good defender on the Warriors, Taj was a good defender with the Wolves, Butler is an elite defender, so there have been times they should have been better than they were.   KAT is an all time offensive big. That doesn't mean he isn't a bad defender, which does hurt his team."
"&gt;Jokic's health alone doesn't surpass the impact (on both sides of the court) of Jo. That's a very weak and uncompelling arg, imo.  It's not a weak argument, as sad as it is, he's on the court for a longer time, and is able to do more.  Also jokic is the best passer in the league, he is having one of the best offensive seasons of all time breaking multiple records. You can argue two way play Is more important but I'll argue that it's easier to build a strong defence around a weak defender than to build a near all time great offensive system using someone as Jokic.  Anyways I was only talking about MVP voting and the VOTERS factor in health, no one gives a shit what you think or what your opinion is  &gt;The Sixers are 8-8 without Embiid, thanks to the recent winning streak post-All Star break, with most wins in that timespan coming against nad competition  Literally just watch one nuggets game when Jokic is off the floor. This team cannot create offense for shit when Jokic is gone and it's just will Barton and Jamal Murray is, we aren't winning more than 3 games lmfao. You're a PLAYOFF team without Embiid. We are a LOTTERY team without Jokic. You can talk all you want about two way play but Jokic impacts winning games much more on a regular basis. We are steadily climbing the standings and the season isn't even over yet so calm down."
"yeah, only that MPJ guy averaging 17/8 on 53/45/73 splits.  Oh yeah, and don't even get me started on that bum Jamal Murray only averaging 21/4/5 on 48/41/86 splits.  Jokic gets no help!"
Hopefully we pull in a big-name Canadian FA in the next 10 years like Shai or Jamal Murray.
In terms of starting guards that actually handle the ball Jamal Murray is pretty much the only guy above him but he has less than 200 attempts. Happy to see that Fox is taking another step I was a little after last year that he was starting to plateau.
Jokic and DPOY Jamal Murray
Passing on Jamal Murray and Domantas Sabonis. A plague on the GM who shall not be named
"Guy really nutted inside a girl who has been with half the NBA and music industry. James Harden, Jamal Murray, Drake, Lil Uzi, Tyga, Chris Brown just off the top of my head   Don't get me wrong she bad af but damn man he coulda went for literally any other girl who had less mileage"
&gt;Well 2019 Houston was a historic offensive juggernaut who also literally the worst matchup for Utah in the league.   So a bad matchup for the best defender in the league?  &gt;Jamal Murray going nuclear &amp; scoring 50/night w/ God-like shooting in like 4 games had nothing to do with Rudy's defense  Are you sure this wasn't a product of Murray and the Nuggets attacking Gobert's drop coverage?
"Well 2019 Houston was a historic offensive juggernaut who also literally the worst matchup for Utah in the league.   In spite of that, Utah held Houston below their regular season average &amp; Harden well below his--in spite of really bad losses in games 1 &amp; 2  Utah lost that series bcz PJ Tucker couldn't miss from 3 &amp; Utah shot like 23% on wide open 3's.  The Denver series was just a high scoring series in general because of the style of play of both teams. Jamal Murray going nuclear &amp; scoring 50/night w/ God-like shooting in like 4 games had nothing to do with Rudy's defense. And even Nuggets fans will tell you Utah was the better team &amp; had no business losing that series"
"I think KD knows and can't forget that suspicion is on him since the time they were up 3-1 on the Warriors, they needed just one more game against the team that they have been beating, but they managed to lose three games in a row, and it became known that KD had already made up his mind, before that series, to leave, and then after the three games lost he did leave and went to none other than the Warriors...        In those three games lost, to me, KD did not seem really excited and motivated to win.  We saw the likes of Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray in last year's playoffs for instance,  did KD display similar passionate effort to win in the three games mentioned? I don't think so.       Why leave anyway? Even if you surprisingly lost 4-3, you could beat that team the following year(s)? The OKC franchise had invested on you all those years, waited for you only to reach that situation and perform?"

oh.man Jamal Murray was battling some serious injuries while playing the best games he has ever had and probably will have
"Suns picking Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson as 4th overall picks in back to back drafts. Yuck  Some notable players available after them were Jamal Murray, DeArron Fox and Jonathan Isaac.  Oh well the Suns are rolling now and mostly made up for those bad draft selections with Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson."
"&gt;but how does nuclear murray compare to nuclear Klay Thompson ?  As a Warriors fan and hardcore Murray stan, I feel like both can be demoralizing but I feel like each of their nuclear energy is a bit different. Although it can seem like they can get hot when their team needs them the most (see Klay Thompson's game 6 performance against OKC or against Houston, or Murray's game 2 performance against the Spurs, also think his game 3 performance against Portland is a good example of this too although the Nuggets lost that game thanks to CJ or his game 5 or 6 performances against the Jazz)  Klay's nuclear feels much more methodical like sometimes when Klay is hot he'll just stay that way for the entire game, also when Klay's hot it's because he's hitting a lot of three because he doesn't usually as much variety to his offense as Murray does, so if he starts to hit a few you can start to get the feeling that it's one of those games for Klay. I also feel like even when Klay's really hot he's still pretty emotionless like he doesn't do much showboating, he's like a stone-cold killer, I'd imagine it's different for opponents to watch him hot as opposed to Curry who has much more emotion and celebrates more when he's hot.  Jamal's nuclear comes in spurts and conveniently for the Nuggets seems to happen a lot in the second half/fourth quarter of games. When Jamal is hot, it just seems like he hits everything layups, mid-range, threes, Jamal makes any tough shot when he's hot the defense doesn't seem to matter (see 50 point game against Cleveland). Sometimes he stays hot for the whole game but it does seem like he likes stepping up in the fourth. A lot of the time the key for Murray to stay hot is him being aggressive when he's scoring well and playing aggressively he's super hard to stop like how he played in the bubble. Unlike Klay when Jamal's feeling good and going nuclear, you can tell because he's got a lot more emotion, trash-talking, you can just see the confidence in him rising and it feels like nothing rattles him. I've seen some comments in the Jazz and 76ers hating on Murray for getting hot and I feel like he's prone to get those comments more so than Klay when he's hot and playing with that kind of swagger in that way he reminds me of Steph and makes me think that it must feel different for opponents to play against nuclear Murray who has so much more emotion and swagger than Klay who just is emotionless even when he's hot"
"Because he's actually strong as fuck and a perfectly capable defender when he puts in the effort. He just has to exert so much energy on offense given our roster the last 2 years that he doesn't give 100% on defense.  But when he wants to key in on defense, he can. He usually does when his shot isn't falling. Like he decided to guard Steph the entire 2nd half of our last game and Steph went like 3-12 in the half or something. Same thing with Jamal Murray in game 7 of our series  So if you start attacking him, he's able to put in the effort and make it not worth the time.  Plus, despite being on the shorter side at 6'1-6'2, he's got an impressively long 6'8 wingspan - Curry is at 6'4 and Tatum is 6'11 for some reference points."
"If you replace Jamal Murray with shai do the nuggets win the series last year? That’s a easy no.  Tbh this really shouldn’t even be debatable. Jamal was fighting thru 3 injuries in his  shoulder, ankle, and knee to start the season. He could have just sat and he’s be averaging over 25 ppg on even better shooting splits. But he fought thru it and played to help the team. If he sits no one is even debating this rn."
"You guys are better than us. We lost cause Rudy Gobert is bad. And yes Jamal Murray is a good young player who can score, but I prefer Shai, honestly."
Jamal Murray on his Maple Mamba shit
I'm thankful for Jamal Murray
jamal murray of roy
"Jamal Murray is one of those players that will leave you in awe by playing either incredibly well or poorly.  One way or another, he's jaw-dropping to watch on any given night.  He was instrumental tonight in the 1st quarter Denver domination of Philadelphia defense."
the joke is about jamal murray being dpoy
"I guess Doc was sending a message to his starters to play better in the next one by not playing them at all in the 4th? I’m pretty sure the game was still in reach by the end of the 3rd, before Jamal Murray popped off.   By the same token, why did Malone keep his starters in until the end of the game? It was pretty much a blowout win for the Nuggets."
&gt;Has jamal murray ever missed a shot?  He's never missed because he's the first player in NBA history!
Honestly as a jazz fan Denver scares me more in the playoffs than any other team. When he plays the jazz Jamal Murray might as well be Michael Jordan
I find your disrespect of Jamal Murray appalling.
The way us people with Philly accents say Murray is fucking intolerable to me    Jamal Merry. Seth Kerry. Disgusting.
Jamal Murray has broken the Philly's spirit. I'm surprised Doc didn't put the starters in when it was a 13-pt game.
"Jesus Christ.   I mean, Jamal Murray."
Will Barton should not be handling the ball. Give it to Jamal Murray.
"In this story, is Jamal Murray or MPJ the sister?"
Jamal Murray when he’s hot is reminiscent of a hall of fame player
"Jamal Murray shoots 82% at rim, just behind Giannis among players that play starter minutes. Only about 12% of his shots come at the rim but it's still crazy."
Nope. Born Showman Jamal Murray Finally has a home crowd for the first time this season. I am an idiot for not anticipating this and putting a lot of money on him going off
Kyrie's feel more intentional. Jamal Murray always looks like he doesnt know how the hell he pulled that off lol
Has jamal murray ever missed a shot?
Jamal Murray
"18 first rounders is a ton, and I think you have to take into account just how random drafting can be. One thing I did that I found quite interesting is just pick any 7 year stretch and use a random number generator to randomly pick a list of 18 first rounders. Almost every time, you end up with a great, multiple time all-star, player.   I did it once from the 2005-2011 draft and got a team with DeMarre Carroll, Joakim Noah, Jrue Holiday and Steph Curryand then did it again with 2012-2018 draft and got Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter Jr, Jonathan Isaac, Jamal Murray, Clint Capela, and Dennis Schroder.   18 first rounders doesn’t mean that you automatically win a championship, but it definitely means you get a top 10-15 player. You have to get really unlucky to not stumble into at least one elite player."
I'm looking foward to a Jamal Murray and Tobias Harris duel tonight
That’s my dawg that’s Jamal Murray
"It does. I'm not saying one is better than the other, I'm just confused as to how Murray is always left off these lists of young guards. It's always Booker, Mitchell, Fox, etc. Jamal is playing just as well, if not better than some, has had an amazing postseason, and still gets underrated."
Where’s Jamal Murray
Just a reminder this is the writer who put jamal murray 5th on purpose
Jamal Murray?
TJ McConnell has been announced as the NBA Jamal Murray of the Month
Where is Jamal Murray?
It's next to impossible. There's so many advanced stats that they can be used to make an argument for any of the better defenders in the league...I'm looking at you Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray from Feb-Mar is averaging 22.7/3.8/5.3 on 50/45/91. Murray has been significantly more effecient than Mitchell this season, and we've seen what he can do in the playoffs. Their roles are different for their teams, and it does not make sense for Jamal to take the same amount of shots as Mitchell. Murray is severely underrated and those other players aren't definitively better than him."
"If you gave him Jamal Murray,MPJ and Will Barton our record would look a lot better..."
"I rank him around jamal Murray, below fox, sga, trae, Booker, Tatum,..."
Kyrie has also missed 15 games this season. Jamal Murray has played 13 more games than Kyrie. Availability matters. Y’all need to watch the games before talking. Every Nets fans knows how much Harden has been carrying the team this season no matter who is out of the lineup.
Jamal Murray pubes flashbacks  vietnam-dog-flashbacks.gif
"Barkley is always wrong. Lakers can beat the Nuggets who are without Jamal Murray, and the blazers just don’t enough to stop AD or Lebron. I haven’t watched much of the bucks this season but they’ve been the favorite or near favorite for years. They choke in the playoffs"
"Have you forgotten about Wiggins? Steph, Dray, Wiggins, Oubre, then Baze. That top 3 is honestly pretty solid, and Oubre has had some awesome games this year. He's a fine role player.   Assuming MPJ is the second best, who is the Nuggets 3rd best player right now? Aaron Gordon who is a very solid player, similar to Wiggins, maybe? After that though? It's a pretty fucking steep drop off. Like, Will Barton is good but not any better or worse than Oubre or Bazemore. They just bring different skills. He's a worse defender but he can handle the ball and pass a bit. Monte Morris is good, but again, just a role player like those dudes. The rosters are not as different as you make out without Jamal Murray."
I think he’s saying jokic is on a constant uphill battle fighting against the bad play of Jamal “negative” Murray
"then what would you trade a 24 year old Jamal Murray for? Maybe Mitchell but I doubt Utah would do that.  And same goes for Julius Randle, for Zion? Hell nah."
This dude thinks Julius Randle and Jamal Murray are untradable
"Jamal Murray, SGA, probably not the worst idea in the world to take a chance on a Kentucky guard lol."
"&gt;But we were still without our best on-ball defender  You mean RoCo?  Even then, we're missing *Jamal Murray*. Would have been a blowout if he had played."
"Yes but don't you think both of them took some risks? I mean KD arguably rushed, Jamal Murray played right after having a sore knee. I know not everything is knowable, but AD rested more than 2 months. Therefore, I think if they didn't think he is OK to come back, they could have rested him 2 more weeks. Not like we are dropping out of the playoffs anyway."
Would you seriously rather have westbrook over jamal murray. Potentially unpopular take but I don't think Westbrook's style of play is scaleable for winning. He props up shitty offenses well enough but running 25-30 posessions through him a game is a lot of turnovers and inefficient offense even if he creates 10-15 scores for team-mates also.
You can never know sadly sometimes. Look at KD’s achilles tear and recently jamal murray injuring his opposite knee the first game back from knee soreness.  Just hope this goes well.
"Autografts (a tendon graft from yourself) is much preferred for younger, more active patients, as opposed to allograft, where they take it from dead dudes. Allografts have a lower re-tear rate, but that re-tear risk comes with a more severe (longer) recovery. Older people or less mobile people might opt for the allograft because they'd prefer a faster recovery rather than a stronger ligament. Other times youd use cadaver tissue are for people who have had several re-tears and simply dont have anything left in their body to harvest a tendon from.  Jamal Murray almost certainly had a patellar tendon autograft.   Source: former knee surgeon apprentice and current medical student (surgeons feel free to correct)"
"I understand they could not play both games of back to back because of injuries, but was wondering if your coach sees us as easier to beat (we are without Jamal Murray) than Clippers without Kawhi, or harder so wanted you at full strength? It seems like you are saying there was no choice for Dame as he was recovering, and Nurkic is probably needed more against Jokic was Stotts's reasoning."
Bro your name is Tfues fan and you’re arguing that Jamal Murray is more valuable to the nuggets than nikola Jokic. That is asinine and objectively wrong. Jesus Christ
"Lets see how he does with out the real MVP of the nuggets, Jamal Murray. Hes done well in 3-4 games since, but lets see how it extends.. If Murray didnt get hurt, id say hes the MVP for the team"
Jamal “Willis Reed” Murray
Jesus that's now two players the warriors have been playing to get hurt.  First Jamal Murray and now avdija.  Obviously not the fault of the warriors but still interesting.
"You’re honestly a joke if you think Jamal Murray, MPJ and vets are anywhere near as bad Draymond who can’t shoot, Oubre who missed his first 20 something threes, a 19 yr old rookie and Bazemore without Jokic and Steph, respectively."
Hmm don’t assists require teammates who can actually make buckets though? Shame he didn’t have Jamal Murray to pass to
"Yeah this dude is gonna be averaging 20+ on elite efficiency next year (pretty much almost at 20 this year anyway) and he's so good that Jamal Murray might actually end up becoming the 3rd option. If he continues to be improve on defense, Denver are legit set for years."
"Interestingly, one **could** build the lineup that the Denver nuggets FO was attempting to build this offseason:  Murray  Jrue  MPJ  Jerami  Jokic  Ofc we know grant didn’t stay as we expected and we got way outbid for jrue. But that lineup on paper is quite good across the board.  Bonus points if you select OG for bench/flex, since we disastrously tried to trade down to select him at 24 (the Donovan Mitchell trade) only to have Masai snipe OG from us at 23. Arguably, we should have just taken him at 12.  That said, even if I were trying to build the above roster, draymond is a way better fit than Jerami is. He just obviously wasn’t available for our FO when they were crafting their lineup lol. AD would also fit like a glove at the 4 next to Jokic.  So theoretically, one could build a “super nuggets” roster (simply because you chose so many nuggets and as a nuggets fan that’s what I’m drawn to first) of:  Jamal/FVV  Jrue/SGA  MPJ/OG  Dray/Grant  Jokic/AD  And you’d have a ton of flexibility. Probably would end up starting AD at the 4. Not sure if you lose too much offensive punch if you also slide dray up to the 3 over MPJ, but it feels wrong bringing draymond off the bench lol.  I feel pretty confident that this roster would do pretty well against any other combination of players from this list, if for no other reason than a lot of them already have a lot of chemistry together and the ones who don’t fit together incredibly well on paper and have high enough BBIQs that I don’t think it should be an issue."
One little injury to Jamal Murray and he ain't top 5? Pshhh
I heard he’s basically the American version of Jamal Murray
"In a vacuum, Jamal Murray is really just Austin Rivers with a hot girlfriend"
"Jamal Murray is better than Lillard, CP3, and Westbrook then as well I guess."
"I honestly really believe in this Utah team.   Jamal Murray had to turn into Michael Jordan to come back against Utah, and that team made it to the WCF.  Now you add Bogdonovic, who is their 3/4th best player, and Ingles shots are actually dropping?  I think they're the most likely to win the title this year."
*Cries in Jamal Murray*
I mean that’s not really silly:  Luka  Steph Dame Kyrie Harden Cp3  Jamal Murray  Jrue Russ Simmons Fox Trae Conley Ja
"dude didn't have a jamal murray just a kelly oubre, Andre wiggins, Draymond Green  don't act like he doesn't have help just cuz yall used to having 3 HoFers in your starting lineup (Klay and KD)"
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"It was a dumb business decision, because here were are right before the playoffs. Harden is out. KD is out. Lebron is out. AD is out. Jamal Murray just went down. If they held off for one more month maybe that doesnt happen."
"Would you take Brandon Ingram over any of the following: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, or De'Aaron Fox? Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.  I just wonder if the Pels are risking mediocrity by trying to make Zion and Ingram work just because they maxed him already."
I agree. Jamal Murray is complete shit and RJ Barrett is the better player.
I think jamal murray will make it at some point
Did you not see how good jamal murray last year was in the bubble
"Man, let them be upset. I remember how mad I was about [Jamal Murray getting away with a travel on a shot that sent a game to OT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n1b5v6lpTM) that we eventually lost.  There is no reason to antagonize a fanbase for being fired up for their team. That was an excellent game and we were the beneficiary of a foul that probably doesn't get called more often than not."
"jamal murray had a 21 fgm game this season as well, probably the craziest scoring display i’ve ever watched"
"Yeah.  Jeter would go full Kobe in the postseason.  Something about the moment just made him better.  I think Reggie Miller had that as well.  We saw that with Jamal Murray in the bubble, although that's a very small sample size."
Dearon fox and jamal Murray better than dejounte
"And who did jokic have? Jamal Murray, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, MPJ. Jamal mUrray is the perfect guard to go alongside jokic. KAT's best teammate ever was andrew wiggins. Twolves have failed to build around towns, which is why we have only made the playoffs once."
"Right? It’s Will Barton, not Jamal Murray, and you’re helping off Jokic. Will Barton isn’t going to pull up from midrange and your guard fought through the screen fairly well and you have help side that can come over. He 100% needs to communicate what to do there and honestly just bluff at Barton to slow him down a split second and start recover to a closeout on Jokic. Instead he got stuck in no-man’s land."
How in the actual fuck is fucking Kelly Oubre better than Jamal Murray pre-injury? Like explain that. The warriors literally just had to sign a guy to a second 10 day contract that’s how depleted they are. Fuck outta here dumbass
"One of the most unique and best team offensive seasons ever, for sure. The advanced stats and impact metrics are wild. MVP-level.   However, I need to see him succeed enough defensively in the playoffs against really good competition to definitively put him up there with some of the greats. Center defense has been critical for playoff teams for a long time. Jokic's rim defense is a potential hole that could come back to haunt him at a critical time. Really wish Jamal Murray was healthy because he had a great chance to show just what he could REALLY do in the playoffs. He's been let down before by mediocre supporting casts and poor coaching, so it's really not his fault. I'm a big Jokic believer, too.  For example, Hakeem was arguably the best player in the NBA on both ends when he peaked. Center is still a really important position defensively and has the most competition across eras. But that offense is fucking incredible and unique, and he's still great when the shot isn't falling, which is the biggest sign of true excellence IMHO. One of the best offensive engines I've ever seen for sure, at any position."
"Nah man, stop with the doomer thoughts. Jokic isnt going anywhere. He's got 3 years left and says he wants to be our Duncan / Dirk. Long as we have him there's a chance. MPJ will get a max extension this summer and winning goes a long way. After that contract, no guarantee he stays, but he's developing on a winning team which should give us at least 6 more years with him if he waits all the way until he can test FA for real for the first time, maybe 4 if he tries to force a trade. AG is a question mark, but he seems pretty fuckin' stoked to be on this team, fits in well between MPJ and Joker and is under contract for next year. Murray will be back in time for the playoffs and with another year of development from MPJ who knows? Maybe 80% Jamal is enough to push us over the top (and honestly knowing Jamal, he's the type of dude he'll try to recover in time to get back after the ASB or close to then - I dont think he'll make it, but I'd bet he comes back sooner than later).  We'll see of course and on one can really know for sure. But I refuse to be a doomer about it."
"no, jokic plays center. i feel like you don't understand what you're talking about here. There are five positions in basketball. One player plays at each position in each lineup, irrespective of their playstyle. PJ Tucker played at C for houston despite being 6'7 because someone needs to be assigned as C.  Jokic wuite literally just plays the C for denver. Jamal Murray is the point guard. These things are tracked according to how the coach puts lineups in.  Running offense does not make you the PG anyway. Plenty of offense is run through shooting guards, centers, etc - randle runs the offense on the knicks as power forward. Jokic does not bring the ball up court or call the plays, and does not have the ability to guard the 1, or the handle required to play pg. He's a good passer but he is a true center. Luka, on the other hand, is reaponsible for bringing the ball up, calling plays, and guarding the 1, because...he plays point guard."
Hey how’s Jamal Murray doing and your championship aspirations? Oh... right...
"Or fall all the way into the play-in. The West is tough, especially if everyone's healthy (rip Jamal Murray)"
"Are any of those players as impactful as Jamal Murray though? Without Jamal and Monte, we were giving some guy we just picked up off the street pretty big minutes. Plus you guys are a very good team who has been on a tear recently. You guys just beat the Bucks the other day off a back to back when Giannis was playing."
"Cause Nuggets were favorites to win tonight. Even without Jamal Murray, y'all are still tough as nails."
"Gobert is the best player to stop that in the league, so yeah, we'd prefer that  What kills Gobert is the PnR into a midrange jumper (Jamal Murray, Chris Paul)"
What lol??? Julius wouldn’t even go for Jamal Murray and MPJ the way he has been playing. Plus he is on a great deal next year.
Curry deserves MVP. Maybe if the nuggets fall off with Jamal Murray out we can have another Westbrook type low seed MVP. I hope so atleast
"&gt; Jamal Murray (24)  &gt;Aaron Gordon (25)  &gt;Jokic (26)  Those guys are all making ~30m/year. That's not a young core, that's who you have to win with now."
"Jamal Murray (24)  Monte Morris (25)  MPJ (22)  Aaron Gordon (25)  Jokic (26)  Am I missing something? Would you mind explaining to me your logic on how we're 18th and the Spurs, Cavs, and Knicks are higher than us?"
MPJ or Jamal Murray or even Klay if he counts
"He averages 1 turnover per game - his decision making is simple, not terrible.     MPJ has more positive impact metrics across the board at a more valuable position than Jamal Murray who is not going to be 100% until fall 2022.   If MPJ doesn't get hurt and develops normally, Murray is no longer the second option on the team."
"He’s 26.  I’d say he’s in the same tier of value as Ben Simmons, jaylen brown, or jamal Murray aka the second tier of young prospects."
"Jamal Murray has that potential as well, i think."
"Jamal Murray, 2019 first round vs the Spurs, game 2, fourth quarter. Watching in real time it seemed like he could throw up anything and it would be all net. I think he saved them from going down 0-2. I thought it was a wild fluke cuz I thought he was kind of a scrub, but then he exploded again in game 6 vs the Jazz last year. I think he’s the only other person I’ve seen approach Klay’s level."
"Well first of all they didn’t just add Kawhi and PG to a playoff team, that playoff team lost Tobias (shipped before deadline but still), gallinari, SGA, and others.   Also, I think super team needs to be more than 2 stars, no matter the quality of role players around them. I don’t think Tmac and Yao were ever even close to considered a super team even when the prospect of them remaining healthy was possible. I don’t think you’d consider the nuggets a super team if you replaced Jamal Murray with Kyrie.   Super team to me means 3 stars. There have been many duos in history, and so another duo doesn’t seem crazy when that’s happened many times over the years. It’s when you get 3 all nba caliber guys that it becomes a super team to me."
Jamal Murray 50 on 25 shots And no free throws
"Homer pick but Jamal Murray. Dude is a career 88% FT shooter, ice in his veins in the clutch, and has never made an all star team. Before the injury, ofc"
"As we saw with Miami last year, the bubble will be known a decade from now as one of the biggest outlier creators in NBA history.   Jamal Murray becoming a different player in the playoffs isn’t a metric. It’s a fallacy. No GM is going to base future plans on that."
Don’t forget Jamal Murray and bam!
"In person: Derrick Rose and LeBron trading back-to-back game winners in 2015, performance-wise they were kind of whatever but obviously that just really sticks out to me         On TV live: I don't know there's quite a few, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going back and forth in the bubble was crazy, Kevin Durant game 3 in 2018, Klay Thompson game 6 in 2016, LeBron's performance in the Cavaliers come back in 2016 and so on, it's tough to just pick one of those live, but if I absolutely positively had to pick a game that I saw live I guess I will go with LeBron's game 6 against the Celtics in 2012, I think it's still the greatest game he's ever played, he just looked.... different that night, like the motherfuker was possessed or something lol"
"It does affect both do towards over reliance on the other leg, Jamal Murray just tore his ACL. He had knee soreness in the other leg before the year, that over reliance on the other leg caused the tear. Same with Klay"
Current Jamal Murray
"&gt; on court, and they play like the league's worst team when Shai is not on court.   If you place so much value in on/off stats. Look up the on off of players like Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Giannis, Embiid, Nash during Suns run, Jokic, Chris Paul most years then look up on the On/off of Luka. It is comparable to a good role player which is crazy because as such a ball dominant player, he should have a huge statistical impact. I don't care how little someone values on/off, you have to be surprised that someone who has the reputation of carrying their team has pretty mediocre on/off by superstar standards even this year which is his best year.  &gt;It's not like Dallas suddenly has any offense when Doncić is out  People made a big deal that Dallas was the best offense of all time last year. This wasn't fair because for a while now every year, offenses have been getting better and better and that number 1 offense last year wouldn't even be a top 5 offense this year. What was also ignored is that even without Luka on the court the Mavs still had a top 10 offense in the league (and a better defense). Check out how bad the Trailblazers offense was without Lillard or Hawks offense without Trae Young. This year the mavs have the best scoring duo on the bench but losing Seth Curry, and with the injuries they haven't been quite as good as last year (but still overall a net positive).   &gt;if we assume Westbrook can score.  Don't have to assume, he is a scorer.   &gt;When the player in question is shooting 10 percentage points lower than most other high-usage players and 6 percentage points lower than league's average than this ""impact"" is another story in my opinion  I compared the impact of SGA and Jamal Murray to Luka, not playstyle. I compared Russell Westbrook for playstyle. Barring injuries, if you replaced Jamal Murray with Luka this year, I think they will lose less games then the amount you add by replacing Luka with Lebron James."
"The gap between Jamal Murray and SGA to Luka is smaller than the gap between Luka and MJ and Lebron that he often gets compared to. Luka is a great playmaker, but he will never develop the defense those two had and the only other way he could catch up to them is if he shot like Steph."
"I'd put him ahead of PG right now, and if he keeps up this hot streak he could pass Butler by the end of the playoffs. solidly in the 12th-15th range by the end of the year. The only real caveat to that is who else is looking dangerous for those spots, guys like Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell and Zion Williamson are all one big year away from also being in the top 5/10/15 etc. conversations. JT is probably the best of that group of guys competing and with Murray/Mitchell injured it likely helps build his case.   good point tho I am a bostonian and huge C's fan and hearing people say Tatum is already a top 10 player is just too soon. maybe once the current old guard (LBJ, Dame, Kawhi) start to go on the downswing he can shoot up"
Yeah replacing Jamal Murray with Austin Rivers doesn’t really move that championship needle much as much as I’d love to be optimistic
"We have an easy schedule  The regular season against bad teams is not where missing Jamal kills us, it's the playoffs against good teams who will stay home on cuts and force us to create a shot out of Jokic / Murray PnR"
"I can't give you a source for it being lower. Only about the same:  &gt; It’s impossible to say whether Murray, and those other players, was more likely to succumb to injury because of the fraught nature of a season conducted under the weight of a global pandemic and the protocols adopted to navigate it. Injuries on the whole are not up this season, according to Jeff Stotts of the injury-focused site In Street Clothes, and while Monday’s game against the Warriors was the Nuggets’ sixth contest in nine days, it was Murray’s first in seven days after sitting for four games to rest a sore right knee—not the one he injured on Monday.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/13/22382551/jamal-murray-injury-denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic"
Luka is still overrated (was more overrated last year though). The gap between Lebron and MJ that he gets compared to is larger than the gap between him at SGA and Jamal Murray.
"""Heat culture"" is bullshit sloganeering  Jamal Murray has always been overrated  David Fizdale is a good coach who was dealt a shitty hand  ""Positionless basketball"" is just made up bullshit to explain vastly superior modern athleticism/conditioning/training and intentional switching"
"By this criteria Jason Terry is a star but Jamal Murray isn’t  I agree Jamal isn’t in the top tier of players in the league fwiw. You just shouldn’t have tried to give a criteria for what a star is, because there just isn’t something concrete to point to when defining such a nebulous concept"
The Murray-Mitchell rematch would have been so much fun. I'm hoping for Jamal to have a quick recovery.
Besides Jamal Murray unfortunately.
"I mean surely him not playing quite as well during some regular season games is ok, he’s not going to compete for championships if he keeps getting hurt either. Like, he should be able to compartmentalize that to some level, because if he keeps playing recklessly (which is how I’d describe it), eventually he’s going to have an injury that he can’t just come back in 2 weeks from. That knee injury was about an inch away from a total knee blowout and it was because of a dumb, unnecessary play. You’d hate to see him have a career altering fall or some Jamal Murray stuff because of a dunk in a blowout. Especially after seeing Jamal’s injury, you don’t want that.  Also dudes his size can start really slowing down if they accumulate too much of that. Steven Adams is only one year older than Embiid and look at how much he has declined"
"15/8/7 for Ben Simmons, 21/4/5 for Murray, 18/8/1 for MPJ (and only getting better), 15/7/4 for AG. Jamal and AG are both solid playmakers but don’t need to worry about that when they play with Jokic who averages 26/11/9. AG fills the defensive gap, and both Jamal and MPJ are more lethal offensively. Btw I rounded up for all of these stats it need be.   To suggest that Simmons is a better 2 piece is entirely dependent on what you value I suppose but the nuggets get everything he offers and more from a more well-rounded starting 5."
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, Aaron Gordon"
after reading all of your posts i've determined that you're a gigantic homer and literally no intelligent GM would take Jokic over Embiid in the playoffs. Jokic had a negative net rating in the post-season despite getting to the conference finals and got absolutely abused on defense despite having the entire scheme built around protecting him. He's so bad on defense his coach takes him out of games at the end of playoff games because he doesn't trust him. Also read the part where you claimed Jokic only has a bad defensive rating because of the lineups except Jamal Murray MPJ and Aaron Gordon all have lower defensive ratings without him on the court so we know thats not the reason! Also the idea that because teams dont attempt as many inside shots against Jokic as they do against Embiid is because the nuggets have to shrink the court and stunt every single PnR which is why they get BOMBED on from 3. He's one of the 10 worst defenders in the NBA and the Lakers beat the nuggets because of it.
"I think you confused Donovan Mitchell with the Nugget's PG, Jamal Murray."
"Somebody like Denver winning would be cool, I know with Jamal Murray being injured their chances got diminished but I like watching Joker play and with as crazy as this season has been seeing some new slightly unexpected blood winning the title would be cool"
"Ben’s value isn’t that high man. Especially who’s going to give eite young talent for supposed elite young talent   So It would be to a poor team for picks cause most contending teams already wouldn’t want to fit Ben into their lineups. As like I said he’s very niche, which is completely okay as long as your team is trying to fit around him. He’s not a plug and play piece   You do realize that no one really was ready to trade for Harden? Even Morey wouldn’t even include Maxey in the deal. He was reportedly the last part we wanted of the trade.   Heat said no, to what was mostly Duncan, Herro, salary filler and picks. Celtics said no to Brown, Nuggets wouldn’t even have discussions with us as they took off Jamal Murray immediately off the table.   Harden’s value was already 50 cents on the dollar from all his antics. The only other real option was to not trade him and just have him sit away from the team until some actual good offers came up. But that would obviously have tons of media drama and stuff related to it, the org wanted the issue solved.  I really don’t believe Ben would have worked out here and it’s hard to believe Ben would acquire something better than how good the Nets late picks will probably be. 2025, 2026, 2027 will all be unprotected. If harden and kd will even still be there, they’ll be 36 and 37 by 2027   I’m not saying I love the trade, I actually dislike it. I wish harden just gave it the year and asked out in a real offseason so we could have gotten real offers. But I don’t want And have no regrets of not taking Ben."
"Rudy is extremely valuable in the regular reason though, he impacts opponent shot selection more than any other player by effectively eliminating the highest percentage shots. Embiid and Jokic kind of break their gameplan but that’s two players who nobody can really stop. Those stats are measuring regular season impact, so it’s not about playoffs. Otherwise Ben Simmons, Giannis and Embiid would be lower because they all have major scheme-related problems in the playoffs that they have yet to resolve, and Jokic, LeBron, Rondo and Jamal Murray would be higher. But it isn’t what the stats measure when we’re talking about the regular season."
F'n guy! Always copying Jamal Murray! Lol Jk hope he'll alright.
"Doc is a shit coach, you can never expect him to get tactical things right.  He bascially lost them the series vs Denver by letting Jokic do whatever he wanted and instead they doubled Jamal Murray as soon as he came across half-court."
"First Jamal Murray and now Mitchell? Darn, they are both such electrifying playoff performers."
The NBA is a league built on star power so yes why would anyone care that some nobody role player gets hurt compared to Donovan Mitchell or Jamal Murray
Resting players this season makes a ton of sense. Players are dropping like flies left and right now. Just in this week alone we have lost Jamal Murray and now Donovan Mitchell is down.
[Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell re-visiting their crazy playoff duels from last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C61dnzhcj_s)
I just don't agree with this statement. Jamal Murray is having a better season than anyone on the Sixers and MPJ is literally one of the most efficient players in the NBA this season. His team is plenty good.
Check out the most recent episode of the Only Fans Podcast the newest NBA/Comedy Podcast Ep 17 The Wake of Jamal Murray- RIP 2021 Season [Only Fans Podcast Link ](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/only-fans/id1526465380?i=1000517321436)
I wanted jamal murray. Probably would have been pretty similar production to Brown.
LOL that’s the reply from a dude who knows his team fluked its way into the WCF but doesn’t wanna admit it. I’m sure the Jamal Murray flukey shooting + opponents forgetting how to hit open shots formula will work wonders for Denver in the future.
"Nah. Anyone with a brain knows how flukey that Nuggets run was and that the Clippers win that series at least 7/10 times. It took an all-time unlikely collapse and Jamal Murray fluke games for them to win. If your success was reliant on such an unlikely collapse and a career 35% three point shooter shooting like 47%, it’s a fluke."
"Lmfao. All season people say “wait till playoffs” then when you succeed in the playoffs it’s a fluke. How about this: the Nuggets are just a more talented, better team than the clippers (with Murray), have more fight, better chemistry, and better leadership. The clippers have no identity and that’s why it’s fully unsurprising that they choked like that. They had 3 chances to win a single game against Denver and they couldn’t do it, because they weren’t as good. The fluke was them leading the series at any point. Jamal has always been unreal in the most important moments"
"A couple of years ago, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray seemed like that"
He’s still upset about Jamal Murray
"I'm definitely pulling for strings, but Ima throw out Jamal Murray. Can't really think of anybody else  Edit: Christian Wood showed signs as well"
"&gt;Does the official site of the NBA count?  Lol, hell no!   NBA.com DPOY Power Rankings are universally panned as absolute SHIT! Haha.  I remember one they put out in March, I think, where they actually ranked legendary shitty &amp; half-assed defender Jamal Murray @ #5 in their DPOY Power Rankings! JAMAL MURRAY!  If anyone ever has him as #5 in DPOY rankings, they clearly ARE NOT a ""reputable"" source.   [PROOF](https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-ben-simmons-steals-no-1-spot)"
"Hey AD - do you think the Nuggets will ever win an NBA title? Secondly, what do you think your fellow KY alum Jamal Murray is doing right now as part of his recovery?"
yeah the Jamal Murray appearance was interesting to say the least
Yea so did Jamal Murray  And Jokic is still carrying the Nugs
Didn't he put Jamal Murray on the DPOY list?
"&gt;That’s an excuse people use when they don’t actually watch the teams they are talking about. You literally mentioned nothing about the skill level of both players.   What excuse? I asked a direct question. Where is all this Westbrook ""clutchness"" when it really matters in the playoffs?  &gt;JV for one. Dillon Brooks has been good for them as well, Slow Mo, Bane and Allen both been really good. And the biggest issue is they are ninth in defense despite Ja not being a good defender.   I thought u said ""elite"" role players..    &gt; I know we aren’t comparing two years of Jamal Murray to the entirety of Westbrook’s playoff career. You can’t be serious, you can’t mention “it’s just one one regular season” and then allude to one Jamal Murray bubble run. You just cant.   Of course I'm not talking about whole career but if we're talking about who's better right now I'm taking Murray. It's not even just the bubble run either...the Nuggets had a good playoff run in 19 as well.  &gt;From a basketball standpoint, Westbrook is better than Ja. He’s not efficient especially cause of the games with the injury now and he’s still a better scorer, playmaker, defender, and rebounder.  The only argument u can really make for Russell is statistics, but his statistics never actually amount to anything"

We lost picks.... one of the picks that turned out to be Jamal Murray.
"KAT, Middleton, Holliday, Vucevic, Bam, Trae, Simmons, Jamal Murray, Fox I'm all quite confident in.   Randle, Lavine, Sabonis, Brown I all lean towards better but I probably need one more year from all those guys to be sure. Booker and Mitchell need to show up big in the playoffs, but they're close.  This is the second year in a row Westbrook's team has been better with off the floor than on. He's playing with the second leading scorer in the league and he's 6 games under .500 when he plays. Costs his team 2-3 points a game with his shooting. Needs the ball in his hands constantly. And has been horrendous in the playoffs for years.   Still though when he's on in the RS he's talented enough to win games just on his own merit for long stretches of time, which very few guys can do and that's really valuable.  Borderline top 30 for RS but wouldn't be in my top 50 players for the playoffs."
"Even without that 1, the Lakers franchise would still have 16 other titles to be proud of.  Jamal Murray has 1 good stretch of unsustainable shooting in the bubble and people start saying he “lives rent free in our heads” when he got sent home by the Lakers in 5."
BUT FRANK VOGEL SAID WE SENDING TAPE TO THE LEAGUE SO ADAM SILVER CAN SAVE LeWHINES LEGACY FROM BUBBLE GOAT JAMAL MURRAY!!!!!!!
"He probably will be, so what? Is that a knock on him? How far would you go without Davis, Gasol and Trez against healthy Nuggets? Would that mean that Lebron sucks?   Because Denver is missing  their second best player, especially in playoffs - Jamal Murray, and their starter and their backup PG, all of them shooters."
"Nuggets also have players out lol in Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and Will Barton, I dont think that's a valid excuse."
"You brought up Jamal Murray and him living in the Lakers fans heads for no reason, so I’m gonna trash talk back about your team’s lack of success and the Lakers historical dominance over your franchise. Now you bring up the “at least my team does it the right way” and “built over bought” which is just an excuse to cope with the fact that the Lakers eliminated the Nuggets last year. It was just trash talk and not meant to be personal.  I’m out too, enjoy Jokic and hopefully he wins the MVP this year that he deserves, and hopefully Jamal Murray comes back healthy next year. And when he does I still like the Lakers to beat y’all since that’s my team."
"Hey if you enjoy supporting a franchise that never wins anything and always gets beaten by the Lakers, more power to ya.  You were talking about how Jamal Murray lives rent free in the Lakers head when clearly the Lakers live rent free in yours lol"
oh year ! That one game Jamal got hurt. I miss Murray bruh.
Jamal Murray gives another great performance in the crutch.
"Few good players? Randle, Ingram, D’Lo were all drafted by the Lakers.  Also nobody could care less about him dribbling around Lonzo like 4 years ago lol. Lakers still sent Jamal Murray home last year and the Nuggets were lucky to win 1 game where they still nearly blew a 20 point lead"
The same Jamal Murray that got sent home in 5 games last year despite playing at an unsustainable level he’ll never reach again? No he’s really not.
"&gt; He could be at home     If I'm an NBA player, let alone a player on a Jamal Murray caliber. There is no chance in hell im missing a road game to LA, NYC, or Miami      All about the strip club life"
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
I traded Jamal Murray for him midway through the season and dude has been one of the primary reasons I’m in the finals rn. Bless up
"Here we are, 35 days later. Harden is injured for some time, Jamal Murray is out, and the Lakers are injury-riddled and in a play-in spot. Curry had the best shooting month and best April in NBA history, as of now I got the Finals being the Suns vs. 76ers"
Nah we’ll take Denver way before Utah IMO. We beat them in 5 last year with Jamal Murray on absolute flames...
Jamal Murray (fat lever misses out)  David Thompson  Alex English  Carmelo Anthony  Nikola Jokic
I'm not sure. Jamal Murray is quite a big loss imo. Jokic will have to pull off one of the greatest carries for them to make it far.
"I'm obviously biased, but I think it's possible. Our offense is still really good, we have MVP that is MVP sololy because of his offense and MPJ who is just free buckets, it's not as good as with Murray, we have less weapons now, but I'm confident in Jokic and MPJ taking 50+ shots a game in the playoffs, if MPJ keeps shooting good our offense won't have a problem. On the other hand, our defense is better than with Murray and Barton, instead of them we have Facu and PJ, both of them are really good defenders. With starting lineup we now have the team is pretty balanced.   We will know if we are contenders after the next 4 games, we already had the great win against the Clippers, now we have to play Lakers, Jazz, Nets and Knicks. If we win 3 or more we are contenders, if we win less everything is possible but the chances are way slimmer. The team is already 9-1 after Jamal got hurt, with one loss being when Barton got hurt in the first minute of the game. I know that our team doesn't want to blame the loss on injury, but it obviously affected them. It's not like this team can't play without Jamal. We are all sad that he got hurt, but people are really underestimating the Nuggets without him, we are still a good team, in fact we are probably better than in the last year. MPJ is playing like an allstar now, Jokic is better than he was in the last season, AG can guard any wing, and Facu and Dozier (if he is focused) can defend almost any guard."
"Elite stats all year. Has been available for most, if not all of his team's games unlike Embiid and LeBron. Has missed his running mate in Jamal Murray for a while now and still putting up great numbers and wins."
"[League data shows the player injury rate this season is down about 6%, even though several marquee players — including LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, James Harden and most recently Jamal Murray — have dealt with injuries in recent weeks.](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-says-injury-rate-down-slightly-from-normal)"
"Overall the best story for me would be the Nuggets, to not only have a second-round player be possibly MVP but to go on a great Championship run, while losing Jamal Murray, a championship for a team that hasn't had one, the best player on the team was a happy fat kid not that long ago and he's just a likeable guy.         Out of the teams you listed though the Suns and Chris Paul getting his first championship would probably be the best story , I'd aldo say the Clippers if Paul George actually plays well throughout the playoffs and puts an end to the Wayoff P mockery"
lakers sweeping the jazz without jamal murray of course -Laker Casual
"The nuggets, clippers and lakers will win a 5 -6 game series against the suns? is that on the basis of past seasons and past playoff success? If thats the basis, I see why you have a preconceived notion about the suns just because they missed the playoffs for 11 years...    We are talking about the CURRENT TEAM the way it is assembled, a huge chunk of which was there when they went 8-0 in the bubble and beat the nuggets, lakers and clippers in what was a playoff type like atmosphere, as well as a team this season that only GOT BETTER with a playoff veterans such as Jae Crowder, who STARTED in the NBA Finals just last year with Miami, and Chris Paul who we know has gotten his fair share of success in the playoffs and may have had the closest chance of winning it all with the rockets if he hadn't gotten injured...   As of today, this team will play either Golden State or San Antonio in the first round, two teams they have beaten easily THIS SEASON.    In the second round, they will be facing either the Lakers or the Nuggets, and based on their past games this season, they've had more trouble with the Nuggets than the Lakers (which they beat by 17 points), of which they've lost back to back overtime games (the second a double OT game which they should've won if they called a travel on Jamal Murray for his game tying shot to force the first OT) after winning the first contest.  This means that they've never been blown out by either team, and actually blew out the Lakers this season.    But let's assume the original premise of the post and that the Lakers don't get past the suns (if not the nuggets).  I see them having a chance at beating the nuggets, especially since Jamal Murray, who does the most damage against them, is out right now and may not be fully healthy by the time the playoffs come around.  That is the reality which we have to consider, which means the suns have an even better chance at beating the nuggets which they've had close games with this season.   I see that going the distance to 7 games...which favors the Suns due to the quality of the bench that I was talking about a few posts up.  Then the Suns will only have to beat either the Jazz (which they swept), or the Clippers or Mavs.  They already swept the Mavs this season 3-0 so the Suns can pretty much win a 7 game series against them.  The clips they just beat recently, and have a nice rivalry going with them (they also have not been blown out by the clips and been competitive in all their games with them..., and not to mention beat them at full STRENGTH with Kawhi and PG in the bubble, and WITHOUT Chris Paul), so I don't see you saying that the Suns get beat in 5-6 games by the Clips.  Perhaps a competitive 7 game series where it goes to the last game and becomes a toss up in the end, but the point being is that the Suns have a LEGITIMATE chance to beat any one of the teams you just mentioned based on their play THIS SEASON alone, and even more so if you include last season's 8-0 bubble performance.   They are hungry after not being in the playoffs and if the 8-0 bubble is any indication of a playoff atmosphere (which I believe really was), the Suns will not buckle under pressure (and haven't the entire season thus far), and will remain focused until the end. I say minimum Western Conference Finals, and if they win that, NBA Champs..."
Jamal Murray =&gt; 2011 Caron Butler?
"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
It didn't look more inadvertent than the one Jamal Murray was ejected for.
"Yeah duh, Jamal Murray is clutch"
&gt;Stats can actually display clutch levels quite well...   &gt;   &gt;I’m not a data truther either  Jamal Murray IS clutch though.   [He passes the eye test and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J-4CXw4-Hg) has the stats to back it up take a look! ([x](https://twitter.com/TheNBACentral/status/1384182724940894217)) ([x](https://imgur.com/cpEwgXX))
it is obvious to players. That is the move he is SUPPOSED to make based off of both his shooting priority outside and what the play dictates. In saying that there is a skill to being able to suck in the player effectively. Like he is trying to make it look like he is sneaking but also do it loudly so defenders notice and slide to him.  Jamal Murray is reaaaallly good at it. He just runs around under the basket sometimes and opens up 3 point shots or layups for Jokic to hit.
"Perfect example for the flaw in your comment is the Denver Nuggets. Never tanked, never tried to tank, always competed after the George Karl blow up in 2013. They did things the right way, highest they drafted was 7, found great mid round and 2nd round value, savvy FA pickups, great coach, amazing player development, timely trades and extensions. Got better for 5 straight years.   Jerami Grant dashes for a bigger role, Gary Harris unexplainably loses his offensive game, Jamal Murray torn ACL, and that’s with getting unbelievably lucky enough to get two superstar potential players at 41 and 15 in Jokic and MPJ. Winning a championship is just hard. No one way will guarantee you get there, just gotta do your best and some times that means increasing your odds of getting a superstar. Any team could replicate the nuggets model but without the complete dumb luck of Jokic AND MPJ that’s a 6th seed at best."
"Thanks! I’ve been discovering all the cool data they have on the nba website for the first time because I had always used bball ref until they blocked off some of their stats.   Another interesting one - Jamal Murray is the only guard (minimum 2 per game on average) who makes over 70% of shots in the restricted area. MPJ is 8th on that list total and Jokic is lower at 70% but on more  attempts. There are only three players using the same statistical minimum above who shoot at least 70% in the paint and above 40% on above the break 3s: Durant, MPJ and Jokic. Jamal Murray is .07 above the break threes from also being on that list."
"uhm you are viewing this from the wrong perspective, only 47% of his potential assists actually lead to assists which is a pretty low number so his teammates just dont convert his passes  and why are you talking about passes received? he has 48 passes per game which is more then Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday ..."
"Nuggets were missing multiple *starters* too that they'll have back for the playoffs. They started a 2020 G-leaguer and NBA rookie at PG/SG. That's a really garbage point bro, c'mon now.  No one is saying the Nuggets are going to wipe the LA teams off the floor after losing Murray, but to say they're a warm up is straight disrespectful or you haven't been paying attention since Jamal got injured."
Murray is still far and away the best guy at running PnR with Jokic (including setting up Jokic to score).  We need to get MPJ more shots but ultimately he's still going to be mostly a play-finisher and Jamal and Jokic will be the big and small initiators. Hopefully we just don't go to Jamal iso quite so much
"Yet Jokic had Jamal Murray and MPJ for most of the season whose OBPM were 2.7 and 3.9, respectively. But I suppose if you’re asking to Steph to literally be god and carry this team offensively AND defensively then you’re right. He’s definitely not MVG"
They are better with MPJ unlocked. I don't understand why the team for so long has refused to let him be the number 2 option when he is clearly a much better scorer than Jamal Murray. Guy is averaging 18 points on 66% TS and 44.3% from 3.
"I would really like to dispel the myth that the Nuggets are a better team without Jamal.   We've had 10 games from the trade deadline to the injury and 10 games since the injury until now.  Pre injury they were 8-2. Post injury they're 9-1. Pre injury they're 111 defensive rating, post injury they're 110. Pre injury they're 116 offensive rating, post injury they're 118.      I think it's indicative of how good a coach Mike Malone is, how good a Front Office Tim Connelly has built, and how great of players Nikola Jokic and MPJ are that despite all the injuries the team hasn't missed a beat.   We're going to miss him in the playoffs, and I think the last three minutes of the Raptors game and the last three minutes of this game show that. Maybe once Monte comes back, there will be more stability on offense at the end of games with him and Jokic running the 2 man game.      Anyway. Just getting annoyed with the growing myth that the Nuggets are better without Murray."
"/u/tfuesfan you still think Jamal Murray is the team's MVP and that Jokic can't lead a team, or are you finally willing to admit that was a bad take"
"they are definitely not better without Murray, but I think MPJ is a better 2nd option for that team. he seems more consistent than Jamal and his height makes his cuts to the basket lethal.  so imo Jokic - MPJ - Murray is a more natural pecking order. sucks that one guy had to go down for the other one to shine though."
"Lmao dumb ass, what about removing Jamal Murray(you know the one who made the clippers his bitches) will Barton and monte Morris. That's our top 3 guards fool and we won. We won with fully fit teams in the bubble(sans Barton) and we beat them with injuries to important players in our rotation. And u just assume almost everyone will take clippers lol. Like I said, delusional."
ESPN tomorrow: Has Jamal Murray been holding the Nuggets back this whole time???
"&gt;Murray is super streaky, and in the bubble, he was at peak streak. But he also has bad games and disappears. He will also force 3s and miss when he’s cold and games runaway from the nuggets.  Jamal is not that streaky anymore, clearly, you didn't watch him before he went down with a season-ending injury. Before he got hurt Murray was averaging 21/4/4 on 47/41/86 shooting splits. Before Jamal got injured he was quickly becoming a consistent 20 points a night scorer and was becoming more and more efficient with his shooting. Also, he was continuing to make his mark in the league as a clutch player who can be a great closer alongside Jokic.   Also when Jamal is cold he tends to pass more and give more effort on defense."
I’m so sad because I honestly thought with Jamal Murray Denver could’ve had a real chance at the title including beating out the lakers in the west :(
"I like Jokic and acknowledge his year, but no one seems to ever make note of the supporting casts here. Jokic &amp; Luka are doing basically the same thing except one guy has Jamal Murray, MPJ, and now Aaron Gordon plus a deep bench. The other got KP for what won’t even be 45 games so THJ has prob been the second best player. Like 4 wins separate those two teams so you tell me who’s having to do more?   CP3 also just pulled a 9th seed to 1st seed this year."
"What? MPJ missed a third of the season. Murray was never healthy and missed time all year. Their second best guard behind Jamal is Barton who has been injured most of the year and is out right now. 3rd best guard is Monte Morris who has missed a lot of time and is currently out. 4th best guard is Facu who missed a lot of time earlier in the year. 5th beat guard is PJ Dozier who missed a lot of time. Our two top bench guards at the moment were signed off of the street after the deadline. Gary Harris barely saw the court for us this year before they traded him for a  loss (Hampton was to get Gordon and the 1st to take Garys contract as part of it). Paul Millsap missed a few weeks. Jamychal Green missed a few weeks sparsed out and has played through injuries.   The only rotation players the Denver Nuggets have who haven't missed significant time this year are Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon (who they traded an injured starter for), and two guys signed midseason as reactions to both a starter and his backup going down at the same time.   And just to throw the math out there:  Players lost to injury this year so far:  Clippers - 10 players missing 148 games between them  Nuggets - 14 players missing 164 games between them."
"He's also better than Jamal Murray as a player and in those types of shots, there are very few players in the league that are as efficient as Booker from the midrange (one of those players is on his own team).  It sucks that we most likely won't see those teams play against each other in the postseason (Utah has no shot against the LA squads and they most likely will have to play one or the other), but i have a feeling that the Suns would clap the Jazz in a series, their offense just translates into the postseason so well."
"Scottie Pippen one probably goes to Kris M, Jamal Murray, or AD. I dont even know who they would pick for the Nets tho  Best Energy Guy probably goes to Pat Bev"
"Jamal Murray, Herro, And AD all played above their head in the bubble when it came to shooting"
"Yeah I can, because I'm not an idiot or a Nuggets homer. Sorry, Jamal fucking Murray posting two of the 42 ever 50 point postseason performances in one series and shooting like 45% from three was absolutely a fluke. Christ, how can anyone believe otherwise?"
"Both of the Nuggets series for me, for different reasons the first round sing Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell just absolutely go out it was phenomenal shet, and then the Clippers series, Once they went up 3 games to 1 we were all ready for the Battle of Los Angeles, and then they kept blowing all these multiple leads which led to an absolute shitshow and beautiful NBA Twitter after game 7😂😂😂"
"He hits the exact same type of contested shots that Jamal Murray hits in the postseason. Just tough, create your own shot across the mid range. That’s the stuff that serves you well come playoffs. No doubt Booker performs in the postseason when defenses step up."
Give me Jamal Murray smh 😤
Jamal Murray   Ja Morant   Javale Mcgee   Jodie Meeks   Joe Mama
"For sure. Basketball reference has an adjusted shooting section that attempts to do that. I just did the math myself and depending on if you use raw numbers or percentages, Kobe's TS% of .548 in 1997-98 is equivalent to about .596-.598 this season, which is slightly above Luka, CP3, Jamal Murray, and right around Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, and Jimmy Butler."
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
"&gt; Dwight and Javale were played off the court multiple times  The same way Trez was played off the court by both Luka Doncic and Jamal Murray in the series he played in.  &gt; Schroeder's been keeping the team afloat for much of this stretch.  I disagree, their defense has been BY FAR the main reason why they've won some games in this stretch and that hardly has anything to do with Dennis Schroeder, in fact they have the worst offense in the NBA since LeBron has gone down, they are winning games by holding their opponents to 90ish points."
Denver had a chance until Jamal Murray  The other question mark is how they’d look vs. LAC in a series considering how Kawhi is someone that can defend LeBron and how much defensive potential sits on that team.
"at least you admit it. reddit was shitting on chris paul big time.  the overreaction to ""bad"" contracts whether it is westbrook, paul, or wiggins, or jamal murray or simmons or siakam or al horford or (or even blake griffin) or whoever, is totally ridiculous. they are always way easier to shed then people claim and half the time the player in question is not nearly as ""washed"" as everyone claims. plus, everyone acts like ""cap space"" is this magical thing without understaning how rare it is for genuine difference makers to ever hit the market and how much, generally, you have to overpay for them when they do."
"&gt; Statement: Shai is ~~going to be~~ fucking amazing  SGA/Dort/RJ/Jamal Murray Team Canada guard rotation, inject that shit straight into my veins."
Jamal Murray ... his beard just grew in a slightly different place.
"We're down Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and Monte Morris. Who do you expect him to play? Also Shaq has been really good and we've won like 4 games in a row with guards we signed a week ago."
Yeah I'd trade Murray for him. I'm in the minority though and I love Jamal but AG and Simmons makes us absolutely lethal defensively.
I can't even begin to figure out what this stat is basing these ranks on. Conley is top 10 and Jamal Murray is right behind him. Christian wood is above Embiid. I can't find a rhyme or reason
"think ab the teams the nuggets would have to beat. if the standings stood till the playoffs rn they’d play lakers 1st round, jazz 2nd, and most likely clippers or suns in cf. That alone, without jamal murray, would be crazy if he won"
"jamal murray shot more FTs in that series than Lebron, wtf are you smoking. You still mad half a year later lmao"
he also has MPJ and had Jamal Murray too lmao
"I""m suspecting but it's most likely not Jamal Murray."
"Most improved award is literally based on stats, do u guys even pay attention to the awards? MVP factors in wins not MIP. Plus the nuggets are on a winning streak with Jamal Murray hurt"
No dude. Murray carried the team on his back in the Jazz series. That series is over in 5 without Jamal.
But the good thing is we will get to see other young talent like Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell in the west And hopefully Trae Young in the east
Idk man. We haven’t seen playoff book. Could be like Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell where he just goes nuclear in the playoffs. Plus you already know Chris Paul is gonna step up his game
Jamal murray didn’t exist?? Jokic didn’t do no damn carry job lmao
"Gobert is an elite rim protector, and not good at other things on defense.  Meaning he will struggle in switch scenarios or if he plays drop coverage, he will get burned. The drop coverage explains why Jamal Murray torched the Jazz (and likewise Mitchell torched the Nuggets drop coverage because Jokic can't guard that either).   Furthermore there's the possibility that Mitchell isn't good enough, even though he's very good. When it comes to down to the last possession of the game can he produce a good shot 90% of the time like LeBron can? When the offense stalls can you depend on Mitchell to just take over a game and churn out good shots for himself in consecutive possessions?"
Wow Lakers Clippers in the first round would be the dream...by every other West teams lol Sucks that Jamal Murray is hurt though.
I guarantee you it'll be easier to game plan for MPJ than Jamal Murray/Donovan Mitchell/Devin Booker.
"No Jamal Murray Nuggets is not going to be better than the Suns/Jazz. Given the seeding being as it is, most of us would rather play the Nuggets."
"For whatever reason, Jamal Murray and Donavon Mitchell’s bubble performance were heavily questioned because of playing in the bubble but people rarely questioned Herro’s."
"Because some players are notorious for being slow starters (like Jamal Murray), others are known for being able to get right back into it pretty much instantly (KD). You would understand this is you knew anything about Jamal Murray or weren’t a complete fucking dumbass"
"Nobody. Still, a man averaging 21pts in the regular season outscored him in the last 3 matches. So i guess Jamal Murray is just greater by your logic"
Dawg are we talking about the MVP race or who is the better player. Jamal Murray when he played this season was better than Deaaron Fox and that’s it
Jamal Murray was already a really good player &amp; continued to be this season. Herro averaged 2 more ppg in the bubble than he did in the regular season. And im considered a “herro hater” but the bubble narrative is idiotic
looks like jamal murray is not up there no more
"MPJ is turning into a star, and your guys are all young. Jamal Murray, MPJ and Jokic Big 3? Especially if MPJ takes another leap that’s a great team"
If we're going to use individual games as a metric then it has to be jamal murray
You're taking 2021 Rose over jamal murray?
Week 17 stats.  Jamal Murray | Will Barton | Michael Porter Jr. | Aaron Gordon | Nikola Jokic  Stats: 133.9 offensive rating | 100.0 defensive rating | +33.9 net rating | 90 minutes played  That was what could have been.  Get well Murray.
"jamal murray is definitely better than rose, dlo, and lowry."
"Yeah. Jokic is the MVP. Jamal and MPJ were both playing like all-stars. The Gordon trade seemed to energize them on the defensive side of the ball. To me, they felt like the most complete team after the deadline and before the Murray injury"
"? Jamal Murray put up 2016 Steph numbers in last year’s playoffs, he was better than Murray. But more importantly those teams were better than us 3-8. We just beat them because LeBron did usual LeBron shit and AD played like a KG-Dirk hybrid.  Jokic would have destroyed us without AD. He made Javale look like ... well, Javale. And Dwight did a great job but he couldn’t play more than 25 minutes without fouling out. Who else is guarding Jokic ? We tried Kieff on him for short stretches and it was a bloodbath.  Also we beat Houston and Denver in 5 but both series were much closer than 4-1 looks. We could very easily have been down 2-1 in both series and that’s with LeBron and AD both having all-time level playoff runs."
"Jamal Murray kinda does I think, minus the deep deep 3s. He plays like I feel like Steph would if he was just a human, really good shooter LMAO"
"I would say Jamal Murray would be more of a ""Home-grown son of Toronto""   Like Lowry is to Philly.  Kitchener is close enough.  RJ Barrett is poised. I say this because Thompson is more of a role-player.  Jamal showed superstar potential in the bubble last year."
"Probably should’ve been 7th or 8th this season with how many games our starting rotation missed. Maybe missed playoffs even. Luka really carried way harder than this sub and general media realizes. Like as an example, I don’t think most people realize Jamal Murray played more games than KP and KP left early in another 4. We had a 14+ game stretch where 3/5 of the starting rotation are now in the g league or off the team.  The Mavs got hit the hardest in the West by covid by far. Our starting rotation had only played together like 3-4 times by the all star game. It’s hard to say where we’d be had there been no covid for the league. How they’re playing rn vs the Clips is pretty on par with how they played when the whole rotation was together this year."
"Thanks! I even see a comment I made compiling some of the most reactionary threads I'd seen around that time, like saying Jamal Murray is top 10."
If Jamal murray is playing this is a close out game for us smh so hard to watch
"relax bro they're missing jamal murray and they're still a top 4 team in the west  your team without its stars was looking like a g league squad   stones, glass houses, throwing and living in, etc"
"Yeah, this was true when they had Jamal Murray lol"
"This is where Denver really misses Jamal Murray, first time this series where Jokic and MPJ have been zoned in."
"Oh I feel that homie.  Same way I feel about the Niners losing their recent SuperBowl appearances.   Much rather my team have a run to the Finals and lose instead of constant 1st and 2nd round exits.  People can make all the jokes they want. If it were their team in the Finals last year, they’d rock that shit proudly. If the Heat are a fraud, then so is Jamal Murray and Spi-Dad Mitchell.   I highly doubt that’s the case tho. Bucks just played a better series after having a better offseason."
"If we do end up trading Simmons this off-season, would much rather get someone younger than Butler. Someone like Beal or maybe Jamal Murray. Otherwise, would much rather keep Simmons especially if we do well in the playoffs this year."
"Facu the Goat. He plays really good defence for someone his own size. He's aggressiveness leads to him like averaging a steal or two per game. He's been a really good help, setting up plays for Jokic and the rest of the team while in the absence of Jamal Murray"
"Sure. But if you're looking purely at numbers, Jokic has a case of being the better defender.  ||Jokic|Embiid| |:-|:-|:-| |DWS|3.4|3.2| |DBPM|2.5|1.0| |Steals|1.4|1.0| |Blocks|0.7|1.4|  Of course, I'm not going to argue that Jokic is the better defender. But the difference isn't as big as people are portraying it to be, especially when you're considering who is more valuable to his team.  Embiid is in system with multiple elite defenders, Simmons, Thybulle, Green, Harris are all good to elite defenders which helps his case when it comes to all-defensive teams. Case in point: Bucks had 3 players in all defense team last season. (Giannis, Lopez, Bledsoe)  Even the 10 games that Embiid missed due to injury, the 76ers were 7-3 during that stretch. Which actually helps Jokic case more than hurts it.  While I can't say what the Nuggets would look like without Jokic since he played all 72 games, without their 2nd best player Jamal Murray, they went 16-6 during that stretch. The injuries to Embiid and Murray, and their team record only served strengthened Jokic case and shouldn't be used against him."
for the last year some random guy messaged me whenever trae had a bad game to convince me Jamal Murray is better. lol deranged
The Carmelo Anthony traded ended up being the pick that led to Jamal Murray
"Question is how good is jamal Murray if he is 75% of bubble Murray ,nuggets are the answers else it might be the sixers they can score really well and with their defensive personnel they will harass everyone on the nuggets expect jokic"
With Jamal Murray? Nuggets.
"I remember seeing someone on here say that he'd take Jamal Murray over Trae Young because Trae ""hadn't proved himself in the playoffs yet"" or some bullshit like that."
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
"You know what, I forgot about that. That’s a great point. I was also thinking about somehow needling about Jamal Murray htt it couldn’t fit that in a chant. I was more along the lines of I like stuffing and forgot about the connotations. I appreciate the check!"
Jamal Murray be like: so the whole Lakers team getting a warning too?
We are one Jamal Murray-level player away from being a title contender.  :(
"The Mavs were 2 wins away from a title during that 2005-2010 stretch, had 67/60/58 win seasons and won at least 50 games every season during that time. Portland has 1 50 win season during this stretch. This current team cant even handle Denver without Jamal Murray. Even the 2010 Mavs the year before they won the title and things were looking gloom and doom won 55 games.   Mavs were actually close knocking on the door for years, Portland has never been close to any kind of title. Just way apart in terms of where they were. 2005-2010 was more analogous to 2011-16 OKC tbh. Portland's current path to serious title contention would be hoping some top 10-15 player falls out of thin air into their lap. Good luck with that."
"Lebron has led the Lakers in defensive rating, defensive win shares, DRPM,  DPIPM, and dFG% the last two seasons. All of the best defensive Laker lineups have Lebron in them. He locked down Kawhi and Giannis last year and he was the one guarding Jamal Murray in the playoffs last year.   Kuzma said Lebron should be 1st team all-defense this year."
That’ll happen when you don’t have top 5 defender Jamal Murray on you
"Oh no doubt. Jokic is definitely our best player, but when Jamal is playing with Jokic there's an argument to be made that he's 1b.   Jokic is 1 without Murray and 1a with him. Murray is never 1 without Jokic but is 1b with him. If that makes sense."
"Downtown Denver, 2019. I'm in a coffee shop in an office building, standing in line. The line isn't moving and I have no idea why. In walks Jamal Murray. He walks behind the counter and starts serving people. To this day I have no idea why. Also I was surprised how normal sized he is. Prob 6'1."
I think Jamal Murray will need to earn back his starting job
"No he doesn't , 2013 Lebron was a DPOY runner up, lead playmaker and lead scorer for his team. Jokic can't come close to that, he just doesn't have the athleticism. I'd argue Jokic wasn't even better than Lebron in the playoffs last year, Nuggets had better depth and Jamal Murray was playing out of his mind and they still lost in 5."
The ones I know of is Orangeville prep and Crestwood prep .. Jamal Murray went to orangeville  There’s prob more tho
Have ever seen Jamal Murray and Austin Rivers in the same room?
Watch him post Jamal Murray nudes next.
Maybe with Jamal Murray..but w/o him it looks like a clean road to the finals for the Lakers.
"Well basically Jamal Murray ""accidentally"" released  a vid of his gf sucking him off"
Jamal murray isn’t tradeable. At all
Yea Jamal Murray and Michael Porter jr lmao
Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray are probably the only two tradable young stars on contender teams that Portland would even look at.
"AD isn’t good enough to lead his own team bruh. The Pelicans had some talented rosters in his time there. The point is that while Lebron and AD are both legends, a team of Kawhi and PG could beat them on any given night with the right supporting cast. Same with a healthy Nuggets, that team with Jamal Murray has tons of Star power and depth."
"Jamal Murray, except we haven’t seen his junk."
Jamal Murray at home:
Jamal Murray with tats
Austin “Jamal Murray” Rivers
Scooby Doo meme Austin Rivers revealed to be Jamal Murray.
[Jamal Murray](https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nba/players/full/6617.png&amp;w=350&amp;h=254) showed up in his first game back from injury
"Watching the Nuggets rn makes me think, if they had Jamal Murray rn, they would be top 3 title favourites for sure."
"They still have Jamal Murray, but he goes by ""Austin Rivers"" now."
Who the fuck let Jamal Murray possess Rivers?
"Jamal murray is for real and im willing to die on that hill, bam too"
Well the obvious conclusion from tonight is to trade Jamal Murray /s
It’s time for Portland to blow it up man can’t beat a Jamal Murray less nuggets
injury to jamal murray
Rivers really just decided to become Jamal Murray
Who needs Jamal Murray when you have Jamal Murray with tats
Austin rivers has tapped into the spirit of Jamal Murray
"I got love for Jokic, but I don't see him making it out of the West without Jamal Murray. Even with him it's a near thing.   If the Lakers are a wounded animal this is the Jazz' year. Lot of heat coming out of the East though."
Esp no Jamal Murray
"Not bad but even with Shai and Jamal Murray I put them behind Australia, France, Spain, and Serbia"
"Yeah man, we all saw the Jamal Murray video."
&gt; Denver entered the season with one of the deeper guard rotations in the NBA. &gt;  &gt; PG: Jamal Murray / Monte Morris / Facu Campazzo / Markus Howard &gt;  &gt; SG: Gary Harris / Will Barton / PJ Dozier / RJ Hampton  Dude read even just the first few sentences
Jamal Murray was dropping the most insane playoff performances we've seen in years and he wasn't an all star this season.  All Star selections are super dependent on the media.
"Did you watch the Nuggets vs Jazz last year? The Nuggets sat Jokic at the 3pt line, forcing Gobert out of the paint, and Jamal Murray just attacked their weakest defenders, they also ran high pnrs with Gobert, so Murray ran by Gobert while he was still recovering, and when a wing penetrates its on the low defenders to rotate depending on a team's defensive philosophies, that's what team defense is. Gobert got that contract because the Jazz's defense is to SPECIFICALLY funnel everything to Gobert"
"The Canadian team is good right now, but imagine how good they’ll be in Paris in 2024. With Jamal Murray and SGA fully healthy and with all their young players having 3 more years experience they could seriously be the 2nd best team in the world."
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
"imagine if SGA , Jamal Murray were there :("
You forgot about The Bubble God Jamal Murray
"Ja has played like a star over his past 3-4 games. All being playoff/playin games and he’s delivering night in and night out.  You sound like the same people who doubted Luka last year, he’s not a superstar but he has warranted all the praise he’s getting with his play.  Same way people fawned over Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, And Luka Doncic last playoffs. Let Ja have his moment."
"r/nba stay sleeping on Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Ingram and MPJ and Jamal Murray and Simmons, all of these guys are also under 25"
Those teams are easier for us to defend because we have size at the wings. It's the athletic guards such as Ja and Jamal Murray that give us trouble.
1. Steph Curry ......... 47.2%   2. Zach LaVine ........ 36.9   3. Jamal Murray .......36.9   4. James Harden ..... 36.8   5. Dame Lillard .........36.0   6. Luka Doncic ......... 35.7   7. Jayson Tatum ....... 34.6   8. Jordan Clarkson ... 33.3
Like this one on Jamal Murray last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-P_7QQgA8
"Yeah I was trying to figure out who would be #5 and if it's not Rudy then Ben's a good shout.   Definitely a better fit too.   I was thinking maybe Jamal Murray too but it depends on what OP wants. The best 5-man team or the best 5 players regardless of position.   If you're going best 5-man team: Murray, Luka, Simmons, Giannis, Embiid/Jokic.  If you're going best 5 players: Embiid, Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Gobert."
"Embiid, Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Ben Simmons or Jamal Murray will be my 5th guy."
"You gotta fight over picks dude. I get it, there aren’t any top 10 players in the nba that actually play intense, championship level defense because they have so much else on their plates. But the construction of this team was built on this idea that you have Kawhi and PG to take out the other teams’ best wing. This also doesn’t even necessarily have to be wings, look at what Jamal Murray did to the Clippers too. Maybe it’s just an understanding that you shouldn’t have your two best offensive players be the exact same position."
Jamal Murray pube type beat
PG would be a perfect fit on the Nuggets funny enough. Have to wonder if they’d entertain a PG/Jamal Murray swap
"Except when Jamal Murray went down, but they still did pretty ok thanks to Jokic"
"It’s why you should never judge a player by their first few years.. there’s like 10 good to great players in that draft   Simmons, Brown, Ingram, Siakam, Jamal Murray, Vanvleet, Sabonis, Levert, Dejounte Murray, Brogdon"
Idk but I saw Jamal Murray play like prime Steph Curry in the bubble
"Campazzo doesn't space the floor well enough to fit with Aaron Gordon.  Jamal Murray's on- and off-ball gravity really unlock Gordon's offense. Murray and Gordon screening for each other off-ball was killer because Jamal's a physical screen-setter and a shooting threat, and Gordon is big and strong enough that you can't switch Jamal's guy onto him.  My tin-foil theory about Campazzo is that our FO reached out to him assuming that we would put Monte Morris in a Jrue Holiday trade (and re-sign Grant), and didn't want to go back on their word when the trade fell through. Because he'd have been a nasty bench guard to run alongside either Murray or Jrue."
"Giving up the  draft pick that became jamal Murray was a big deal, why minimize it?"
Jamal Murray needs to clown this dude again for my entertainment
"This opinion always gets posted, always gets upvoted and still never is right.  We gave up Gallo, 2 good role players in Felton and Wilson Chandler (Felton ended up back on the Knicks within 2years), fodder and a first 4 years in the future.  We got a All NBA player, had enough cap room to get Tyson Chandler, resign JR Smith and sign other vets to make our roster better.  At worst it was a fair trade - the fact that the 2014 pick turned into Jamal Murray was the issue - but that had no influence from that trade and moreso fucking Phil Jackson destroying and dismantling everything"
"somewhere in a parallel galaxy far far away, jamal murray is the most famous porn star to have ever lived."
I don't think so. Jamal Murray is their second best player.
"Jamal Murray is a better player than Facu, no questions... but I can't help but get the feeling that Facu is sort of a better fit with this team. I'm not saying they are better off without Murray of course, but Facu just does everything this team needs."
"Apparently this is not to Jamal Murray but to a really annoying Nuggets fan who was yelling ""pussy"" to Carmelo and possibly others too."
"Lol, I do..always!  He reps Canada hard and wants to play each year, plus is besties with Jamal Murray and was one of the early commits last year and again this year too.  Honestly love his game and followed his whole career and because he played a few years of college and was a 2nd round draft pick to a weak team his buzz was never huge.  Showed flashes of promise late in his rookie year by than was injured his entire 2nd year.    He came back and had a great 3rd year lady year and now in his 4rth year he is A 2-way star, or close to it all season for Memphis.  He is a slightly better RJ Barrett type but will eventually get passed by RJ if RJ keeps going the way he is.  It's unlikely Brooks makes an all-star by game, but he will be near that level for a few years in his prime for sure.  He might be our 4rth or 5th main player in Victoria, or 5th to 7th with our complete team including Murray and all out stars.  Clearly we need some bigs to show up an play big for us, but I f I ranked guys right now, he may even be #4 or 5th, behind only Jamal, Shai and Wiggins and possibly be tied with RJ. Than Nekeil Alexander Walker.  Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson would all be very close too.  Than, very close behind your next tier by would be the Brandon Clarke's, Khem Birch, Lugentze Dort, Dwight Powel, Oshai Brissett"
Don’t want a repeat of Jamal Murray
They barely made playoffs and beat a Jamal Murray- less team at home... lol
With no Jamal Murray and and don’t use that as an excuse to the worst defense I’ve ever seen from a full team
A Jamal Murray walking on the court and playing 48 minutes play
Morris just swallowed up Lillard? Jamal Murray is that youuu???
"I mean we have tj Warren going mj mode, ad suddenly becoming the greatest mid range shooter of all time, Jamal Murray playing consistently, Tyler herro’s above average good playoff series, heat performance overall, etc.   I think I’m gonna stick with that the bubble wasn’t really the normal nba experience and some really weird shit happened, that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred."
Man I miss Jamal murray. Nuggets would be so nutty if they were at full strength. Injuries fucking suck
*Jamal Murray has left the chat*
Man this team would be absolutely destined for the finals if jamal murray was healthy
jamal murray should bring in a bunch of different masks and use them as reaction shots  like he could put a clown mask on whenever he disagrees with a ref call
"Wish Jamal Murray was playing. He's kind of our nemesis, but dude's just fun to watch."
I’m heartbroken Jamal Murray is out.
"Steph, Dame, Harden (and/or Kyrie whoever you count as PG), Luka, Westbrook, CP3, Trae are all clearly better.   You could argue Jamal Murray, DeAron Fox and Ben Simmons are better (I'd rather have Murray and Simmons). And I'm not even counting Lebron who is a full time PG at this point. At best Ja is bottom top 10 at this point. He's closer to Brogdon than he is the top 5 guys"
"Steph, dame, Kyrie/harden, cp3, luka, trae, deaaron fox, we’re all better this year. And you could probably count jamal Murray and even d Mitchell as PGs as well. Ja obviously has balled in the playin and game 1, but he wasn’t particularly good this year as a whole."
"I mean the Lakers didnt have healthy Davis for most of it, and who knows what would have happened if Joker stayed in the 4th in Game 4 (also they didnt have Jamal Murray..)  but still, a competitive Suns team is good for the league. western conference too beefy"
jamal murray changes nothing
"Jamal Murray ain't turning no sweep into a series win, hell naw. Put some respeck on CP3 and the Suns name, they're a legit title contender."
Damn Jamal Murray looked like he was crying 😞
As a Suns fan I feel bad for Jamal Murray. Good luck next year and keep that fight
They never had a chance without Jamal Murray
"Nah. Jamal Murray, their 2nd best player, has been missing."
"Nah nah they have no Murray, this isn't a fair comtest without Jamal there to tip the scales"
"The Nuggets fought hard despite missing their second best player, Jamal Murray, all postseason. I expect them to be much better next year. Future is bright"
michael junior porter has his chance to step up and take that jamal murray spot that he's wanted but can't seem to make it happen
Was cp3 not hurt in round 1? Jamal murray ain’t fixing this shitty Denver defense
Sucks but it happens. The suns were just all around better. If Jamal Murray was healthy it may have been different.
Took his team as far as they could realistically go without Jamal Murray. Most didn't even think they could get past Dame.
They were grasping at straws. Knew they weren’t good enough. Tried to get better. Didn’t matter cuz Jamal Murray got injured
"Damn if only Jamal Murray was here, then the Nuggets would lose in 5 games this round."
Jokic truly carried this team. Now they are playing like a 15th seed without him. It sucks that Jamal Murray was injured. Better luck next year.
"Jamal Murray coming back is going to help, but the Nuggets need to find a PJ Tucker type player if they want to compete for a title next year"
adam silver really robbed us of a jamal murray vs dbook rivalry.
"One thing that wouldnt have changed with Jamal Murray is the Nuggets being so bad getting over screens vs guards on pick and rolls. They put AG on CP3 in the 4th quarter on Friday same shit, too hard for a big 6'8 wing to do it. Jokic hasnt had a good defensive series but drop coverage has no shot in hell like this with everybody just dying on screens."
Suns fans do know if Jamal Murray was healthy this would be nuggets in 6 right
Jamal Murray. End of conversation.
Nuggets going to get swept. Ugh. Jokic can't win with these scrubs. Really missing Jamal Murray.
"Lmao if y'all are seriously arguing Khris Middleton is better than Nikola Jokic that's wild. I usually ignore those kind of takes but this is too funny. Just to clarify:  So the Bucks probably get swept if James Harden is playing. Y'all were a shot away from being down 3-0. Now Kyrie goes down and the Bucks have the luxury of playing a team whose 2/3 stars are out. Plus Khris plays next to Giannis, one of the best players on Earth to take defensive gravity off of Khris.   Meanwhile we all know how much of a playoff beast Jamal Murray is. So the Nuggets are clearly missing their second best player and it's blatant when you watch their offense right now. Their second best player has basically been Monte Morris.   And your best data/argument for Middleton over Jokic completely ignores the MAJOR injury scenarios present. That's some impressive critical thinking skills ya got there."
"That was one series. The injuries this year, caused by the 13-day offseason and super compressed schedule, have been a constant throughout the season and postseason. Let’s just look at these playoffs: LeBron, AD, Chris Paul (who is obvisohyl looking better now), Harden, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Dontae Divencenzo, Embiid, Kyrie, Hunter+Reddish. Basically every team had a very significant injury or two.  Yeah, everyone is usually banged up by this time but this has been different. Half the stars in the playoffs were either out or not even close to their real selves."
Why did you guess Jamal Murray lmao
"jamal murray, demar derozan, isiah thomas all tweeted about him after his game 6 vs the mavs"
That was jamal murray
Who is this? Jamal Murray?
There were so many insane and ridiculous performances last year to enjoy. Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell anyone? That one tops the list. Bubble or no bubble that was one of the most insane 1 on 1 match ups that I have seen in NBA playoff history. Period. And it happened in the first round!
"IIRC, at least Canada is sending their A- or their B+ team.  Every one of their best is presumably in except for Jamal Murray"
"MVP, man. He won it. Kawhi hasn't. I know, I know, Finals MVP, blah, blah, blah. Cedric Maxwell and Iggy have won that award. Jokic's team hasn't made the finals. Jamal Murray is a nice player, but Kawhi has had some legendary teams. Learn the game, nephew."
Jokic is missing his right hand man Jamal Murray they could definitely take Brooklyn with him that’s how meaningful he is so if he gets swept doesn’t really mean anything truly he did all he could do he really function well setting people up ...now if Clippers got swept hell yeah tht would mean a lot they were expected to win it all last year and come out the west this year .
"Right. Maybe I didn’t word the question clearly enough. Jamal Murray is an incredible talent. Obviously having an incredible talent on the floor is better than NOT having that talent. My question wasn’t “would they be better with Murray”. Of course they would. My question was, given how lopsided the series has been so far, would he make them better ENOUGH to change the outcome of the series."
"If there is a franchise that can come back from down 3-0 its the Denver Nuggets. Jamal Murray might play. They won't clear him, he'll come onto the court and forget how to miss"
Jamal Murray and Jaylen brown too
Nah Jamal Murray can't play. He can only Chuck
Jamal ‘I’m about to get the best head of my life’ Murray
Yeah and? I’d still take current Jamal Murray over current Rose
"Maybe. They also had Jamal “Not Ready To Pack My Bags And Go Home Yet” Murray on the team who went nuclear in both series, which they unfortunately do not have right now."
"Yeah I understand conceptually that if he gets hot, it could help.  I also don't expect a lot of agreement based on where I posted this, but there's not a bunch of evidence that they were way better this season with him than without him.  Y'all scored fantastically against the Blazers.  But against the Suns everyone says the Nuggets are ""playing uninspired"" and they really need Jamal Murray.  I think it's just frustrating as a Suns fan to beat the Lakers and have a strong edge against the Nuggets and have the media conversation always be like this because it takes some respect away from what the Suns are doing."
"You're looking at this way too linearly. Nobody is saying that Jamal is on AD's level. What people are constantly trying to explain is that the Nuggets would be much more competitive with Murray, not because he would drop 20, 30 or 50 points (although that comes to play as well), but because his ability to create his own offense and his impeccable two-men game with Jokic would create enough spacing for Gordon to cut and dunk or MPJ and Barton to hit open threes.  Would that be enough to beat the Suns? Maybe. Maybe not. These teams played three close games during the regular season which could have gone the other way. But it's almost certain that we wouldn't be seeing three blowout wins.  We need to look past points scored and think in terms of what players bring to the table in the bigger picture."
"If they’re that low I highly doubt it.   Luka, Mitchell, CP3 if he’s still like this, Dame, Ja, Steph, Klay, Jamal Murray, and Conley will all still be around and I think I’d take literally all of them except Conley over who Booker is right now.   I think Ja and Klay are the only debatable ones too. Also very important to clarify that if Booker improves his 3PT shooting, this discussion changes heavily."
Wtf Jamal Murray is most definitely not a superstar
"Assuming you meant ""if"", yeah, that's my point. OP is asking a hypothetical question. I answered based off the impact of losing a player like Jamal Murray, and how much he was ballin in the regular season and bubble. Suns fans swingin at the air, acting like y'all would beat a full power nuggets team. Ain't no way. Look at these games now. It's not like the Nuggets are playing hard and good rn; everyone besides Joker is choking like crazy. If Gordon and MPJ just played to their regular levels, this series would at least be 2-1 right now, and go to 6 games. Add Murray in there and it's probably over in 5-6 and Nuggets in the WCF."
Too good : Denver needed Jamal Murray
This team with Jamal Murray on the court makes a strong case for championship this year. If Jamal puts on another performance like he did in the bubble then they could very well beat this Suns team. Timing is everything.
Well if I made a post about how much Jamal Murray sucks I would have been downvoted into oblivion

this is where Denver really misses Jamal Murray
"Jokic has jamal murray, michael port jr and A gordan. They a finals prospect if they are healthy. They might be a top 2 seed next season"
I think the cutoff is if you are injured for the season halfway through like Jamal Murray or if you start late like a Jaren Jackson.  The 50 percent mark of games played or slightly less but at MVP level like KD is to me a great cutoff.
"Murray being hurt and not having a penetrating point guard destroys his offensive capabilities, when he was back-screening for Jamal, he was a walking bucket. Without a playmaking ball handler that can drive and score his offensive capabilities are limited."
It's a real shame that Jamal Murray is hurt. This would have been a really good series if both teams were 100%
"I mean. The decisiveness of this take is a turn off, but it’s not a bad take necessarily. Playoff Jamal Murray is fucking insane. As a Jazz fan I feel highly qualified to speak on this. He gave the Nuggets like a third of their points during our series against them."
A consistent and non injured Jamal Murray
This was an incomprehensible fever dream. Jokic will be here for awhile. We went to the WCF last year and are down Jamal Murray this post season. We’re not not winning.
like a jamal murray perhaps?
Nuggets are gonna be real scary when Gordon gets a summer of practice and Jamal Murray comes back with a vengeance.
"If they had Jamal Murray, i'd say they could have a chance, i mean this is the Team that came back from 3-1 series twice last year."
if only jamal murray wasnt hurt tho
"I agree, the Nuggets should be more competitive in this series and could have picked up at least 1 win by now. But they are frankly outmatched by this Suns team.  Being injured =/ being hurt. Everyone, especially at this stage of the season, is hurt. Jamal Murray physically can’t play with a torn ACL and Will Barton is taking a legit risk playing the limited minutes he is playing with a strained hamstring. Chris Paul is a beast but the idea that he’s just mentally tougher and that’s how he’s getting through his shoulder contusion is laughable. He’s 90% healthy and was 80% during the Lakers series. Also, it’s the pros man. Everyone wants to win. No one “wants it more” than someone else.  Every team is an injury or two away from having their season drastically change. There’s only 5 guys on the court for one team. Do you not remember the Phoenix vs LA series that just happened? That series changed dramatically depending on if Chris Paul and/or Anthony Davis was playing.   The Suns are truly a fantastic team and I’m rooting for them to win it all after they beat Denver. I grew up being a fan of the Nash and Stoudemire teams. But the way you talk about basketball is baffling. When you say things like Chris Paul has the heart of a champion or the Nuggets don’t have the heart or the Nuggets are soft, you remind me of Skip Bayless in [this](https://youtu.be/xRaO1mN5EEM) video. It’s a just a dumb way to talk about sports."
"Yeah, you could argue Jamal Murray is one of the top 10 NBA playoff players this season just for that"
"They need a good, switchable tweener with size and quickness who can switch and play good team defense, and a dynamic guard who can playmake, space the floor and slot next to jokic. Like Jamal Murray and PJ Dozier, perhaps?"
"Oh man, that is fucking dire.  Sucks that we don't get to see this series with Jamal Murray healthy, it would have been wild."
"Jamal makes a fucking HUGE difference.  Also Dozer not being there hurts like hell. He's an insanely good defensive player &amp; rebounder for his size. Sometimes he will have games where you watch and it looks like he's not playing well on offense or whatever, then you look at the box score and he's a +20.  This also takes pressure off MPJ to be the 2nd guy, and Murray has so much gravity that it will open up way more shots for MPJ.  Our starting backcourt right now is couch guy and a 5'8"" 30 year-old rookie."
"Idk how to feel about all the “he needs help” comments. Are we saying he needs Jamal back or straight up saying he needs help even with Jamal on the court?   Those two are a gotdamn solid foundation when it comes to a “small” market team. They also have MPJ who has shown, while not at a elite star level, can shine out.   Murray getting hurt was a big blow, but to say Jokic needs help is saying this team can’t win in the next 3-5 years even if the ceiling is the roof."
Jamal Murray scoring 30 is a huge help. He isnt playing though.
"Yeah, I mean the reason LeBron was clowning Crowder is because the Lakers were manhandling the Suns about to go up 2-1 behind consecutive 34 point games from AD. The shit all changed when AD got hurt after LeBron was already limited. Just like a big reason why Denver is down 3-0 right now is cause Jamal Murray is out. I'm curious to see how Phoenix does when they finally match up against a team that's actually healthy. It's cool they're beating severely weakened teams due to injuries, but eventually they're gonna have to beat a good team at full strength."
"&gt;But no way it'd be this easy      I agree, 20 point blowouts wouldn't be a regular thing with Jamal Murray out there, for sure.      I'll say Lakers Suns could have been a great series if both teams were healthy"
Did you forget about Jamal Murray?
"Honestly, I don't think we need to do much.  Getting Jamal and PJ back fixes a ton of our issues.  PJ was our best wing defender by far, his presence is sorely missed.  And losing Jamal Murray is absolutely massive, it changes the way defenses can play against us because we have no one else that can consistently create with the ball in their hands, allowing teams to double Jokic much more and jump his passing lanes.  Jokic is still finding shooters out of the double, but they just can't hit their shots in this series, and that has nothing to do with the Suns D, they are just missing wide open shots they have been making all year.    Honestly, I would be fine with the Nuggets straight running it back next year.  If we can get healthy and get the chemisty back we are a legit title threat.  Missing two of our top three guards, while the third is on limited minutes just coming back from missing 20 games just can't be understated.  Instead of our intended starting backcourt we are playing Facu and a dude who was sitting on his couch two months ago."
"I think the NBA screwed over all 4 conference finals teams with the short offseason. Injuries impacted the Heat, Lakers, Celtics, and Nuggets. This Nuggets team with a healthy Jamal Murray could easily go 7 games against the Suns."
"Considering Jamal Murray becomes Michael Jordan against the suns, there's a good chance."
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray is great in that role already. Need MPJ to be the third star within 3 years
"No, you could *possibly* beat the Suns with Jamal Murray. This Phoenix team is for real."
"I mean you clearly haven't watched the nuggets if you think Jamal is our best player. I love Murray to death, and he was a star in the playoffs, but he's inconsistent. He started the year weak and we've won games without him. To say Murray is a better player than the literal league MVP is absurd because the Nuggets do not win a damn thing without Jokic."
MPJ is pretty good at cutting to the basket and Jamal Murray runs P&amp;R super well with Jokic.
Jamal Murray. He has a great secondary star and he was injured.
Jamal Murray avgs 24 5 and 6 on 47/40/90 in 33 playoff games.  Trade him in either starting backcourt guy and it's a completely different series
I'm going to put it like this. If jamal and Barton weren't i justed they would be starting both are great shot creators and Murray is a good distributor this means we can put way more pressure on offense and make them work harder as wright now we have zero isolation scoring. This means Aaron Gordon isnt our second option and can focus more on defensing like he did when we traded for him and due to us having more capable shooters he can do his cuts better as they don't have to pack the paint. I'm still counting Dozier as I juries but this means Morris can lead the bench unit he is quite good at that task and our bench doesn't look complete ass. We are also not playing Campazzo more than 10 minutes so he doesn't get smoked for his size and has more energy to be effective offensively. Because mpj isn't the second option and guarded as tight on defense he has no need to create for himself because he can't dribble and is probably shooting better. Or I'm wrong just saying
Calm down we talkimg about Jamal Murray not LeBron or MJ
Nephew compared Jamal Murray to KD and Kawhi
Idk look at his stats since Jamal Murray has been gone. He turned into an elite scorer overnight. I think he’s going to be in All-Pro very soon.
It would have been a 7 game series. I don’t think you realize how good Jamal Murray has been since last year.   Dude was also insanely clutch
"Pretending that having Jamal in there doesn't change literally everything is a joke.  Have you ever watched a Jokic+Murray Nuggets game?  It doesn't look anything like this.  MPJ gets wide open shots all night when Jokic/Murray get into their two man game.    This Suns team is legit, I am not saying we win.  But the entire series is completely different, including what is asked of everyone else."
"He’s gotten *much* better on defense. He’s gone from being nearly unplayable to being below average. As far as BBIQ goes, I think he’s improved significantly but I never played at a high level so that’s harder for me to comment on. His biggest problem right now is his handle. If he can make a big improvement in that area he might be our second option by playoff time next year even if Murray makes a great recovery. Think about that...playoff Jamal Murray as your third option 😮"
"""Excuse me Mr. Silver, can my good friend Jamal Murray shoot threes in the corner sitting on the bench?"""
Or a Jamal Murray
Getting Jamal Murray back would be a start
Chris Paul really is great  Wish we got to see Denver with Jamal Murray. Jokic is insane
"Can’t imagine how Jamal Murray feels right now, dude must be dying to be out there"
Jamal Murray is hurt bro
&gt;They're doing everything with Conley still on the bench.  People said this about the Nuggets with Jamal Murray against the Trailblazers fwiw.
I mean with no Jamal Murray we kind of all saw this coming
Jamal Murray :(
Maybe he sees SGA as best Canadian player and shows up to prove otherwise?   Now I wonder how is he vs the Nuggets when Jamal Murray (another top Canadian) plays?
They would’ve won if Jamal Murray was healthy
"Jamal Murray did it last year during the playoffs, but was told to stop after he started doing it a little too much..."
Wouldn't win these games if Jamal Murray was helathy.
yeah but did Jamal Murray play?
better than jamal murray too
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"Curry  Dame  Harden  Luka  Trae  Ja  Jrue  CP3  Lowry  SGA  Conley  Lamelo  Lonzo  Dinwiddie  Dejountae Murray  Brogdon  Fox  FVV  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons    That is 20 point guards, and I definitely can't find 5 who I think are worse players than DLo. I'm not sure DLo is better than any of them - at best I think he's about the same as 1-2 of these players."
I am starting to think drafting:  &amp;#x200B;  * OJ Mayo over Westbrook   * Rubio over Curry * Wesley Johnson over Paul George * Derek Williams over Kawhi * Shabazz Muhammad over Giannis * Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray * Jarret Culver over Tyler Herro      was a mistake...
"LOOOL the only reason your team made it out of the first round were injuries. The Suns had one of the luckiest runs to the Finals in modern NBA history. Every single opponent they faced had either their best or second best player injured (or both lol).   LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and Jamal Murray all missed part or the entirety of their series against the Suns. Even with that luck, Phoenix *still* couldn’t win the championship."
Kind of funny how they only follow 1 person and it's Jamal Murray
"And he even has another level with Jamal Murray. The two have crazy good chemistry, they create space for each other all over."
"Yeah I just disagree with the notion that you have to win a ring to be considered the best player in the league regardless of how good your actual team is, and without jamal murray the nuggets roster is below average on its best day. Either way Jokic has a really respectable playoff numbers and success given his age, and has had some elite playoff series that rival any player in the top 5."
"That was so long ago and Lonzo isn't even on the team anymore. I doubt anyone even cares on the Laker side, hell if you search Jamal Murray in r/lakers there's been no post made about him."
"I don't know any Laker fan that hates Jamal Murray, but sure farm that karma by mentioning the Lakers."
"&gt;2) They only follow one person: Jamal Murray   This is the best part imo, its low key kinda sweet"
"Yeah Ayo absolutely has the *it factor* that guys like Morant have that makes them so terrifying. Guy plays with absolute reckless abandon and 0 timidity. Taking and making huge shots like he’s not even a rookie. If he can get his fundamentals up, I could see him being a genuine terror in this league for years to come. I see his ceiling as a Jamal Murray type guy"
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
&gt;	2) They only follow one person: Jamal Murray  I don’t know why but this specific detail is sending me
Lebron in Cleveland is a bit drastic. Lebrons second best player was Mo Williams. Jamal Murray is head and shoulders better than that
"If you reduce it to a single game, Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray scoring 50 points against each other in a playoff game was also historic."
It's be a shame if someone did this to Jamal Murray.
"Hmmm I personally wouldn’t but that’s me, I’ve just been taking people who are productive right now. I have friends that took gambles on Kyrie, Kawhi, Jamal Murray and Ben Simmons lmao so you wouldn’t be alone taking a risk"
Logic agrees but Jamal Murray + 4 firsts is what Emperor S'Morey needs
"If a Jamal Murray level guard was available, Ben would already be gone"
"Clippers, Warriors and Nuggets all have Kawhi, Klay and Jamal Murray who could change the potential of post season run if they come back healthy this year. All such wildcards"
"&gt; ""turns out the final piece we needed was to get rid of that guy...""   Which is why Moreys stance has been so frustrating. They don't need another superstar, a Jamal Murray level guard is all that's really needed plus role players and Embiid can carry so easily. Wish he had more faith in him."
"So, is Klay Thompson or Jamal Murray on the ballot as well? How is this dude being there more controversial than Klay or Jamal?"
Yeah Jamal Murray played terribly after he got the max. Then he found his way again and proved the front office right in the bubble. Guys go through slumps and it’s fair to feel more pressure after being handed a huge amount of money. Hopefully he just needs to find his confidence and he’ll live up to expectations. The season is still young.
"Might be a slump, might be back injury bothering him, maybe his drop foot got worse?  When he missed that transition layup the other day, it seemed due to inability to even get slight lift off his drop foot.  Regardless, he could be the Nuggets equivalent of KP with that new contract.  Gotta hope Jamal Murray returns in strong fashion, but Nuggets might be in a bit of a bind long term.  I get they did the extension to keep him and his agent happy, but he is now under contract for six years on the Nuggets and his struggles will both hurt the Nuggets on the court and with being able to afford their team."
"Jokic has his Robin, Jamal Murray"
If Jamal didn’t go down I would have the nuggets winning this year... if Murray was there you would have a great top 2 with a good surrounding cast for sure
"Nah, Hawks didn't have Jamal Murray so this is a fake W"
Yeah but if the Hawks had Jamal Murray healthy then we wouldn’t have won.
This is your most cursed post since you put the Crying Jordan meme into the Jamal Murray video
It would be Jamal Murray not mpj
Conley/Mitchell were coming off of injuries in the playoffs too. Neither team was actually healthy.  The 'Big Boys' all have serious injury-concerns atm as well.  We haven't seen what healthy Klay looks like. We don't know how Murray/Kawhi are going to look coming back yet. I'm guessing Klay/Jamal will look pretty good but we have to see.
Get this man Jamal Murray back asapp
"Why does this feel like a Jamal Murray move?   He could leave the shadow of Jokic, get paid all the big bucks, let Dort play defense, average 35 and have a stream of talent coming in via drafts or materializing into vets via trades."
"&gt; His game is more consistent and reliable with less variance than the other stars you name  That is simply not true.  The numbers do not bear that out in the slightest.  Tatum, Butler, Gobert, Booker, and Brown all have MUCH larger sample sizes of performing at a consistent all-star or all-NBA level.    SGA has about 30 games of being a very efficient guard at about 25/6/6 levels and, outside of that and including all of this season, has simply been a good, not particularly efficient scorer with solid playmaking skills on a very bad team with average defense at best.  Not that different from De'aaron Fox, who honestly has a good argument to be ranked above SGA as well.  SGA doesn't belong in the conversation with Butler, Tatum, Beal, etc.  He belongs in the conversation with De'aaron Fox and Jamal Murray and whatnot.  Just a different tier, and not top 15."
"&gt; No, man. You just brush off all of the issues Jamal had as a player. He couldn't string together 3 games of solid play, idgaf who was scouting him or what he was doing behind the scenes. His inconsistency went way beyond the domain of just being a young player.  It was not beyond the domain or just being a young player. Since box scores are the only thing that is connecting with you then here:  In his 2nd year and 1st as a starter, the 20 year old Jamal Murray had 27 games of 20 or more, including 7 over 30 5 of those over 58%, 3 over 60%, 2 over 70%. Of all the games he had under 10 points the majority of them were in wins. He had more games over 16 points than under 16 point.  In his 3rd year he had 29 games of over 20 or more, including 7 over 30 and 2 over 40 (48 and 46) which were both over 60% from the floor and misses 7 1/2 games to injury. OBPM goes up, BPM goes up just like it did the year before. TRB% goes up, AST% goes up, TOV% goes down while USG% goes up.  As a 21 year old, and I cannot stress this enough a 21 year old in his first playoffs he averages 21/4/5/1. Massively weight down by one very poor game. He has more games over 23 points than under and has two 34 point games to boot. Is also a + in two of the Nuggets losses and has the highest TS% among all non-bigs on the Nuggets, and a higher TS% than CJ and Dame.  His efficiency scoring went down in the regular season a bit but he was also given much more responsibility and allowed to take more shots. Generally speaking the efficiency goes down when that happens until a player is able to get used to it. If they are able to. Obviously they felt strongly that he would.  He did this on a playoff team that was winning games. A successful team. One where he wasn't the main option every night or could decide his fate all the time. That means it wasn't the situation where a player is putting up empty stats on a bad team (Sexton) and on paper looks much better than they are. Inconsistency aside he was playing winning basketball, had winning effort, and on top of that had made it clear that if he has a bad game in the first 3 quarters he comes out in the 4th ready to kill. He proved this many, many times.  That is a 100% of the time maxed player by the team they are playing for. A super young guy who can struggle for an entire game but then tap in and become a closer in the 4th, and seeks that, is significantly more intriguing and interesting for teams than someone who comes out and gives you 14-18 a night reliably in the system--i.e. Mikal Bridges. There is no question that Jamal had consistency issues, he would go for 20+ 4 games in a row and then come out with a 14 pointer and a 15 pointer the next two. But what he wasn't was mentally inconsistent. He was checked in and wanted the moments, even if he was missing shots. This wasn't a situation where he was fading away or getting in his head and avoiding the  responsibility. That is massive and overweighs a 15-25 point rollercoaster ride given his age.  Before he turned 22 years old Murray had shown improvement every single year. Clear, visual, in game, improvement. Added and refined skills. Was becoming extremely good in the PnR with Jokic, so much so that even at that age with this up and coming team he and Jokic LEAD THE LEAGUE IN ASSISTS BETWEEN TWO TEAMMATES and were considered a deadly late game system by themselves. He showed it in the regular season and showed it as the #2 guy in his first playoffs, again, as a 21 year old.   Sexton is 23 years old right now, has been putting up empty stats on a perennially bad team as -the- guy with the system built to help him succeed, and taking pretty much as many shots as he wants. Shoot Murray even if his scoring was off could turn into the offensive facilitator and would actively go for rebounds. He more than doubles Sexton in each category by the time he turned 21. He also proved he knew how to play off ball as a cutter or shooter, and was very good at keeping the ball secure and not having turnovers or getting into situations that could force a turnover. These are extremely valuable things that aren't going to show up on the box score. That is extremely uncommon maturity and poise for a 21 year old.  His weaknesses were inconsistency with scoring (as a 19, 20, 21 year old on a competitive team I will provide you with countless examples of inconsistency at that age including players like Carmelo and LeBron) and defense. Unless you come into the league as a defensive player, and a very good one like Davion Mitchell or GP2, NBA defense takes a while to get used to and learn. Not just whatever scheme you're playing as a team that you have likely never played in, but the size and speed of grown ass men with years of NBA training and the significantly heightened skill level of scorers. People doing things you've never had to guard before. Every young player gets slack on learning defense when they come in, because 99% of them need 2-3+ years to become a tolerable defender for a playoff caliber team. If not more.   Seriously. You have a 21 year old who has proven to you he can string together 20 point games since he was 19. He can have back to back 30 point game sin the playoffs. He has a fantastic mechanics/footwork for someone his age, and a shot form that will translate to better and better shooting as he himself gets better. He's already adept at being the main ball handler, an extraordinarily good PnR guard who can score from all 3 levels out of it (there are some all-stars who struggle with this in their late 20s!), can confidently play off ball as a spot up shooter or slasher and make the right offensive reads to facilitate success (being a good look), who is an extremely hard worker, improves his level of play in bigger or higher leverage situations, and does not shy away from it.   All of that is far, far, far, far greater than the negatives of inconsistent shooting and poor defense. Those are the reasons that Tim Connelly and Coach Malone never once considered trading him, said he was off limits since year 2, believed in him and gave him more and more responsibility despite having a budding superstar in Jokic who could be option 1 and 2, constantly and publicly praised him while also treating him with the responsibility level of a vet after year 2, and signed him to that max extension.   As any single team with a brain would have done. It is an absolute no doubt decision for all 30 teams. He is a special player and it was clear to see what was in there half way through year 2.   &gt; Was the Sixers front office full of donkeys when they gave Simmons the max?  By the time Philly signed Ben Simmons to his max he had been the Rookie of the Year, an All-Star twice, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Defensive 1st team, lead the league in steals, was a pivotal member of a team 1 game away from the finals, and was cruising to 16/8/8/2 a night on high 50s from the floor. He had all the tools and wherewithal to be an incredible slashing threat too if Philly had a better passer. There is no team at any point in the history of basketball who wouldn't have maxed him. His issue is entirely mental, and sad, and there was no predicting that.  &gt;  Was the Knicks front office full of redditors when they gave Porzingis the max?  Are we talking about the Kristaps who put up 23/7 with 2.5 blocks a night while being 7'3"" and shooting 40% from 3 and made the All-Star game? The guy who had made a massive jump each year in the league and was playing incredible before completely blowing apart his leg? If you're asking me if it was unwise for a team to max a 22 year old 7'3"" unicorn who could fly for huge dunks, shoot 3s better than many guards, and protect the paint and rim at an elite level I'd ask if you're joking. That's a no brainer. Now the issue if there was one is that it is a direct gamble to give a contract to any big man coming off an injury like that. Especially one as athleticism reliant as Porzingis. Regardless all 30 teams if they are in that position are giving him the max, you have to assume he comes back near that and if that's as good as he gets  for his career he's a better Brook Lopez and gets maxed into his 30s.  &gt; They were better players than Jamal as well.  Which is why they were no doubt decisions. Zero doubt. Zero hesitation. Zero questioning of the decision from those teams. Then both of those contracts presently look iffy because of completely uncontrollable circumstances. You can't guess if a player explodes his leg, and you can't guess if a player runs into one of the worst mental blocks in the history of the sport out of nowhere. That has zero to do with the front office's decision making.  &gt;  For every player who pans out and ends up being worth it there's a player that ends up overpaid.   Here are the players on a rookie max currently: Ben Simmons, SGA, Trae, MPJ, Fox, Mitchell, Bam, Tatum, KAT, Booker, Murray, Wiggins, Embiid, Siakam. The only questionable signing in this whole bunch is Siakam. When Wiggins was maxed that was as much Minnesota not being able to afford any semblance of a good player leaving them. Otherwise which of these players do you think isn't gonna be worth the contract? You implied 50% of them and considering all of them except for 8 games of MPJ and Siakam have been worth it, who is going to have a massive regression out of nowhere?  &gt;  Waiting a year doesn't cost them, simply.   Yes it does. This isn't 2K. The human element plays a massive part in this. Waiting a year tells a player ""eh, we dunno if we believe in you yet. let's see another year"", while all of their peers in the same situation are getting maxed. It also opens up really dumb FA possibilities which teams do not want to deal with even removing the fact they are burning part of the bridge with what could be a cornerstone player + their team."
"I can't keep going back and forth with you. It is so very apparent that you can only assess players by box scores and basketball reference stuff. That's not how actual real world evaluation works. You are completely and totally on your own with this evaluation because you can't or won't assess anything except for box scores with players.   Everthing is a gamble. The Lakers trading very good players for Kobe Bryant who never played a game outside of high school was  gamble. The Wolves taking KG 1st overall out of high school when he didn't play in a huge bball talent pool is a gamble. Philly taking Embiid despite him only playing basketball for like 4 or 5 years and having a foot issue already is a gamble.   They are all calculated risks, calculated risks are gambles. But they aren't blind shots in the dark.   Once again, there is a reason why every front office would have given Jamal the contract he got to keep him and was a no brainer for the Nuggets, and why Sexton will absolutely not be getting it.   There's a reason that despite Mikal Bridges averaging 14/4/2/1/1 on 54/43/84 as a 24 year old got him 100m instead of the 180m super max. Those numbers are insane if scaled up even a little tiny bit, so why didn't he get a max?   Because you have to watch him play to actually understand that. Just like you have to watch Sexton playing to understand he isn't actually a better offensive player than Jamal Murray at all, and doesn't have near the ceiling. You have to watch the games. You have to watch the players playing. Rudy Gobert scores 16 points on 65% from the floor. He is nowhere near the scorer nor does he have the potential as Evan Mobley -right now- who is scoring 13 on 49%.   All stats aren't equal and it is painfully obvious you didn't watch Jamal Murray carefully enough and you may have not watched a single Sexton game ever.   By all means keep telling saying that the best evaluation and talent growing front office of the past 5 years, who work to make the proper basketball and financial decisions for a multi-billion dollar corporation, were wrong to give Jamal the max. Clearly they didn't know what they were doing and somehow they just lucked into Jamal becoming exactly what the coach and front office said about him being able to become since his second year in the league.   That massive 9 figure, franchise changing, decision made by the people who have proven to make those decisions the best was a silly unnecessary gamble that they made stupidly. They couldn't have possible seen Jamal's progression coming, or had any idea what his time behind the scenes was showing them. With the trainers, with the coaches, in practices, on his own.  No, it is you, redditor, who knows how to evaluate talent and assign potential and a dollar value on it better than the people who have a career doing it. Not the people who are around this person every day to understand his personality and work ethic. Who are watching him in practices, in the gym, in games, concentrating on him with the knowledge that can only come from being a career long basketball player, coach, scout, executive.   No, they didn't make this decision accounting for everything you're looking at on basketball reference, everything they saw in games, and the metric ton of things they see that you can't see not to mention wouldn't be able to see.   It's you, basketball fan, who understands what's an unnecessary risk and gamble. Not these people who have spent their entire life around basketball in order to have a literal career doing that very thing; and the fact that they were completely correct in their decision, oh, it can only be a fluke. It couldn't possibly be that your ability to assess players is faulty and lacking. It's definitely the entire team of professionals, ex-players, and coaches who were wrong.  Incredible."
Jamal Murray and KD's hair (or CJ's beard)
Nikola jokic and jamal murray?
"&gt;What? I don't think there's any way you're a consistent Nuggets watcher if you think that's hyperbole--and referencing his uptick in assists via the box score is a horrendous way to make your point. The kinds of passes he has added, the areas in which he is able to thread things, the ease of his reads, are so much better than they were prior. He hasn't had trouble getting Jokic the ball in the post for 2 years.  He still has trouble getting the ball to Jokic in the post, though he is much better at it. I don't see why it's relevant that he's better now. He's clearly worth the max now which isn't my point.   &gt;You're telling me that in his first playoff series ever Jamal struggled somewhat to guard an very athletic and Derrick White who had at least 15 points on him at that point? I mean. Shocker. Derrick White is a good player and played his best basketball in that series.   He didn't struggle somewhat, he simply struggled. Also don't act like it's normal for anyone to struggle while guarding Derrick White. He's an average player at best. If you're gonna undermine all of Jamal's weaknesses while enhancing his strengths there's no point in having a discussion.   &gt;What about Jamal playing much better defense against Damian Lillard the series after that?  You can't seriously tell me I don't watch the Nuggets and come out and say this. He didn't even guard Lillard.   &gt;Sexton is a 6'1"" guard who can solely score and doesn't do it efficiently  He is 6'1"" but that's an ok size for a point guard. His wingspan is same as Jamal's. He's also more efficient than Jamal was at that point and much more consistent.   &gt;furthermore his shot doesn't look particularly good, it really isn't very good,   Again, he's more efficient than Jamal and has shot around 40% from 3 every year. Again better than Jamal at the same point of his career.   &gt;and so you have a tiny slashing guard who can't score, can't facilitate, and doesn't play defense.  He scored 24 points on 55 ts% last year. Jamal in his 3rd year scored 18 on 54 ts% with much less consistency as well. I think Sexton had clearly shown both a higher scoring potential and floor than Jamal. Jamal's passing was better but not by much. Sexton is one of the worst in the league. Jamal was still below average though , there's a reason a shit ton of Nuggets fans were doubting if playing him at 2 would be better for the team. Jamal clearly had much more potential there than Sexton.   &gt;Unlike Murray who showed he had the size and physical tools to at least be a good team defender (and is now one of the better PoA defenders in the league at his position) Sexton has consistently ranked at the very bottom of multiple defensive metrics. Dead last in DRAYMOND in his second season and second worse in DRPM behind Trae Young. On top of that he was near the bottom of the league in net rating and turnover% as well.  &gt;Some of this has to do with how bad the Cavs were on defense, but the Nuggets weren't a whole lot better at times. Especially during the seasons when Jokic was genuinely not a good defender.  Sexton is a bad defender but so was Jamal. Defensive stats are also garbage so there's no telling how much better Jamal was on defense than Sexton now.   To sum it up. Sexton is a much better scorer, much more consistent, proven by all the stats. Jamal was the better passer defender and had slightly better physical attributes. Neither should have gotten the max, both had glaring weaknesses. Again, you're making Sexton's sound like the end of the world. At the same time you're making Jamal's sound like small inconveniences on the road to greatness. Which for me they weren't.   &gt;I don't care about what people are upvoting and I'm talking to you about the things you did say. Also, the opinion of the majority was right. The opinion of the front office was right. For some reason you are more interested in proving that you weren't wrong than you are admitting that the Nuggets knew what they were doing when they decided to take the calculated risk of maxing a young player, as a max rookie RFA is always a risk of some sort.  You say they took a calculated risk, I say they took a gamble. An unnecessary one. The scenario where Jamal doesn't improve at all was just as likely, everything else are fairy tales. Waiting another year to max him carries much more benefits than consequence. Getting a better look at a player is much more worth than ""he may get annoyed and won't re-sign in 5 years"".   If he doesn't improve you're gonna be able to retain him even 5 years down the road cos he won't be commanding a max. And in case he really doesn't want to re-sign 5 years down the road, replacing an 18/4/5 guy isn't too hard"
"Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic"
"Claims his account was hacked. Is this for real hacked, or ""Jamal Murray getting a blowjob"" hacked?"
I remember Jamal Murray had to unlike one because people took it seriously but he thought it was funny and had just liked it for shits and giggles.
He’s had better teams than luka. Imagine if you gave luka a Jamal murray level player
"&gt; No it's not. Sexton just posted better numbers and they didn't want to give him 100mil. It wasn't shocking that he was inconsistent, it was shocking how inconsistent he was and it was shocking that he hadn't improved on it since coming to the league.  Because looking at numbers isn't a good way to tell if a player is worth giving a max contract to or not. It is so much more nuanced and complicated and in depth than looking at someone's bball ref page.   &gt; His playmaking improved a bit, huge is a hyperbole and you know it. He upped his assists by 1.4 and still struggled to get the ball to Jokic in the post. As for his so called defensive improvement i would suggest you take a look at him attempting to guard Derrick fucking White in the playoffs.  What? I don't think there's any way you're a consistent Nuggets watcher if you think that's hyperbole--and referencing his uptick in assists via the box score is a horrendous way to make your point. The kinds of passes he has added, the areas in which he is able to thread things, the ease of his reads, are so much better than they were prior. He hasn't had trouble getting Jokic the ball in the post for 2 years.   You're telling me that in his first playoff series ever Jamal struggled somewhat to guard an very athletic and Derrick White who had at least 15 points on him at that point? I mean. Shocker. Derrick White is a good player and played his best basketball in that series. What about Jamal playing much better defense against Damian Lillard the series after that?   &gt; His growth wasn't linear. Going from year 2 to year 3, he improved his passing and his efficiency went down. Meanwhile every 5 games or so he would tweak something, or roll an ankle etc. And since i already used Sexton as an example-Sexton had 48 games where he scored 20+, Jamal had 28 in a longer season. His inconsistency was insane.  Growth isn't linear. But Jamal's growth has been about as linear as it gets. Inconsistency is one of the least worrisome things in a player when they show that they work hard and have that All-Star caliber play inside of them. Young players always get more consistent unless they truly bust. They knew he would and he has.  &gt; Everyone on here is upvoting this when i literally didn't say it. The opinion of the majority isn't always right.  I don't care about what people are upvoting and I'm talking to you about the things you did say. Also, the opinion of the majority was right. The opinion of the front office was right. For some reason you are more interested in proving that you weren't wrong than you are admitting that the Nuggets knew what they were doing when they decided to take the calculated risk of maxing a young player, as a max rookie RFA is always a risk of some sort.  &gt; Would you give Sexton the max though?  No.   Sexton is a 6'1"" guard who can solely score and doesn't do it efficiently -- furthermore his shot doesn't look particularly good, it really isn't very good, and so you have a tiny slashing guard who can't score, can't facilitate, and doesn't play defense.   That's also the archetype of a player who doesn't fit in very well with teams, can't play off-ball like Murray can and hasn't shown the ability to not be a black hole on offense.   Unlike Murray who showed he had the size and physical tools to at least be a good team defender (and is now one of the better PoA defenders in the league at his position) Sexton has consistently ranked at the very bottom of multiple defensive metrics. Dead last in DRAYMOND in his second season and second worse in DRPM behind Trae Young. On top of that he was near the bottom of the league in net rating and turnover% as well.   Some of this has to do with how bad the Cavs were on defense, but the Nuggets weren't a whole lot better at times. Especially during the seasons when Jokic was genuinely not a good defender.   The things teams look for as far as upside, tells of potential growth and future value, ways that a player can succeed in the NBA on ball, off ball, man defender, help defender, are not there for Sexton in the way they are for Murray, or SGA, or even MPJ to a lesser extent.   The offensive ones aren't anywhere near good enough to make up for the defensive issues like in the case for Trae Young who will likely rate as the worst defender at his position for the rest of his career.   The defensive ones are no good either and the physical tools aren't something you can suggest future success either.  So no, Sexton doesn't get a max. He is a great example of the antithesis of Jamal Murray however in how teams properly evaluate players."
I agree but I also don’t see our Nuggs killing it without Murray.  We’ve got great pieces and the mvp but without jamal we’re 4 seed at best.  Likely 5 or 6 seed.  Hope I’m wrong.
Jamal Murray + picks or like a really good player on their rookie contract + lots of picks
"&gt;You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract.   No it's not. Sexton just posted better numbers and they didn't want to give him 100mil. It wasn't shocking that he was inconsistent, it was shocking how inconsistent he was and it was shocking that he hadn't improved on it since coming to the league.  &gt;Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up.  His playmaking improved a bit, huge is a hyperbole and you know it. He upped his assists by 1.4 and still struggled to get the ball to Jokic in the post. As for his so called defensive improvement i would suggest you take a look at him attempting to guard Derrick fucking White in the playoffs.  &gt;There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.  His growth wasn't linear. Going from year 2 to year 3, he improved his passing and his efficiency went down. Meanwhile every 5 games or so he would tweak something, or roll an ankle etc. And since i already used Sexton as an example-Sexton had 48 games where he scored 20+, Jamal had 28 in a longer season. His inconsistency was insane.    &gt;Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.  Everyone on here is upvoting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ql7zfd/comment/hj1pk64/) when i literally didn't say it. The opinion of the majority isn't always right.  Would you give Sexton the max though?"
Which team was willing to beat the Brooklyn offer?   None… we couldn’t even get Jamal Murray from the nuggets
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
PG carried Clips to the western finals without Kawhi. JoBum got swept without Murray of Jamal
"Jokic has become sneaky good on defense. The MVP getting better is scary for the league. When Murray returns, they will be a serious threat. Hopefully Jamal can ball out."
Meanwhile some moron is telling me Jokic is being carried by Jamal Murray lol
Just a reminder that it took like 5 NBA games for Jamal Murray to finally hit a jumpshot
"man desperately needs jamal murray back, but who knows how consistent he will even be when he returns.. he was pretty inconsistent before the injury even/excluding the bubble"
Meh. Just miss Jamal Murray
I feel like once they get Jamal Murray back they'll be real championship contenders. Jamal's ACL rehab looks like it's going very well so far
"Not as easy as it seems. He needs to study Trae Young, James Harden, Jamal Murray, and of course Steph."
Tatum to Denver for Jamal Murray.
"Yeah looking at the market it seems like a lot of teams _could_ try to offer their young dynamic stars, like the Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell, but I'm not sure why they'd do that and not just roll with their guys who are 5+ years younger.   My hot take is that Boston should 100% offer Brown for him though. They need to diversify the talent on their roster."
"I'm a different guy from the one who said the Jazz have a ""terrible construction.""  I think the Jazz have a very good roster construction, but that there's a clear weak spot that the Jazz have not yet been able to solve. You don't play effectively against great teams like the Bucks, who run through a wing/forward, nor do you beat the Clippers with Kawhi twice, unless you have one of the best rosters in the league. You just also don't surrender two 50 point games in the same series to Jamal Murray, or 39 points to Terance Mann, or three 20 point games from Reggie Jackson, unless you have a weak point."
"I think it’s less that the cavs don’t want to keep him at all, and more that they don’t want him at max Jamal Murray money"
mavs 2nd best player is kristaps and he misses huge stretches of the season  jamal murray played 48 games last season KP played 43  jokic played great he's not a bad pick or anything I just think luka did an unreal carry job with this roster last year
How can he be THE player when Jamal Murray is the only player in NBA history?
"Honestly the Nuggets just have picture perfect roster construction that they don't get nearly enough credit for. Jokic and Murray have the deadliest 2 man game and the deadliest P&amp;R game in the league, and Jamal Murray has proven to be an elite playoff scorer time and time again. And yet they've remained at the top of the conference despite the loss of half of that duo. Any other team would be dead if they lost half of their superstar duo, but they stay around"
Yeah if you give Jokic Jamal Murray and MPJ he also does the same. But Jamal is injured and MPJ is MIA.
"Cmon man. If you give Lebron Jamal Murray, Aaron gordon, MPJ and the rest of that roster, it’s a guaranteed finals trip at the least. Jokic can pile the stats but he needs to win when it matters most for discussions like best player"
"Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, Jusuf Nurkic, Malik Beasley."
Celtics fan so James young. Figured his ceiling out of Kentucky and the amount of good 2 guard scorers they had was Jamal Murray-ish. Couldn’t figure it out
"As do many other teams though - luck always is a part of it. Like last year, the Bucks were lucky that KD's feet are big. The Suns were lucky to face the Lakers with LeBron halfway to broken and AD broken after 3 games, followed by the Nuggets with Barton coming back a bit too soon off a pulled hammy + no Jamal Murray, followed by the Clips with no Kawhi.   So the Clips would need luck of some stripe to reach the Finals, indeed. I would not pick the Clips (even healthy) over the Nuggets though, for instance, if the Nuggets are healthy and they were to meet at any point in the playoffs. Bledsoe can't shoot, and the Clips literally still don't have an answer for Jokic. Simple as that.   But honestly I don't think it will come to that. The Clips without Kawhi for (lets be charitable to him / optimistic he gets back sooner than one would expect) 80% of the season probably don't win enough games to be more than a play-in team. We've seen Kawhi go slow in his rehab though in the past. There's no reason to think he'll push himself hard to play in the regular season and if he doesnt I just think they'll miss the playoffs, if not by a lot. He's locked into his contract for years to come anyway, no reason to risk it."
"yeah this beatdown tonight should be franchise-changing.   your roster just does not look competitive with the nuggets, with no jamal murray, who are a western conference playoff team that you presumably have to be able to beat in order to win championships  need a trade badly, urgently.   get size, get centers, get anyone, sign someone out of the G-league, just do something  the options are that or tank which is really not optimal after signing luka to a megamax, and he probably wont let you properly tank anyway because he's so good"
Hot take: when Jamal Murray comes back the Nuggets will be the best team in the NBA.
"LBJ+AD+Rus thats why.  suns wouldn't had made it to finals if jamal murray was healthly imo. they exceeded expectations,  regressing to the mean."
"Lakers series: AD goes down , LeBron playing injured.  Nuggets series: No Jamal Murray for the Nuggets.  Clippers series: Kawhi gets injured, after playing some of the best playoff basketball in history.  The Suns got super lucky AF."
Dwight played more and better than Haslem.  You can pick any number of players though. Jamal Murray was at the pool. He's in D Mitchell's videos.
"Yeah. Guys like Jamal Murray were outstanding in the bubble and we saw him hanging out at the pool. The difference between the Heat making it further than the Nuggets was just conferences, not toughness."
Jamal Murray has found a way to become even more hot and cold than he was last year it’s not like he’s trying to average more than 20 points over an entire season for the first time ever I think the real embodiment of it all is the spin around jumper he took instead of the layup late into the fourth quarter
"...no, it's really 2.  With that logic you could say any guy 10-30ish is a top 10 player.  That doesn't make any sense.  Jamal Murray has the ability to play like a top 10 player for a whole playoff series, but that doesn't make him a top 10 player.  Also Kyrie simply misses way too much time and causes way too many issues for me to rank him in the top 10.  You rank players on their abilities and bodies of work and whatnot, and Kyrie is not at all a top 10 player in the NBA.  You're right, he *can* play to that level, but that goes for plenty of teams and players."
"Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, 2 1st rounders and 2 pick swaps for Beal would be I think a great deal for us."
"Jamal Murray. His offensive inconsistency is driving me nuts...every year this inconsistency happens only to him, for me he will never get to any kind of All-Star level. Maybe he needs more ball in his hands but for now he is not worthy of keeping just because he is showing from time to time that he is inconsistent. On the other note I’m hoping that playoff showing from last year will happen again this year."
"See I don’t get the inconsistency, y’all call a player soft for leaving the game due to injury but than be shocked when Jamal Murray is playing through an injury (fucking up his game might I add) like pick a struggle, and tbh he didn’t even get injured he just got elbowed I’m pretty sure he’ll be fine"
Jamal Murray at 20 is so dumb
One thing I know for sure is that Jamal Murray isn't a top 20 player in this league.
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray can't be a top 20 player
"He’s still an athletic freak and a 6’10 PG with great passing, court vision, ball handling, defense, and rebounding. The other guys at the top of his draft class were Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Dragan Bender, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, Kris Dunn, etc.     Even now how many of those guys would you take over Simmons? And keep in mind Simmons went straight to averaging 16-8-8 in his rookie year."
"Murray and change. He has more value than Jamal.   But it would be kind of silly to break up that pick and roll chemistry.   Ben would solve a lot of your defensive issues, though."
"Don’t know if you’re being sarcastic but Melo demanded a trade from the Nuggets to get to the Knicks instead of waiting to sign with the Knicks in free agency. He did this because he didn’t want the financial limitations of a FA contract. In return, the Knicks had to mortgage their future for him and that’s the reason why they never had the assets to become true contenders with Melo. So basically Melo wanted more money so he forced a trade that broke the Knick’s bank. Jamal Murray was drafted using one of the picks the Nuggets took off the Knicks.   I still love Melo because he’s a legend here in NY, but he did the Knicks dirty lol. I don’t blame him, he was young and dumb and didn’t fully understand the implications of his actions. He just knew that if he signed in free agency, he’d have to take less money. Most guys were taught never to leave money on the table."
All of them are better than Jamal Murray
The head: Jamal Murray
I also can’t imagine Jamal Murray and MPJ tbh
Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray isn't better than Simmons. Unless Murray plays like bubble murray pretty consistently, Simmons will be the better player."
"Oh my wolves took Justin Patton when we had Kat,Taj and Gorgi Deing all three long term contracts all over Collins. Also took Khris Dunn over Jamal Murray, never make thibs your POBO"
"Simmons is the better player overall but his skill set makes him a weird and uncomfortable fit, whereas Jamal Murray can be plugged into any lineup and you don't have to painstakingly construct a roster around him to mask his deficiencies. I'm highly skeptical of any Simmons-led team making a deep playoff run because a competent coach and defense can exploit his lack of shooting."
Jamal Murray for obvious reasons
Surprise no one mentioned Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, and picks"

I don't even want to think about Jamal Murray shooting against the Jazz last year in the playoffs...
Jamal Murray made it last the entire bubble lol
Honestly anyone who got overhyped in the bubble. Like Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray are not the future of the NBA bro
"The amount of hype he got going into college and the draft was like LeBron level. It’s not weird that he didn’t live up to that, few players do. I think what feeds into the Simmons hate is the fact that other guys were taken after him (both in that draft and in subsequent drafts) who have added to their games offensively and become 20+ ppg scorers while Simmons has appeared relatively stagnant to casual watchers. Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, Trae Young, Ja Morant, the list goes on. Would I rather have any of those guys? Maybe some of them. It’s probably too early to tell, but if Simmons gets traded away, the Sixers will be quantitatively worse in a lot of ways and people will see his true value."
"Yeah but I also have: Jimmy, Nurkic, Seth Curry, MPJ, Covington, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and so on. It’s a struggle to find GP and/or players not shitting the bed every week so far."
I mean then he got a foul called on Jamal Murray to do a 4 point play by kicking his leg out 🙄
The playoffs where he lost to Jokic’s unprecedented passing ability and Jamal Murray?
Kelly Oubre:  2-6 from 3   Jamal Murray:  1-5 from 3
Jamal Murray is cold
Jamal Murray regressed so much. Looks like he was a product of the bubble.
"Sounds like a sound strategy, a list of UK players who have flashed or are showing flashes of being great in the past 5 years.  Kentucky|| :--|:--|:-- Year|Player 2020|Tyrese Maxey 2019|PJ Washington 2019|Tyler Herro 2019|Keldon Johnson 2018|Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 2018|Hamidou Diallo 2017|De'Aaron Fox 2017|Bam Adebayo 2016|Jamal Murray 2015|Karl-Anthony Towns 2015|Devin Booker"
I don't like when Draymond and Jamal Murray are both playing at the same time because then I have to remember that I've seen 20% of all the dicks currently on the floor
"Where is Bol Bol? I’m not watching this game for scrubs like Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, and Steph Curry!"
What about Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray? Blake Griffin? Chris Paul? There are a lot of guys making the max who clearly don't/didn't want to be traded.
"See: _the entire 2016 draft class_  Nearly every single prospect from that class was looking like boiled ass their rookie years. Like, they were all _horrendous_.  From the lottery, not a single one of Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, or Domantas Sabonis managed to break past averaging 10 ppg their rookie years, without much positives to show besides maybe the very occasional ""oh look at this huge game/huge play he just had! See, he has potential!"" game."
I’ve never heard Jamal Murray talk before and I did not expect that voice
I'm pretty sure if Denver wants to win more games Jokic is probably not averaging a triple double. Jamal Murray is averaging less than 4 assists right now.
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
"I really like the nuggets. I have family in denver and it's a cool city. Plus I'm a big fan of my fellow Canadian, jamal murray.   As an arsenal fan, I do hate stan kroenke, however."
"we wont see guys like Jamal Murray drop multiple 50 pt games in the playoffs, which automatically makes it more legit than last year..."
"It's like people don't understand the concept of averages. The bubble made it so much worse. Basically your bubble high was treated as your average. National TV analysts calling Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray ""MVP candidates next season."" Because they had crazy high scoring bubble playoff games against each other. Jokic has a great playoff run and all of a sudden that's just who he is. 35/15/15 guy.   I'm a Sixers fan. I know Embiid can drop 40. I also know the difference between being able to drop 40 and being a 24-27 ppg guy, which is what he is."
"I love how everyone gets compared to Simmons. ""Is lamelo better than Simmons."" ""Is Jamal Murray better than Simmons."" ""Is trae better than Simmons."" Simmons has a completely different play style than all of those guys. Stop comparing them lol"
Jamal Murray. Recency bias of course.
Jamal Murray
"Luka, Steph, Dame, Booker, CP3, Mitchell are all above him. Then you still got guys like John Wall and Jamal Murray. Ja and Shai knocking on that door too. Don’t think CJ will make it."
Y'all acting like the Lakers didn't go through Jamal Murray Nikola Jokic James Harden Russel Westbrook Dame And Cj😂 again fuck outta here  Edit: major props to jimmy butler
Damn so what you are saying is they were not a deep team? I swear I just said that.  Edit; as for the nuggets Jamal Murray should be filling that gap but he has been pretty poor. Without MPJ the nuggets are also not very deep!
The list is trash but luka and Jamal Murray are pgs
"Did you rip this from ESPN, good lord. No Kyrie lmao. If Luka is a point guard then so is Lebron. Westbrook sucks- is Jamal Murray even a pg? What’s going on here"
Well You may say that but I would be devastated if say the Knicks traded all their draft picks and good players for a top 5 player and then could only get out of the 1st round once in the next 10 years. (cough Carmelo)  That would be rough for any franchise they might even become the joke of the league and watch their draft picks light it up in the playoffs on a contender (cough Jamal Murray).  Trading for harden can work out but if it doesn't someone may lose their job it's not without risk that's all I'm saying.
"they lost many good defenders like Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig and Jamal Murray isn't that good. MPJ hasn't played yet."
Jamal Murray? Just gotta convince the Rockets that bubble playoffs Jamal is his true level of play instead of what he is doing right now.
I agree. I'd do it in a second. Brown is the only actual no imo. Jamal Murray is too inconsistent
"No, I didn't forget when Donovan Mitchell and fucking Jamal Murray started dropping multiple prime Michael Jordan games in a single series.  It was an outlier. He hasn't played that well before, and he won't play that well again."
"Simmons offensive game has definitely been figured out, but I’m still not sure about Jamal Murray. He’s more or less gone back to what he was pre bubble which is a good guard, but not elite level like it looked like he was in route to."
Jamal murray easily
"Also it's not the bubble and what obviously was an unsustainable hot streak didn't last.   He's not same old Jamal Murray we've know - who is good, but not an all star, and certainly not the top 10 player he was in the bubble"
Stop spreading fake news. Jamal Murray got hot when Landry Shamet was guarding him. Bruce Brown put clamps on him.   Jamal Murray is the most overrated borderline all star in the league. He will never be an all star or win a championship in his career.
"Reason Jamal Murray is that low is because I don't think that the Nuggets are willing to deal him while he appears to be in his prime.    I don't think the Celtics will deal Jalen Brown either when that team clearly has some amazing synergy.  Brandon Ingram and Ben Simmons aren't fixed in those spots, but given both seem to be stranded on a strong team mid-slots seemed appropriate.  Herro and Pascal could be the Toronto style swap needed."
&gt;  best to worst   You think that Jamal Murray is the worst on the list and Herro is the best?
Trade bait rankings for Harden best to worst (not offered):  * Tyler Herro * Pascal Siakim * Brandon Ingram * Ben Simmons * Jalen Brown * Jamal Murray
"People were very quick to label Jamal Murray as the best player on the nuggets last year during the bubble because of his insane scoring run, even some commentators were saying it during games as if it was a fact"
"Murray was never as good as people were hyping him up to be. Yes, he had an amazing playoffs but that was a handful of games in a unique environment. People act like he was averaging 30 last season - but he was really averaging 18 on average efficiency, playing alongside one of the best playmakers, if not the best, in the game today. No-one considered him a star before the bubble - but a lot of people only watch the playoffs so that is the only Jamal Murray they saw."
Brandon Ingram  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Tyler Herro
Jamal Murray isn't averaging 47ppg on 64% shooting over a 3 game stretch to save them from losing.
"i dont think you understand. if we’re talking recent playoffs.. Embiid WAS the team. that was it... you hit him with a triple team its over, Ben isnt giving you 25 even if he was healthy and the Sixers didnt have a bubble Jamal Murray to dish too. that dude is the nuggets actual bubble playoffs mvp.  it was just Embiid, Harris, and a bunch of guys that didnt fit together. using bubble playoffs as a talking point to compare Jokic and Embiid is just lazy"
"I love me some Jamal Murray, but Denver better get on the phone and try for Harden. If they can trade him for MPJ and other pieces without Murray that’d be great, but I don’t think that’s possible"
Jamal Murray didn’t turn into an all star like they anticipated.
Jamal Murray isn't averaging 47ppg on 64% shooting over a 3 game stretch to save them from losing.
No he isn’t. All his buckets were against Landry Shamet. Bruce Brown put clamps on him. I’d rather have Bruce Brown than Jamal Murray on a championship team.  Jamal Murray is the most overrated borderline all star in the league. I predict he will never be an all star in his career or win a championship unless he plays 4th fiddle on a Kevin Durant team.
Remember when Jamal Murray was good?
"Delusional. Lakers lost the homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs due to the bubble. The bubble was an advantage for everyone else. Look at Jamal Murray goin off and the Heat making the Finals.   ""Never having to worry about losing home court"" lmao would have been 7 straight home games if Lakers played the Clippers in WCF, not to mention half the arena in away games is full of Lakers fans"
"Jamal Murray is also not showing up for games, even though he's on the court."
He has jamal murray too ul also ben simmons is playing like shit so far this season and the 76 still have tje best record in the league
Murray is also all star level point guard that has shown that he can carry team in the playoffs. If you asked Embiid if he would rather have healthy Jamal in playoffs as a second guy or the player that can't stay in close game because he will get fouled every possesion and bring one point max from free throw what do you think he would say?
"&gt;Giannis is a great defender, personally I don’t think he’s better than kawhi because he cannot guard wings without fouling  Giannis isn't better than Kawhi at defense because he isn't as good as Kawhi is at Kawhi's greatest defensive strength? That isn't fair IMO  What about off-ball? Kawhi doesn't protect the rim much at all (he mostly just swipes sideways at drivers), while Giannis is one of the 3 or 4 best weakside rim protectors in the league. Rim protection is STILL by far the most impactful defensive trait in the league, even in the playoffs, and Giannis gains a huge edge here  Also, Kawhi can't switch onto bigs regularly, he's strong but he's not *that* strong, and he is too slow to check the very best guards (see: Jamal Murray last WCF), Giannis can guard 3-5 comfortably and holds his own against top tier guards (see: Booker, CP3 being very unwilling to target him in the Finals)   &gt;Kawhi is also a significantly better offensive player. I know people are going to bring up the suns series, but the suns played him terribly, and don’t have amazing defense to begin with.   Idk about Significantly Better. I do agree Kawhi is better offensively, but it's not a massive gap any more  The Suns didn't play him terribly. They just flat out didn't have the personnel to guard him. For that matter, like 25 of 30 teams in the league don't. Miami w Bam and the 2019 Raps with their all-time playoff defense and Utah with Gobert are some of the few teams that can check Giannis fairly successfully  You're also not entirely true about them not having an amazing defense to begin with - they slowed down AD and Jokic very successfully (granted injury/supporting cast questions ofc) and Ayton was having an awesome defensive playoffs before the Finals. EVERYONE expected them to win the Finals, they were basically being crowned as winners the moment they won Game 2. Saying the Suns played him terribly is re-writing history a bit IMO. Let Giannis have his shine, he won that series for them  &gt;We already saw how this story played out in 2019 and while Giannis has still made huge improvements he still hasn’t caught up to kawhi IMO. I know It’s stupid to say what if, but if KD’s foot was in an inch back, Giannis would be getting flamed for not being able to win against the nets without Harden and Kyrie.  Why bring up 2019? If you watched Giannis in the Finals, he's a noticeably different player - he's *slightly* less athletic IMO but he's a lot more purposeful with his movements instead of continually just running himself into the wall, he's very active off ball, he has a few more counters in the post/paint than he used to (that fade, that hook) when bigs give him space, he's a much better passer and commits fewer offensive fouls  For that matter, Kawhi is better than he was in 2019 too - he's a much better passer"
Jamal Murray scoring title is a very wild interesting prediction
"Dame, Steph, Luka, Trae, Kyrie, cp3, Westbrook, Jamal Murray  In no particular order, anyone else better than Ben Simmons? Maybe mike conly/Lowry/dlo/wall?"
"Nuggets win the finals, but Jamal Murray is FMVP"
"We won’t ever know until he’s out of MN and joins some better team. Lots of teams make the playoffs with meh talent and one giant superstar. Heck, the Nuggets win percentage went up last year after Jamal Murray was injured (they definitely need Murray to win further into the playoffs. KAT is just a third guy on a good team and people on this sub act like he’s a legit superstar. The one time that Butler did drag KAT to the playoffs, KAT had well below his career numbers in every stat but rebounds.   Idk why people can’t figure out that some people put up stats AND help their team win, and some people just put up stats as a function of increased usage on bad teams, but don’t really contribute to more wins added. If he is the third best center in the league as some people say, he’s still two tiers below Jokic and Embiid."
"&gt; monk  As a Kentucky fan, Malik Monk was a better shooter than Jamal Murray and Devin Booker in college.  The talent is there, but I don't know where his head is.  I expected great things out of him when he went to Charlotte, but they barely used him.  The Lakers bench is soft and I can see Monk outshining the other shooters on the team."
"Jamal Murray… people forgot about him after the bubble sad nobody noticed this year in the last 25 games he played he averaged 24 PPG, 5 APG, 4 RPG on 51/46/94… the Nuggets were dominating when he got hurt in fact that game he got hurt was the only game they lost with their Big 4 on the court.   He is so gifted offensively, there’s literally nothing he can’t do. He shot 41% from 3, he’s a great mid range shooter, free throw shooter,  he plays in the post, he’s Kyrie Lite when he comes to creative finishing at the rim, and when he needs to be a playmaker he’s a really good passer. This year he was also solid on defense.   I think in the second half of his career when he returns from injury, he’s gonna remind people that he’s gonna be a top 5 PG in the league for years to come when he’s in his prime."
didn’t jamal murray break the record ;) could be wrong
Jamal Murray &gt; Devin Booker
Didn't Jamal Murray also break the record?
What? The jamal murray who was dropping 40 and 50 bombs in the playoffs literally a year ago? Mpj can't even create his own shot consistently let alone playmake for others
Suns fans won’t like this one lol.   Jamal Murray &gt; Devin Booker
Upvoted (I don’t agree with you but upvoting this is my way of countering that one dude who said Jamal Murray is better than book)
"Nuggets have a PG, his name is Jamal Murray."
"With injuries to LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Klay, Donovan Mitchell..."
Jamal Murray
Would you say Jamal Murray is currently a star?
"I said marginally because there's definitely still a good amount of people who have him really high. There was a thread the other day which included him in a list of Jamal Murray, D'Aaron Fox, Gilgeous Alexander and Ja Morant.  &gt; “Every advanced metric shows there’s a sizable gap in impact in dontes favor”. What impact exactly are you talking about?  Win-shares, BPM, Offensive *and* Defensive ratings, VORP, RAPTOR, LEBRON are the metrics, and broadly define how much a player contributes to winning games. Team record is *a* noise, but most will select against it and the difference in team record this year between the two players was 6 games, so not a spectacular amount.  &gt; Also just the fact that herros a much much better floor spacer than donte already puts him in favor in the nba.  Donte has shot better from the 3 this season on the same attempts (.379 to .360). A greater proportion of Donte's shots are from the 3-point line, and both are taking them from the corner a similar amount (.426 of 3's for Donte, against .463 for Herro).  &gt; Dontes “better” in advanced metrics while herros much more efficient than him.  They finished the season with TS% separated by 0.1% (.542 vs .543). Donte's offensive toolkit also includes the fact that he finished the year the best offensive rebounder at his position, and turns the ball over less.  The point is that Herro's offensive upside compared to Donte is vastly overstated, and comes down to the difference of Herro taking 3 more shot attempts per36 than Donte. No greater efficiency, as of the most recent season worse 3-point shooting and less ability to positively affect half-court offenses outside of shooting (which, again, is not more efficient)."
"Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, and maybe OG"
"This is a tricky question.  All the NBA players are very good at the basketball thing. A guy like Luke Garza was the player of the year in college and a late-second-round pick whose only pro potential is overseas. But, very few can be superstars in the way you described.  There's the added layer of there being a lot of ""stats guys"" on bad teams. Putting up points on the Cavs or Magic or Kings is a lot different than being a superstar. I don't even think SGA is a good example. You can't have a young player on a team that is taught that losing and franchise turnover is good and then expect them to be more than a stats guy.  So, I suppose I will go with four options:  Jamal Murray - Is very close. So close that ""Could Denver have made the Finals if Murray was healthy?"" is a fairly legit argument. Being the second-best player on a Finals team means the player in question is really, really good.  Michael Porter Jr. - Nowhere near as close as Murray and much more unlikely to reach star level. But, if ability/health/work ethic ever comes together? Watch out.  Jaylen Brown - Will he ever be the best team on a Finals contender? Not sure. I do think he can be the second-best player on a Finals teams. Before you scoff at that, the second-best player for the most-recent Finals teams were Olympians.  Cade Cunningham - Don't want to hear top draft picks? Welp, don't give a fuck. The guy has never played a second of NBA ball and I think he will be the best #1 pick since LeBron. Will be a perennial all-star and will win a title sooner than LeBron, Giannis, KD, etc. That is delusional and far-fetched for many. But, I think he's that damn good. And, like MJ during his title spree and Duncan during the Spurs stretch, he has the chance for a run of greatness where the more established stars are aging out and where younger players aren't as developed."
Jamal Murray that one game against the cavs
I think Jamal Murray. Does he fit the requirements?
"If you mean Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray, it’s way to early to say that."
Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray comes back in time for the 5th-seeded Nuggets to make a deep run to the Finals.  Please.
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10. Dejounte Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. Michael Porter  13. Deandre Ayton  14. Jamal Murray  15. Donavan Mitchell  16. Jarret Allen  17. Collin Sexton  18. Trae Young  19. Bam Adebayo  20. Ben Simmons  21. Anthony Edwards  22. John Collins  23. Myles Turner  24. Marvin Bagley   25. Lonzo Ball
"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."
"Yes! Came here to say he's probably in my top 2-3 behind Fox. Seems like no one ever mentions him as being a key part of the Cavs rebuild, but he had such a strong season (went 17/2/6/1 on 47/40/85) and showed he should absolutely be a centerpiece for them going forward, probably a really good 3rd option. I see him as Kemba/Jamal Murray type going forward."
"Even though he is labeled as a superstar, I think Donovan Mitchell. Rarely is ever talked about, and I’ve seen people even say Jamal Murray “start of the season” was better than him."
First player that comes to my mind is probably Jamal Murray?
Jamal Murray averages 24ppg in the playoffs...
Jamal Murray comes back better than ever and has a 60 point playoff series winning game.
"Jamal Murray is a better scorer than Kawhi,  Kevin Durant,and LeBron then. Got it"
Jamal Murray 2.0 or even better lol
Who will be the best player  Also Sengun and Enes Kanter are completely two different players. Only reason you’d compare the two is because they’re from Turkey  It’s like comparing Jamal Murray and Wiggins because they’re Canadian
"You’re acting like the man carried his team to the WCF. Dude played great, but let’s not mince the facts, Grizzlies lost in 5. Jamal Murray thus far has been a far more productive playoff basketball player, so what Jokic is on his team, that shouldn’t be held against him."
Terrance mann filling in for kawhi and mpj taking on the scoring load from jamal murray
"I don't think it's totally out of the question. The Lakers are gonna be load-managing, Jamal Murray, Kawhi, and Klay are gonna be out for significant amounts of time, CP3 is gonna be 37 come playoff time so he's probably going to be load-managing, the Jazz could take a step back like the Hawks did after 2014-15, and the Mavs will have Jason Kidd at coach. If Ja takes another step forward, I could very well see it happening."
All guards that played their college ball in the state of Kentucky?  Jamal Murray.
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"

"Saw the list and first thing I thought was ‘How much is the difference between Bam and Gobert?’ Looks like an unpopular opinion but:  I remember when they asked, around a year ago, D’Angelo Russell who he would build a team around if he was a GM (he couldn’t pick a player on the Wolves). He said Bam, a modern big who can switch anything, pass, shoot, guard the rim, rebound. No weaknesses, has every intangible. Not a big Dlo fan but it really made me think, I can definitely see what he’s saying. As good as they are it is actually way easier to find a Jamal Murray PLUS a Jaylen Brown than to find one Bam. I would argue the only player who can do everything Bam does and doesn’t have a significant weakness that Bam doesn’t have is AD.. and that’s not even really true, with AD’s health. As crazy as it is, it’s easier to find an unstoppable offensive force like Harden/Luka/Lebron than to find a Bam. I guess the counter argument is you can win a title without a Bam but you can’t win it without an super dominant offensive player."
Even missing Jamal Murray?
Harden's strength is ironically his weakness. He's only dominant because he played on the Rockets and was given free reign to play his game. Which is a shady foul drawing game. Other than that he's a good point guard/shooting guard. Take away the foul drawing and given free reign of a team and he's no different than any other good point/shooting guard in the NBA. Put Damian Lillard or Zach Lavine or Jamal Murray in his position and they'll put up just as impressive if not mbetter numbers.   See 2021 playoffs.
"1. Hawks are the top seed and upset either Nets or Bucks in the 2nd round  2. Kawhi misses the entire regular season and 1st round but returns to rescue the Clippers from a 3-2 deficit against the Lakers and wins the series in 7 games   3. Nuggets get Jamal Murray healthy and make the WCF to play Clippers  4. Steph Curry wins MVP and helps the Dubs return to Top 4 seed  5.

"No free throws is insane. Jamal Murray is easily one of the most underrated players in the league. Has an insane offensive package, elite 3 level scorer, is a good defender, and is a great passer. Combine all that with his hustle, clutchness, and toughness and you have a beast of a talent."
"I think this is where the tier list is fundamentally lacking. If you go off of pure defensive stats, sure Lillard is really bad. But it is way more nuanced than that. The context of overall team defense and matchups changes the picture.  Embiid has Simmons and Thybulle on his team who make his defensive load much less. Plus he is guarding the likes of Brook Lopez and Adebayo as the best centers in the East (behind Embiid of course).  Meanwhile, Dame not only has to take a huuge offensive load, but he is forced to guard the best guards in the league! Dame matches up with Steph, CP3, Jamal Murray etc. And the rest of the team is trash at defense so he has no help on the weak side"

"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).  This team should be good enough to win a title. I really like Giannis and Jokic as a pairing as well.Jokic as a pairing as well."
Jamal Murray is very very good. He was terrific in the 2020 playoffs and he was good last season up until the injury.
"Colin Sexton is a great player. He’s an efficient scorer with improving defence and playmaking. On a decent team, and with experience, I think he’ll be Jamal Murray level or better."
"Definitely in the conversation in terms of pick and roll chemistry, maybe not overall talent. [Zach Lowe did a great breakdown from last year](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/zachlowe29949405/nba-playoffs-genius-jamal-murray-nikola-jokic-lakers-doing-it)"
"Nuggets should build around Jokic, Porter Jr and Bol Bol, and not Jamal Murray"
jamal murray sucks but mpj isnt that good either
"Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker are all in the same tier as players... presuming Murray rebounds from injury."
"1. Lebron - same story every time Lebron has any career hardships. I’ve learned my lesson - don’t bet against Lebron James. Yes he’s 36-37, but MJ was winning chips in his mid 30s too. The GOAT types are just different. This last playoffs he clearly wasn’t 100% healthy and the Lakers were still up 2-1 with AD playing. Bron was very likely to win MVP before his injury. He’s the best.  2. KD - came off an an Achilles injury and is playing some of his basketball ever. Unbelievable accomplishment given how serious that injury is. Also dominated at the Olympics. I still have him under Bron as a playmaker. But it’s closer than ever between those two.   3. Giannis - the dude plays efficient unstoppable basketball. And he’s a top 5 defender. The Nets are unfair. KD and Harden are among the most elite players in the league. Griffin is vastly underpaid for his contributions. And even though Harden was injured he had a very, very good playoffs. Even injured Harden’s advanced stats were much better than Jrue’s and Middleton’s in that series. Huge achievement for Giannis.  4. Kawhi - people get stuck in the moment and forget how good Kawhi is. The Clippers would probably win it all this year if Kawhi doesn’t get hurt. They lost to the Suns 4-2 without him. Just does everything at a very high level. Except leadership.  5. Jokic - I don’t think people fully understand what a generational talent Jokic is. I fully believe he could go down as the best center ever when all is said and done. All I can say to the Nuggets is get him some real help before he leaves you. Jamal Murray is pretty good, but clearly not AD or Harden. I mean just imagine if Jokic had Luka or Dame. Plus one more Kyrie/Westbrook type stat. That’s a serious, serious contender against the Nets and Lakers. That’s how good this guy is."
Yea because Jamal Murray carried them lol
Jamal Murray is overrated as fuck and him being healthy would not have meaningfully impacted the series vs the suns even though that's what everyone wants to believe
"You're an insane person....I never said Murray was a better offensive player.  Like read, dude.  I literally said ""Not saying Jamal is better player than Manu, but as a pure scorer, if you just need a bucket it's really not ridiculous to say Murray is a better option.""  I'm trying to get it through your insanely thick skull that, strictly from a scoring perspective, it is close and it isn't a homer take to say Murray is a better bucket getter than Manu was. It's close.  I readily admit that, as a whole, Manu was a better offensive player.    This is the most pathetic attempt to win an argument that I wasn't even making"
jamal murray
"&gt; Murray had a better offensive season despite his efficiency being far worse? &gt;  &gt;   59.2% true shooting and 61.2% shooting isn't ""far worse"" -- it is very close and on better volume, with a higher 3 point percentage.  I'm trying to say it's at the very least a close argument.  I never said Muray is better.  Re-read what I have said.  I said ""Not saying Jamal is better player than Manu, but as a pure scorer, if you just need a bucket it's really not ridiculous to say Murray is a better option.""  To act like it's the most homer take ever means you aren't looking at the numbers objectively.  I'm trying to.  I'm also not insulting people and calling them chumps and saying ""this is why you'll forever be in the mud.""  Like dude, what?"
"I dont understand how anyone can watch these last playoffs and come to the conclusion that MPJ is already better than jamal murray. Like, how???!"
"&gt;2) Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  i wouldn't say this is unpopular but a very bold take. murray was so good in the bubble run, and porter has had injury issues as well so it's hard to say how it will shake out but it'll be great basketball"
"Is anyone trading any of these guys for a single season for a single season of westbrook if the $$ was the same?  Jokic, Giannis, Embiid, Kawhi, Butler, Lillard, Curry, Harden, AD, Lebron, Luka, KD, Tatum, PG, Spida, Beal, CP3, Simmons, Brown, Zion, Randle, KAT, Kyrie, Gobert, Trae, Booker, Jamal Murray  And what about these guys: Sabonis, Harris, Jrue, Middleton, Bam, Vucevic, Valanciunas, Ja, Fox etc.  Half these guys are gonna be better next year just due to gaining exp. I don't think its wrong to say WB is out of the 25 and i'm not saying he's not been great in his career or whatever either, but he's not a top-25 any longer."
"sorry this is the internet and we're strangers, i genuinely didn't think anyone in this entire thread was being hostile at any point, including you and me lol  &gt; And Ja Morant is in a tier above Brogdon and Lonzo and definitely not average   if we say ""above average"" is the top-10 pgs, ""average"" is the 11-20 pgs, and ""below average"" is the 21-30 pgs, that would mean that Ja is a top-10 PG?  so better than three of:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  which three here would you take Ja over for a game today?  i'm not disagreeing or being hostile i'm genuinely curious."
"The 2023 season is probably the next time that Jamal Murray will be playing, so seems like you're almost agreeing with him"
I’m surprised you have Denver so high with Jamal Murray missing most the season.
"Jamal Murray will be a first-team all nba player soon. His game is so polished at his age, he was in DPOY rankings mid season last year and he’s gonna come back like he never left"
"Ja Morant will be top 5 in 5 years  Jamal Murray won't get back to his old self  Devin Booker peaked this last season  De'Aaron Fox will ask for a trade, he'll become top 10 in 3 years"
"maybe because people don't understand how words work, but how many fans if they sat down and thought about it would say he's better than at least 4 guys on this list:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  Brogdon  Sexton  Lamelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Ja Morant  I think he is definitely worse than all of these guys, and he would need to be better than three of them to even be ""average""."
"1. GLeague Ignite is a much better option than playing college which is a waste of time for a prospect.  2. Miami got overrated due to the bubble when they weren't a great team during the entire season pre-bubble and what they are going to be this upcoming year won't be as good as many are expecting.   3. Like all things LeBron, the Lakers success is exclusive to the buy in for LeBron as always. When the buy in rate is near 100%, so is the success.   4. Interested to see how Jamal Murray looks and it could be a game changer for the league if he's back to norm  5. I think Horford is the most underrated move of the offseason and it will have substantial value for Boston this year.   6. Interested to see how Atlanta looks with a full year of Nate McMillan at the helm. This could be massive   7. Interesting to see how good are the Bucks and Suns this upcoming season.  8. Chicago is the Atlanta Hawks of this season. Not in terms of the success Atlanta had but they can be bad or really good and no one knows till they build chemistry. This could be a nightmare or a dream"
1) AD wasn't healthy but at same time if AD was fit then Lakers wouldnt be a seventh seed. We would have faced Portland and we would have beaten them say 4-1(the one win for Portland due to Dame going nuclear) .   2) Jamal Murray isn't that good to make a 4-0 sweep with 3 blowouts in it and change the series to help Denver win 4 matches. Like he's good but not THAT good. Now if the series went a bit tight I could have understood but no we destroyed them in every facet
"If every team the suns faced weren't injured the suns wouldn't have made it to the finals. The clippers were much better than them when kawhi was playing, Jamal Murray would have fixed the nuggets scoring problem, and both lebron/ad were nor healthy"
"Warriors won’t win a championship again with their  core 3  Zion will have a better season than AD in 2021-2022  Eric Bledsoe isn’t hot dog ass like everyone in this sub thinks, but he’s definitely still a lower tier PG  Although I feel bad for Kings fans, I want the Kings to be bad every year just so the league has a punching bag  Lakers should retire George Mikan’s number   If Raul Neto was 3 inches taller he’d be a top 7 guard   Take Jamal Murray off Denver and his production and stats would take a big hit"
"I mean, he didn't have far superior efficiency....Murray scored more points on better efficiency this past year than Manu ever did, and Jamal averages notably more points on notably better efficiency in the playoffs.    It's not homer, you just have your information wrong."
"&gt;Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  Oh wow this is an extremely hot take. 2022-23 I can somewhat see due to MPJs limitless potential but right now he's not at that level yet.  I can agree he's better in the regular season but Murray's offensive IQ, shotmaking, chemistry with Jokic means he's much better in the playoffs. And I'm not just talking about the bubble, talking about 18/19 as well   Edit - my unpopular opinion is that Kyrie Irving will NEVER be a first option on a successful playoff team due to mediocre passing and non-existent defence plus polarising personality"
"&gt;Zion and Brandon Ingram will not work out as a duo. Ingram is good but his lack of defense is too much to overcome.  is Ingram a bad defender? he was legit really good at it as a Laker?  &gt;Michael Porter Jr. is already better than Jamal Murray. He’s going to be 1A/1B with Jokic by 2022-23  What has MPJ done to prove that he's better than Murray right now?  &gt;The Bulls have turned themselves into the next Pacers. They have a bunch of good players but no great players. They’re not going to win a playoff series with this core.  That's just common sense, THe bulls aren't a top 4 team in the east by any measure  &gt;NBA’s G-League Ignite is a waste of money. The G-League system as a minor league makes a lot of sense. However, competing with the NCAA is looking a gift horse in the mouth.  How is it a waste of money? if they can get better talent, then more people will want to watch those games."
"Ah, so we're a 'Jamal Murray is a top 5 player in the league' kind of guy"
I remember being mad about the Jamal Murray max because he got so much more than LaVine
"Bro stop it man you’re out of your damn mind.  SLIGHTLY less points? And where did the ‘superior efficiency’ come from. That’s just not true.  This season Jamal Murray averaged 21 points on  47/41/87 shooting splits. In his best ever scoring season, Manu Ginobili averaged 19.5 points on 46/40/86 splits.   In the playoffs, Jamal Murray averages 24.3 points per game on 47/41/90 shooting splits. Over Manu’s 6 highest scoring playoff runs he averaged 19 points per game on 45/38/83 splits.   If we take both of their best years, Murray averaged 26.5 points on 51/45/90 shooting. Manu averaged 21 points on 51/44/80 shooting.   So now you, the person with the brain, tell me, the brainless, how Manu scored just *slightly* less, on superior efficiency (where the hell did that come from?).   “Worst homer post in a while”  Put some fucking respect on Jamal Murray’s name and stop living in the past"
"I’m sorry, what?? Manu a better scorer than Jamal Murray? What am I missing"
Mostly cuz you can slot a score first guard into the PG role when you have Jokic on your team to facilitate. Manu would be a better Jamal Murray both at scoring and facilitating.
bubble jamal murray was better than any teammate melo had on ur poverty franchise also its the greatest player in general drafted by that team why do u think ingram is over bynum
For modern players it's going to be someone you don't even really expect. Like OG Annonouby or Jamal Murray
"&gt;Denver:   PG: Jamal Murray (2016-present)   SG: David Thompson (1976-1982)   SF: Alex English (1980-1990)   PF: Carmelo Anthony (2003-2011)   C: Nikola Jokic (2015-present)  Jamal Murray would not play for Denver, 2-time All-star Fat Lever would -- especially considering how defensively-challenged this unit would otherwise be.  And with Lever and Jokic, this team would be a triple-double factory on a nightly basis."

"He is not okay, he is very good at them. Only 13 guys in the league shooting 3+ midrange shots a game had a better midrange shooting percentage than him last year. He had a better midrange shooting percentage than guys like Kawhi Leonard, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, Tatum, and others. And it's not like this is an anomaly, he shot basically the same percentages the season before.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DistanceRange=By%20Zone&amp;CF=Mid-Range%20FGA*GE*3&amp;sort=Mid-Range%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1"
"Man what a trash ass offer for us. Why would any team give up two *elite* shooters *and* picks for Ben ""Everyone Else's Skills Have To Cater To Mine"" Simmons. All y'all uneducated, don't actually play basketball, haven't watched a Wolves game in your life /r/nba nephews come up with the most ass ideas. Y'all have these elaborate tiers of player value based on how you guys see other people discuss them rather than having actually watched these guys, making everyone agree simultaneously with Raptors fans that OG is untouchable, but DLO is a negative asset, and CJ McCollum is also ass compared to Ben Simmons (tag my post y'all wack ass 76er fans, y'all never getting Dame).   Nevermind the fact that D'Angelo Russell played good (not passable, good) defense after his return from surgery, nevermind that for some reason because KAT isn't a mistake eraser you supposedly have to surround him with all plus defenders despite Jokic playing the same position with guys like Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and MPJr surrounding him (successfully). Man, I just really hate y'all bum ass, can't hoop fools."
Am I wrong but didn’t Jamal Murray and/or D Mitch last year
If someone commented on how much they loved Jamal Murray getting injured how would that make you feel? Instead of wishing misery on someone else why not just wish for better things to come from your own team/camp? These types of comments are never needed

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
That’s amateur porn star Jamal Murray to you sir
Murray might not play at all this season so I am not counting him. Yes it would be between Gordon and Barton for 2nd most important and if its with Jamal out then Barton is on the ball a lot more and more important for the team. I know Gordon is a much more talented player and a lot younger but I am just saying right now if they don't bring in free agents I think the importance of Barton makes him invaluable.
"&gt;I'd say he is possibly the second best player on the team  Definitely not. When Jamal Murray is healthy, Barton becomes the 4th or even 5th best player on the team, depending on how good Aaron Gordon is offensively on that day."
"Because it's hard to make the finals over and over and over?   Not only that but CP3 is a hugely injury prone. They have a really good shot, but in the west we are looking at a full squad of GSW, Jamal Murray back with DEN, AD/Lebron resting, Mitchell is getting more rest from that injury, Kawhi will be ready by playoffs, Mavs are revving up for Doncic inevitable MVP season (IMO gonna happen in the next 3 years), and the list goes on.      Like Draymond has told Book its harder to reach the finals over and over."
Lost to Nuggets without Jamal Murray or Will Barton.
"AD, LeBron, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi were injured in your run"
"It was 10 games after Aaron Gordon arrived and before Jamal Murray got hurt.  Nuggets went 8-2 in those games, and beat some really good teams comfortably."
damn Jamal Murray is Jesus?
We would have still beat the Nuggets if they had Jamal Murray
"AD, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi's injury all did this lol"
A healthy Jamal Murray might make the nuggets even better
"Oh yeah I completely forgot that this is the same team that gave Jamal Murray a max extension a year early. At the time it looked a little aggressive, but that ended up being a great choice too."
Maybe AD and Lebron will get injured again  Maybe Kawhi will not make it in time for playoffs  Maybe Conley and Mitchell will sprain their ankles right before playoffs  Maybe Jamal Murray will not make it in time too..... Oh wait...
"That’s completely untrue.   Every team has 2 max slots, and at the very least one should be used by teams who aren’t just starting a rebuild.   That means that around the Top-30 players should be receiving a max contract, along with players who are projected to be at least that good.   The only reason why people think only a few players should get maxes is because they compare Jamal Murray and Khris Middleton to Jokic, Giannis, and LeBron; players who value exceed the max."
So was Jamal Murray
Facts. Russ would have willed that game 7. He would relentless attack Jamal Murray that series. His rim pressure would give kawhi a added sense of security.
Jamal murray
"rebuttals:  made to second round - well it was Portland  only lost to the conference champs - it was a sweep  also, jamal murray will be unavailable for an unknown amount of time.  although he's young enough that I'd assume he'll recover well, in which case may as well be optimistic that he'll play into shape by the time playoffs come around."
"We didn’t almost lose to the Clippers, it was 4-2 lol  Sure we got pretty lucky with injuries but you and most everyone on this sub fails to recognize our best player all year and the guy who runs the offense couldn’t dribble a ball for the Lakers series besides one game and got COVID right before the Clippers series.  We beat the Lakers game 1 when they had AD, what do you say then?  Do you really think Jamal Murray flips the script that much and we go from sweeping them to now suddenly not even being competitive with them?  Also, what does any of this have to do with CP3 and re signing him? That’s the topic at hand. There’s not a better PG we can sign and he’s one of the main reasons we went so far in the first place. Of course we’re going to run it back"
You guys almost lost to the Clippers without Kawhi   Let’s call a spade a spade   You got the luckiest draw with injuries in the history of the league.   Every round you played a team missing 1-2 starters   AD/Jamal Murray/Kawhi  You had a 2-0 lead with home court advantage and became only the second team to lose 4 games in a row after being up 2-0.   You had the worst Finals collapse in the history of the league (outside Golden States 3-1 debacle) after playing injured squads every round leading up to the Finals   And you are sitting confidently saying you could beat a healthy nuggets team and will be back in the finals  Lol ok bro
"1)Let Warriors pick up the star in first place as their FO is saying the reverse of developing their rookies . I would fear once they trade a star  2)Okay the Lakers would be good but Bron-AD-Russ sounds like shit come playoff time as all 3 would occupy the rim-paint region. Spacing would suck  3)Would give you Kawhi as Tyronn Lue is an underrated tactician and I really feel PG13 massively steps up as a MVP level player  4) Yes Luka is elite, a superstar but after that the roster isnt that good to make me fear also we do have a good record vs them since Luka has joined  5) As good as Jamal Murray he isnt a top 10-15 player whom you can say completely change the results of the Nugget playoff series from a 4-0 sweep to a  win for them(with 3 of them being blowouts)"
"That's what they said about Jamal Murray, there was no reason to have given him the max based on his production on the court"
"Jamal Murray will join him one day, guarantee"
"You can’t sit here and say well among PG I have him as 17th in the whole league and out of the other side of the mouth say he should play next to someone who can be more on the ball in the half court. If you look at just guards there are so many, so many guards you’d rather have. You don’t have Booker on your list? You don’t have Jamal Murray? Donovan Mitchell? Beal? Lavine? Irving? Harden? Brown? McCollum?   Like who did he have a better season than last year? Was he better than terry rozier? Was be better than FVV? Tim Hardaway and Norman Powell are both coming off two very strong seasons in a row, both FA, both 28, was Lonzo better than either of them? Let’s just be honest."
"I think the Suns have a better chance of going back to the finals than people are anticipating especially if our roster improves over the summer which it likely will since our best guys are all young and coming back. The Lakers are a question mark to me, Golden State is a threat but also a big question mark, Clippers won’t have Kawhi all year and the Nuggets same with Jamal Murray."
"Rewatched the first series and really realized how close they were to being down 3-1 instead of tying it 2-2 and winning 4-2. AD got hurt on the last possession for the first half of game 4 and didn’t return, but if he was healthy Lakers probably win it at home and close out 4-1 or 4-2 instead.   Denver is a different team with Jamal Murray but hard to say they go from being swept to definitely winning.  Clippers on the other hand, unless you subscribe to the Ewing theory, pushed it to 6 without the clear best player in the series Kawhi being out for all of it, not to mention Zubac and Ibaka for most of the series  So yeah, very improbable run. Even if they do improve (and that depends on CP3 as well as their contract situation with Bridges/Ayton), making the Finals is so so unlikely."
No Jamal Murray
If you keep predicting everyone to the Lakers you’re getting it right eventually lmao  [Joel Turner] Sources indicate Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown could team up in LA down the line  Let’s see if I’m eight years from now
"I disagree with a lot of this. In general, I don't like that they got a player whose main value is playing WITHOUT LeBron, and did it by giving up 2 players (3&amp;D wings) whose main value is playing WITH LeBron. And those were the main tradable contracts/assets + the FRP.  I could see it working out still, but it seems like it needs some real magic in FA and with coaching to make it work.  For third option.. man that's a sensitive topic. Russ is 22PPG (on 22 shooting attempts) on worse-than-Draymond efficiency this year. That's a good argument that even the Sixers have a better 3rd option in Ben Simmons.   Oh and the obvious team you missed is the Nuggets: Jokic, MPJ, Jamal Murray. Those are 3 great scoring options."
How about Jamal Murray?
Wish so much we could have seen Jamal Murray play for team Canada
Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray viral video [XXX]
"Step 1. Put undersized center montrez Harrell on Nikola Jokic.   Step 2. Oh that’s not working? Why not try putting Montezl Harrell on nikola Jokic? They’ll never see that coming.   Step 3(game 7 now). Ok, don’t put trez on Jokic what a stupid idea. here’s the plan, EVERYONE  ONLY guard Jokic and Jamal Murray and hope no one else ever makes a shot. What’s that? Someone else DID make a shot? Well, why not just scream into the abyss for the entire second half then?"
"You are delusional if you think he is a top 3 PG. Lillard, Curry, Trae Young, Kyrie, Jrue Holiday, CP3 and Luka are all much better. And I would still prefer a healthy Jamal Murray, Lowry and Ja Morant above Russ."
"Shai doesn't see the types of coverage that Tatum does no offense. Whenever teams play the OKC Thunder, they're not working as hard to watch film and stuff because they know that you guys aren't trying to win any games anyway Lol no offense.  To say that hes a better scorer than year 3 Tatum is just not true Lmfao. You can see in the raptors series 2020 specifically how well Tatum handled basically every type of coverage a player could see. Nick Nurse through everything at him that he possibly could, but Tatum was still playing as well as anyone possibly could. Shai crumbled in the one playoffs series where he saw any kind of double coverage against Houston.  Shai also played less games. If he played a full season, his averages wouldn't be as high. He had a few really good games (i know specifically because I really like watching him a lot as a player).  Shai is great but hes not in the same league as Tatum (but not far off). There is no young player in this league who has the arsenal of offensive weapons that Tatum does.   I would say Shai is more like Dbook which is still an amazing compliment because Dbook is a fantastic player in his own right. Tatum, Luka, and Zion are in a league of their own followed by the other young players like Shai, Dbook, Dmitch, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and obviously more."
"At least for this year, I think Phoenix still has a good shot to come out of the West again with a solid offseason.  The Westbrook addition with the Lakers is meh, no shooting and more AD at the 5 could lead to another injury and I'm not even sure how good that team is if he stays healthy.  Jazz are what they are and are looking to shed cap/run it back with the main core.  Nuggets still wont have Jamal Murray for the majority of the year so we'll see what they look like.  Clippers dont have Kawhi so unless they do something major this offseason they're not a threat.  The Warriors get Klay back but he hasn't played in 2 years and the rest of that roster outside of Steph still can't score. It's really wait and see what they do with the rest of their offseason.  Mavericks have Luka, but unless they make a big addition, they seem about the same, so a first round exit.  So getting out of the West again still seems plausible, although it's obviously harder if the Suns face healthy teams (although I personally think it is a little overblown how much the Suns benefitted from injuries this year)."
"Jordan Clarkson is Bouknight's floor.  As a Holy BouKnight squire, I believe his ceiling is....JAMAL MURRAY  I KNOW! HERESY"
"That is why I am waiting on that bet I need to see the full team but if they get Lowry and add a perimeter defender at the 2 spot with BI, Zion and Jonas in the frontcourt then I think they can win a lot of games like 49-33 type team and hopefully that lands them the #4 seed and Zion the MVP.   I see the Suns dropping to like 5th/6th because CP3 will most likely miss games and they might have a hangover after the disappointing finals. The Blazers \[I think Dame is gone\] and Clippers should both drop out. And then Jamal Murray is gone a long time for Denver which should hurt them. Luka is probably the biggest concern to my Zion bet but I'm going with Zion.  So I think it will be in an order like Lakers, Warriors, Jazz, Pelicans, Mavs, Suns, Nuggets, Clippers  Really incredible playoffs looming if everyone stays healthy and/or comes back on time like Murray and Kawhi."
I think DeMar did a great job as a leader in the locker room to the young guys and as a primary initiator.  One of the common trends we see in teams who have trouble developing young talent is not providing the prospects with solid NBA-level guard play. This is even true for young guards.  Learning how to effectively initiate an offense is probably the most difficult learning curve in the NBA for young players and having a solid vet show you how it's done can change the course of a player's development..  Shai had Lou Williams and Pat Bev in his rookie year with LAC  Jamal Murray had Jameer Nelson his rookie year.  Donovan Mitchell had Rick Rubio his rookie year.  Trae Young had Vince Carter and Jeremy Lin during his rookie year.. and there's a ton of other examples.
"Jokic, Luka, Jamal Murray, Steph, Klay, PG13, Kahwi, LeBron, AD, Ja Morant, CP3, Booker, DeAaron Fox,  Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae, Tatum, KD, Harden, Kyrie, LaMelo, Bam, Giannis, Holiday, Khris Middleton, Embiid, Lowry, Beal are all better"
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
"&gt; Okay, well 25 games isn't enough to properly rate a player, and he hadn't proven much in the league other than that he could get injured and play well for a 1/4 of a season.  I can agree with this, I have no problem with this. They *did* rate him though and I think his performance in those games compared to being 3C is a big jump, and while I do understand the reasoning I think that's an overly negative reaction to a neutral problem.  &gt; Would you say that Jamal Murray became the best player in the league in the bubble playoffs? No, he was insane but it's a small sample size.  In this instance we have other games to look at to tell whether or not the bubble games were outliers, so the judgement of 'well maybe this isn't indicative of him as an overall player' has a basis.  It's not that big though, mostly I just disagree with the degree to which his injury affected his ranking. Especially considering that KD didn't play a game that season but was still 1A (which I don't disagree with), because it feels like it's staked too highly on reputation."
"Okay, well 25 games isn't enough to properly rate a player, and he hadn't proven much in the league other than that he could get injured and play well for a 1/4 of a season.  As he has played more, it has become more and more apparent that his game is sustainable and he is a top level player - he is rated accordingly.  Would you say that Jamal Murray became the best player in the league in the bubble playoffs? No, he was insane but it's a small sample size."
"Remember how valuable KCP was on that run? Dude was our primary defender against guys like Dame, CJ, Harden, Russ and Jamal Murray and we even threw him at Jimmy in the Finals. All while shooting lights out the whole way through. Russ isn’t doing any of that. His playmaking will help us maintain a high floor in the regular season but his lack of shooting ability kill us in the playoffs"
"Full strength Suns would’ve taken full strength Lakers to 7, but you can’t get aging injury prone assets and cry when they’re injured. This isn’t 2k. Jamal Murray would not have taken a nuggets sweep to 7. Clippers with Kawhi I won’t comment on, I’m not sure the suns would’ve had the same outcome but it’s the same team that has choked 3-1 with Kawhi.   Lakers casuals delusional man, y’all have no depth, aging assets, no shooters in a 3pt NBA. There’s no denying Westbrook, AD, and bron on the same team but primed for finals? Nah. West is anyone’s. I’ll happily eat my words if they steamroll their way to the finals. And I want bron to prove everyone wrong"
"Gotta hand it to you, you are AMAZING at strawman arguments. Literally never bragged about losing lol. However, I know that we were injured and not even near 100% lol. And that’s fine, if the Suns would have won I would put no asterisk next to it. But, I’m glad they lost…because the Suns and their fans got WAY too cocky and arrogant for no fucking reason when the ENTIRE NBA fanbase could see how injuries benefited your team so damn much, and y’all annoying asses try to compare CP’s minor ass shoulder injury like he wasn’t still playing well as if it was the same at all LMAO. You faced an entire injured Lakers team…got cocky about it. Faced a Jamal Murray-less Nuggets…got cocky about it. A Kawhi-less Clippers…got cocky about it. Avoided a Nets team in the east whose TWO superstars went down with bad injuries…got cocky about it. Then you finally face your first healthy ass team and get your ass handed to you. Again, nobody cared if y’all won or not, and I’m a CP fan so I was rooting for him. But seeing how cocky and arrogant y’all got beating completely injured and depleted teams, I’m glad y’all got fucking humbled, knowing DAMN well in your heart of hearts you won’t be back ANY time soon."
And Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard...
Jamal Murray
"if he's a budget jamal murray then his ""D"" is the last thing he needs to work on"
"The Melo Nuggets/Knicks trade was pretty brutal. People did question it at the time, but most of the fans and media were infatuated with the Melo to NY storyline. Meanwhile the Nuggets continued winning and got tons of future assets, one of the pick swaps ended up being Jamal Murray even.   The infamous Celtics/Brooklyn trade narrative changed very fast as well."
He plays nothing like Baron…  I was thinking more like a Jamal Murray.
Don't forget the Throat GOAT: Jamal Murray
KD #1 is sus and Jamal Murray and Gobert should be on this list
"You forgot Ben Simmons, Embiid, Siakam, Jamal Murray for Team Euro"
"Did they forget Simmons, Embiid, Siakam, Jamal Murray, Rudy Gobert, and others would be on Team World?"
"Poor man's jamal murray! Really like his game, even though his D needs work. He's a local to me and I first saw him at 13. One of those natural phenoms.  I bet he'll get big minutes eventually."
The fact is Book was 21st in the NBA in FT/game. Probably not a foul baiter if that's the case.  The fact is the Suns were beating the Lakers when both teams had everyone healthy (except CP3 was still hurt)  The likely fact is the Suns would've been up 2-0 on Bron/AD had CP3 not gotten hurt.  The fact is the Suns had an average margin of victory of 18 points per game against the Nuggets. Don't think Jamal Murray would've made that a win for the Nuggets.  The fact is you need to learn to cope with Devin Booker being a star in the NBA and stop crying about it lmao
Jamal Murray
"seeing a lot of cope honestly  siakam was broken against the g-league nets, i promise you celtics defense is not that good  missing hayward is not missing fucking jamal murray+lebron +james+kawhi leonard+anthony davis LMAO  we would not have played the nets in the first round if their guys were healthy anyway, use ur head"
Regular season will end before Jamal Murray had a full year to recover from injury. Thats so dumb
We have a trade exception. Let's go get him for the sole purpose of defending Jamal Murray when he returns.
"&gt;Shai is in that group with Mitchell, Booker, Ja, Fox, and maybe Jamal Murray where team record is going to be a big part of whether they get selected or not.  Yeah but his team was the only one that went out of its way to have a bad record among those guys. The Thunder play their guys as hard as Sac, Jazz, Suns and Nuggets: 95% chance Shai gets in, probably pushing Booker back into Conley's spot."
"&gt; Shai is in that group with Mitchell, Booker, Ja, Fox, and maybe Jamal Murray  I agree with that, but all of those guys are super fucking good and have made giant contributions to winning teams (if you count rookie Shai). I think with the exception of Ja they all went after 6 in their drafts. The thought of getting a guy like that and another decent swing at getting another is very tantalizing. It's also totally possible that Cade is the next great thing, you never know, it's what makes draft night trades so interesting/frightening"
"Could just as easily say the same about Fox. There are so many great guards in the league that it's very hard to call anyone in the West except Steph, Dame, and Luka perennial all-stars, and even Steph missed it due to injury just two years ago. Shai is in that group with Mitchell, Booker, Ja, Fox, and maybe Jamal Murray where team record is going to be a big part of whether they get selected or not."
"Honestly DeMar can play 4 positions pretty well. He’s a better playmaker than Kyrie, Kemba, Jamal Murray, and some other high scoring point guards"
"Probably because, the way it played out, you guys were the comparatively healthier team for every series this playoffs except the finals by a sizable margin.   CP3 had his shoulder injury to contend with throughout, and the COVID protocol had me sweating cause I was hard rooting for a Suns-Hawks finals once the Lakers were knocked out, but a 70%-of-full-strength-CP3 that missed 2 games all post season is objectively a better injury situation than the Lakers (LeBron at 70% due to ankle injury, AD and KCP out for the close out games), Nuggets (Jamal Murray out for the series, MPJ at 70% due to his back injury), and Clippers (Kawhi and Ibaka out for the series). All of these teams had either their best or 2nd best player out for all or a significant portion of their series, as well as key role player starters playing injured or not playing at all. Meanwhile the running joke on this sub was that CP3 was sacrificing bench players to the injury gods to keep himself and the rest of the suns starters healthy for the playoff run.   I hate the concept of asterisk championships or playoff runs. Injuries are a fact of the game and it should be considered a skill in and of itself to remain healthy and available and the Suns did that better than every Western team they faced. It’s incredible how CP3 elevated the young core of the Suns to championship contenders at his age and so immediately. But maybe the injury angle isn’t the option to go for if you wanna garner legacy points for the 2021 Suns."
How would Jamal Murray be winning scoring titles and not be all-nba?
"Also in the Carmelo Anthony trade to the Knicks 3 draft picks involved in the trade are recognizable players today. The picks used to select Dario Saric, Jamal Murray, and Jakob Poeltl we’re all traded in that one transaction."
"Teams in the mid-2010s (or trades from before then) that traded 1sts years in the future. How did they turn out? I think while there are examples like the Nets/Celtics, and even the Knicks w/ Jamal Murray in the Melo trade - most teams that take lottery tickets of 1sts 5-6 years down the line end up losing."
You want Jamal Murray to play for the KW Titans?
"Jamal Crawford's ProAm league he hosts in Seattle. A lot of Seattle/Washington-based players like to go there like Isaiah Thomas, Zach Lavine, etc which brings in non-Seattle/Washington-based players like Poole. There was even a game between KPJ and Dejounte Murray there yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9hDy7cgAAs"
AD literally lost his all-nba center and was the 6th seed and the Blazers were backed by Vegas. Even if you think AD had the better team there is no excuse for a 6th seed sweeping a 3rd seed unless injuries occurred.  Nuggets were 3rd seed and didn’t have Jamal Murray this year and they still handled the Blazers.
"Dove at Westbrook’s knees, Closelined Jamal Murray, shoved CP3 after getting salty, talks tons of shit constantly. Yeah wonder why people hate him? Who knows"
"I think an east all-stars vs west all-stars (all american players) and a Europe vs rest of the world team in a semifinal, and then a final between the winners would be really fun.  It could be like:   East: KD, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Zion etc.  West: Steph, Lebron, AD, Booker, Kawhi etc  Europe: Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Gobert, Tingus Pingus etc (lowkey a death lineup)  Rest of the world: Embiid, KAT, Jamal Murray, Zhou Qi, Simmons, SGA etc.   The non-europe world team would be the worst IMO, but you never know."
And Jamal Murray was looking like Michael Jordan last year
jamal murray is canadian
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
Jamal Murray is pretty good
"There’s always an unlikely source.   Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon for Dame?  LeVert and Sabonis for Dame?  Lauri, Williams, Coby White for Dame?  This may start the framework of some deal, but there are teams and pieces out there."
Jamal Murray does too bad he’s Canadian
"Lakers- if I could guarantee full health, Jamal Murray and Malcolm Brogdon   If health can’t be confirmed, SGA and Brogdon"
This guy puts up Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray before Lowry... 🤦‍♂️
Mannnn if Jamal Murray was healthy I would say he would be top five easy
Jamal Murray
"It's hard to know, and it doesnt necessarily have to be sulking. Imagine the Nuggets came up with a package around Jamal Murray and picks. Denver has similar injury luck and loses in the 2nd round. Harden makes it clear he won't resign. You have to trade him right? And, you're certainly not getting back anything like Jamal Murry. You potentially crippled your franchise.   It seems pretty understandable to me why teams that Harden didn't want to play for didn't give up big assets to try to swing a deal."
"It is relevant people who dont apply context are so stupid. Imagine thinking giannis missing two games and not having fucking DIVINCENZO of all players is the same as missing Kyrie and Harden, Kawhi, or even Jamal Murray lol."
"Jamal Murray is someone that shocked me.  I thought the guy was like 27-28, but turns out he is only 24."
"Lakers, Jazz and Suns sure. Mavs I don't know, depends on how they surround Luka, Nuggets won't have Jamal Murray for the bulk of the season so that's a big blow and the rest are unknowns, we'll need to retool as well (we have i think it's 8 players under contract as it is) so if things go right in this hypothetical world a 6th seed isn't out of the realm of possibility"
Jamal Murray and picks for Dame
I agree with looking for a blue chip prospect in addition to picks.  The only problem is I don't think we got that offer.  I would've loved to get what OKC got for Paul George. They got hella picks in addition to Shai Gilgeous Alexander. The nets just didn't have an appealing young player and i'm not convinced any NBA team out there made an offer like that for Harden.  They added more pick swaps on top of hella picks to compensate.  James Harden is 32 and only ones that even wanted to go all in on him were win now contenders who didn't really have appealing young players.  It's not like we were offered Jamal Murray. Hell [This Denver Nuggets source says they never even offered MPJ plus hella picks](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/22/nuggets-jamal-murray-james-harden-trade-rumor/)  Jokic only 26 so I doubt their picks ever good anyway though.
The Nuggets. Jamal Murray for Ben Simmons.
Jamal Murray
"Not really. Jamal Murray will be out most of the year. Who knows how he looks when he returns, you usually want to wait till a full year plus the offseason to judge guys.   And they still play trash defense in the playoffs."
Jamal Murray will miss the majority of the season so yeah they will be fighting for the lower seeds tbh.
"Honestly, I like the 2016 draft a lot with a small lineup. Go with Simmons, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, and Sabonis. Still behind the 2012 lineup, but that's a good team to surround Simmons with a bunch of 3 point shooters around him."
Jamal Murray as well
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it’s looking like he’s well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let’s see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I’d say it’s the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He’s averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he’s not super-efficient, his numbers don’t contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he’s fun and it’s good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren’t great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don’t hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year’s trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that’s it. He can’t pass the ball at a high level and he’s a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
The one gif where he photoshopped Kyrie throwing the ball away after a big jamal murray game into Kyrie throwing a globe in lebron's face is my favourite.
"Wasn't he supposed to prove a lot of people wrong last year after laying an egg in the bubble playoffs? Raptor fans are quick to forget that even before the pandemic, he was criticized a LOT for not showing up against big teams. Have you not seen that movie before with DeRozan?  There were a lot of REVENGE SZN posts during the offseason. He even had a YouTube special about his ""humble hustle"" and how he's going to ""prove people wrong"". What happened there? Team record aside, his 3 point shooting fell off a cliff and once again, he disappeared during clutch situations. Remember how the Raptors suspended him for a game for reasons undisclosed? Not concerning at all? He's like the anti-Jamal Murray.   He's a very, very good player but he's just a high level role player.   And next season he's going to miss the first month coming off a major surgery and another offseason of development wasted. Remember how people said he only sucked in the bubble because he didn't play during the lockdown? Imagine how much he'll suck after half a year of zero basketball coming off a major surgery.   He ain't proving shit so sell high."
"What you mean, they better be all stars? Have you seen the list of 2nd picks? The majority of them aren’t all stars. And the 7th pick is even worse. The only other 7th pick that was picked in the last decade to become an all star like Randle is Jamal Murray. After that you have a lot of role players and guys struggling to be in the league. So i guess I don’t get your argument."
Sure fire jamal murray level player is better than a top 3 pick
"Yes they beat them this year, but Nuggets will have a healthy Jamal Murray, Lakers will get better and be healthy, Suns probably not going away, Warriors are one trade away from contending again. I don’t think the Clippers going to make much noise being a 7th or 8th seed."
"Yep, I think any organization would take a sure fire Jamal Murray level player from any pick other than a top three pick in a strong draft."
Jamal murray?
"Yeah I think expectations should be lower. Expecting Giannis/Kawhi or DMitchell/DBook level production out of the 10-15 range is unfair. Those are anomolies. I even think Jamal Murray at 7th pick is quite good.  We drafted Killian Hayes at No 7. While I think (and this is generous) he has skills that could turn him into an All-Star level player, I would be pretty happy if he could play alongside whoever we draft this year and run some good offense while our star is on the bench.  There are so many factors that shape a draft picks transition into the NBA, some of them are very much out of their control, so I think it is unfair to try and evaluate every lottery pick as if it could be a potential star."
Bro it's so bad Jamal Murray accidentally uploaded an IG story of it and his gf was asking people to take it down
"I mean, you're basically saying that you'd rather pay Jamal Murray 2 max slots than not have him. Seems like a crazy overvaluation of the guy."
Jamal Murray raw  Also Jokic's 5 year extension was pretty low compared to other superstars. Jamal Murray actually makes more than him lol
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
Kawhi couldn’t even clamp Jamal Murray
"DEN will be without Jamal Murray for the entirety of next season as well. They got swept by PHX without Murray, LAC took PHX to 6 without Kawhi. POR might blow it up. I do expect MIN, SAC and NOP to improve somewhat, but they won't suddenly make a significant leap to 2nd round playoff teams unless one of them goes out and gets a Damian Lillard or Bradley Beal."
I mean if Jamal Murray plays anything like the bubble I don't think it'll be too bad for them
"Nah that’s pretty much an ACL thing, I mean Klay prob would have still missed the whole season had he only injured his ACL and not also the Achilles. Hell I think Jamal Murray prob sits out the whole season too if he sees fit and people wouldn’t say a negative thing about it"
Didn't Jamal Murray just get his operated on within a few days of tearing it?
"Shai, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson starting 5"
Have you forgot about Jamal Murray?
"Wiseman is younger now than Ayton was when we was drafted. Look at the list of players who have gone 7 overall in the last few years, Steph, Jamal Murray, Julias Randle, Killian Hayes, Harrison Barnes, Eric Gordon, Harrison Barnes  It actually has one of the highest hit rates of any draft pick"
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, Will Barton for Dame, RoCo  Then Aaron Gordon for Norman Powell Sign and Trade"
And they were 1 game away from the conference finals  too bad Jamal Murray shot 4/18 in that game 7 and they lost
"Did you even read my post. It's splitting hairs between 21 year old Jamal Murray and current Booker, and no one was anointing Murray a superstar."
"You don't even realize I'm talking about the Jamal Murray from three years ago, do you?"
Jamal Murray is better at getting head
Pretty disrespectful to Down-3-Games-to-1 Jamal Murray.
"Saying the Suns got lucky is the same thing as someone who got struck by lightning and survived is lucky. Ya they are lucky to survive but they got strucked by lightning in the first place. Lakers, Nuggets, and Clippers were favorites to win it all and Lakers were ranked number 1 defense even without AD, Nuggets had a better record post Jamal Murray Injury because MPJ broke out, and Clippers beat the Jazz. If none of these teams had injuries, it would have been the hardest run ever for a top seeded team. It isn't like the Suns played against the Rockets without Tmac and Yao Ming broke his foot and the Rockets still took them to 7 games like it happened to the Lakers."
" Improvement team: This is tough without seeing all the offseason moves but i really like the Al Horford add for the Celtics and a full year with Fournier alongside Smart, Brown, Tatum is solid. If they’re healthy, they can be a 50 win team.  Decline: I doubt Denver without Jamal Murray for majority of the season in the West can be a 50 win team(54 win pace team last season if it was 82 games)."
"Pels: Ingram, NAW, Lonzo, and #10  Knicks: RJ Barrett, Quickley, Robinson, Knox, 3 FRPs  Raptors: FVV, OG, #4, and 2 future FRPs.  Nuggets: Jamal Murray, Nnaji, #26, and a future FRP  In my opinion, it’s very unlikely Lillard will end up in a Dubs jersey. Wiseman is looking like a bust and the 7/14 picks don’t wow me."
"&gt; Where are the better deals for him this offseason? Serious question.  You're not going to find much better than a Wiseman/Ben Simmons type this season. Nobody is going to give up a prospect like SGA or Anthony Edwards, most of those teams would trade their key young guy for Dame and be in the same position: unable to contend. Everyone in this thread just hasn't thought long enough about who could realistically trade for Dame and what would make sense.  Like Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown etc. are your BEST case scenario players. Guy on their second contract making near Max or max money, on a team that has a realistic chance to compete if they trade for Dame."
"I think there’s better offers than what the Warriors could give unless Klay Thompson is involved.   OKC could give them Shai and all the picks  Denver could give something involving Jamal Murray  Pelicans could probably try something like Bledsoe and Ingram for Dame  Knicks have Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Knox they could use in a possible deal  Nets could always offer a Kyrie swap  If the Heat believes in Precious, they could always move Bam"

"I mean I’m Greek American and I feel like he should be also known as Nigerian first because that’s actually what he prefers saying he grew up with his parents Nigerian culture in his house but if we really wanna be specific about it people give these nicknames to players all the time from where they are born, Andrew Wiggins and Jamal Murray both are referred to (in jest) as maple Jordan and maple curry because they were born in Canada but obviously calling someone Canadian isn’t seen as taking away their ethnicity, it’s their nationality so that’s why he just gets called greek freak, it rhymes and it’s true he’s a freak. I remember an nfl runningback used to be called the Nigerian nightmare, Giannis could have a cool nickname like that with his ethnicity but Greek freak stuck."
Same could be said for the suns right?  Injured AD and Lebron   Injured Jamal Murray   Injured Kawhi and Ibaka
Neither would Jamal Murray am I right????
Jamal Murray woulda scored 100. I know you never heard of him and he avg 16ppg but hes real important
"Lebron and ad, hurt.  Jamal Murray, hurt.  Kawhi, hurt.  Giannis hurt.  Enjoy your mickey mouse ring Phoenix"
Wasn't just Jamal tho. Nuggets starting backcourt was Facu and Austin Rivers lol. That's such a huge downgrade from Murray/Barton/Dozier. Also before Jamals injury the Nuggets were playing as well as anyone in the league after the AG trade.
"This might be my homer goggles speaking. I agree with you about both LA teams but I don’t believe Jamal Murray is the difference between a suns sweep and a win for the nuggets team. I believe only Kawhi, Lebron, KD, jokic are capable of that kind of win differential."
"Sorry Nuggs bros, but I would be fielding all calls asking about Murray. A super dynamic guard on a max deal, tearing up his knee at age 23? Sorry, it's a business move.  Hundreds of promising young guards have been taken out of the league like that. I would downgrade Jamal from perennial all star to... Ricky Rubio at this point. I think the injury is that serious and will likely lead to more knee injuries down the road. That's a lot of risk for a max player when you are in a championship window."
"&gt; Why would they trade away a guy who has dropped like a dozen 40/50 point games in the playoffs for two playoff underperformers?  To play doubles advocate, Jamal Murray will never again be the player he was. It is highly likely he will blow out his other knee in the next 2-3 years, too (I think the stats say 60%-70%?). Maybe they want to trade him now while his value is still really high instead of taking that risk."
Team Canada would have done some damage if not for Jamal Murray being down mostly
The notoriously injury prone Jamal Murray.
"I don’t think you can just say the lakers or nuggets would lose, lakers were up 2-1 before AD went out. ( I know CP3 was very hurt but Lebron wasn’t 100% either) the nuggets matchup is also very interesting, because Jamal murray in the playoffs is a deeeeeemon, and always seems to kill book.  Glad we’re aware about the clippers series tho. Beating the bucks is impressive, but jrue and Middleton have been reeeeallly bad. I’m not trying to take anything away from you guys I know it seems like I am I’m just trying to be real. Congrats on the chip"
"Not sure what you’re trying to say here. I don’t know the first decade well enough to disagree on, and I agree on the Russell/ Celtics domination era, but you lose me after that The 70s were the wilderness years, it started well with Bradley &amp; Clyde Knicks, but Cocaine really hurt the league later.  The 80s is Magic &amp; Bird &amp; massive growth, but the 1981 “clarification” of zone defense ushered in the era of isolation (insane illegal defense calls).  The 90s is Jordan/Pippen Bulls domination &amp; clarity on how isolation was ruining the game.  2000-2010 is the return of fluid basketball &amp; the beginning of the 3-pt era.   2010-2020 is LeBron domination &amp; the 3-pt revolution hitting it’s stride, in large part behind Steph Curry.  This is shaping up to be a golden age as superstars are appearing all over the place. Here’s hoping Trae Young, Zion Williamson, Jamal Murray,Luka Doncic, Ja Morant, &amp; all the rest stay healthy because the NBA has never been more fun to watch than it is right now."
jamal murray sga
Only thing about a violent dunk that i remember is that Jamal Murray jam when he received a charge instead
If Jamal Murray is out... flip a coin.  That's without Klay able to give positive contribution.  Murray got injured in April.
Jamal Murray out til 2022-23?
"You’re right. Y’all really shutdown Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard."
"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
Ben Simmons is the most obvious candidate   Jamal Murray is the dark horse candidate
"&gt; Something they've had success with is that empty side pnr with Middleton and Giannis, but maybe easier said than done to continually get to that setup  It is. Empty side pick and rolls are also reliant on not using them that often otherwise defenses can start shading towards the roll and cutting off angles too easily if they know it’s coming. Also works a lot better if the defense is basically playing the pick on roll 2 v 2.   I think Jrues biggest issue in the pick and roll is he doesn’t do that much to to truly stress/scramble a defense you kind of know what’s coming. Reads are often telegraphed his intentions to drive when he has it in certain spots are clear. Not a big change of direction stop on a dime type either from a movement perspective. He’s not that creative an offensive player per se and when I mean creative think someone like Jamal Murray."
"Jamal Murray is definitely better than kris Middleton,  And I’d put Trae young over DBook"
"Ben Gordon, the spiritual bridge between Rip Hamilton and Kemba Walker, an undersized Bradley Beal with the scoring ability of a Montae Ellis Donovan Mitchell hybrid, with CJ McCollums shooting on Jamal Murray type range, would’ve been the ideal pairing for a guard like prime d-rose in today’s modern NBa."
young players that are about to get paid their dues get shit on constantly on this sub for years. john collins and collin sexton are the victims this year  jamal murray and jaylen brown are also recent examples
You hurt my feelings!!! Lmao I’m not going In there next to Jamal “not an All Star” Murray
"Nobody is 100% at this time of year. You're moving the goalposts again- we went from talking about players missing time to players playing at some hypothetical level of optimum health.   And no, you're offering a lot of circumstantial evidence and framing it as certain causation, but it's not conclusive. In logical terms, its essentially the difference between a necessary cause and a sufficient cause: while it is true that the mental health/condensed schedule elements are consistent with a higher level of injuries, it is not necessarily true it must be the cause. Consider Kawhi, who only played 52/72 games because of load management. He still got injured at the wrong time. AD missed most of the season, only playing 36 games, and should have been rested for the Playoffs, but he still got injured. Jamal Murray went down after only 48 games.   Was the condensed season a factor? Maybe. It's hard to say without actual studies done on the players' health. There are plenty of players who had healthy seasons this year. And, going back to the original point of contention, it isn't like this level of injuries we're seeing in the playoffs is unprecedented."
"To preface this I don’t mean any offense by anything I’m about to say, I’m super happy for players, coaches, fans you all deserve it for sticking with your team throughout the shitty years. I’m not trying to rain on anybody’s parade, I lived in chandler for 2 years and played with cam Johnson’s lil bro, don’t take this the wrong way.  If I’m looking at the finals teams Of say the last 5 -10 years besides last years heat they are easily the weakest finals teams. They don’t have top 10 player, you could argue they don’t have a top 15 player. Chris Paul is amazing but he only starts playing up to his potential in the second half of games. When was the last time a team won the finals without a top 10 player? I don’t even remember.  Another thing that makes me doubt that the suns aren’t as good as people like to act like they are is because they haven’t really been tested by a real good team yet. If Middleton and holiday can play up to their potential it would actually be a good series and we could find out more about the suns if they’re for real or not.  The fact that the clippers without probably the best playoff player alive right now along with KD and bron, no ibaka, and a hobbled Marcus Morris took the suns to 6? Last years lakers would have beaten the clippers who played the suns in 4.   If the teams rematch next year healthy I honestly expect the clippers to win in 5. Every single of the clippers losses besides game 6 where they just ran out of gas were single digit super close games. I’m not going to argue about the calls at the end of games, but they could very well have called ayton for a push off in game 2 and they could have called the ball going out on cam Payne in game 4. Again I’m not saying they should have made those calls, I’m just saying it’s very realistic that they could have.   Booker just had his first efficient game since game 1 against the clippers and nobody is talking about how underwhelming he’s been because the suns have literally had no adversity.   There is a reason the lakers even with Lebron hobbled and a bad supporting cast were up 2-1 on the suns until AD got hurt. The only team that I could say the suns realistically beat if everybody is healthy is the nuggets and even that I’m not sure about because playoff Jamal murray is a demon. They might have beaten the lakers fully healthy ill give them that one because the lakers weren’t as good this year, but there is no scenario in gods green earth that the suns beat the clippers with kawhi alone healthy.   Next season should be very interesting and I hope we see a fully healthy playoff run for all teams so we can find out who is really at the top. Congrats on your guys’ chip tho."
"This is why you always need proof of an oral contract, Nurse should have pulled a Jamal Murray"
"I'm not sure Simmons gets through on this. He's damaged goods right now. I replace him with Jamal Murray. Donovan Mitchell is also suspect, I might even take damaged Simmons over him."
"Jamal Murray single handedly ruined two 3-1 leads last year. To think that we’d get swept with him starting is laughable, similar to your playoff run. You can’t beat uninjured teams. That’s why this year is one and done and also an asterisk. Be true to yourself."
Jamal Murray should be the third option
"Yeah I mean the elite pick and roll guard is always the dream. But what you really need is something that really stresses a defense. Can come a couple different ways.   a) Elite playmaking. Free flowing, guys who can make complex reads, put defense in rotation. Milwaukee blatantly lacks this. KM Jrue Giannis all telegraph reads.   b) Elite floor spacing. Dirty little secret about Mil this team lacks true high level floor spacing regardless of what %s tell you. Only Middleton has real gravity. Teams help off Jrue, Lopez, PJ, Portis, DiVicenzo regardless of their %s it just is reality theyll let them shoot. Again nothing that is difficult ot game plan against in this sense.   c) Off ball movement, Jrue used to play off ball well in NOP, KM back in the day could do this, just hasnt manifested itself though here. Blame Bud, blame many factors but it's reality they are stationary and dont get system buckets  d) Individual offensive creativity. Nebulous concept but to symbolize it think Jamal Murray. Back cuts, cuts to set up openings for others, DHO give and go game, he kind of plays spontaneously and can improvise and free flow alot on the fly. Which stresses a defense alot. Buck players dont have this when they are in certain spots you know what's coming. KM pick and roll = looking for a 17 foot pull up no threat of much else as an ex. Again all the telegraphed reads, they dont catch you off guard and rarely stress you with multiple different threats to account for at once."
I think even just a Jamal Murray / Kyle Lowry level player would be enough for the Bucks as an upgrade over KMid
"I think he’d be a somewhat of an interesting fit conceptually on the Clippers in a sort of all-wing line-up with PG, Kawhi and Marcus Morris, but I don’t see any way that gets done as it would have to be a sign-and-trade which hard-caps the receiving team and as it stands currently they’d be over the apron. They’d need to send out significantly more salary than they would be taking in (killing their depth), find teams willing to take on those salaries, and then they’d have to fill out the rest of the roster with as cheap of contracts as possible (killing their depth further). It’s just not feasible given their salary cap situation. For the Lakers I agree it kills their spacing and there is probably other things they can do to more effectively put a better team around LeBron and AD to play to their strengths during whatever window they have left for title contention. I don’t think it would be the absolute worst move, but also not the best thing they could do. The Lakers could more realistically pull it off financially but they’d run into the same issues of unnecessarily hindering their flexibility to fill out the roster and would essentially have a 3 player team. I’m not sure where he ends up but I don’t think it will be in Los Angeles. My best guess is that he ends up back in San Antonio on a reasonable contract and they work with him to move him to a destination he wants later on. I do think he can still contribute to a playoff team, but finding the one that fits is difficult. As for other options, the Kings or Pacers (as suggested by Reddish_5) might be interested in his creation ability. Maybe the Nuggets as a short-term Jamal Murray fill-in?"
Isn’t Jamal Murray the closest thing?
"And what else does Jamal Murray besides score? You know, the guy who would have flipped a sweep the other way."
Jamal Murray seems to match Curry's playstyle much more
Ok? Laker series LeBron was playing at probably 60% and AD was out half of it. Against the nuggets no Jamal Murray. Against the clips no kawhi and it was still a close series. Why bash the bucks but not the suns lol
"Nah. I'm a big Jamal Murray fan, but they lost in 5 to the Lakers last year"
"Lebron, AD, Jamal Murray, Kawahi"
"Sometimes they do, most of the time they don’t. Jamal Murray has a 50 point playoff game but he sure aint better than Steph."
Or Jamal Murray
"I forgot Zion &amp; Mitchell, just added them.  Which Murray you talking about? Jamal Murray is Canadian.  And with Mitchell on there no room for Ant..."
Depends on if it's Jamal Murray or Dejounte Murray
JAMAL MURRAY
Jamal Murray posted…….. something else
"Haha yeah I'm glad you didn't take that the wrong way as I was just giving you a hard time. But yeah to be fair, even looking back outside of Giannis and Gobert a good number of those players in that draft have been pretty injury prone and/or just good enough to not make all star team. 2013 draft has only had 3 all stars, 2016 for example already has had 5 and the argument for Jamal Murray being damn near close would make 6."
He has a point. The shortened offseason ravaged teams with injuries. Just look at the past four conference finalists. 3 out of 4 got kicked out in the first round. Heat got fucked by injuries and COVID early on and were never the same. Celtics had a season ending injury to Jaylen Brown. Lakers had debilitating injuries to both Lebron and AD.  Denver made it past the first round but they never had a chance because they lost Jamal Murray to a season ending injury.
"Because not only is KD bigger than Dame in terms of fame, the Blazers were better than the Nuggets.  No disrespect to either teams, and I do recognize that a lot of Blazers players had disappointing performances (particularly McCollum), but the Nuggets had no Jamal Murray and Will Barton. Their starting backcourt was Rivers and Campazzo, with almost no shot creation outside of Jokic. The Blazers were clearly more talented and were generally expected to win.   Might as well blame the Blazers defense, certainly giving up 120 points per game to a team like that was pretty embarrassing."
"&gt;Suns then played a Denver team with no Jamal Murray, the second best player on the Nuggets.  Lets not pretend that the Nuggets with Murray were gonna win anything lol"
Suns beat the Nuggets by an average if 18 points per game... does Jamal Murray really counteract that?
"Nets easily beat the Bucks with a healthy Harden and Kyrie. They almost lost against just KD pretty much.   Suns went to six games with the Lakers, and that was with an injured Lebron and decoy Anthony Davis.   Suns then played a Denver team with no Jamal Murray, the second best player on the Nuggests.  Suns then played The Clippers with their best player in Kawhi not being able to play.   Suns are now playing the Bucks with their star player having ligament bruising/sprain.   That's just off the top of my head. Pretty sure Donovan Mitchell was injured at one point as well as Conley. Joel Embid also had injury questions with his knees as well.  There have plenty of series deciding injuries that have happened right before or during these playoffs that have changed the entire landscape. Suns don't get past a fully healthy lakers, I'm not even sure if they get past a fully healthy Denver. They have had break after break after break."
Jamal Murray would be the GOAT if he was transported to the 70s/80s (pre ACL)
players today would reign hell upon the 80s/90s lmfao. Jamal Murray would be the GOAT if he played in the 80s.
So you posted a tweet meme that’s literally not relevant. Like zero relation to anything being said. Mark Cuban and Deandre Jordan have ZERO relevance to an injured Jamal Murray. And your zero effort reference to that tired tweet is funny to you? Be my guest but it’s been a tired tweet for years now and you added nothing new to the conversation.
"Everybody loves the game, but yet underrate their competition as a team without Jamal Murray because of the Suns series. The game and the series Lillard had hasnt maintained its praise it deserved because of that. Without Jamal the Nuggets were a really good, top 4 seed level team. Going to be crazy when Jamal gets back.   Then, with the underrating of the Nuggets, this game doesn’t look as impressive. Giving the Nuggets their due just shows what Dame did accomplish was hella impressive, even if they lost in 6"
"Guys, its Dario Saric. Like, damn wasn't it convenient enough Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, &amp; Kawhi Leonard went down? Gotta go through some trial &amp; tribulations."
Jamal Murray is the best player in the league without an all-star appearance.
"Lol hell no, all the athletes are at Old Town. Jamal Murray just took a pic with the Suns in 4 guy there"
They have 7 posts in the past two days with Jamal Murray in the title lmao
Suns blow out the Lakers as soon as CP's shoulder is better. Suns win in 6 easy.   Sweep the nuggets. Blowing them out in every win. Easy win. Jamal Murray isn't an all-star.   Clips lost 2 games to suns without CP. They find issues with trying to fit CP into lineup causing the clips to win a couple. Still beat clips in 6. If we say Kawhi gets healthy then I can say CP doesn't miss any games and suns don't struggle to fit CP in.   Suns would've won every series regardless of injury. Easy championships.
"exactly it's just stupid to ignore the fact the suns benefited *heavily* from injuries to key players at every step along the way. It's also stupid to ignore the fact that the suns have been elite this whole season AND postseason, regardless of who they played. Sure, maybe they don't make the finals if AD, Kawhi, or Jamal Murray are healthy, but maybe the still do win, we'll never know. But it doesn't take anything away from what they've accomplished"
Listen man.. Jamal is Canadian. We basically all grow up scrappin and then shaking hands afterwards from hockey. I remember getting taught that shit in the 3rd grade from the school's vice principal. Murray probably thinks this dude and the situation is hilarious because... well it just objectively is.  So just chill and have a laugh about it. Everyone else is.
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"No AD for basically half a series, no Jamal Murray, no Kawhi. C’mon man. Their run is impressive but not *that* impressive."
Jamal Murray signing with Esports org NRG confirmed
"I think the Jamal Murray and the Nuggets disagree.  There's no *good* time to suffer a catastrophic injury, but at least Saric got to experience an amazing playoff run and has a good chance of getting a ring."
"lol that Suns dude is becoming a legend.   He basically fucked those Nuggets guys up physically, then mentally with the Suns in 4 comment, and now emotionally while he's out clubbing with their bae Jamal Murray lol"
Jamal Murray heel turn! Next step he is going to take a steel chair to Jokic's back.
"Jamal Murray seems to change his mind quickly, perhaps he's a bandwagon fan when he's off work."
Imagine thinking Jamal Murray was even remotely the only nugget injured lol. Why tf do you think they were starting Austin rivers and facu to begin with?
"Almost certainly?? Did you watch the series? The suns stomped on Denver and I’m sure having Jamal Murray makes it more competitive, but there’s no reason to believe they make it passed the suns let alone as confident as you sound about it. It’s not like their best player/MVP was out as well"
After what I saw Jamal Murray do in the bubble...he gets the number one pick. Jaylen Brown 2nd cause of his two way skills but he still can't get a bucket like Jamal. Then it's between Simmons and Brandon Ingram depending on what you're looking for. Defense or offense. Actually you'd be better served with Siakim at 3rd or 2nd and then Simmons and BI can fight for that 4th pick.
"Michael Porter Jr. With Jamal Murray out for most (all?) of the regular season, MPJ has a chance to fill some big shoes. If he continues to develop and breaks out to an All-Star or near-All-Star level, then he'd be in the MIP mix."
"&gt;Jokic was the best individual player that series.   Then why was he soundly outplayed by both LeBron and AD?   &gt;Jokic got the whole defense  I guess Denver forgot to defend LeBron and AD then?   Come on, this is a ridiculous take. Jokic wasn't even the best player on his team in that series as Jamal Murray was the one that really stepped up, averaging more points (25 ppg) and assists (7.4 apg) than Jokic did (21.8 &amp; 5). The Lakers had to spend as much effort defending Murray as they did Jokic, same with the Jazz and Clippers. Acting like Jokic was all alone out there is absurd."
"Jaylen Brown is my pick too. All around great player, one of the best 2-way players in the game. Has a versatile game strategy and the flexibility to adapt to different defenses. He's one of my favorite players in the game based solely on his skillset and mentality. He's one of those players that you can slot in at multiple positions on any team and have something special every time.  Jamal Murray is a close 2nd in my mind. He's explosive, confident, and has the skillset to be the scoring option that many teams lack. Jokic and Murray are a great fit as they can pick up each other's slack on off days and command the floor when needed."
Jamal Murray is number one for me. Put Simmons at 5th place and thats it. None of those other players pull playoffs game like him. He play with a MVP but often when it matter feel like the best player of the team. Too bad he got injured but lets not have short memory here.
"1. Ben Simmons  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Domantas Sabonis  4. Brandon Ingram  5. Pascal Siakam  6. Jamal Murray  7. Malcolm Brogdan  8. Dejounte Murray  9. Caris LeVert  10. Buddy Hield  11. Fred VanVleet  12. Malik Beasely  13. Jakob Poeltl  14. Alex Caruso   I understand that this may be controversial so please enlighten me on how I'm wrong, but please keep the Ben Simmons slander to a decent level. We can't just pretend he isn't a great player."
"I don’t see the case for Murray over Siakam. Pascal has an all-star start, all-nba 2nd team selection and championship ring as a top 3 player on that 2019 team. Even this past season in what was widely considered a “down year” for Pascal, he scored and assisted at essentially the same rate as Murray, and while Jamal has an advantage in terms of efficiency, Pascal’s massive advantage defensively leaves no room to argue for Murray."
Who tf puts these together and do they watch/like basketball? Forget Simmons still going #1 over players like Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown where their GMs would hang up if Morey called with a straight swap……But they have Zubac AND Poeltl going over Caris Levert this with the benefit of hindsight. What a pointless exercise. They zero credibility so it doesn’t even spark a real debate.
"Jamal Murray averaged 21pts, JB averaged 24 on better efficiency and he's inarguably better than Murray at everything other than scoring so I'm not sure what you're basing this on."
"Hell no give me jaylen brown, Brandon Ingram sabonis and Jamal Murray over simmons right now"
"He's not ""far and away"" better than Jamal Murray"
"This is an interesting draft cause there are 4-5 guys with arguments here. Between remaining potential, what they’ve done so far, fit, it could still be Ben, it probably would be brown, but there’s also arguments for Jamal Murray, Brandon Ingram and Domantas Sabonis"
"It was Jamal Murray and Bradley Beal for me, although that was more a couple of years ago they don't piss me off as much anymore. I think it's easy to misinterpret their confidence as arrogance for some reason"
"MCW’s first game is obvious, but Linsanity is probably never happening again.   The Jamal Murray vs Donovan Mitchell series we just experienced, especially the 50 v 50 game, was something really unique and special and I doubt either player is ever that good again."
"I kind of agree with this choice, but it's hard to say it is a one hit wonder, when he got injured right after and didn't have a chance to to show if that was a new him or not.  It was kind of like a lower version of Jamal Murray.  Still solid during the year but showed a new level during the bubble."
Idk what happens to this dude and Jamal Murray in the playoffs...
&gt;complete wash on defense  Not true at all. Jamal actually gives effort on that end.   Also Murray being a superior shooter and better pnr player makes him the better playmaker
No one said remove it. I’m saying look at it through a larger scope than just the bubble. It’s pretty clear to anyone who isn’t biased that fox is better. Basically equivalent offense (although fox is a superior playmaker and that gives him an edge for me) and a complete wash on defense obviously. Also who’s shitting on Jamal Murray? I love Jamal Murray. But I’m not gonna lie and say he better than fox. Stop dick-eating
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"Steph, Dame, Kyrie, CP3, Russ, Ja, Jamal Murray, Jrue Holiday, Luka, Trae, Lowry, Conley. Not in that order but they are above Ben Simmons. So probably 13-14. It’s a tossup between him and Fox since both of them have non-existent playoff performances anyway. In the RS, Ben has Fox beat in everything except points. So probably Ben but by a tiny margin."
Fat Lever over Jamal Murray.
"No one is hanging in the air like Jordan. None of the players listed in the other comments do anything like this. Jamal Murray is close (like 65-75%) but he has more horizontal movement, not vertical I’m my opinion. Murray just as tricky but doesn’t nearly do the floating easy adjustments like MJ"
I think Jamal Murray had a similar jordanesque layup but no one really has the hangtime/mid flight body control as MJ. Most players' similar highlight moves are just routine for jordan
"Heat fan here.  Lillard, Curry, Doncic, Westbrook, Kyrie, Jrue, CP3, Trae, Fox, and Brogdon are better imo  EDIT: Jamal Murray too"
"Curry, Holiday, Dame, Russ, Kyrie, Harden, CP3, Trae Young, Luka, Jamal Murray"
1 Jamal Murray is killer his playoff performances should be proof enough 2 Trae/Ja/Shai no particular order but Shai would be my pick for the best 2 3A lamelo 3b DFox 4 MPJ
"Ranking for right now, not for potential:  1. Trae. Great playmaker, proven playoff performer, good shooter but also good at getting to the line and has a nice floater/drive. Not a good defender, but no longer the worst in the league.  2. SGA: put up efficient scoring and playmaking numbers last year despite having Dort/Horford as his only NBA-level teammates. He’s a really promising combo guard, legit playmaker and great scorer.  3. Fox: had a great year last year in a Kings team that doesn’t have much coaching. He’s not the playmaker that Trae is (IMO) and not as well-rounded as SGA, so he falls a bit.  4. Jamal: efficient combo guard who can consistently average 20 and has the ability to go off for 50. Can play well offball, good in the PNR, solid playmaker. Not a bad player at all but I’m not sure he’s the type of lead guy the first three are, assuming Bubble Murray is a fluke.  5. Ja: his shot isn’t great, nor is his defense, but he’s incredibly bouncy, a good playmaker, and he has that “it” factor. Again, this is just ranking for now, going off potential Ja would be much higher. He has a great mentality and is a team leader, on top of his basketball ability.  6. MPJ: not a guard so not sure why he’s here. Absolutely offensive flamethrower, especially from three, but his defense sucks and he’s a non-passer; if the ball ends up in his hands, it’s ending the play in his hands, be it a make or miss. I think the other players are more well-rounded than he is, but, again, potential is sky-high.  7. LaMelo: promising because he has that ability to make every pass, but below these guys because he’s still a rookie and adjusting. Love the guy but I don’t think it’s fair to have him in conversation with multiple All-Stars and several guys who’ve shown up in the playoffs."
Bubble Murray really elevates Jamal Murray stocks
"The thing is I’m not and I’m surprised you see it as that lol. I’m a minority and lived in really Mexican and Asian cities for big portions of my life and always had a diverse group of friends even in college. White dudes being the most attractive to my female friends is really common to the point I’m shocked people think I’m forcing a race narrative right now. When all you see growing up is attractive white dudes in super hero capes, you’re gonna find them attractive.   To bring it back to the nba, Jamal Murray is objectively a better player, popped off in the bubble, and subjectively hotter than Tyler herro. He’s also not a zoomer celeb. It’s not a woke narrative it’s just facts and maybe you grew up in a different environment where it wasn’t obvious to you."
"Bro, seriously? You got fans of teams offering Malik Beasley and Goran Dragic and you're telling me you wouldn't even want to entertain a discussion for Jamal Murray or Chris Paul?"
jamal goddamn murray.
Joe flacco was always good but never great until the playoffs. Aka Jamal Murray
"same - I feel like '20 playoffs was mostly Jamal Murray + Jimmy Butler, but in '21 the guys who changed some minds were Trae and Bobby"
"Recency bias, but Jamal Murray fits the bill"
"Don't leave Austin ""Jamal 'Maple Curry' Murray"" Rivers out of that carry job"
Jamal Murray
I’d pick KAT over these guys if I’m building a team from scratch.  - Klay post injury.  - Paul George - Jimmy Butler - Jamal Murray - Rudy Gobert - Bradley Beal - Chris Paul - Kylie Irving
"See this is ridiculous. There is a ton of competition in the West and after the first round every series for the Lakers is at least going to 6 games, maybe even they lose if the team’s shooting falls flat. Also the only injury that’s noteworthy come playoff time is Kawhi, Jamal Murray should be back and pretty healthy by then. The Lakers need to worry about the Suns (Who beat them), Jazz(Who can’t expose Gobert), Nuggets(With Murray back), Clippers(with Kawhi back), and Warriors and Mavericks if Curry or Luka is having a great series since the best guard defender the Lakers have is Bazemore."
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
I have had Jamal murray in fantasy the last few years and he never has an average game. He either looks like a top 10 player or a top 50 player on any given night. That bubble run he had was one of the best performances of all time too so I think he fits this well
Obvious:    Ben Simmons with a league average Jumper = MVP candidate.  Giannis with a league average jumper = GOAT.  Westbrook with LEague Average Jumper = 3 time MVP.  Less Obvious  Jokovic with League average speed = HOLY SHIT  Drummond with LEague Average finishing = 20 mil a year as the starter on a playoff team.  Jamal Murray with league average defense = Bubble conference finalist.  Maaaaybe more.
"No one has said it yet: I think MPJ might be a dark horse in this race. Nuggets fans are expecting a contender-lite run this season, and no Jamal Murray means MPJ will have to be the #2 scoring option. He hasn't shown great consistency thus far in his career, and if he has a low turn in play during a period where the Nuggets are dropping in the standings, I can see him becoming the scapegoat for the fanbase this season"
"Geeeez the attacks for no reason. My roommates a Nuggets fan so we watched a lot of both lol.  I just don't think having Jamal Murray, of all players, is going to keep teams from switching onto MPJ and attacking him both in the PNR and isoing"
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
"Kinda/sorta Jamal Murray. He's solid, but seeing how the Nuggets were still a good and competitive team without him makes me reconsider my earlier thoughts of him being a defacto superstar level player. Amazing clutch performances from a scoring perspective for sure, but that's about it. I'm not all that impressed by his PG play, granted Jokic kinda takes the bulk of that responsibility given his play, but 5asts and 2.5 turnovers is pretty...not that great out of your PG. He's not really much of a factor on defense, which would definitely be his biggest detriment in a playoff series. Yes his scoring has the potential to overlook his defensive woes, but to me, your scoring don't mean much if the other team can score just as easily. However, maybe this can be seen as more of a knock to the Nuggets defense than Murray's.  I will say this though, if Jamal Murray was present for the conference semi-finals I definitely don't see the Nuggets getting swept. But I do still see them losing. And that's because I believe Booker and CP3 would be turning Murray into BBQ chicken where the Suns win in 6."
"Jamal Murray. He is super streaky and people only seem to remember the good streaks. He also has to have one of the worst effort:points scored ratios in the league, it takes him like 8 seconds of dribbling and crossovers to get a fadeaway jumper in iso."
"I think neither of your two choices really has a shot at winning MVP this year. Giannis and the Bucks should be focusing on post-season success, which means a lot more strategic rest during the regular season. They might still finish with the #1 seed in the East, but I think voter fatigue is going to stop him from winning. He'll get noise (the same way LeBron will get noise if the Lakers are #1) but ultimately it's not going to go to him.  Similarly, Harden is never going to win MVP playing in Durant's shadow.  I think the only guys who are going to win will be Jokic IF both he and his team improve (which basically means Jamal Murray doesn't get injured again) and whoever wins the league scoring title. That could be Beal, it could be Curry, it could be Dame. Or some young helio-centric player like Doncic or Luka."
"Jamal Murray, I never see him being in all star in his career"
"That 18/19 Pels team’s second best player was Jrue Holiday. The third best was Mirotic.   7 years with AD, Holiday was the best teammate they could get him in that time. They had Boogie right before he broke down, too. Bonus points, I suppose.   They traded draft picks for players who didn’t help. Missed drafting Hield over Jamal Murray for example.   These guys do have agency over where they go. They are the product, not the old white guy cutting checks. They can orchestrate their destination via free agency or trade. At least in a trade, they’re letting their old team get something for their departure.  Unless you’re Ben Simmons and you’re now worth less than a Tyrese Halliburton."
&gt;They have the next Stef Curry coming back in the playoffs (Jamal Murray)   &gt;To beat the Lakers they can just put Campazzo on LeBron and lock him up like the Mavs did with J.J Barea   at least put in some effort in your troll threads
"This is a decent take, but what makes him more valuable than Jamal Murray or Zack Lavine. Like I have eyes I get that he is a good player (advanced stats also back that up). Top 30 easily Top 20 Maybe, but top 10 he is not. Like Luka is firmly a top 10 but i'd put Trae more in the 25-30 range. Thank you for not just screaming ""BUT HE IS A GOOD SHOOTER"" hes not. I aggregated contested looks from 10 and in because obviously he should be hitting wide open looks 10 feet or less from the basket."
"*What makes him better then somebody like De'Arron Fox, Jamal Murray, or Zack Lavine?*  &amp;#x200B;  LMAO. What makes THEM better than Trae Young?"
"Especially considering that current players have done very similar things and the media barely blinks.  Draymond posted his dick to snap chat, Jamal murray posted an instalive getting head, someone recorded Kahwi in a strip club.    Every body knows the players party, occasionally they fuck up and post it publicly.  As long as they still play no one should care."
Homer take but jamal murray has crazy highlights
Jamal Murray and Gobert
Sexton I guess Jamal Murray kinda too?
Like Jamal Murray or dejounte Murray? Jamal is so quick so idk
In what world does Jamal Murray alone turn a 15+ point differential sweep into a series win for the other team?
Jamal Murray is not the difference between being swept with three blowouts and winning a series.
"2013 LeBron more impactful due to being able to play 1-5 more effectively than Jordan.   LeBron can bully his way through smaller defenders and target bigger, slower defenders. He can shoot 40% from 3, drive on anyone, playmake from all angles on the floor, control the game with the way he manipulates defenses out of the post (more to playmaking than assist numbers), and impact offensively more than Jordan.  Even if Jordan has steal numbers and great 1on1 defense vs guards, LeBron is more impactful as a defender by being able to quarterback his defense, read plays, and guard 1-5 better than most. Jordan gave more effort for regular season D, but when LeBron needs to step up defensively and switch onto Bubble Jamal Murray to stop him, he can.  There’s a reason why most of the best players now in this most skilled era are versatile wings…. Bron, KD, Kawhi, Giannis, etc… Bron is a bit more impactful."
"I agree with the WCF take if Jamal Murray is healthy, I think the Bulls are a first round exit, if the Hawks are a top 3 seed I could see that, and I 100% agree with Kuzma being MIP, especially if Beal is traded (despite the fact I don’t think he will be)."
it was seen as a steal at the time https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dl2w8a/amick_source_tells_theathletic_the_kings_have/  everytime theres crazy revisionist  Another contract that was looked at as one of the worst in the league was Jamal Murray until the bubble
"This is exactly what we told ourselves when we gave Murray the max, and tbh MPJ has shown more than Jamal did at this point imo. So eh"
"Eh, a backcourt of Jamal Murray and Curry wouldnt be really good, especially with Jokic as Center. You‘d need a good defender at the 2"
"Properly rated   But the problem is, in the modern game he’s outta position. When he came into the league of course he has to play SG. So he’s that undersized SG and all the downsides that come with it  But since then, everybody and they mama runs point. You can score 50 and play point. Luka, harden, Cade, Kevin porter, players that just 5 years ago you’d laugh in someone’s face if you said they’re point guards. Think Jamal Murray. Murray as a 2 is not as good as him as a PG. SGA is another one   CJ would be an all star if he was a 1 and it’d erase most of the negatives about his game."
Bubble Jamal Murray was like prime Steph Curry my god
"""Nuggets are hoping for a Jamal Murray return in February or March, per the ESPN broadcast just now. That would put his timeline to return at 10-11 months post-surgery.""      https://twitter.com/harrisonwind/status/1426017458448601091?s=21"
MPJ is too low   Without Jamal Murray this year in 23 games he averaged 23 and 7 on 55/45/85 splits…. Come on man
I still read comments about Jamal Murray getting head. That’s much more useless shit
You think the Nuggets can get the 2 seed with Jamal Murray missing more than half the season?
You know Jamal Murray probably won’t be back until like February or March right?
"Its so weird to me guys will list Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray as point guards but not Lebron, its like, have you watched any of these guys play?  Because some of them are clearly not point guards."
"Off the top of my head:  Steph  Kyrie/Harden - you choose who you want to call the PG  Dame  CP3 LaMelo Luka Trae Jrue Westbrook   Not sure if Donovan Mitchell counts but he runs the show  Jamal Murray if he comes back healthy, not going to say Jokic because he’s more a point center obviously  SGA  Ja Morant"
Jamal Murray too low
"Dude if I told you to use a calculator and then you put in the wrong equation, yeah, you're gonna get the wrong answer.  I explained how I think advanced stats should be used in a reasonable way. Your method of using them indicates that Cameron Payne and De'Anthony Melton are ""better"" than Jamal Murray, because the way you use them is misleading. Just because you look at them in that way doesn't mean we all have to."
"Because the way you're ranking based on these stats is misleading. The next ranked point guard in EPM is Kyle Lowry. The next ranked point guard in LEBRON is Jamal Murray. So saying he's only 18th as if that means he's in bad company is wrong, because I think you'd hesitate to say that Lowry and Murray are below-average point guards in the league.   A number of backup PGs are higher than them, because those stats show how well someone performs in their role - for example, De'Anthony Melton is ranked higher in LEBRON than Jamal Murray. Does that mean the nuggets should trade them and start Melton? No, it just means Melton is probably a good backup PG. We shouldn't use them as bona fide rankings, it's more important to see what percentile the player is in and whether or bot the number is positive. Lonzo's in the 89th percentile for EPM and is a positive in all three major advanced stat - that's solid evidence that he's a valuable player."
"I’d take Jamal Murray.  Better defense, better playoff performer, more clutch, better complimentary star (neither can be a first option on a championship team without a lot of injuries)"
"Comparing him because to a ball dominant Westbrook on a bad wizards team is not the same as comparing him to Jokic on a title contender. That’s an apples to oranges comparison.  Beals usage rate the past two seasons has been 34%. Jamal has never been above 25%. Beal is a mid-30% 3p shooter in both the regular season and the playoffs. Murray has been trending up from mid 30s to 40s in the regular season, and is a much better playoff shooter at 40%.   Murray and Jokic also have incredible chemistry with their two man game. They can both fluidly transition from either role as the pnr ball handler/roll man/pnp shooter, and both can abruptly pull up from the mid range in the middle of all of this. It’s a fucking nightmare to try to defend. It’s hard to guard straight up. It’s hard to guard with switches. You can’t send hell because both are great passers. And even if you defend it well enough, both are skilled enough to just take and drain tough mid-ranges over “perfect” defense. Beal doesn’t give you any of that. Even if he could, it would take time to learn that dance with Jokic. Murray and Jokic have years of chemistry built up that you’re throwing away just because a guy has a higher rating in NBA2K or some shit. Because he’s perceived as a better scorer. Even though Murray elevates his game and is a more proficient playoff scorer.  Beal is straight up a worse basketball fit for the nuggets than Jamal Murray and instantly hurts their ability to contend for a title."
"Jamal Murray - he had a really hot playoff series, but he’s never played anywhere near that level in the regular season. Yet people act like he’s a proven all-star."
"don't @ me.  trading for noel then failing to make him into anything.  MCW for 2 years of decent production and then gone?  then post Hinkie process,  ben simmons big mental block over jaylen brown/jamal murray/ingram  fultz, another big mental block over tatum/ball/fox  imagine drafting hometown kid mikal bridges and then trading him before he even puts on the jersey once and his moms works for the team.  sixers ""greatest"" hits all make me giggle.   sixers draft strategy:   is he hyped in the mock draft? yes.  can he shoot? who knows.  does he have the right temperament and intangibles? who the fuck cares."
Yeah this also how I feel about Jamal Murray too. I actually find Jamal Murray and MPJ a bit overated. Don't get me wrong they're great and will develop to become even better. But the inconsistencies are a huge factor and it needs to be fixed for them to deserve the hype.
1. Herro  2. Jamal Murray  3. Zion
"Jamal Murray regularly outplays him because of this, while we had Harris to guard him"
"Game 1-6 Jamal Murray of this series was the most fun, hype shit I've ever watched as a basketball fan. He would shoot from 30+ out drain that shit and come  back bouncing down the court."
"I know he’s coming off an injury but I feel like it’s a stretch to label Jamal Murray as mediocre, don’t you think?"
"Flukey af, TJ Warren turned into prime MJ, Tyler herro was the next Miami heat great, AD all of a sudden became a great shooter, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell turned into supernovas. Quite frankly the 2020 playoffs should be expunged from the history books, including the lakers Mickey Mouse ring"
"Stop. CJ is far from being the worst perimeter defender. CJ has the potential to be a fine defender, but he’s had a pretty bad coach and played on a pretty bad roster his entire career. In game 7 of the 2019 Western Conference Semifinals against Denver who had the best home record in the league CJ held his matchups to 3/11 shooting including a clutch block on Jamal Murray in the final minutes of the game. CJ has proven he can be the #1 at the highest level, he would absolutely dominate with Embiid."
"No no, random dudes who have no idea saying random shit isn't what I'm talking about.  I used the word ""noted"" and not ""speculated"" for a reason.  It's a Jazz fan who completely arbitrarily says ""I have Jamal Murray as not playing this year.""  Based on....literally zero insider info.  Baseless speculation is moronic.  You are right, anything can happen, but it would be like me saying ""there is speculation that Donovan Mitchell will re-injure himself this year.""  It's baseless, and thus pointless.   The people who actually have ANY knowledge of the situation ALL say he should be back this year.  Without any doubt.  Random dudes with zero insight saying something isn't evidence of anything."
"I'd say another top 40ish player and then a bunch of good, competent role players who can make open shots and not embarrass themselves on D.  Jamal Murray  Reggie Bullock  Dillon Brooks  Lebron  Derrick Favors"
"&gt;  Making the NBA, and especially the league's upper reaches, is for the single-minded. The best players are often identified by the time they hit puberty, then hermetically sealed in AAU programs and club teams, ushered from hotel to gym and back to hotel. Any pursuit outside basketball is deemed a distraction, frivolous and ultimately pointless.  I disagree with that take.  Hakeem, Duncan, Embiid and Giannis didn't really find basketball until they were well into their teenage years.  Lebron didn't quit football until he was 16, Iverson played through high school.  Harden, Klay, KLove and MJ most famously of all played baseball, Kobe danced and played other sports, the Gasol brothers and Luka played soccer.  The only stars I can find who didn't play other sports until they were teenagers are Durant and Jamal Murray (star?).  Tiger Woods and Serena Williams are the exception and not the rule."
Jamal Murray bulked up a lot before the bubble and then obviously could shoot in the bubble
"If Jamal Murray has a 4 point playoff game, there is absolutely no way he gets the same pass Tobias Harris is. They are both the second option on offense and I’ve never seen such an important player put up such a bad playoff performance and everyone ignore it because another bad playoff performance is more polarizing."
"""Gets caught up in the excitement"" is not an excuse for shitty on court behaviour. Pushed CP3 from behind, injured Westbrook in 2013, almost injured Jamal Murray in Game 7 last year. He's a dirty player plain and simple. Stop whitewashing his antics as ""gets caught up in the excitement."""
"Don't put any excuse or reasoning for why he does what he does. He constantly does shit that can injure people and clearly doesn't give a fuck. Way too few people remember what he tried to do to Jamal Murray when the game/series was essentially over in the bubble. I have no doubt in my mind he was trying to injure him, but luckily nothing happened. He's a piece of shit on the court and that's all there is to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-P_7QQgA8   Murray very easily could've torn a knee ligament(s) here. And Bev does shit like this all the fucking time and does it under the guise of ""always going 100%"". As if playing hard means you need to be reckless."
"2 other words, Jamal Murray"
"Light skinned 5'11 Van vleet is loved. 6'3 jamal murray is loved. 6'5 light skinned Devin Booker who also grew up well off is loved. Klay Thompson who also grew up rich is loved.   As far as his size is concerned he is league average ""at worst"" for his size. Chris Paul is 6'0. Just stop"
"Devin Booker is two inches taller, are you serious right now? You're pathetic bro lol  Edit: Jamal Murray is loved and is the same height as Curry. Seriously, grow up"
"&gt; jealous cus this light skinned small guy   Curry is 6'3"" and at least 3"" taller than chris paul. Average height for an NBA point guard.  Two. Players love Klay, Devin, Jayson and Jamal Murray."
"I kinda like these tiers.  Destroyer Class: Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, Harden  Wrecking Crew: Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker"
"Jamal ""Pube God"" Murray"
 Jamal Murray would have averaged 50 ppg on 85% shooting if he played in the 90s
Its whatever the media wants that year.....Unfortunately Jokic has no chance the nuggets get at least the 3th seed.....So Bubble Jamal Murray better be here to stay if Jokic wants MVP
"Ok, I'll take Jamal Murray and a 1st... I'll also throw in siakam and Fred, 2 1st and cash consideration for joker. I will also throw in some pick swaps."
"2016. Simmons,Ingram,Brown,Hield,Jamal Murray,Sabonis, Beasley, Levert, Siakam, Dejonte Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, and FVV was an undrafted player from this class"
Jamal ‘Escanor’ Murray
"Also, the NBA today doesn't have layers like it once did. Football is like chess and each play can be broken up and analyzing it is very fun.   Years ago the NBA had sophisticated plays. Ball movement was a great thing. Nowadays, plays are instantly finished by guys chucking threes. I honestly don't blame Steph for that. I blame the guys who want the glory like Steph. Dame lillard has literally mirrored his game off Steph. He was a totally different player 3 years ago. He was more like an Isaiah Thomas(pistons) and it was a breath of fresh air. In comes trae young, this guy just chucks 3s constantly. Everybody wants to be like Steph and it's problematic, even for Steph. It takes away from his game.  The league currently doesn't have a true playmaker. I've only seen this from lamelo. Lamelo is gonna be my fave player as long as he makes his main thing playmaking. I'm just tired of everybody chucking 3s.  We need PFs to bring back the mid range. Currently KD is the only star taking advantage of that   The reason why the people in the media talk like this is because the league itself is full of egos. You have guys worrying about THEIR OWN legacy and not the team.  People have always been protective of their players and teams for decades. This ain't new. It's just how it is and NFL is definitely like that.   It's just that NBA is becoming more toxic because the game itself is just watered down. Jamal Murray made 50 points with just 25 shots. That's damn mighty impressive. Let's be honest tho, am I excited, intrigued? No. I'm not because some other fella will do the same in a month.   Adam silver doesn't realize the problem, but it will come to haunt him in a few years. Stars are made from the offensive end. Guys like Clude drezler, Hakeem, magic and bird, Kobe, Jordan, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, TMAC, Tim Duncan, Garnett, Allen, Iverson, Dwade and Anthony, Lebron. All of these guys made themselves household names because of the offensive not defense. It's obvious. Not many people know guys like Tony Allen who is the greatest defender, top 5 in league history, imo.   Not many players were known to be amazing offensive threats, this led to each time having stars of their own or underdogs (04 pistons). If you have a good majority in the league that are offensive threats then you will not have as many stars as you hope. The NBA made this mistake by taking the big man out of the game. The big man was an amazing piece of the game that had to be removed in order to speed up the offense.   I don't know about you younger fellas. Watching Penny and Shaq in the 90s was the most entertaining piece of Basketball I've ever seen. It was insane.  Steve Nash and the Amare duo was crazy too. The spurs and their ball movement was amazing.   The NBA needs to make a transition over the next few years. They need to start bringing the big man back. That's literally what's missing from the game. That is the reason why it feels so bland and empty honestly. If everybody chucks 3s, then they're not exciting anymore."
Jamal Murray has more entries in the post season tho...
"And jokic runs the entire offense. He beats Embiid in basically every single advanced stat, and trounces him in the offense only ones. Like... offensive win shares and offensive bpm jokic is light years ahead.   Also, while Embiid is certainly the superior defender, no one ever mentions that he also plays with WAY better defenders. Simmons gets DPOY chatter also and is first team all nba and probably the most versatile defender in the league. Danny green and Harris are both above average defenders, abs Thybulle looks like a damn wrecking ball out there this year. Jokic has... Gary Harris sometimes. Jokic is regularly stuck defending a guard coming full speed with no one close to him AND the opposing center. He gets hung out to dry 2 on 1 constantly. Interestingly, on the rare occasion the nuggets play any perimeter defense, jokic looks extremely good. He looked close to dominant against the Lakers, routinely shutting down anything near the basket (other than AD lebron PnR, but that kicked Embiid's butt too).   I'm not saying jokic would be Embiid level defensively, he wouldn't. But it would be a much different conversation if jokic had elite defenders surrounding him and Embiid had the mpj sieve, ghost of Paul Millsap, out of position undersized will Barton, and Jamal Murray (who has improved but...) in front of him. The gap would narrow for sure"
"&gt;You think if Embiid continues playing better than Hakeem/Robinson ever did offensively while also playing DPOY defense, putting up never before seen big man scoring numbers, for a year and a half...then he'll finally be a superstar. I almost literally face palmed here. That would make him have one of the definitive top 3-5 big man peaks in NBA history.  Statistically he's great so far, but he's still not at Hakeem or Robinson's level lmao. He has to maintain this absurd statistical level and meet the eye test for another year or so, including playoffs, in order to be a bonafide superstar.  The problem is, everyone knows this level of insane shooting, for example, is unsustainable once everything goes back to normal so it's hard to hail Embiid as the best player in the world based on this small sample size.  &gt;Comparing Murray to Embiid/Jokic is even more ridiculous, considering Embiid and Jokic have shown these capabilities in the past, Embiid has had insane big man scoring the past couple years with DPOY defense while Jokic has established himself as the best big man playmaker ever even before this season. Murray was a top 60-70 player who suddenly started dropping 50  So now historical precedence matters, not just play in that exact moment? So you agree it's ridiculous to hail the new best player in the league based on 30 regular season games in this strange season? After all, Jamal Murray was putting up numbers better than prime MJ *in the playoffs*, so by your criteria he shoulda been the undisputed best in the league.  Guys like LeBron have proved it and still are at that high level. Embiid has ways to go, but he is on the right track."
"Jeremy Lin doesn't deserve his ring  Dirk does deserve his ring  Clearly there's a sliding scale here, and Lebron going 4-2 with Delly against a 67 win exact same team means he didn't need Kyrie or Love.  Give him like Clint Capela and Jamal Murray and it's a win"
"No, it does not. Jamal Murray didn't become the best player in the league for those several weeks in the bubble as he was playing like the best player in the NBA statistically.   Sustained superstar caliber player throughout a long period of time is what makes you a superstar. You have to prove it like all of the other players in the Top 5 for a long time in order to be considered a su  FWIW, I think if Embiid finishes strong this year, has a good playoffs and continues playing at the same level next year, then he'll have enough sustained success to claim superstar status. But rn, he does not quite have it yet. Jokic needs even more time. Their numbers 30 games in are not only not enough evidence to be better than someone like KD but are unsustainable, like Embiid's midrange numbers  Your argument is ridiculous"
It took me forever to find out what team Jamal Murray is on. None of the posts say anything about him being on the Denver Nuggets.
"As a lakers fan, I hate to appreciate jamal murray. But it’s undeniable. Good on him."
Jamal Murray with the anti-Harden stat line.
Jamal Murray.   There's a 2% chance you get Jordan/Kobe. 8% chance you get Mike Conley. 90% chance you get Seth Curry.
It’s significantly worse than the laker’s with Jamal murray
And it’d be even worse with Jamal Murray wouldn’t you agree?
He bout to get some Jamal Murray treatment
"Bouncer: Welcome to the salty spitoon how tough are ya?  Jamal Murray: I just scored 50 points on 25 shot attempts.  Bouncer: Yeah, so?  Jamal Murray: ...without any free throws  Bouncer: Oh, sorry! Right this way sir!"
"Murray is not the first Nugget to score 50 points in a game this season. Nikola Jokic did so earlier this month and needed 33 shots to get there. They are the third duo under the age of 25 to accomplish the feat in the same season, according to [ESPN Stats and Info](https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1362957237690466305), joining Jerry West and Rudy LaRusso along with Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson.  It's a fitting honor for Denver's two young "
"Damn, Jamal Murray just went off for 50 on 21/25 shooting, 8/10 from 3."
Jamal Murray will be the best point guard in the league in 3 years. Feel free to drop some remind mes or whatever.
As a kitchener mans i love all jamal murray games
"How is it toxic bro, the Nuggets have a legitimate MVP candidate and a top 10 player in the league. They need to surround him with a second option that can help win a championship, Murray is not that guy.   Jamal Murray is young right now and they can get Jokic a second star he can win a championship with if they sell high. Not every comment is based off hate, tell me which one of my adjectives is actually incorrect. Because he’s not efficient, he’s not consistent and he’s a bad defender."
Couple days ago on r/nba: Jokic should get mvp cause he carry the whole team himself  Jamal Murray: That's when I took it personally
Jamal Murray
People who say Jamal only went off in the bubble cause no fans dont know shit about Murray. Im not saying it wasnt a little bit of an aberration but the kid loves the fans.
"Holy fuck Jamal Murray, 50 points on 21-25 shooting? And that fourth miss was a fadeaway at the end of the shot clock...just unreal stuff."
Drug test Jamal Murray cuz HOLY FUCK 🍁🇯🇴
Somebody tell Jamal Murray they are not playing in the bubble anymore.
Drug test Jamal Murray cuz HOLY FUCK 🍁🇯🇴
Holy fuck Jamal Murray
"We’re the Nuggets not supposed to be a top 3 seed, Jamal Murray MIP but bro isn’t even half off what he looked like before, Heat looked like the best team in the East but lost to the Clips bench twice even with Jimmy Butler against no Kawhi or PG, bubble was clearly a fluke but rings are rings 🤷‍♂️"
"Thank NBA for giving us a surprise game against the Nuggets right now, I really wanted that, really.  &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-19) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (15-13) ---|---   D.

* ~~jamal murray~~  still at least 4 guards that deserve a spot over him
sorry but Jamal Murray plays no D and his team is barely above .500 with Jokic who is the MVP this year based on the stats.   So you got the wrong Murray on your otherwise good list
"they should literally hire a guy who’s job it is to quickly break down plays ala Kornacki   i don’t give a rip that Doris Burke learned that Jamal Murray chews gum during games so he’s always eating, i wanna go to Doug Collins with a breakdown of that last possession"
The bubble has proved to be fluky. Look at Jamal Murray and Herro.
&gt;Your favorite team would probably be much better off with Harden taking a heavy ball handling role  Yeah but dont worry untouchable at all costs Jamal Murray will give me 18 a game on league average efficiency its all good(and Sam Amick even said as recently as 2 wks ago Denver viewed Murray as untouchable in Harden talks)
"Nah, Sixers get better, and let me explain this.  Jokic is an average defender. The problem with Nuggets defense is that Millsap is washed, and Gary misses a lot of the games, while the other guys are unathletic and undersized. As good as Embiid is, he won't help with open threes and perimeter penetration. So Embiid + Nuggets get slightly better on defense, but they lose more than half of their offense. Jamal Murray is not a typical point guard, so he wouldn't be able to maximize Embiid. There are ways of dealing with this - if you move Murray to shooting guard and bring in Monte to run point, that helps utilizing offense, but you have to move Gary out off the starting lineup, and play two undersized guards. This would effectively mean Nuggets don't even get better on defense, and lose their offense. They get worse.   Let's look at the Sixers. Jokic would get an elite 3pt shooter in Curry, an elite defender in Simmons, good defense and offense from Harris, and like actual wings on the team. Defense would be fine. Rim protection is overrated. On offense, running your center at point changes so many things. Imagine Simmons as a hyper athletic, 6ft10 version of Gary Harris, cutting and receiving Jokic's passes, while Green, Curry, and Harris space the floor. It's like, Jokic can do everything Embiid already does on offense, plus his playmaking instantly opens up new things for the other guys. That's way more valuable than rim protection, especially if you have capable wings."
I’m not sure why people are trashing me for this like I posted saying Jamal Murray is the best PG in the league. All I did was point out a fact I thought was cool on two of my favorite players. I feel you though I have faith both the jays will be playing this year
"*In the East  I don’t think there is any adjustment Snyder could have made to stop Jamal Murray. He was hitting any shot...contested fade away threes, 360 layups, etc. The fact that the same thing happened to the Clippers just shows how different the bubble is from a normal series."
He definitely performed but the bubble environment definitely helped a lot of players ala Jamal Murray. Honestly I think you’d be better off with Embiid than Jokic because of defense you can’t hide C defense like you can with a PG. It’s just his conditioning that worries me.
Jamal Murray as a suns fan. I swear he averages 30 plus a game against us. Then I look at his stats and see that he’s never averaged more than 20 ppg in a season. Wut????
"Sure as fuck wouldn't be what happened to Kyrie when he stopped showing up for work for no reason, which was... nothing.  You can't fire these guys. What, you're going to fire Jamal Murray, spend a shit ton of money on lawyers trying to get out of paying the rest of his contract, and then just not have a Murray anymore? Your top 7 or so might get traded but they're never going to get cut."
Jamal murray
"You cannot tell the story of basketball without Vince. He popularized basketball in Canada and is a huge reason behind the influx of players coming from Canada. Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett. There are many more that were exposed to basketball because of Vince."
i think we saw but maybe Jamal Murray?
remember emerging superstar jamal murray? Next face of the NBA giannis?
"You guys are so tire some lol he has a higher DBPM than Embiid. There’s stats that say he’s good.... stats that say he’s bad but for anybody who watches him consistently you know he’s just an average defender. He takes off plays, but clamps down when he has to. He is playing with god awful defenders like Jamal Murray and MPJ. You put good perimeter defenders and a good defensive power forward around him and you can have a top 10 defense with him."
Jamal Murray and Will Barton are below average defenders. MPJ is waaaay below average. Gary Harris and 36 year old Millsap are good but both have missed at least 1/3 of each season for the last three seasons. Y’all seriously underestimate how bad the Nuggets are defensively regardless of Jokic.   Furthermore the only true PGs on the team are Monte Morris and Facu Campazzo. If you replace Jokic with Embiid the loss in playmaking outweighs the gain in rim protection.
"Before the draft it was definitely looked at as wrong to not have taken Fultz #1. Also many saw Brown as a project, I remember a lot of people thinking we should’ve taken Dunn or Jamal Murray"
jamal murray ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint duncan robinson this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time

"Jamal Murray is on. Say your prayers, Washington."
  JAMAL MURRAY IS A BAD MAN 😤😤
Fucking Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray - Pornstar
"He's never had an all-star on his team, besides Jamal Murray in the bubble. And every team gets worse without their best defenders."
"NW division would be a fun ultra small + ultra big line-up:  Dame  Donovan Mitchell  SGA  Jokic  Gobert   Let's get fuckin weird.  You also get Jamal Murray, Conley &amp; CJ as ultra smalls and KAT as another big.  Sprinkle in some Dort, MPJ, Ingles and Bojan Bogdanovic and you've actually got a pretty good squad"
Everybody says the Nuggets were a fluke anyways. Jamal Murray so clearly played at a level that he is not capable of under normal circumstances.
"No fans, no travel, guys like Jamal Murray looking like a top 5 PG. Teams like the Mavs and Heat looking like top teams in the league. Lakers were the last ones standing, but there was a lot of bubble wonder flukiness there too."
even jamal murray was still a lot closer to understandable (still not worth at all over harden) than herro
Right: Lamelo being way better than what people were predicting  Wrong: Jamal Murray taking the next step (although I know he's dealing with a ton of injuries)
Right - No matter what insane numbers Giannis puts up he wont be anywhere near the MVP because the media gets tired of the same person. I got shit on when I said this last year.   Wrong - I thought Jeremy Lamb was done after his injury.....Thought Jamal Murray was going to be the next big thing i still dont understand how he was playing like the bubble and now hes just a regular person again.
"Jamal has been disappointing, yes. But he has also been hurt the majority of the season with injuries (elbow, shoulder) that have clearly effected his shot. See the fact that his FT% has hovered around 75% for most of the season. He also had a stretch of games after the elbow where he straight up got passive-- which I can't ever recall seeing.    He also came into the season (admittedly) out of shape after spending most of the offseason rehabbing his hamstring. And in spite of all that, the Nuggets have been drastically better with him on the court.  He seems to finally be getting healthy, and while I don't think he is Curray reincarnate ala the bubble... I do think there is a good chance some of these takes look dumv by the end of the year.  Lastly, I'm also of the mind that he is a SG with combo capiblities (both defensively and offensively)... interestingly that is something George Karl has harped on for years. And when Murray initially got into his bubble groove it was while playing alongside Morris.  I kind of want to see what that would look like.. though long term it'd have to be someone defensive minded like RJ instead of Morris."
"They're the team that makes the most sense for Beal imo.  What I don't understand is, whenever a Beal to Denver trade is brought up, MPJ is always the guy floated as the main piece going to Washington. I feel like Jamal Murray makes more sense as the centerpiece to a Beal trade.   Washington gets back a young guard to build around, and a couple picks.  Denver gets another all-star player to pair with Jokic. MPJ, Barton, and Morris fit well with Jokic-Beal."
"A certain Jamal M.  No, wait, that's too obvious.  Let's just say J. Murray needs to step up."
"First off, I was talking about the lineup they ran last night that prompted your original comment. 2nd, I never said a word about Murray. 3rd, Beal would be great, sure, but our main issue as a team is defense and you want to remove the team's best defender and it's only true wing, leaving us with no wings and a worse defense. 4th, monte is getting the most minutes of his career. He is 3rd on the team in touches, Campazzo is 8th. Campazzo is playing 9mpg alongside Murray, monte is at 14mpg with Murray, and that's a ridiculous threshold anyway because monte is Murray's BACKUP. He comes on to run the offense in place of Jamal, so his playing time with him will always be limited."
"Jamal Murray has completely dipped from mainstream NBA conversation with how badly he’s declined so far this season. I thought he was here to stay, but apparently he had a TJ Warren-style bubble. Think that things’ll eventually change."
I mean Jamal Murray looked like prime MJ in the bubble
Trust me guys this sub is right like hes not even worth like jamal murray he's basically just fat trae young god such trash learn to defnd maybe??????? lol  -this sub about a fucking legend before their eyes the last decade.
"There were fans who didn't want to trade the likes of Tyler Herro, Jamal Murray or Pascal Siakam for James Harden. It's almost like people forgot the man is literally a one man offensive system as we saw for years in Houston."
They are only 73-24 because AD and Jamal Murray weren't healthy
Player comp: Jamal Murray circa 2020
Shades of the Jamal Murray poster a while back
I dunno. What if Jamal Murray doesn’t play?
Jamal Murray understands
Reminds me of that Jamal Murray dunk last year on DJ Wilson that was called a charge. Both are a shame.
He wouldn’t be this good if Jamal Murray was healthy
"Kinda a weird post to make considering Canadian basketball has really been taking off in the past 5-10 years. RJ Barrett, SGA, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins with some other talented Canadians that didn't quite pan out"
"You could say the same about any country. Basketball has always been an American-dominated sport, but as you can see in recent international competitions, other countries have a lot of solid players on the come-up. Even now, Canada has a lot of solid canucks like Jamal Murray and SGA that can become all-stars soon. It won't be long until the international players outnumber homegrown players in the league"
"If anything, I'd say last season was more open since there wasn't really as clear of a favorite after the injuries the Lakers accumulated and the Warriors still recovering. Before Jamal Murray went down, the team looked poised to make a championship run (although, not sure if they wouldn't been able to get passed a possessed Giannis)."
"And MPJ and Jamal Murray are Johnny and Turtle, so then you're just left with fucking Vince and Eric. No one wants that."
"Maybe I should say 3 best players. I don't think anybody that isn't overdosing on crack would argue that. Let's break down some facts. Mpj had the second most efficient 20 point season of all time last season (look it up). Jamal Murray was putting up stats comparable to Devin Booker and Donavon Mitchell, what non crack head would aregure that they aren't max players? Mpj and Mal have missed less time over the last 3 seasons than Klay Thompson. Is Klay Thompson an overpaid broken toy?"
"Damn. It’s like the Hospital Celtics. But Jamal looks like he’s doing well with his recovery isn’t he. Hope MPJ, Jokic, Murray get a good play off run this year."
I heard more about Kuzma when he was on the Lakers than I heard about Jamal Murray
"&gt;Word was that he wanted a max contract like De'Arron Fox/Jamal Murray  no, word was he wanted $100M/4yrs (and cavs wanted a 5th year, total amount unknown), which is pretty far shy of a rookie max extension for his draft class."
Depends how much it is. A lot of questions on his market value since he didn't start off the season too well and he is now out for the season with a meniscus injury. Word was that he wanted a max contract like De'Arron Fox/Jamal Murray but I would be shocked a team would offer anything close to that at this point. Would suck to let a player they drafted and developed walk for nothing.
Lol Jamal Murray seems cool. Suns are so fucked when he comes back.
Jamal Murray and AD were injured though!!!
"Yes but did he do it against LeBron James, AD, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard with one hand tied behind his back?"
"We’re just trying to bank as many wins as we can before Jamal Murray returns, cause we won’t win another game after that"
Jamal Murray or Ja or CJ
Suns wouldn't win if Jamal Murray was healthy
jamal murray
Until either of them beats the Nuggets with Jamal Murray they're all fake contenders
Jamal Murray/KD still got me second guessing.
Jamal Murray was top 3 on the DPOY ladder.   The methodology is the NBA.com writers snorting coke and randomizing what advanced analytic they want to priorities.
"I mean CJs had multiple seasons better than Murray's best season. Jamal is basically Denvers CJ with the inconsistency which is why he looks like the GOAT some nights but somehow only averages 18 ppg on pretty much the same efficiency as CJ. If anything the guys you mentioned + CJ are all better than Murray, Murray's just gotten hot at the right time to make people think he's ever deserved to be an all star in the regular season"
Yeah If Jamal Murray was healthy they wouldn't win any of these games fraud lucky suns.
Jamal Murray
1. CJ 2. Jamal murray
"So we have no idea how this suns team would play against a healthy nuggets, one of the best offenses in this nba?   We do know that Murray cooks Booker.   Jamal also played very well against this suns team in the 20/21 regular season and we know he picks it up in the playoffs so yeah he’s likely continue to do very well."
"This suns team has not faced Jamal Murray, a much better defender than Facu or Rivers who’s miles better offensively.    This suns team has not faced a healthy nuggets team.   Not sure what you’re trying to argue here."
They absolutely do Facu and Rivers couldn’t stay in front of CP3 or book or fight through screens at all. Jamal and Barton are much better defenders not to mention Dozier. There’s a reason Murray is 13-2 against the suns all time he cooks them
And it’s not like their dumbass coach was crying in the media about his team not giving 110% last year in the playoffs when they were already down 0-3 without Jamal Murray and MPJ’s back issues were flaring up.   Malone has an anti-intelligence approach to the game of basketball and it probably affected MPJ’s long term back issues.
"Defensive specialist Jamal Murray, yep.  And in the NBA today you can basically get any switch you want."
"You guys got beat down by an average of 18 ppg lmao. You are severely overrating Jamal Murray if you think that.  The bubble was an anomaly, just like how it was an anomaly for a number of other players."
"Thankfully, Jamal Murray wasn't playing tonight. No way we win by 30 if Jamal Murray was playing.  They're cursed. I hate seeing the Nuggets as crippled and broken down as they are right now. When the Suns and Mavs were both garbage, Murray and Jokic gave me great, entertaining basketball to follow, so I always want to see them succeed. Still, great play by our sunny boys. Let off the gas a little bit and quickly turned it back on when we needed to. Twelve straight y'all, hope everyone's hungry for pasta.  GG Denver. Hopefully your squad gets healthy soon."
suns only won because jamal murray wasn't healthy tbh
"It’s almost like the nuggets look like a completely different team without Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Bones Hyland, and Zeke Nnaji. Who could have predicted this?"
Really miss seeing Jamal Murray + Jokic on the court
"What stats would you recommend looking at? Specifically asking about a generalizable way of seeing a player’s inconsistency as opposed to just pulling out random games of his.  I know bballindex does points consistency and fantasy points consistency (also minutes and usage though I didn’t check those) and Tatum’s graded out well on both of those the past 2 years though it hasn’t been updated for 2022.   The Ringer analyzed consistency using gamescore partway into the 2020 season. He wasn’t on their top 10 most consistent nba players list like Giannis, Lebron, Butler, Harden, Sabonis, Kawhi, KAT, AD, and Ingram. But their least consistent stars list (stars based on their criteria which he met) didn’t include him either: D’lo, Lavine, PG, Shai, Kemba, Jamal Murray, and FVV."
"If you wanna use literal terms like this, he isnt even African American, he’s African Canadian. You dont say Jamal Murray is African American because he lives in America currently lmfao"
Yeah but what if Jamal Murray was healthy tho
"You mentioned jokic, I think two teammates are candidates: MPJ though that doesn’t feel like out of nowhere he just had back injuries. And Jamal Murray. He isn’t there yet but he broke out in that one playoffs and he could be a star"
I think Simmons is an overall better basketball player than Jamal Murray.
Jamal Murray. The dude just knows how to get his hog slurped out on a whole ‘nother level
Jamal Murray
"I mean at what point does it just become delusional? Morey thought Nuggets were going to include Jamal Murray for a swap and random. Like if you ain't serious about trading Ben, why kill his value more?"
"Jamal Murray. Kinda meh the first two months of the season, absolute flamethrower the rest. Every year (except this one, oviously)"
But Jamal Murray isn't healthy so this doesn't count
Suns wouldn't have won tonight if Jamal Murray was healthy
This wouldn't have happened if Jamal Murray was healthy
Jamal Murray not playing tax is applied though
Suns are a play in team if Jamal Murray and Kawhi were healthy.
I wouldve taken it personally but then i realised Jamal Murray isnt playing so realistically its impossible for me to take it personally
Can’t take it personally bc Jamal Murray isn’t playing
Doesn't count cause Jamal Murray isn't playing
"True, but they would have won if Jamal Murray played"
Mavs would've won if Jamal Murray play.
&gt; Even without Jokic that's a good win.      They were also missing Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. Not what I'd call a good win but they ended up taking care of business.
Jamal Murray. To think that a healthy Murray is what’s stopping the Nuggets from winning the chip is crazy to me but it’s a popular take here.
"I mean - he is a borderline top 20 player… don’t get me wrong, he’s having a top 10 season so far and ranking him 82nd is ridiculous, but if you were starting a team today, for only this next season… he’s borderline going top 20.   Assuming no injury no question you take Steph, Jokic, KD, Lebron, Giannis, Harden, Luka, Kawhi, Embiid, AD, Butler, and PG13 over him. That’s 12 players.   Even though he’s having a better season so far than some of the following players I’d probably take them over him too: CP3, Dame, Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, Ja, Beal, Middleton, Trae. Maybe you take DD over them, maybe not.   You’ve then also got players like KAT, Bam, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, LaVine, and Lowry who it wouldn’t be crazy to pick over DD - maybe you do, maybe you don’t.   And, despite what I said on injury, I’m not even including Kyrie (who is a head case and I wouldn’t want close to my team) or Klay &amp; Jamal Murray (tbd on how they come back from injury)   So yea, I feel like borderline top 20 is very, very fair. Putting him any higher would be ridiculous."
He needs Jamal Murray back asap
Yo MPJ low key got some potential too. Plus a healthy Jamal Murray….
High- Mo Williams 52 points Low- Michael Porter Jr. Playoff career high 28 points I know he’s young and only played 2 seasons but the way he shoots I thought he could get an efficient 30 especially with Jamal Murray out last year
Lmao I'm sorry but Jamal Murray is not coming a few month off an ACL injury and keeping pace with Curry in the playoffs. Don't be foolish now.
Only real competitor is Jokic so it probably is gonna come down to the Warriors record vs the Nuggets record. Jamal Murray and Klay Thompsons returns might have huge implications on the MVP race which is funny to think about
*all star level player  &gt;!jamal murray!&lt;
"Denver doesnt suck. They just arent healthy. Lots of teams were missing players last season, except the 2 that reached the finals. If Jamal Murray was healthy Nuggets might have won the title."
He didnt have a slump. People just expected him to play like he did in the Bubble for an entire season. It's like how people thought Jamal Murray would also be  getting 50 points like it was nothing.
"I don't think it's weird. JW was one of the most dynamic players in the league, a proto Jamal Murray/Ja Morant."
"Your response shows truly even though it’s mentioned a ton, how young NBA Reddit is, and how short sighted you can be. “Supreme assets”. So let’s break it down more since you’re being disingenuous.  Following 2012-2013 season. Knicks 54-28 Nuggets 57-25 Knicks go farther in a weaker East. Following that. Both have awful losing seasons. With the Knicks winning less than the Nuggets.  The biggest kicker from those “knocked” assets, is that the picks you didn’t mention, just the in your opinion bad players, turning into Gary Harris and Jamal Murray. Please educate yourself as to why the Nuggets are now threats every year. The Knicks finally made the playoffs since 2013, and Melo is a journeyman."
jamal murray syndrome.  When its hot its raining from everywhere
"Right now (Nov 18 before any games played today), the West is collectively 106-112 and the East is 117-111 so the East has a better record against the West. This is being done even though the West has played 119 home games and the East has only played 104 home games. Several Eastern Conference teams have already make significant West Coast road trips (which is why teams like the Lakers, Clippers, and Warriors have played 12, 10, and 9 home games respectively).   I haven't tried to add up who has missed more games. Yes, the West is missing notable players like Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, and LeBron has missed time too. But the East has no Kyrie, Ben Simmons (who is very solid in the regular season regardless of his playoff issues), and the Bucks has been playing a mash unit a lot with all their top 4 missing time."
"They *do* because they change the entire narrative of a player usually. Think about how differently people think of Giannis this year compared to last after winning the title. Think about how people think of Jamal Murray after the bubble run. Or Mitchell after he beat OKC.  The narrative doesn't start on opening night, it's driven through a players career. And *usually* after coming off a finals run as the best player, a guy would get more respect and drive up his chances the next year of being an all-star."
Best player: Jaylen Brown  Who the 76ers would draft in hindsight and not trade him: Jamal Murray
"Given that the 76ers needs a PG role and that they already have bigs drafted thus, #1 Jamal Murray.  The Lakers at #2 is drafting for assets to attract free agents and selecting Brandon Ingram is a good pick.   At #3, the Celtics have scorers in the likes of Isaiah Thomas and I would take Domantas Sabonis."
[Very Jamal Murray-esque.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btg9CLNfoco)
"They've done well, but those were some high picks also. Its a lot easier to draft well when you pick at #2 every year.  * Randle at 7 was a good pick, but not the best pick in that draft or anything. Still, I'd say he'd go higher in a redraft so props to them for the pick. * Rusell went #2 in 2015. People have a wide range of opinions, I tend to think he's overrated. Not a bust or anything, but you figure they'd pick up Booker in a redraft, and probably also take Porzingis and Myles Turner ahead of him. The Lakers got Larry Nance late in this draft, which I do think is actually a really good pick. I'd rather have him than Russell, honestly. * Ingram #2 in 2016. Another good, not great pick. Went before Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Brogdon and Dejounte Murray. Not sure how a redraft would go, but probably he isn't the 2nd best player in the draft. * Lonzo went #2 in 2017 right ahead of Tatum. Bam and Donovan Mitchell also went in the lottery that year. I think he goes behind those guys for sure in a redraft, and also maybe Fox, Jarret Allan, OG, and John Collins. Not a bust, but probably not like a great pick either.  Overall I'd say good but not great picks. They didn't get any real busts, so I give them credit, but they also picked super high 3 years in a row. They could have a team with Randle, Booker, Turner, Siakam, and Donovan Mitchell or something and win 70 games."
"you're* wouldn't expect a suns fan to have good grammar, though. so I'll forgive that one :)  ah yes, the all important western conference champs. can't wait to tell your grandkids about that one huh?  ""yeah kids, we won the western conference in a year that fans weren't allowed in the stadium for half the year. and no, no the warriors were really depleted. lakers? no, lebron and ad were injured too. jamal Murray, kawhi you ask? yeah they were out! but trust me, it was really tough :/"""
"Yeah but harden is not really liked on this sub. If it was on Jamal Murray, SGA or kawhi it probably gets 5k lol"
"AD was better during the bubble, but Giannis was better than AD for the 2 previous years. Even then Giannis never got to finish the Heat series. He was down 0-3, but the game he got injured in he was 8 for 10 with 19 points scored in 11 minutes. No guarantee that the Heat close out a 3-1 lead. The bubble had inflated shooting numbers overall. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell were trading 50 point games in the Jazz/Nuggets series. AD's career achievement without LeBron up to that point was 1 playoff win against Portland."
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
LeBron: injured   AD: injured   Harden: injured   Kawhi: injured   Trae: injured  Kyrie: injured   Donovan Mitchell: injured    Jamal Murray: injured    Bucks: “real ring”
Jamal Murray was on this list last year so the answer is yes
You know you’re talking about former DPOY candidate jamal murray?? /s
"CJ has literally been one of the best 2nd options at guard in the league for the past 5 years. 76ers fans don’t understand that for most teams a 2nd option is not Anthony Davis or James Harden. For most teams the 2nd option is Bojan Bogdanovic, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, or even Reggie Jackson or RJ Barrett. And out of all of those players CJ is the best scorer AND playmaker you can get."
Don’t forget the bad calls that negated Jamal Murray.
Sometimes? They still think Jamal Murray is the next Dwade
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard: .277 ws/48 3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.   I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt; Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.   Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.   As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts per hundred when he checks in, that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.   &gt; Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.   I don't know what your point is here with the whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team. Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.   &gt; And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.   3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.   I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.   Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.   The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.   If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.   [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"
Like if Jamal Murray didnt get injured he would probably have reached the finals but i see your point. Giannis was on that boat last season.
Is it wrong to say Jamal Murray was playing at an elite level when the Nuggets made the conference finals?
"If you go with Mickey Mouse Bubble performance, you have to rank Jamal Murray  somewhere around all time top 30 players. Right?"
&gt; you just lost to the Suns  &gt; undefeated in the bubble  &gt; Suns in 4  &gt; Did Jamal Murray play  &gt; WCC Suns being 1-3  It's been 3 straight years since that Sunny video by Boney M that the Suns have been a meme factory.
"best mid range shooter in the Chinese league, maybe. He cut down on his inefficient 3s but he still wasn't a good shooter. You've got to be smoking premium crack to say that Westbrook was the best point guard in the league that season/bubble. Same bubble that Had Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Jamal Murray, Chris Paul..."
But did Jamal Murray play?
Jamal Murray
"Well we have a Jamal Murray at home, he’ll do."
"I agree with him and I'll try explaining it how I think of it. Anthony Davis is a top 5 talent in the league, maybe provides top 5 value in the league when he's on the court, but he isn't a top 5 player in the league. It's somewhat hard to distinguish those from each other.  When he's on the court his numbers don't ever not look good. He has an unbelievable midrange game, he can run the floor, catch lobs from anywhere, and then on defense clamp any 4 in the game, play great defense on most 5s not named Jokic or Embiid, and play elite help defense.   But there is something that is critically lacking in his game and it's hard to pinpoint. It's too cliché to say killer instinct, or heart, or silly sports platitudes like that. But AD is very evidently a player who can just will you to wins night in and night out. At times it seems like he doesn't even want to do that.   It's not normal for a player who is putting up 28/12/2/1.5/2 on 50% from the floor to miss the playoffs. It isn't normal for someone to put up those numbers and only get to 34 wins in a season, and especially because AD is clearly not a ""great stats, bad team"" guy. He's not an empty stats guy which is very much what KAT feels like right now. He can get those stats on a championship level team all the same, and give you valuable possessions on both sides.  A team with Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, sniper years Ryan Anderson, some ok but not very good guard/wing back ups like Toney Douglas, Tyreke Evans, Tim Frazier, James Ennis, and then some solid back up bigs in Ajinca and Asik shouldn't be 12-26 at the All-Sat break if you're the best player at your position in the league.   James Harden as a 23 year old pulled a starting 5 of him, Chandler Parsons, Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, and Dontas Montejunas to 45 wins and took OKC to 6 games; and that was with Kevin McHale as coach. Then half that damn Pels team ended up going to Houston eventually too.  KG's running mates were Terrell Brandon, Wally World, Anthony Peeler, and Rasho Neserovic and he pulled into the playoffs in an even more competitive West.  Hakeem didn't have a single All-Star with him as he kept making it to the playoffs each year in the West.   Dirk the same thing, he took a team to the finals and lost in 6 (refs willing) that was starting Jason Terry, Josh Howard, old Jerry Stackhouse, and Erick Dampier.  Jokic won a playoff series last year against a high-powered Portland team with his top 4 guards out, one other guy who could score but not defend, and then a mix between 5'9"" rookies, just signed players, two way guys, and the reanimated corpse of Paul Milsap. This year without MPJ and Murray, and now Barton, Jokic is leading the Nuggets while putting up even better numbers and a top 10 defense...and they will sail into the playoffs.   But with Jrue Holiday and a bunch of 3pt marksman, Anthony Davis had years where he didn't even sniff the playoffs.   That just isn't normal. If you put any of these other guys on that team they're going to find a way into the playoffs, even if it's the 8 seed, even if they get swept. They're certainly going to win more than 30 games.   I think it speaks to Anthony Davis at his core is just a right hand man type of player. He may very well be the best ""2nd option"" of all time. He's this generation's Scottie Pippen who people sometimes even have as a top 5 player in the 90s. But AD just doesn't have that drive in him, or the specific skill, or desire, or whatever it is, to pull teams to wins. Pull them into the playoffs. Just find ways to get it done and get there. He isn't that guy...even though he obviously has all the talent in the world to do that, and has always put up numbers that SHOULD do that.   I mean damn even Carmelo took a team with a guard rotation of Pablo Prigioni, Ronnie Brewer, Raymond Felton, and a 39 year old Jason Kidd, 7ppg Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith, the decayed husk of Kenyon Martin, Steve Novak, and Tyson Chandler to round 2 of the playoffs. And Carmelo is not a better player than AD, whatsoever, in any way. But he is the kind of guy who is a bonified #1 option, who has the drive and will to just find wins and go for broke trying to get them in a way AD doesn't.  AD kind of always seems like he's holding back a little bit. The other night vs. I forget who, but AD was red hot the entire game and WB was...not, and to take the game winning shot what happened? They ran 1-4 flat with Westbrook who took a contested 30ft 3 and bricked it. AD was standing in the corner just watching it.   Now you could say that has something to do with coaching, and maybe it does, but not even Vogel is that bad. It's not like this was some misdirection play or a match up thing either. Also if you're that guy, if you're an All-NBA 1st team player, if you're this HOF two way incredible 30ppg dude...you should be demanding that shot. Especially when you are just draining jumpers all night. But he didn't, and that isn't the first time he's seemed to shy away from pivotal moments like that.   So in that sense AD is a ""very good"" player, but not a great player. He's an absolute incredible talent, incredible scorer, incredible defender, easy choice for the HOF. but as a ""player"" there is something that is critically missing from him. Something that you can find in almost all of his All-NBA 1st team peers from LeBron, to Jokic, to Embiid, CP, Dame, Curry, Doncic, Harden, KD, Butler, Trae, Morant, Mitchell there are so many of these guys who have that extra part of them. Even guys who haven't been All-Stars like Jamal Murray, Fox, Ant, Bogdanavich(s), grab hold of that moment more willingly and firmly than AD.  I mean good lord it's in Russ--that's half the reason he's so good at basketball--but AD should be the person taking that situation every single time. Not just over Russ but maybe over LeBron most of the time too. That's how good he is. Not just a single shot but just down the stretch in general.   AD is going to be one of the 5 greatest talents of this generation, and he's gonna pick up a lot of hardware, but there is just such a distinct generation between him and these other HOF peers of his when it comes to drive and will to win. Maybe AD is just apathetic, maybe he doesn't care that much and is just insanely good at basketball, I mean he is notoriously lazy about his workouts in the offseason which also isn't normal. I don't know. But there is absolutely something to it."
Beverly is such a bitch. Every time he’s on the verge of elimination he does bitch shit. Last year he did an unnecessary dangerous play on Jamal Murray.
"Same with this season, and any lockout-shortened seasons (like 2012). It isn't saying that it's a lesser championship, but the season was an atypical one.  Hell, the Celtics/Pacers 2013 seasons get an asterisk, too, since they only played 81 games (they were supposed to play the day that the marathon bombing happened, and never made it up because it had no effect on seeding). That doesn't mean that those two teams had lesser seasons.  People get heated about asterisks because of the association with Barry Bonds, but they don't mean that your stat or win doesn't count, just that the circumstances were different. In 20 years no one is gonna care that Jamal Murray or Anthony Davis missed playoff games in 2021, but they're sure as hell gonna care that the 2020 season was suspended due to a pandemic and restarted months later in a bubble at Disneyworld."
Y’all really forgot about Jamal Murray
The Nuggets *were* healthy and were the 5th seed before Jamal Murray went down. Then they finished the season 9-1 and actually jumped up to the 3rd. Why do you people just make shit up?
"Have to disagree. Hate the asterisks thing but the injuries happens argument is kinda bs here when over 10 all star caliber players are injured and can't play. If the suns beat the bucks or hawks without giannis or trae young  how much are we going to value that championship. I mean look at the teams they faced. Lebron injured, AD out, no Jamal Murray, no kawhi. Obviously they worked for that championship but no season has ever come close to being this bad."
Yet they lost in 6 to a Nuggets team missing Jamal Murray and Barton. I watched the games Dame was getting cooked by Austin Rivers. WAR doesn't take into account defense at all which would explain him being overrated.
"yea there is a reason, reason being jamal murray is injured"
"I recognize the Suns got lucky compared to what we should’ve faced, but you’re brain dead or just lack the most basic knowledge of recent NBA history if you think we’ve had an easier path to the conference finals than a large number of teams. The Celtics have had obviously easier paths in two of their ecf trips lol.   Half the shit you said in this comment are just factually wrong. The Nuggets regular season offense (and record) actually improved once Murray went down... they’re obviously not a better team without him, but that spacing bs is just numerically wrong.   A broken nose is nowhere near as bad as a... sore back? Y’all talking about luck, but I sure am seeing a shitload of excuse making from casuals on top of the actual luck we’ve had. MPJr played badly because he can’t attack off the dribble better than a role player, he just gets his shot off with ease... but he sure as hell wasn’t getting his shot off with ease while Mikal guarded him. That isn’t changing whether Jamal plays or not, not to mention the fact that he was getting relentlessly targeted on defense damn near every possession. That gonna change when Jamal comes back too? MPJr gonna magically become great off the dribble and an average defender?  Again, half of what you’re saying immediately goes against the stats. Rivers and Facu shot a combined 38% from 3, we weren’t sagging off them. However, we did an amazing job on defense for one reason: Jokic wasn’t able to exploit doubles and aggressive defense. We were able to play Jokic 1 on 1 straight up with Ayton without doubling or blitzing at any point. That gonna change when Jamal comes back too??  Sure, I’d say it was lucky. However, we’d still show up better than the Nuggets did. I mean we won 2 games without CP3 against a team that won 2 straight against the Jazz and murdered an AD-less Lakers team while CP3 averaged 9/4/8 on 44% TS. The Suns missing cp3 would actually put up a fight, which we didn’t see out of the Nuggets... and dumbfucks like you want to turn around and pretend the Nuggets would wash us if Jamal Murray played. Just lol."
"I couldn’t be less emotional man lmao you’re the one trying to convince yourself you didnt play a crippled and injured team to get a cakewalk to the conference finals.   Literally look at the nuggets spacing after the Jamal injury and before dozier and Barton’s injury to get your answer, it was far better than what we saw in the playoffs but you only watch Phoenix so ok.   a broken nose is nowhere near as bad of an injury as other stars have been dealing with and you still move the exact same.   Mikal played good d but MPJ was obviously moving stiff which backs up the reports that came out, it’s not either or.  It kind of does because having Murray and a healthy Barton actually forces Booker and CP3 to defend instead of sagging off Facu and Rivers, we see how that makes them play worse now that they’re forced to defend against the clippers.   Dozier is also the nuggets best guard defender and can actually stay in front of book and CP3 unlike Facu and Rivers so that helps too.   Like imagine whoever you consider the suns 2nd best player out of CP3 and Book out of the series, Ayton playing with back problems, bridges back for game 2 on a minutes restriction and cam Payne out for the entire series playing a fully healthy nuggets. You’d consider it a lucky ass matchup for the nuggets."
"Lol cry more, we curbstomped them. If if if, your teeth are still laying shattered on the side of the road.   So Dozier not playing killed your non-Murray spacing? Maybe the spacing wasn’t all that great to start with then.   I’m not saying he’s 100% healthy, but there are very few series past the second round in NBA playoff history where an important player isn’t playing through something. DBook literally broke his nose and no one is making excuses for him. He was getting clamped by Mikal because he can’t attack off the dribble for shit and Mikal isn’t easy to shoot over, and then he got relentlessly targeted on defense (along with Jokic). The Nuggets role players didn’t step up, but Jamal coming back doesn’t exactly stop us hunting one of MPJr and Jokic on every single offensive possession."
You trade both of them for Jamal Murray. That’s a win-win trade imo.
"The lakers beat the suns with a healthy AD  The nets beat the bucks with a healthy harden or Kyrie  The nuggets are more formidable with a healthy Jamal murray  The clippers are a legitimate championship team with Kawhi, instead they are a symbol for how bad the competition is that they might get to the finals without him, and if they lose it is 100% because Kawhi is out.  The bucks are toast without Giannis assuming he can’t play  And Embiid was injured - I get that this will be scoffed at but someone at that size playing that minutes load on a bum knee absolutely affected their chances specifically with how compromised he was defensively.  So there, in some way or fashion that covers the other top 8 players in the league.  And the ratings are up because no one watched the bubble and those ratings were disastrous."
"Making more deep playoff runs or winning another championship is never a guarantee.  The Suns have had an incredibly lucky playoff run.  Lakers: Injured LeBron and AD going out.  Nuggets: Jamal Murray completely gone.  Clippers: Ibaka out and Kawhi, having one of the best playoff performances of all time, becomes injured.  And the Suns would be down 3-2 to the Clippers, who are missing their best player, if game 2 didn't have that miracle ending.  All these injuries are making the Suns look a lot better than they really are. And CP3 is on his last legs.  Better enjoy it."
"It was always bound to happen. This is the most injury prone playoffs ever. Kawhi knee, Trae ankle, Booker nose, now Giannis knee. Lets not forget Emiid played hurt, Jamal Murray missed them completely, Mitchell missed a few games because of ankle."
And Jamal Murray
"This is the thing that nobody wants to hear: Fans are going to cheer players that get injured more often if they're assholes and less often if they're nice guys. That's just the way it is. Embiid is widely regarded as being an asshole. Giannis is widely known for being a really nice guy. And KD is a douchebag manchild ring chaser. The Warriors crowd was extremely respectful in when Jamal Murray went down with a torn ACL because he's not a raging dickhead. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but thems the facts."
"Homie said ""it will be the biggest asterisk ring ever."" Then proceeded to say ""I'm not the asterisk guy."" Idiot  Fuck asterisks winning a chip is hard, every team faces difficulties. Suns won games while CP3 was injured. They swept the Nuggets, Jamal Murray doesn't turn a sweep into a win. Clippers should have gotten swept, refs gave them game 3. Injuries suck but that doesn't make it an asterisk championship. Do the raptors have an asterisk? The Nets and Warriors both had injuries last year do the Lakers have an asterisk? Actually the dumbest take I've ever heard. CP3 turned this team from mediocre to contender in one season at like 35."
That’s what they said when Jamal Murray went down. Though Jamal never put an ounce of weight on his leg after he went down. Giannis full on walked around with it. Every knee is different and every injury is different. Hopefully this is the one time where they’re wrong and it didn’t tear.
"Damn the Suns could win the chip and have dodged AD, Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, Ibaka, and one of either Giannis or Trae 🤯"
This sucks!!! I was heartbroken with the Jamal Murray news and seems like stars have just been going down ever since.
"Great question, and again, unlikely the Nuggets would bite on something like that but here’s the reasoning behind doing something like this. If it’s an ACL, Giannis won’t be fully healthy until the 2023 season. By then Jrue will be 32 and Khris will be turning 31. Lopez will 34 and PJ will probably be retired. The Bucks own next year’s pick and then that’s it. You basically have one year to do a mini rebuild. Khris, Jrue and Brook are good enough to make the playoffs in the East as a 7/8 seed. That does nothing for you when Giannis gets back because he will most assuredly be rusty and then you go into the playoffs as a tremendous underdog and probably lose in the first round and hope Jrue and particularly Lopez don’t show significant signs of aging which is a real risk considering the defensive and offensive burden they’ll have to take on with Giannis gone. So if it’s 2023 and Giannis is finally fully healthy would you rather have 25-year-old Jamal Murray plus healthy Giannis at 27 years old and a good lottery pick? Or Giannis plus the older players I mentioned and like the 20th overall pick? Giannis is locked up long term regardless, but the timeline just got shifted back at least two seasons."
Jamal Murray. His didn't happen in the playoffs obvioulsy but he missed them entirely
Ya because Middleton/Holiday is a horrible return for Jamal Murray
"Hate to say it but Jrue is 31, Khris turns 30 in a month. They have no picks after next year. They have one year basically to restock the shelves. Honestly should consider trading those two next year. Denver wouldn’t do it but a Jamal Murray trade might make sense for both teams. Gordon/Murray and other salary for Middleton and Holiday. Bucks tank a year and hope to get two guys back healthy. Nuggets probably become title favorites. I’ll probably get downvoted for that though"
Jamal Murray getting you know what
We have shai and jamal murray missing but even then they are more scoring guards than floor generals
Jamal Murray not turning off the cam-  nvm
"I don't think an ACL tear would have him become that much of a different player, it's gotten a lot better with guys like Lavine coming back seemingly 100 percent. Tho an ACL tear would almost definitely keep him out past February, that's when Jamal murray wants to return and he injured his months ago"
"It happens every season, it's just LeBron is logically and rightfully complaining about it even though the NBPA agreed to the season. Also teams got additional rest during quarantine, which is ironic because that probably helped LeBron win his ring. A lot of the superstar players that got hurt with the exception of some young guys with serious injuries like Jamal Murray, Brown, and Siakam all came back quick except the players that have an injury history (LeBron, AD, Kyrie, and Kawhi). All these teams knowingly signed these players to big contracts knowing their injury history, the circumstances are unfortunate but high reward moves come with high risk."
[Jamal Murray](https://youtu.be/izVelx9ymEI)
And Jamal Murray isn’t in that count
Anthony Davis  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Donovan Mitchell  Joel Embiid  Mike Conley  Jaylen Brown  Chris Paul  ---  No Trae or Jamal Murray
And then probably another year after that to really get back on track.  Jamal Murray doesn’t have a lot of trade value right now.
Anthony Davis. Jamal Murray. Kawhi. Giannis. Insanity.
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
"Imagine if this team had Jamal Murray, SGA, Boucher, and Olynk. Could’ve gave US a run for their money"
Lol you’re a troll. You played the lakers who shouldn’t of even been in the playoffs. The nuggets with no Jamal murray and now a clippers squad with no Kawhi.
Not at all. Suns have played a decimated Lakers That honestly shouldn’t of even been in the playoffs. A Jamal Murray less Nuggets and now a clippers minus the Kawhi. You are literally projecting.
Shai Brooks and Jamal Murray too
I've seen LeBron clamp up Porzingis to Giannis to Jamal Murray over the last few years. He can guard 1-5 period.
NAW playing like Pan-Am Games Jamal Murray
Canada is missing Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous Alexander but this team is actually pretty good
"1. What injury did Butler have?  2. Dragic and Bam vs LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, Barton, Ibaka, KCP, Morris (both), etc"
Jamal Murray is in the top 5 players I would want taking the last shot of a game.
List of point guards who are 100% better than Reggie Jackson (in no particular order):  1. Curry 2. Lillard 3. Kyrie 4. Cp3 5. Trae Young 6. SGA 7. Jamal Murray 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Jrue Holiday 10. Mike Conley  11. Westbrook 12. Lowry 13. Kemba 14. Brogdon 15. Ja Morant  and that's not even including big guys that technically play PG like  1. LeBron 2. Luka 3. LaMelo 4. Simmons
"They are both *slightly* overrated IMO. All that hype last night about CP3 making his first finals and all that, carrying or altering franchises (kinda true with OKC/Suns) some had him as a top MVP candidate which is kind of ridiculous. Yet he looks old and is clearly being carried by Booker, Ayton, and is being outplayed by some others around him too like Payne. He is pushing 40 years old and has an injury history so it's not that shocking, just very over hyped at the moment and if he makes that finals... the team has had arguably the easiest route to a finals in NBA history playing against LA without Lebron/AD at 100, no Jamal Murray on the Nuggets, and no Kawhi on the Clippers which looks like it's gonna be a 7 game series with CP3 playing bad. Props for him and the organization turning things around in the W/L department but it's a collective effort with a rising superstar in Booker next to him, CP3 doesn't make the playoffs without Booker.   Butler too has been known to drop 40-50 pts and be a solid 2 way player, but he's still only a top 12-15 player at best without a ton of feats to back it up. Always thought of Butler as a lesser PG-13, both are great 2 way players but PG-13 averaged 28pts and was a DPOY finalist in the same year when he was given the star role with Westbrook, and has been a solid 1b to Kawhi's 1A in LA despite some slight inconsistencies (dude erupted last night for 41pts in an elimination game). For a dude called Jimmy Buckets who has had numerous opportunities on solid teams with star power around him we haven't seen his best quite yet despite a solid effort in the bubble where he carried a bad team and admitted to being too exhausted in the end, and didn't come close this year on what looks to be a Heat team in need of extra help."
"lmaoo suns blew a 3-1 lead      imagine having no AD for 3 games, no Jamal Murray, and no Kahwi for 5 games of the series and still can't win the west"
"That's true, but it'll still be a year before Jamal Murray looks anything like his original self"
"I would agree but they must feel really encouraged from how well the team played without Jamal Murray, probably want to run it back"
Nuggets missing Jamal Murray.
"at my local target, they have Lakers, Dodgers, Kings, Bruins, and Trojans gear regularly. I have yet to see Clippers stuff. and to add insult to injury, I've even seenJayson Tatum and Jamal Murray children's jerseys. wtf."
Or you could just break that cycle by taking Jamal Murray and not taking 5 years to rebuild. Pretty easy decision.
"&gt;If you're trading for a young guy, get the guy with 4 years on his rookie contract  You're not trading for a young guy, you're trading for the chance at a young guy, and the odds that young guy is as good as Jamal Murray is incredibly small."
Yeah why trade for Jamal Murray when you can tank for a high draft pick instead that could end up being as good as Jamal Murray  Doesnt matter tho because Nuggets never agree to this
Sun fans shouldn’t complain about injuries. If AD and Jamal Murray weren’t injured would you guys really be here?
"I think this Suns team is not as good as it’s fans make it out to be suggesting that they would’ve beaten the previous teams they played even if they were healthy. I don’t think they would’ve gotten past the Lakers if AD was healthy, or sweep the Nuggets with Jamal Murray, or bear the Clippers if they had Kawhi. And they’ll lose in the Finals to the Bucks. Just my opinion."
"He's the opposite. He wants to be a star, when he is really more suited to a Marcus Morris role with his current skillset.  He's not a good shooter but he's never met a shot he didn't like. He has god-tier athleticism, but shies away from contact. He has the strength to bully little guys in the post, he'd rather fadeaway. He constantly wanted the ball and had excellent vision and passing acumen, but he rarely acted as a playmaker. What was infuriating about AG wasn't his lack of ability, but his refusal to play in a role that would maximise him. Some of that is Orlando's fault because there were some teams that had a dearth of offensive talent that had him doing more than he should have, but a lot of it is on him. I watched AG his whole career in Orlando, and the best I ever saw him play was this year when we put him at point. When his objective changed from scoring to playmaking, letting the game come to him and started taking easy shots instead of settling for hard ones, he was brilliant.  What changed in Denver is they took him off the ball, moved him to the lower usage role Orlando fans had wanted him to play for years, he excelled. I was dubious how long it would last, not because I thought he was overperforming, but because I didn't think he'd be content in staying in that role long-term regardless of the rest of the roster. Sure enough, with Jamal Murray, AG had 63 FG% and after Murray got hurt he put up 46%.  I almost guarantee AG will come into next year, knowing Murray will be out for awhile, thinking  this best chance to make an All-Star game, and chucking up the shots that he thinks will get him there. Don't get me wrong, I wish the best for him and I'm happy he's found a home - but I'm dubious he's changed all that much."
"We saw that in the Jazz series, when he became obsessed with Rubio.  Westbrook is an example of if everyone you meet is an asshole (on the court), you might be the asshole. He plays like one. When you have a bunch of fight compilation videos, with guys like Jamal Murray, Klay, Rubio, Steph, etc., you're probably the one starting most of it."
"No way we give both Jamal and Mpj,we need more than a two man team as well. Take Monte and thrill if you want but only one, probably Murray since he's a pg"
"Not sure if I'm being trolled or not here 🤔  In case I'm not, Jamal Murray."
Aight bro be delusional if you like. Last year kawhi and bev couldn't even guard Jamal Murray properly and you're saying they're stopping a healthy Bron. Lol
"1. They were 13-5 without Jamal  2. They had the MVP 3. They won their first round matchup against a healthy 6 seed  Those 3 things, none of which are dependent on Jamal Murray, clearly showed that the Nuggets were a legit top seed and second round playoff team. You could even include MPJr’s progression and getting Aaron Gordon. That team without Jamal isn’t far off in terms of talent and production from the Sixers, especially when Simmons no shows. The Nuggets without Jamal are a harder second round matchup than many teams get.   Cool, I’m not saying none of that didn’t happen. I’m saying you’re insane if you think the Suns have had an easy, or even dumber historically easy, wcf run. Like complete lack of knowledge about basic NBA history."
"ACL is definitely more than 6 months. Being cleared to do light drills, light practice, and non-contact play is VASTLY different from being thrown into an NBA game. Why do you think Jamal Murray is scheduled to come back around the later part of next season?"
"&gt;The Nuggets without Jamal were a 59 win pace team, better than pre injury.  That’s nice but this the playoffs. You don’t sweep no damn nuggets with Jamal murray. Whatever pace they were on is irrelevant comes post season. Nets had a 27-7 run without KD too during the regular season.   &gt;AD was better than Chris Paul in the series, both due to injury.  Except AD left a crucial game 6. CP3 didn’t and while off, was a +3 for that game.   &gt;Hawks fans proud after beating Simmons   Simmons was healthy and playing. Next  &gt;AD was healthier than CP3.  And still couldn’t play an elongation game. You can come up with as many excuses as you want. Suns faced no true challenge this post season. Your playing a team without its best player right now"
"False  You got MVP jokic without Jamal murray.  You got PG without Kawhi You got AD who was hampered coming into the playoffs and lebron who himself wasn’t 100%  At the end of the day it isn’t the Suns fault, but all this hype surrounding a team who’s faced teams without key players/injured players is ridiculous  And lol did you mention MPJ? Great young player but we talking about the playoffs here. You got to avoid JM, Kawhi and a healthy AD and for a whole series."
"It’s been fun I’m just saying it would be cool to see these playoffs with everyone healthy.  Specifically: Kawhi, AD, Harden, Jamal Murray, Kyrie, Joel, Donavan, Mike Conley, and Jaylen Brown.  You’re taking this too seriously lol. It’s not that deep my man"
"It sucks that the NBA playoffs were so impacted by injuries this year  AD out with injuries, Jamal Murray (though that was earlier in the year), Kawhi, and Zubac (if he stays out longer)  In the East, Harden, Kyrie, and now possibly Trae Young if he misses multiple games"
"Not to mention they played the lakers without AD, and the nuggets without Jamal Murray"
"Definitely.  Im still really disappointed in this years playoffs because I want to see all the best players competing at the highest level.  I know seeing all the new blood going after it is cool but I dont think its ever a good thing for the league when Harden, Kyrie, Lebron/AD, Kawhi, Embiid, Jamal Murray, etc. are all injured or completely out.  Because when/if they're all healthy next year, any of those guys will beat whoever wins it this year and we're gonna have another 2019 Raptors situation but worse."
This RJ performance throughout the playoffs is an aberration. It’s going to be like Bubble Jamal Murray. He’ll fall back down to earth next season.
"Mad credit to the clips for going this far. Suns championship will forever have an asterisk next to it for the amount of injuries the other teams had (LeMao, adisney, Jamal murray, kawhi). Truly a donald duck ring"
"I’ll answer it for you.  Never.  It’s pretty clearly a fluke when Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray all miss playoff games due to injury for the first time in their careers."
The Donovan Mitchell vs Jamal Murray series was super fun
"3: Denver missed out on having a consistently healthy Jamal Murray throughout the season and then lost him ultimately to ACL tear.  4: Clippers have missed Kawhi and PG for several games (12+ each) due to a multitude of injuries, including missing Bev and Ibaka for half the season.  5: Lakers have missed Lebron and AD for several games throughout the season.  6: Portland missed CJ for several games due to a fractured foot.  7: Not really going to make excuses for the Mavs lol, because I don't even know what I'd call KP at this point.  8/9: Whoever you want to call it - Grizzlies missed Jah for a significant part of the season due to a high ankle sprain. JJJ also missed a lot of time due to a torn ACL. Warriors were missing Klay for the entire season.  So yeah 3-8."
That list doesn’t include Jamal Murray who was playing like an all star.  I wonder how much was the quick turn around of the season
Jamal murray Aaron Gordon and picks... plz
"Losing Jamal Murray hurts but Team Canada is pretty stacked. not saying they can beat the US, but anything can happen in a one game final."
Lmao I remember when Simmons said Jamal Murray could be good with team USA then Zach Lowe had to remind him he's Canadian. This was a year or two ago
"No Jamal Murray, sga, brooks, Clarke, olynk or even Boucher"
Jamal Murray and SGA could make the USA roster
"The Suns are the winners of the injury sweepstakes.  Lakers: Injured LeBron and AD getting injured.  Nuggets: No Jamal Murray  Clippers: No Kawhi Leonard, who was having one of the best playoffs performances of all time before he went down.  ""Winners Reward"" haha. Yeah the Suns are winners alright."
"The Trade would be Simmons + Thybulle + Maxy + 3 firsts + 2 swaps. No team can outright beat that offer. It'll be about what that FO values. Sure they could prefer Aaron Gordon and Jamal Murray, that's totally possible but not every FO would. BEcause the 76ers need to make a deal and have the pieces to offer a highly competitive one it should surprise no one if that deal materializes.   &amp;#x200B;  Portland would probably end up trading CJ, or hoping he plays next season as he did the start of this season and Portland is a favorite to make the playoffs. **They could offload Nurk to the Nets for Dinwiddie in a sign and trade.** Makes better sense with Simmons."
"Change jokic to a power forward and watch his ovr go up, then change Jamal Murray to sg and watch his overall go up"
I’ll upgrade our medical equipment and doctors. That’s all they needed tbh. If they had Jamal Murray I think they could go further.
You honestly think that Jamal Murray would have been the difference between Nuggets winning the series and being swept?
"I wouldn't be so quick to say it's Chris Paul's last chance, certainly his best chance but not necessarily his last. CP3 looks like he could have another couple years of star-level play in him, with his key teammates being 24 and 22 they can keep contending as long as Chris can keep being playing near this level.  Still though they're never gonna have a better chance than they did this year with Kawhi out, Jamal Murray gone, the Lakers struggling and no prospect of facing the Nets in the Finals."
"Elite ball handling guards and wings from 2009 to 2019: Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae, Dame, beal, Steph, Khris Middleton, devin booker, Jamal Murray, Ja Morant. There are twelve all-star level guards in eleven years. If we just take the top half that is Harden, Steph, Beal, Luka, Trae, and Dame which is six in eleven years or about one every other year."
"I’d rather see already top 5 guard Jamal Murray in a Nugget jersey than in a rival Portland jersey, I don’t see how it’s that hot of a take. Rewatch the bubble tape. The 50 point game on 21/28 shooting and **zero** free throws. Any good highlight reel will show off all his tight window passes. He’s got potential All-star caliber playmaking. Couple that with his historic scoring ability, a talent which has been proven against hall of fame defenders in Kawhi, PG, Bron, AD. He got to his spots and got his buckets on all of them deep in the playoffs. He’s a proven All-NBA level scorer despite what law of averages will tell you. He’s inconsistent but that doesn’t matter when he’s got the ability to turn his game up when he needs to, and he did a great job of sustaining it for his 20 games, limping through half of them. All that with his Jordan-like madness in work ethic. Jamal is an all-time guard in the making."
"And Jamal Murray, and Jaylen brown"
"I've been a fan of the NBA for over 50 years.  I live in the suburbs of DC and became a bullets fan in 1967 when they drafted Wes Unseld, and went from doormats of the league to winning their division and Wes was only the second player ever to win MVP and rookie of the Year awards.  I agree with your choices of non-dominant players on those Mavericks and Heat team and interestingly that Heat team beat a highly favored Mavericks team to win.  I enjoyed seeing that Mavericks team beat the LeBron led Miami Heat teams.  Both my sons 32 and 29 are big NBA fans We watch a lot of the games together, and talking about the Brooklyn Nets and the LA Clippers I was talking to them about those two teams and how they were stacked with veterans.  That 2006 Shaquille O'Neal Dwyane Wade team had Gary Payton a point guard Williams Antoine Walker Alonso morning backing up Shaq.....  That Mavericks team that beat LeBron had all kinds of old veterans Tyson Chandler Jason Kidd Jason Terry Sean Marion they also had Quran Butler but he was hurt when they went to the finals and another wizard a guyI never liked Deshawn Stevenson who came up huge  for them.   I would disagree with you about generational talent Trey Young is as good a guard as I've seen as is Donovan Mitchell ,Devin booker, Jamal Murray he didn't get to play, Jokic, Doncic, ,etc. A  big crop ofgreat players and time will show which of them is truly a generational talent."
"There was one game in the lakers suns series with both a healthy AD and a healthy CP3, and the suns won. And I highly doubt that Jamal Murray is the difference between a 4-0 stomp and a win for Denver"
"Yeah there are examples of both results happening from these types of moves though. You have the AD trade, which was a massive haul for NOP but in reality, the team still has a lot to figure out and nothing is a sure thing with the types of pieces they received in return (Ingram turned out very well but obviously not the same level as AD). You have a similar trade with Sac and NOP for Boogie, where the reality was Boogie was worth way more than what the Kings got back, but the reality of trading a bunch of guys for one player is that an injury can ruin the entire return. There are other examples not involving NOP, but those are the first two I could think of rn.   But then you have stuff like the Nuggets/Knicks Melo trade, which resulted in short term sustained success for the Nuggets and then really good future assets (including the pick that got Jamal Murray), while the Knicks struggled to build around Melo without the depth of assets necessary to do that. You also have the Nets/Celtics debacle (Pierce and Garnett) but that was dumb to begin with lol."
Yes. At the time. Eric Gordon was seen as a future all star. Maybe a Shai Gilgegous Level or Jamal Murray. Al Farooq was a young athlete and Kaman a solid vet former all star on an expiring.  The Lakers deal had Lamar who was a role player. Albeit a cool notable one. Scola. A solid role player. Kevin Martin who was maybe at best Jordan Clarkson level guy....and Dragic who was maybe thought of like Luke Kennard at the time. Eric Gordon and Al Farooq seemed like way higher potential players.
"If we were ass in the regular season, and teams were banged up all year, sure. But I'm not personally buying that we lucked into our success and we're some scrub fraud team, which is the current narrative amongst fans of teams we've beaten.   We had the second best record in the league in the regular season. Lakers were healthy during the season. Jamal Murray was good up until the last month. Kawhi was healthy.  How did we have a better record than them if we suck so bad?  Yes, we've benefitted from other teams being injured in the post season. CP3 has missed time as well, btw. And Book clearly isn't doing well with his broken nose.   And that exact same Nuggets roster, without Murray, beat the Blazers.  And then we crushed them. We're a good team."
Offering Jamal is a lateral move. It doesn't make them better enough. Murray is really fucking good.  MPJ to Portland makes sense for both teams. MPJ has the potential to be a franchise cornerstone for the next decade and a faster retool for the Blazers. Add in Will Barton and JayMychal Green to make the salaries add up. Now Denver runs with Lillard/Murray/Gordon/Milsapp/Jokic. That puts them on the Nets level for sure barring injuries.
"If you can get Dame you have to do it if you're Denver.  Sorry Jamal.  If you can do Murray, Bol Bol, another guy plus picks you have to."
Sorry I forget about Dejounte. Jamal Murray is who I meant.
"&gt; They just drafted a center last year who made All-Rookie, getting Wiseman just stunts both of their development.  You don't draft for fit. Take the best player available. Particularly the Pistons have no reason at all to cater around their current roster.   &gt; \#7 and #14 are also nowhere near enough value for Cade. I don't consider him a ""generational talent"", but he is All-NBA potential.  I think of it more probabilistic. #1 pick has an some chance of turning into a franchise changing player. A #7 pick has a slightly lower chance, and #14 lower. But I don't think it's crazy that #7 + #14 + Wiseman collectively have more odds than Cade.   Let's say conservatively Wiseman is worth #15. If you look at past drafts in the 1-and-done era, around half the time #7 + #14 + #15 is better than #1:  - **2007: Yes** (Brewer + Thornton + Stuckey &gt; Oden) - **2008: No** (DRose &gt; Eric Gordon + Anthony Randolph + RoLo) - **2009: Yes** (Steph Curry + Clark + Daye &gt; Blake Griffin) - **2010: No** (Wall &gt; Monroe + 2Pat + Larry Sanders) - **2011: Yes** (Biyombo + Marcus Morris + Kawhi &gt; Kyrie) - **2012: No** (AD &gt; Barnes + Hensen + Harkless) - **2013: Yes** (McLemore + Shabazz + Giannis &gt; Bennett) - **2014: Yes** (Randle +  TJ Warren + Adreian Payne &gt; Wiggins) - **2015: No** (KAT &gt; Mudiay + Cam Payne + Oubre) - **2016: Yes** (Jamal Murray + Denzel Valentin + Juan Hernangomez &gt; Ben Simmons) - **2017: Yes** (Lauri + Bam Adebayo + Justin Jackson &gt; Fultz) - 2018 onwards: too early to tell (eg MPJ vs Ayton)  So if you look at the 11 year span from 2007 to 2017, you have 7 times (64%) where it's better to take #7 + #14 + #15."
So what about when Jamal Murray was damn near on the court when Denver played ?
"It doesn't even matter if he isn't (he is imo), the going rate for a good young player coming off their rookie deal is the max. Look at Ben Simmons, De'Aaron Fox,  Jamal Murray, Ingram, Siakam. All got the max (or close to it). Ayton is at worst, as good as those guys."
"having a year off is a good thing. nuggets are 7-1 since Jamal Murray went down with both his best replacements on the roster also being hurt, and we're still starting a rookie right now... jokic is so good it doesnt matter"
"I see no scenario where MPJ or Jamal Murray would not have ben involved in the Rockets demands. Giving up either of them would have been a bad decision considering Harden would have been a season rental. They certainly would have to give up numerous picks or multiple strong assets. In the Harden trade alone the Nets gave up Allen, Prince, LeVert, Kurucs, three first rounders, and four first round swaps.   If the Nuggets did not want to give up that many picks or both MPJ and Murray, then they would definitely have had to include their talented prospects such as RJ Hampton, Bol, or Dozier as well as someone like Gary Harris. If that scenario were to happen then we never would have gotten Gordon."
"Do you understand what you’re saying right now?? Barely any players can do what Jamal Murray did over 25 games and you’re saying it means nothing. Do you actually watch basketball?   I never said Jamal Murray was better or even near the same level as James harden, James harden is one of the best players of all time, but to act like what Jamal was doing wasn’t literally historically impressive is what’s an absolute clown show. Idk what else to tell you   The 24 PPG isn’t what was impressive, shooting 51% from the field, 46% from 3, and 94% from the line WHILE averaging 24 PPG is insanely impressive   Being the first player in NBA history to score 50 points without free throws while only missing 4 shots is insanely impressive...   If it’s nothing, let me ask you, what other guard other than Steph Curry can shoot that efficiently from 3 and the field over 25 games while averaging 24 PPG?"
"Ben Simmons is better than both. Kawhi and PG couldn’t even guard Jamal Murray, then LeBron locks him up in the 4th of every game a week later"
"Last point is an exaggeration. Murray is much more important. If mpj got injured nuggets still a contender, no one views them as one rn without Jamal"
imagine running jamal murray as a third option to KD lite  what the fuck kind of bullshit offense is that lmao
"He doesn't play defense and doesn't win games though. Like... I think he's a better scorer, but there's nothing that Trae does that Murray can't do. He averages more, but he's the first option on a really streaky and up to this point average team.   You may think he has better stats, but there's no way I'm taking Trae over Murray after what I have seen from Jamal these past 3 years."
Is he though? Trae is better than Jamal Murray even.
No Jamal Murray or Gary Harris makes things a lot easier for the Jazz though. Aaron Gordon simply doesn't exploit our weaknesses like those two do.
"Dlo is not even that inconsistent anymore. Jamal Murray is actually more inconsistent and he actually plays on a great team, yet some people praise him like he's a future superstar."
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind.

Monte Morris if Jamal Murray is healthy.
"Definitely, also it sucks jamal Murray gonna be out"
Are we talking about Jamal Murray? Cause I got to look some... things up tonight. Thanks for the reminder!
Hey man hometown team let’s goooo but hey fuck you guy nuggets all day Jamal Murray has a penis I dun seen it
RiP Jamal Murray
Yeah because they haven’t accomplished anything except a good regular season record and the Nuggets lost Jamal Murray. We’re winning the west if healthy

"but what star is available? like a true star, I don't think any.  Might be able to pry Jamal Murray away from Denver, but that's all I could think of."
Imagine thinking Jamal Murray is an all nba player rn
"That Nuggets team, that was when Masai made that Melo trade in his way out and got Gallo and the pick that ended up being Jamal Murray, right?"
Jamal Murray is not an all nba player lmao
Development isn't linear. Jamal Murray basically plateaued for 3 years before taking a leap again now.   MPJ could stay the way he is right now for the rest of his prime for all we know. Especially if he doesn't get some shot creation skills.
we calling Jamal Murray All NBA now?
Lmao Bogi makes Jamal Murray look consistent
"I think it was originally Andrew Wiggins, but I feel like I’ve also heard it for Jamal Murray and RJ Barrett"
"Seeing your nametag, I gotta share this fun fact: At the beginning of this season, in fantasy basketball, I traded my Jrue Holiday + Jamal Murray + 2nd rnd Draft Pick for Russ. Safe to say that the other fella is probably regretting this heavily as right now I have won 13 weeks in a row lol."
"Yea idk about this. The dude is big and slow, and has built his game around that.  I’m not criticizing Jokic and think he deserves MVP, but if this guy had the explosiveness of some other bigs he would definitely use it. Also as others have already said, what does playing safer actually mean? How many serious injuries are from playing too aggressive? Jamal Murray ACL, normal drive. KD Achilles, normal drive. How many serious injuries are the result of another player not playing safe? Jokic can play the way he does because he’s built for it, 6’2 guards cannot play like he does."
"If we meet in the ECF, I want everyone at full strength. Shit, I want all teams completely healthy. I still feel horrible about what happened to Jamal Murray."
"Is it? What would this Lakers team be without Lebron? You swap him for Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, or Jamal Murray and the Lakers are an 8th seed. And that's if AD stays healthy all year..."
 Because no one knew what jamal murray could turn into bruh
Jokic and Jamal Murray :(
god not looking out for Jamal Murray I guess 👺
Jamal Murray prob
"9 just isn't happening, Jamal Murray I would bet on so that's 6, but that's about it imo, all of the others are very unlikely."
you’re gonna lose this one. Jamal Murray is the only one left who will probably make one
"Gobert probably is the MVP of the Jazz this year but there have definitely been a number of national media guys asking why Mitchell was not getting MVP consideration as the best player on the team with the best record. If that same stuff was happening for Jamal Murray or Ben Simmons then that would really hurt the cases for Jokic and Embiid.   You don't hear Kawhi and CP3 getting MVP buzz for this same reason, because Paul George and Devin Booker can make the case that they've been more important to their team's success this year. It might be a minority of people who think that, but it's enough to knock them out of the MVP race. Like I said above, the same thing happened when Steph and KD were teammates.   There's just a big difference between how clear it is that Jokic and Embiid are the MVPs of their teams versus guys like Gobert, Kawhi and CP3 with their teams."
"Barton was supposed to be the next man up after Murray. Him and Morris are the only 2 guys that can replace Jamal as ball handlers and shot creators. I honestly thought Barton was adapting well to the new role, it’s a bummer they ran into the injury bug"
"&gt; Royce is a borderline all NBA defender he will do fine against LeBron. Obviously LeBron will get his because he is LeBron, but Royce is a very solid option.  He’ll probably average 35/10/10 if that’s the case.    &gt;AD will face Gobert when he comes anywhere near the paint.  Have you ever watched them play?  &gt;Whos guarding all of Utah's 40+% three point shooters?  The same players who guarded Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray last playoffs. Oh and the law of averages.  Did I mention they’re the #1 defense this season with LeBron and AD missing 40+ games combined?"
Jamal Murray in shambles after snap chatting his “stats” 😏🍆
"Jokic had Jamal Murray this season until his injury. Steph didn’t have Klay all season long. And Klay is arguable more important to the Warriors than Murray is to Nuggets, if you also account for the defense."
"Yea they are, the rotation was definitely not what it usually is (ignoring Klay being out). The main guys all put in big work today so it doesn’t compare so much for me to the Nuggets not having Jamal Murray atm"
Thats just untrue.  Rockets definitley were with harden and cp3.  Clippers are with George and Leonard.  Bucks were the last few years as well due to their dominant regular seasons. I think theres a few other teams that have been considered borderline over that time as well.  Celtics had a few years with a very good team.  Id also say most people considered the nuggets contenders this year before the Jamal Murray injury.  Especially after the Gordon trade.
The obvious answer is Jamal Murray or Middleton
Second best players then were Jamal Murray and Jeremi Grant and they are both gone now. Even Will Barton and Monte Morris are down with injuries.
Jamal Murray predicted that Facu will be punched by some player.
"What else can they do? They have no facilitators, Monte morris, Barton and jamal murray are out"
"&gt;Damn how’d they get to game 7 again?  Jokic has 28/8/6 the last 4 games of the series.   They lose without EITHER player. The first elimination game, where Jamal scored 42? Yeah jokic put up 31 and hit 7 threes to Murray's 4. He dragged Gobert out of the paint and Murray took advantage.   I watched that AI run. It was epic. That was never my argument. My point is that Jokic definitely could've made the finals against that competition too. Shit they went 7 against a Toronto team led by 2nd year Vince, a 37y.o. Charles Oakley and 35y.o. mark Jackson."
Not really surprising if that happens considering the loss of jamal murray
"Love me some Jokic content. So far his career trajectory reminds me of Tim Duncan. Very elite in the regular season and post season but doesn’t get nearly enough praise bcz he plays a brand of basketball non conducive to highlight reels.   To be clear, obviously Jokic gets praised a lot and has a lot of highlights. I’m not saying he doesn’t get any recognition at all rather not nearly enough considering how great he is.   For instance, Jamal Murray was the Nuggets highlight machine all throughout last year’s playoffs (rightfully so) even though Jokic was playing as good as Murray (if not better)."
"Iggy was very brief.   English, VanDeWeghe, Mutombo, Melo, Jokic all yes  Dan Issel, Bobby Jones, Fat Lever, David Thompson (74 points in a game! Say no to drugs sometimes).  Jamal Murray will definitely be there in a few years"
"you're\* you uneducated clown. You can't even articulate a couple of sentences together without sounding like an imbecile.  And, Murray has the potential to be a superstar for sure. You won't hear me say anything bad about Jamal."
"Tiresome? If y'all don't like how he uses social media (which is mostly good but fans of teams with no title hopes post lowlights)... Simply don't pay attention to him?  Jamal Murray posted himself getting blown. That is way worse than anything KD has ever posted or ever will. Get a grip, or at least exhibit the emotional intelligence to be aware of your bias."
"The other contenders are English, Fat Lever, Mutombo, Abdul-Rauf, Carmelo, Iverson, and Jamal Murray   I listened to Nuggets games on the radio with my dad in the 90s back when few games were televised locally. So I’m a little partial to Mutombo. But it’s 1A/1B/1C with English, Mutombo and Jokic"
DW we are missing 35 mpg jamal murray and his back up monte morris who plays 26 mpg.
what’s even crazier is jamal murray had 21(!!!) FGM in a game this season
Well first thing you have to know is that Jamal Murray is the GOAT aka the greatest of all time.
Isn’t Jamal Murray out? How would nuggets stand a chance against lakers. Wont Lebron and Davis be ready by playoffs? Davis already played. Genuinely curious
"Jamal Murray, 24.0 points on 61.7% TS"
"Isn't a debate? Are you mad?  Edit - Jamal Murray is better than Lillard, had a better playoffs than Lillard ever had"
"UK guards drafted since 2010:  2010: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe  2011: Brandon Knight, Josh Harrellson, Deandre Liggins  2012: Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb  2013: Archie Goodwin  2015: Devin Booker, Andrew Harrison  2016: Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis  2017: De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk  2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Hamidou Diallo  2019: Tyler Herro  2020: Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley"
"I'm interpreting the title the way it's written.   Jamal Murray is now the same age as Buddy Hield's rookie season, which doesn't make sense. How can someone me the same age as a rookie season?  Are you saying Murray is now the same age as Buddy Hield was during his rookie season?"
The first three times watching this clip I wondered why Jamal Murray was being so lazy and clapping instead of running back on defence.
"For a solid minute, I read ""Jamal Murray"" but was picturing Jamal Crawford.  Couldn't figure out what was going on."
"Jamal Murray has post game, just not giving much opportunity to show it."
how about jamal murray at 13
"Most people grow up playing baseball in the summer here. And the Jays were wildly popular in the 90s with back to back World Series.   But I’d say we have better basketball players than baseball players right now. Thanks to Vince Carter’s popularity in the 2000’s and with the Raptors recent championship and 7 year run there’s way more to come.   Outside of our Lord and Saviour Steve Nash there’s:   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Chris Boucher, and  Kelly O to name a few.   We the north!"
What makes Jamal Murray and Curry point guards and Harden a SG? What position is Westbrook? What was he playing on Houston? Positions are kinda meaningless.
"Jamal Murray is Canadian, Embiid is from Cameroon, Jokic is Serbian, and while KAT is a US citizen he played for the Dominican international team when he was under 18. I'm not sure if the FIBA rules allow someone to switch national teams when they go from being under to over 18 years old."
"Jokic, Jamal Murray, and Ben Simmons"
"Lol the history of that pick is hilarious. Looks like Masai fleeced that pick from the Knicks twice from 2 different franchises:  - In the Melo trade, while Masai was on the Nuggets, he got the Knicks to throw in a 2016 pick swap. Probably didn't seem like much, the Knicks would surely be good in 2016 with Melo. The Knicks ended up with the #7 pick, and that pick swap moved the Nuggets from #9 to #7 - landing them **Jamal Murray** - In the Bargnani trade, while Masai was on the Raptors, he got the Knicks to throw in the remaining 2016 pick. Probably didn't seem like much, because it was the worse of the 2016 Nuggets and Knicks picks. But it ended up as the #9 pick, which later became a centerpiece for **Kawhi Leonard**"
"That's right, their most recent garbage trade - landed Jamal Murray to the Nuggets - my god I was pulling my fuckin hair out after hearing they handed their first rounder to Toronto for that washed up guy"
Yeah the pick got ripped by smarter people at the time it's just been 5 years can be hard to remember. [The consensus take was Jamal Murray&gt;Buddy Hield](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2016/6/23/12016970/nba-draft-2016-mock-draft-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-kris-dunn-jamal-murray-dragan-bender). Multiple [sources had ths same conclusion](https://www.tothemean.com/tools/draft-models/#/2016/dv2/all).   It's kind of a microcosm of how NOP was run in the AD era always looking for the short term fix. They didnt want to wait and try to develop a player like Murray. Especially after 2016 which was frankly a disaster year for them they were looking to try to turn things around ASAP wherever they could find a quick fix. Hield was a known quantity they wanted to just get a guy whom they thought could help day 1. The irony was Hield wasnt actually good in NOP as a rookie. The DeMarcus Cousins market was alot worse than alot of people anticipated especially on here. Frankly if Hield had actually looked like some high quality prospect as a rookie Im not even sure NOP wouldve been willing to include him.
If we're having a debate about the **smartest** plays that develop as a result of good screeners:   PG: Jamal Murray - The man gets hit with Centers when he and Jokic reverse roles and he screens for Jokic    SG: Marcus Smart - The broad shoulders and the low core work well in his favour   SF: Lebron James - Is there a thing that this man cannot do?   PF: Draymond Green - Super smart about where and when he should screen   C: Nikola Jokic - The man is an screen island bombarding cutters with passes  If we're having a debate about **hardest** screeners:   PG: Lowry and his Kardashian sized ass   SG: Lu Dort   SF: Jae Crowder   PF: Richaun Holmes   C: Steven Adams
"I would still say about as good.   Buddy was great, but Jamal was still a rookie on Kentucky putting up 20/5/2 on good efficiency and good shooting numbers.   I agree Buddy was the better of the two (since he was a 4th year player), but at the same time Murray was an All-American. They were pretty close to the same skill level in college."
"lol so true. like, i saw it, internally thought that comma was odd but whatever, damn Jamal Murray young af. he’s going to be special."
Jamal Murray is an amazing screener for a PG.
"I didn’t say Buddy was an awful pick. I think he was good pick, the guy is one of the best floor spacers in the NBA.   You’re really trying to fight a point I never made or intended to make. I literally just thought it was crazy that Jamal Murray has played 8800 minutes in the regular season and 1261 minutes in the playoffs and how now reached the age of Buddy as a rookie, when the two were debated against each other a lot when they were prospects.   It’s more of a cool fact, and also your point ignores the concept that if the Pelicans drafted Murray than there is still a chance they could have gotten boogie by swapping Murray and Hield in their trade package for Boogie."
News flash:    Jamal Murray is an inconsistent scorer.
What? Who the hell would ban you? Was that for the Jamal Murray photo or something?
Was it for the crying Jordan Jamal murray girlfriend one?
Doesn't look like Jamal Murray would be given up for Harden either though. joe harris is a volume 43% 3 point shooter. last season lavert was giving 19 points  and 4 assists. and dinwidie was giving 21 points and 7 assists. both with ok field gal %. And shamet is an active 3 point shooter with ok ball handling and passing. Its not like they suck.
The Rockets would be laughed at. That haul wouodnt be enough for even Jamal Murray let alone Harden
Something is not right and I can feel it. Jamal Murray had 36 or 32 pts?
"Yeah, because his shots are falling. If he can keep that up, he has a place on this team for sure, Denver is always kinda lacking in guards that can shoot (it's scary when I feel better about Jokic or Millsap taking the shot instead of any guard not named Jamal Murray)"
I think the biggest issue is Jamal Murray going thermonuclear again
"Jamal murray is not a minus defender. He's not great by any means, but cmon. He's break even at worst"
Jamal Murray isnt looking like the bubble god
"Jokic turns gobert from great to good and Rudy does the same to jokic they cancel each other out. Look at jokics stats the rest of the playoffs, Im not even gonna look em up but I know he played much better 2nd and 3rd rounds. Jamal murray on the other hand holy shit I'll never disrespect him again"
"I think it's really close. Some would point to Jokic's recent playoff success, but the Nuggets had Jamal Murray putting up 50 point games while Embiid's best teammate after Simmons went down was Tobias Harris"
"I don’t know, but that Denver “Big 3” isn’t winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokić is a very overrated player. I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, or Joel Embiid than Nikola Jokić. It’s close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."
"I remember getting flamed after the bubble was over for saying I didn’t want to call Jamal Murray a top 15 or something player and he wouldn’t be an all star or something along those lines, people really take it game by game out here"
"PGs need time. I agree with the smartest guy in the room take KOC can be a little not seeing the forest through the trees sometimes. That being said everyone thought Darius garland sucked and now he’s playing great. Same with Sexton. Jamal Murray wasn’t lighting it up from day 1, neither was Fox. Trae young was one of the worst players in the league for 2 months of his rookie season. PG is a really hard position to translate to the NBA level. Killian might not be good, but let’s give him a couple seasons before declaring that, because it’s very easy to have egg on your face with young PGs. Patience"

"Denver nuggets have a fun duo of Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic, and the Dallas Mavericks have Luka Doncic who’s pretty fun"
"His defense has been incredible, he’s really gotten damn good at going straight up on contests. He’s super mobile for his size too so Jamal Murray hunting for switches on DA tonight for example wasn’t a great strategy.   He’s been frustrating on offense but honestly he’s kind of been that way since his rookie season. He either plays like tonight or we see him look like he’s barely trying. I’m just confident that having Monty and CP3 will give us less of those bad night and more like today, I guess we’ll see"
"Jamal Murray missed some games, and they had a short offseason after losing their best defenders. Based on what we saw tonight, They'll figure it out soon. For sure a playoff team"
"Jamal Murray missed a bunch of games.  He was back tonight, and they played very well."
"Jamal Murray isnt good enough to only dial it in while desperate. But damn, when the stakes are high he balls out"
Jamal Murray is a lot of fun to watch.
Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray keeps me up at night
"I got RoCo, KAT, Ayton, Jamal Murray, Gordon Hayward. Smh"
Rondo wasn't even a starter.  This is a horrible example.     Jamal Murray will help you win a championship better than Trae Young can.   But Trae can take you to the playoffs better.
"so is rajon rondo better than all because he and the lakers won a lot last season? trae young is clearly the better player. the question is whos the better player not whose team is winning the most.  trae and the hawks literally almost beat the nets the other day and are 3-1 this season. id love to see what jamal murray could do in a team of damian jones, deandre bembry, 40 year old vince carter, and a bunch of rookies.   trae became an all star with that team. murrays with the way better team, has he ever been an all star? i mean wins over stats right?"
bro the whole list is just a walking L. Like just stop. No ones even gonna argue with you cause who in their right mind believes Jamal Murray &gt;&gt; Trae and Donovan Mitchell
He's like Jamal Murray lite lol
"If domantas is top 20 then where are the other young players like Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Fox, Kristaps? Or even older players who still play at a high level like Kyle Lowry, Demar Derozan, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker.   Domantas isn’t above any of those players, calling him top 20 is just straight stupid lol"
"Once again look at the teams. Murray is able to play behind the best, at worst second best center in the league while Booker has had to do everything himself. He was an all star last year and was really good when they were in the qualifiers to try and make the playoffs. You’ll see this year now that Booker has some help that Booker&gt;&gt;&gt; Jamal Murray"
"As good as Trae Young is, i think Jamal Murray is just more scalable in the playoffs.    Trae Young's defense is Lou Williams level"
"I’m absolutely in favor of gobert being above sabonis (even though I love sabonis and think he’s probably top 30-40 rather than top 20) and believe that gobert is *also* underrated by most people, BUT...  saying that he made Jokic look pedestrian in that playoff series is IMO really inaccurate. I think part of this narrative comes in because Jamal went nuclear and Jokic was more than happy to play around Jamal instead of the other way around for once, particularly because Jamal had a much better matchup with Utah’s perimeter defenders. Jokic didn’t need to challenge Rudy on every possession. But just because Rudy was a tougher matchup than the perimeter defenders and the nuggets opted to attack with the dude dropping 40+ every game doesn’t mean Rudy made Jokic look pedestrian lol.  He averaged 26.3 points, 8.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.1 stocks on 52/48/85 splits. 62.4% TS, and a 127 ORTG. Including the game winner directly over Rudy in the last 30 seconds to win the series when it counted.  I don’t see any world in which that’s pedestrian, just because it took a backseat to the Mitchell v Murray narrative where the were both on fire scoring.  Credit to gobert for making things more difficult for Jokic, absolutely. He’s one of the few who can. But I have yet to see Jokic have a pedestrian playoff series. The closest thing was probably games 2-3 of that series where it seemed like the whole team just didn’t care and was going through the motions. But for an entire series? Haven’t seen it yet."
"Ight i’ll give it a go..  Devin Booker Trae Young Jaylen Brown Donovan Mitchell Jamal Murray De’Aaron Fox Ja Morant  I think Young &amp; Booker are 1a and 1b honestly, and I like Brown for MIP and All Defensive nods this year."
1. Trae Young  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Devin Booker  4. Jaylen Brown  5. Jamal Murray  6. DeAaron Fox  7. Ja Morant
\- **Trae Young**   \- **Devin Booker**   \- **Jaylen Brown**   \- **Ja Morant**   \- **Donovan Mitchell**   \- **Jamal Murray**   \- **Deaaron Fox**
Jamal Murray ahead of Trae Young? Ja better than Mitchell? Wtf man
"Devin Booker, Trae Young, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, Donovan Mitchell, Deaaron Fox, Jamal Murray.  Though these guys are so young this list can easily change in one season."
In my opinion:  1 - Devin Booker  2 - Trae Young  3 - Jaylen Brown   4 - Donovan Mitchell   5 - Ja Morant  6 - Jamal Murray  7 - De'Aaron Fox
Jamal Murray tho
jamal murray was torching the jazz and the clips and did absolutely nothing against the lakers you telling me rondo and caruso locked up jamal? look man i’m not here to argue
"Jamal Murray and both Bojan and Bogdan Bogdanovic on bench for guard depth.   Also, what am I missing with the Irving placement in World team haha."
Curry  Paul  Kyrie  Luka  Lillard  Lowry  Westbrook  Young  Ben  Wall  Jrue  Jamal  Kemba  Morant  Fox  Conley  Schroder  Russell  Goran  Beverley  Jounte Murray  Lonzo  Brogdon  Graham  Garland  Fultz  Coby  Hill  Payton  Hayes
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"I understand what you're saying, but there's far more at work here than race, and I don't think that's the most relevant aspect. These are rich, famous young guys on the road. And the league has a sexual history that traces from Wilt to Magic to Jamal Murray getting sucked off in a video lol. Really don't think this is just a racial stereotype. Don't think it's some evil thing either. Just guys being promiscuous dudes, and women doing the same."
Wilt 100% wouldve pulled a Jamal Murray
That tf would you shoot Jamal Murray
"No. At 21 ppg, it’s entirely possible that he may not be the leading scoring on his team. Jamal Murray is close to 21 ppg, but Jokic is the MVP candidate. Middleton is averaging more ppg, yet Giannis is the MVP candidate . Tobias Harris is around 21 ppg, yet Embiid is the MVP candidate.   The player you described could possibly be DeAngelo Russell. If the T’wolves were 52-30, KAT would be the MVP candidate.   Or it could be Malcolm Brogdon. If the pacers were 52-30, how many people would say it was because of Sabonis?  When the Raptors were a top seed... Kyle Lowry didn’t get much consideration as an MVP candidate. They looked toward Derozen/Leonard/Siakim as the MVP candidates.   Your player would need to do more...essentially they would HAVE to win the conference with inferior talent... aka CP3 with the hornets, Derrick Rose with the Bulls, Iverson with the 76ers, etc."
"its on brand for the Nuggets tbh. Jokic 41st pick. MPJ was supposed to be up there in the draft. Jamal murray stubbed his toe this morning and used it as motivation,"
"My point is we’re talking about Michael Porter Jr, not Jamal Murray? Wtf are you on about?"
"Nuggets have Jamal Murray, MPJ and now Aaron Gordon along with some other nice role players. They would most likely crush this current Lakers team."
"Just want to take a second to mention that over the last 21 games, Jamal Murray has had  17 games where he's shot at least 46% from the floor, 16 games where he's scored at least 20 points and 14 games where he's made at least 40% of his 3s."
that's DPOY candidate Jamal Murray to you
Lmaoooo that Jamal Murray fingering stopped real quick
"With Jokic, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, MPJ and now Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee, the Nuggets are stacked. Murray would be the best guard on the floor in that series and Jokic the best big man. Stopping Jokic would be a hard task for the Clippers."
"the clippers will depend a lot ironically on how well rondo can mesh in and if he can play as well as they need to pull them out of those offensive funks but it'll be hard unless kawhi and PG let him have the ball and don't go into their iso shit so often when they get cold which may still be a problem     i think the nuggets were still better last year with grant and it's hard to say with murray because he's definitely not been bubble murray and they've lost weirder games i feel this year than last     utah remains to be seen but they're on a win streak again after a stumble     for the lakers it really depends on when AD and Bron come back, if they can come back and get like 5-10 warm up games of regular season in together then yeah it's going to be tough for anyone in the west to beat them, the clippers probably still have the best shot since they have guys that can slow lebron down specifically     but if they can't get in a lot of games they could easily be bounced in the first round, they'd just get more dangerous the longer they can survive in the playoffs     feels like it'd probably be lakers &gt; clippers &gt;&gt; nuggets =&gt; jazz     if the jazz continue to shoot well and jamal heats up again i think both the nuggets and jazz could upset the LA teams even the lakers if they don't get enough games in for lebron and AD.. unless the lakers shooters decide to hit shots these playoffs then it's going to be a big problem for anyone with the lakers defense being what it is"
"And the nuggets didn’t have Gary Harris, will Barton, and some of Jamal Murray."
"Booker and Tatum are the young players that are in that ""these guys are REALLY good"" but not quite ""full blown superstars"" category. It's a distinct milestone in a players development I think so it creates a group of players that are bound to be compared. I'd say Donovan Mitchell is in that category too, with Fox and maybe Jamal Murray in their too.   This is not to say all these players are equal, but they're in the same broad skill-level category I'd say."
Jamal Murray is a star
1. Lebron  2 AD  3. PG  4. Kawhi 5. Harden 6. Kyrie 7. KD 8. Steph  9. Gobert  10. Mitchell 11. KAT  12. Shai  13. Dame 14. CJ  15. Lowry  16. Tatum  17. Brown 18. Randal  19. Vucevic  20. Lavine  21. Young 22. Collins 23. Luka 24. Jokic 25. Jamal Murray  26. Grant 27. Jrue  28. Giannis  29. Sabonis  30. Brogdon/ 31. Butler 32. Adebayo  33. Zion  34. BI 35. Embidd  36. Simmons  37. Derozan  38. Beal 39. Westbrook  40. Cp3  41. Booker  42. Wood  He’s not almost top 25. He has a long way to go
Damn Jamal Murray in good company
"You'd assume but I'd like to see how he handles the pressure. Jamal Murray looked like he would be a superstar after those playoffs and folded, Mitchell has been great but I want a large sample size, can you blame me?"
"There's definitely hope, and that series had me convinced him and Jamal Murray were gonna make a big jump but since I've decided to wait a little more until I say that. The thing with the Jazz is that basically any guy on that team on any given night can get 20, Clarkson, Mitchell, Conley, I think even Gobert and Ingles could. So I want to see who the guy is for them in the playoffs."
And Jamal Murray can always channel his inner Michael Jordan again
"Max contracts are precisely the problem. Tobias Harris and Anthony Davis got basically the same contract lol. Same with Embiid and Wiggins, Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray, etc."
"Well they traded all those assets to give themselves a good chance to win a title in the present. Harden was available to other teams too, it’s not the Nets fault that teams valued Tyler Herro and Jamal Murray more than James harden"
Monte Morris  Jamal Murray   Gordon (not drafted)  MPJ  Jokic
"Since you made that [post 3 weeks ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/m01xrk/oc_breaking_down_jamal_murray_since_the_beginning/) lets take a look at Murray's averages   19/6/2 57.5% TS. Oh wait, that's pretty much exactly what I predicted what is stats would be long term so thank you for reminding me of this and proving what I said better than I could myself. Turns out Jamal Murray is not a hybrid of Steph Curry and Zion Williamson."
Forbes is the suns killer had 8 3s in a game last season against the suns and now killing again. Hate him and Jamal Murray
Expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-15) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (12-11) ---|---   D. Garland | Jamal Murray  C. Sexton  |   Will Barton Isaac Okoro |  M. Porter  Jarrett Allen|  Paul Millsap  A. Drummond |   Nikola Jokic  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-15) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (12-11) ---|--- Outback Jesus (OUT)  |      PJ Dozier  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |      G. Harris    (OUT)  L. Nance (OUT) |  G. Whittington  (OUT)
He couldn’t even defend Jamal Murray
As time goes on I expect the Luka draft (2018?) and the Tatum draft (2017) will be viewed as better drafts. But 2016 was a good draft class but it's just hard for me to see any of these guys as top 10 players besides maybe Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray if he ever gets his shit together.
ANDREW WIGGINS WILL WIN DPOY AND JAMAL MURRAY IS WASHED
Honest question. Why is Jamal Murray not in that Tier 3?
“Crying on National TV Jamal Murray” is definitely elite
Abstinence Jamal Murray in an elimination game? 😛
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"Probably just below in tier 4 with the likes of Jamal Murray, D'Lo and Bledsoe."
"The media is just skewed because..... well let’s face it..... it’s Utah and they’re not a sexy, big market team.  But those who watch the games know that Utah is a legit team and Mitchell is a beast.  I believe if Jamal Murray wasn’t playing out of his mind in the bubble last year, the Jazz would have won and would be viewed differently this year."
Jamal Murray somehow can’t miss against us and it makes absolutely no sense
As a jamal murray fan i hate to say it but mitchell has proved this season he's better. Murray gotta be consistant
"Nuggets fan here:   We lost Jeremi grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig- which was almost our entire bench unit. Jeremi would come to be a starter and then we’d pull Millsap off the bench, but yeah, our team didn’t get better. Isaiah Hartenstein was signed to replace plumlee but has not been playing well and he’s the only other center on our roster besides Jokic.  Combine that with nagging injuries to Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, and now even PJ Dozier. Our team is being forced to play 3rd string players significant minutes and play our remaining starters too many minutes.   We’ve even attempted small ball (maybe even considered “micro ball”) lineups, with 4 small guards and Jamykel Green at center, who are always outmatched and cannot make up for their size.   The off-season was not kind to us and even though I believe we could still make a splash in the playoffs with reduced rotation, we’re going to have trouble getting a good spot with a healthy bunch at this rate."
Jamal Murray is literally shooting much worse even if you’re looking at FG% instead of TS%  And 44% from the field isn’t some horrendous number especially when 40% of your shots are 3s
"&gt;Grant is shooting very efficient far more efficient than Jamal Murray  Lol did u just compare a 6'9 forward to a 6ft point guard??  Remove Grant's FT% (because I know you new school NBA fans love to magically make poor efficiency players look halfway decent by combining all their percentages). This guy is 6'9 and shooting a whopping 44% from the field. That's god awful. His three point percentage is excellent, if he was shooting like this in the bubble maybe Denver thinks twice and actually offers him more than the Pistons to come back and do what he should be doing, shooting the 3 and playing defense.   44% from the field for a wing is god awful considering how much easier it is for a player to get a basket when they're not the shortest person on the floor. Especially considering there's no fans so every game is like practice. Imagine if there were fans out there,he'd probably be shooting 42/36/85.   No wonder his team only has 4 wins. If y'all want to make him an all-star,be my guest. This crap would never fly out west."
Grant is shooting very efficient far more efficient than Jamal Murray  And 24ppg is wayyy more than “a couple buckets”  He’s a legit all star
The man monstar'd Jamal Murray
It’s Dejounte Murray not Jamal lol
"Might not be the most popular idea but I think they should try something around Murray for beal. The nuggets get a better version of the scoring guard they currently have, and Washington gets probably the best young player possible right now. I say this as a big Jamal fan"
"All cool.  Jamal put up 31.6/5.6/6.3 (only 2.0 TOVs as well, which is huge for a guy that used to be known for turning it over like mad) while shooting on .550/.533/.920 splits. Also just 3.6 FTA/game  Now obviously it wouldn't be Jamal Murray if he didn't somehow manage to sneak his distinct inconsistency into the mix by scoring 12, 14 and 17 in 3 games (18/50 combined shooting), while putting up 36, 42 and two 50-bombs in the other four lol.  That said, while Bubble Murray probably ain't ever gonna turn into a long term norm, it still sucks how some people here (and even on /r/denvernuggets) have decided that he's now a fraud because he's having issues with consistency at the age of 23, while playing through an injury for 35+ MPG. Used to be a time when HoF-ers were coming into the league at that kind of age lol."
Yea what happened to them?! Is it Jamal Murray kind of playing worse? I know he was a huge part of their team in the bubble but maybe he can't seem to recreate that now during a more normal season set up?
"Why would the Wizards want Jamal Murray on that contract? He's never been a max player until he had a great few weeks in the bubble, which by all means looks like an outlier, and now he looks just as inconsistent as he's always been."
Murray isn't close to as talented as Beal as an offensive player. Beal is a guy who delivers every night. Jamal gives you two bad games for every good game.
Jamal Murray is averaging 18ppg
"overrated, good team and all of a sudden he looks a lot more like Jamal Murray than Lavine or Beal"
Jamal Murray was the best player on the planet in the bubble
Jamal Murray will only be relevant for a fluke bubble run and ~~being careless with~~ his IG
"Jamal Murray should be expandable honestly, I think Jokic needs a better running mate to win a championship"
"I don’t know where Nuggets fans stand on Jamal Murray, but I just don’t think he’s capable of being that second guy"
Jamal Murray will only be relevant for a fluke bubble run and being careless with his IG
"I understand playoff success is important, obviously. But I think people put too much weight on in...you can't sit here and tell me Jamal Murray is a better player than Khris just because his recent playoff run was better. Jamal obviously is younger and still could end up being the better player in the long run but Khris is a much better overall player right now."
Remember that Nuggets fan really said they’d rather have Jamal Murray over James Harden.
"Jamal ""Kyrie Irving"" Murray"
when are the nuggets going to realize jamal murray was a massive fluke and obviously won't return to the conference finals unless he is traded?
"As someone who thinks that Jamal Murray isn't a good enough second option next to Jokic, the Nuggets losing to a Bucks team sans Jrue Holiday is only throwing more fuel on that fire."
I can't figure out if Jamal Murray is the answer as the #2 in Denver or not
Remember when everyone on this sub said the Nuggets shouldn't trade Jamal Murray for James Harden
4-14 for 9pts for Jamal Murray. Yikes!
"Lmfao, Jamal Murray confirmed overrated. Shoutout to all the dumb asses pretending that his bubble playoff performance was the new norm or sustainable in any way."
Jamal Murray. mr. inconsistent. 9 points 4/14 from the field.
Royce O’Neale is somewhere between Tier 2 and Tier 3 depending on whether he’s guarding Jamal Murray or not
Jamal “Curry” Murray Wiggins Oubre Draymond Wiseman
Jamal Murray Caris LeVert Jimmy Butler Robert Covington Clint Capela
I mean he played really good in the bubble and i guess people expected him to take the next step this season but that hasnt happend. He is back to the pre bubble Jamal Murray.
"Nuggets series, Jamal Murray made him look like a traffic cone"
Jamal Murray&gt;Luka if that's the case.
Yep he'll be reevaluated in the next few days. But tbh this is the season where resting players should be encouraged. Imagine if Shai had a Jamal Murray level injury with 2 or 3 games left in the season. When you play so many games after a short offseason these injuries are bound to happen more often. Better to play it safe. Kind of the same reason they are allowed to straight up sit Horford. Why risk a huge injury in a season that we aren't gonna make the playoffs in?
"Our best player is Jamal Murray, but now it Shai Gilgeous. Canada is very good at basketball, the most talented in the world in fact behind the United States. Losing Murray was a big blow to Team Canada tho. Our backcourt is now Dort/Shai instead of Murray/Shai."
Jokic’s team was much better suited for the playoffs than Embiid’s team. You’re telling me you expected Embiid to go far with no spacing and poor coaching. It was easy as hell to game plan against them because their two best players occupied the same space.     They were a Kawhi miracle away from playing the Bucks in the ECF and last playoffs they didn’t have Ben Simmons. I don’t know how that is underperforming. I think they performed to expectations. Jokic had one miracle run that coincided with Jamal Murray playing the best basketball of his life.    Teams don’t take many shots against Jokic because teams don’t have elite bigs. The second Jokic faced an elite big he let up 31 points a game on 67% TS. Jokic will never win a championship as the best player on a team if he has to go against elite offensive bigs in the playoffs. Embiid can.
"The path to another ring just became so much easier for LeBron without Jamal Murray and now the scarcity of big men in Brooklyn. They now have to rely on a rotation of DeAndre, Claxton, Green, and a washed Griffin against an under 30 years old Drummond and Anthony Davis."
"This off-season, if Fox is clearly unhappy in Sacramento, the Nuggets should offer Sacramento Jamal Murray and 2 1sts for De’Aaron Fox. Fox is a clear step up from Murray, and would let them double down on competing now. Meanwhile the Kings get a borderline all-star in return, plus two firsts to help them continue to try to build up their roster. The firsts won’t be super valuable since the Nuggets will be in contention, so I think it’s a fair deal   Fox: 25/4/7   Murray: 21/4/5"
See most recent case: Jamal Murray
"I am not the largest fan and think he is still a bit overrated. He seems to get less fouls and shoots the three better recently so I am warming up to him though.   Luka gets a lot of credit for tonight but I think tonight is a typical night that a Luka hater would point out. The most negative value in +/- out of all the starters on the the team, and 3/10 from the 3 point line but everyone looks at his impressive volume stats and that he made this legendary game winner. Despite that, Luka has below average clutch stats (and was terrible last year) and hasn't had the [+/- numbers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) of the superstars he often gets compared to. Mavs have a good coach and a good underrated deep roster. If the Mavs had Lillard, Curry, Kyrie, or Chris Paul instead how would their record look compared to now?   Actually not even with them, I think if they had Fox, Jamal Murray, or SGA (forced to play PG instead of SG) instead the Mavs record wouldn't drop off as much as people think they would.  I don't dislike Luka, I dislike the fans that say he is closer to MJ and Lebron, when I actually think his impact is closer to Fox, Jamal Murray, or SGA but he just has higher volume then them (and not as good defense as all three of them)."
No his best position is a Jamal Murray type role when the Wolves get more experience.
Ask Jamal Murray about 6 minutes.
"Yeah most likely he does and I still want him to. While I don't think he can easily be that top tier PG, I think he could similar to guys like prime Kemba Walker or similar version of Jamal Murray was with Jokic.  I'm just saying I still wouldn't mind him coming off the bench. If he is still able to close games, get like 30 to 32 minutes, and play at his best, I think he can still be like that 20-25 million player, I believe he can be."
"If you do rank Harden over KD, then obviously KD would replace Middleton in the 2nds team, but who do you put at point? Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Jamal Murray?"
"Definitely not the most. He's an elite shooter next to Giannis. Compare that to Westbrook, Wall, Love, Wiggins, Draymond, Horford, Hield, etc.  He's more similar to Tobias Harris (except better imo, though it's closer this year) or Jamal Murray. Murray was not worth up to 38 mill a year prior to the bubble playoffs, which was hopefully a turning point before the ACL. He's better and younger than Middleton but it's a similar contract situation.  Both were homegrown talented and key pieces of their teams in smaller markets not known to attract big free agents, and both could have got the max elsewhere. So you overpay. Middleton's shooting and offensive skillset is crucial next to Giannis even if he isn't 2nd-star talent."
All it takes is a second. Case in point - Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray as Omar???  WTF  If anybody is Omar, its Kawhi.  THINK ABOUT IT."
"As much as I want him to play in the 4th, let’s keep him on the bench. Too soon from the Jamal Murray situation. Not worth it."
I would have said Jamal Murray... people still talked about him like he was the 18 PPG on ehh efficiency that he was last year.  Damn shame.
"Not me, but a friend, yesterday he was saying that Jamal Murray is better than Jokic (and just about every opinion of his in general is the weirdest and most contrarian opinion you can possibly have lol, to the point where he gets constantly called out for it)"
You just described the Junior Varsity version of Jamal murray
I was scared for Jamal Murray during the series with the Lakers. He looked like he was running on less than  fumes. I even remember one play he drove in the paint and completely fell and I thought *that* was the moment he seriously injured himself. A lot of these guys are putting **loads** of mileage on their bodies in such a short period of time.
"This sounds like a good idea, considering how he has a couple of opportunities to test his body out at game speed, and can make adjustments to his mechanics accordingly; I would hope denver is willing to try to stagger his game play with some g league time and rehab.  Having a cohesive blend of different circumstances can help Jamal Murray find that sweet spot/fine tuning in his gait and his movement to really get back to where he was before"
Why are they back if they’re still injured? This isn’t necessarily just the Nets fault either. All teams do it. The league has wayyyyy too many games this season especially that are too close together. I believe that’s a big reason Jamal Murray got injured. But I still think they shouldn’t be back in the rotation if they’re still injured or perhaps partially injured.
"I think you summed it up perfectly. People point to the # of times Dlo got traded as meaning he's not good, when in reality trading Dlo and Mozgov eventually brought LeBron, the sign and trade was so Nets would get a 1st round pick and Golden State gets something in return despite losing KD, and trading Dlo to the Twolves made sense because the fit was going to questionable with Steph as PG. Of course no one expected Klay to be out another year.   I think once the Twolves together, Dlo can have that Jamal Murray type role."
We all knew they were not gonna take chances with KD on back to back. Harden was already out. Not sure about BG and LA injuries. They are probably more cautious after seeing Jamal Murray come back from injury and go down with ACL tear. Is Kyrie playing?
"Well without Jamal Murray the Nuggets chances against the Clippers arent that great. Still, let’s not act like Zubac wasn’t in foul trouble minutes into each game trying to defend Jokic. The guy was fouling left and right"
It’s 72/82 games and then 4 7 game series in the playoffs where it matters. We just saw Jamal Murray destroy his knees in a meaningless reg season game near the end of the season. You want an injury prone KD to ball out against the top seeded team in the East?
tell that to Jamal Murray
Your mentality is how Jamal Murray situations arise
"He went into the tax with the melo nuggets. I assume there were conversations about that before the Gordon trade. Especially since Josh is technically the one running the nuggets and he’s actually a basketball fan.  I do agree that the timing is super unfortunate because we barely got to see the core 4 play together and we will have a limited window to see before we have to decide on extensions. BUT, I think the fact that   1.	we saw them gel *so well, so quickly* is a good thing - especially since it was a fit that seemingly made so much sense on paper and then it instantly translated to reality. It wasn’t like flashes or hints with growing pains - just instantly incredible 2.	the fit around Jokic is the more important part - and we still have the rest of this season and next to see how AG and Porter fit around him with a bigger role. It’s not exactly apples to oranges, but I feel incredibly confident that you can plug and play Murray when he gets back. Perhaps it would be harder for AG/MPJ to take more of a backseat as scorers/on-ball guys when he’s back, but I think that’s a good problem to have. especially when we look at the issues our bench has had with people who can create their own shot and how we need to stagger Jamal and Jokic. If we have our two forwards who want more on-ball action, that just gives us more potency with our staggering potential  I just have a hard time believing that if Jokic and the rest of the guys make a decent run without Murray and a solid regular season showing without Murray that we wouldn’t try to run it back once Murray is healthy. Yeah, ideally we would get more time to see everyone play together. But that’s not in the cards. Still think it gets done."
What? Jamal Murray **just** tore his ACL.
"Embiid was great but the 76ers were also riding Tobias Harris's Career season, Simmons being Simmons and Seth Curry starting off the season with unprecedented 3 point shooting. The floor was incredibly spaced allowing Embiid to absolutely feast. Put Jokic on that team and the 76ers are even better. Where Embiid has the leg up is in defensive rim protection but I think Jokic's facilitation and offensive prowess beats that out. Meanwhile the Nuggets were playing without MPJ and with Jamal Murray having a terrible start to the season where Jokic was and still is the sole reason their team are even playoff contenders. Jokic brings more to his team that leads to winning than any other player in the league making the Nuggets a playoff team which is literally the definition of the most valuable player."
"Jokic is the team.  Jokic has  2x the boxplusminus as Gordon porter and Murray combined.  They will barely get worse without jamal. Granted, with or without Murray they always were going to lose in the 1st or second round."
"It is *coming from his mind*, sure, but he could very easily say something like “I imagine the Nuggets FO were asking themselves, is Jamal Murray bigger in the playoffs than Harden? Will Harden, come playoff time, be enough to get the job done? Now, in my opinion the answer to the first is no at this point in his career, and the answer to the second is probably yes, but...” Do you see how that could work? You can have a thought exercise/idea/speculative conversation without everything said being your *personally held opinion.*"
"&gt;lol. Your sad bro.  Bruh, pathetic.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; No, if Jokic is the 5th seed he won’t automatically be below Giannis. That simply is just not true. The Lakers are only 0.5 and can definitely pass the Nuggets without Jamal even with the Nuggets maintaining a better record then Giannis.   Mavs and Blazers can overtake Jokic aswell dude, and Lakers have a harder schedule than the Nuggets. They will likely drop to 7th or 8th. Jokic as a 5th seed would be behind a surging Mavs most likely. With Giannis bound to return from injury, and with the Bucks having the 16th easiest schedule, they're about to win ALOT of games soon. Nuggets have a similar SOS but they're gonna collapse most likely. Jokic is having a rough stretch and it's gonna be hard to adjust to a ""Murray-less"" team. It's VERY logical to assume Giannis will have a better record if Jokic is the 5th seed. Lakers are a faulty example of a 5th seed because their win percentage is being carried by the start of the season and in a few weeks they're about to drop massively, so lets look at the next example. The Blazers have a Win% of 57%. We can assume the Nuggets as a 5th seed will have that if the Blazers rise to the fourth seed (Or hell, the Mavs can but Blazers are a more concrete example.) The Bucks have a Win% of 62, and it's about to rise when Giannis returns. So, as we can see, the Nuggets as a 5th seed will have an inferior Win% and thus an inferior record to the Bucks.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; And no, again it’s not off of seeding, it’s off of record. Usually there is a correlation there but not always. Literally ask anyone or look at past results. You are just wrong bro. Like seriously, just ask anyone, it’s not that hard.   Prove it then lmao. I already said. If its not hard, prove it. So far, its always been based off of seeding. The media and everyone always cites seeding, never record. Voters usually vote by seeding. If there has never been an instance of your example, maybe it isn't true?"
"This really is not uncommon. The NBA literally always sees a ton of injuries. It’s a long season, and basketball is a particularly easy sport to take one wrong step and twist an ankle or a knee.   Like Jamal Murray didn’t just tear his ACL because of a compressed schedule. He took one really awkward step at a bad angle at high speed."
But they both get swept if they only had Jamal Murray.
"Murray was a bit banged up last playoffs, was hurt this season too. He's never been an all star.   MPJ Shoots 53% fg and 42% from three in year two.  The difference between Jamal and a slightly above average lower priced pg isn't so bad in terms of win expectation.  I would rather gamble on MPJ and his high ceiling personally."
Jamal Murray
That might be my favorite Jamal Murray pass at least of the past two years
"jamal has better shot creation, which is more handy in the playoffs. Grant's 3's are still &gt;70% assisted this season. and also if grant and jokic are the 1-2 punch, they often occupy the same spaces, but murray has more spacing to work with jokic"
I became a Jamal Murray fan on a very different day than that.
Jamal Murray
I became a Jamal Murray fan on this day [https://youtu.be/WAuc4CCAA8I](https://youtu.be/WAuc4CCAA8I)
Jamal Murray because he is the first player in NBA history
Didn’t work when they called that bullshit offensive foul on Jamal Murray last season against the Bucks. Wasnt even a foul
"Why wouldn't he? He's been on the biggest stage before, so fans coming back isn't gonna shake his confidence lol. This isn't Jamal Murray bruh"
"&gt;Try shooting 3-pointers outside, in the snow, with a bitter Ontario wind ripping through you, after you've just held a deep-knee squat for 12 minutes, a cup of piping hot tea carefully balanced on your thigh to make sure you do not waver -- all this executed under the watchful eye of your father, a martial arts enthusiast and basketball junkie who has been honing your skills since you were an infant.  &gt;That father, Roger Murray, is bound together with his son Jamal on a quest: to prove not only that this Canadian talent can thrive but also that he could someday emerge as one of the best -- if not the best -- in the NBA."
I agree with you nuggets being crazy is really just is Jamal going crazy.  Jokic will have rare games he goes off but he is pretty consistent.  I murray didn't go off that jazz series was over.  And I know the jazz be killing and I root for you I just don't talk about it.  I hope we don't run into each other's early fuck la if we can't beat them I hope we give them everything they can take
The single best article on Jamal-- written by the always wonderful Jackie MacMullen discusses all this at length:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/25823688/how-jamal-murray-was-raised-become-star](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25823688/how-jamal-murray-was-raised-become-star)
He just plays idk obviously we are not privy to all the secrets but Jamal just plays uhm he is the attitude the fire in Denver jokic will always perform we will ride and die with Murray but that's just who Jamal is he's fucking tough we bitch about Gary Harris being injured but both Jamal and jokic have barely ever missed games we r lucky to have them
"The frustration lies in the lack of nuance surrounding Jamal's progression as a player, and because it was obvious to anyone watching the team every night that he was hurt. And just the overall lack of respect for a freshly 24 year old whose (playoffs) highs have been matched by very few his age (and yes, playoff his debut in 2019 was impressive outside G7 against Portland and G1/G2 against the Spurs).   For the season, Jamal is currently sitting at #16 overall in RPM, #10 in win shares and #11 for RAPTOR. More importantly, since returning from an injury at the beginning of Feb 2020 his stats look like this:  **Feb / Mar 20** = 21.9/3.6/5.5 on 50/39/83  **Bubble** = 26.5/4.8/6.6 on 50/45/90  **January 21** = 19.1/3.9/4.9 on .47/35/82  **Feb / Mar 21** = 25.4/4.4/4.8 on 52/45/90  Other he  biggest outlier over the past year is actually the beginning of this season. It's the one time his shooting splits dipped under 50/39/-.   His assists are down this because of role-- Jokic is the focal point around which things spin more than ever before and Jamal is playing a lot of SG alongside Morris / Facu.  But his D is also very much improved, he is finishing at the rim at a sizzling rate and the ammount of 3's he takes is much higher in volume (other than wait for it... January where he looked relectant to shoot).  In other words, it's fine to doubt he can play like Bubble Murray round the clock. Even I do. But it's also straight ignorant to act as if he is the same 22 year old who averaged 18/4/5 on pretty good but not great shooting splits as a 22 year old. At the very least he has demonstrated to be good for 22/4/5 on close to 50/40/90 when healthy... and to be the type of player who thrives in the playoffs."
"It's not about blocked shots. It's about him not being in position to deter shots. Look at any pick n roll play and see how Gasol immediately becomes useless. He can't run back to his man in time so he has to switch, and he can't pretend to stay in front of the ballhandler. 2 on 1 all night.  Last time the Lakers played the Nuggets, Jokic got basically everything he wanted. (I've got the game on record.) Right at the start, Jokic had three uncontested shots (Gasol just stood there and raised a hand). Then on the very first pick n roll involving Murray, Gasol was again left flatfooted while Jamal launched a freebie."
"Unlikely. Considering where he started, his shooting is the best it could possibly be. His finishing has still been sub-par, he can run PnR but unless it’s with Zion it’s not a *great* idea, and in that case the real threat is Zion not Lonzo. Also in 3 years who of Shai, Luka, Fox, Steph, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and possibly Dame will he be better than? If he isn’t better then at least 2 he isn’t making an all-star game chief (assuming they all stay in the West, which is a big if but like, still).  In short, the Pelicans are gonna get 29 calls about Lonzo at the trade deadline because he’s THAT good when paired with the right talent. Could he make an all-star team as an injury replacement or something, yeah. But perennial? C’mon now."
Well according to some important basketball dudes Jamal Murray is a top 5 defender in the league
"Not really though. We get a passing mention but most people would be amazed with the injuries Boston has had.   Remember when Jaylen got benched during the turbulent 2018-19 season?  In November/December he had:  * Back Spasms * Plantar Fasciitis * Shooting Hand Injury (never explained but his hand was wrapped for about a month)  None of that was really talked about as a reason for his struggles. It was all ""Brown is struggling in a new role"" and ""the young Celtics were pushing too hard for responsibilities they weren't ready for"".   Then the media started reporting that he was figuring things out and adapting to his new role towards the end of the season. No, he just got healthy.  Exact same thing Murray is dealing with now. His injuries were ignored while he was struggling then as he got better people started to retrospectively accept them.  &gt;""Denver doesn't have the same excuses as Boston""   Even here, you're sort of proving yourself wrong. We're 36 games into the season... Our starters have played together once. Yes, your team is banged up, but Jamal having issues isn't comparable to what our team has dealt with so far.   We were 8-3 before a 3-week period where:  * Tatum was diagnosed with symptomatic covid * Brown started missing games with tendonitis * Smart went down with a calf strain * Kemba came back slow from a knee procedure * Pritchard went down with an MCL sprain  That's our 5 best perimeter players all severely limited in a 3-week span. Denver doesn't have the same excuses as Boston.  Even then, we got plenty of comments talking about how Boston was disappointing, it's only now we're out of the woods the media is willing to acknowledge most of those injuries were even a factor.   Hell, about 2 weeks ago DWade was on national television saying the reason we were losing was because Tatum and Brown needed to 'learn how to win', nevermind those two have been historic in their ability to win at a young age."
"the nugs, shoutout jamal murray and the tri cities  and if I didn't enjoy murray, I'd enjoy jokic"
"No he’s certainly not better than Chris Paul. I’m saying that like Chris Paul, he isn’t a flashy stat sheet guy, but he contributes to winning so much more than other guys which is ultimately the goal of basketball.  I’d for sure have him over Jamal Murray and DeAaron Fox."
"Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray  MPJ  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Golbert   Bench:  Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Melo, Josef Nurkic  Solid."
You have way too much conviction about something that is far from a certainty. People said the exact same thing about Jamal Murray before he got hot this last month.     Mitchell is 24. He will have more amazing series before all is said and done.
Jamal Murray
"Khris Middleton is a better second option than Jamal Murray, and Ben Simmons isn't the Sixers second option, Tobi Harris is, and Middleton is better than him"
Dejounte Murray is really not very good. There were actually posts by Spurs fans saying he’s better than Jamal Murray.
"The Nuggets would never give up PJ.  They don’t need to make a trade. If Jamal can develop into that third star behind Jokic and PJ they can be real contenders.  I personally think Murray is already right there, but he still has to win some people over. The Nuggets are fine."
"Jamal Murray - Kitchener, Ont, Canada"
Is team A Murray Jamal or dejounte?

"Jamal has been unreal in the clutch during the past month or so. Not surprised to see him here. Jokic has been a little worse than usual (as he is usually at the top of the league in this regards) but I think there have been more than a couple of instances where he tired from the load he has been carrying (second in league in mins played).  Hopefully now that Murray is healthy, Jokic will start excelling again."
Most local to me is either Jamal Murray or SGA... regardless they're both really good
"**TEAM CANADA**  After the success of the Toronto Raptors franchise, Canada finally earns a second team again, and unites a cast of all-Canadian players to fill it with their Maple Leaf pride.  Quickly, the team proves to be more than a gimmick. In fact, they fit together well. Lead guards Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander prove to be a good tandem, given Murray's ability to shoot and score and SGA's ability to slash and his size to guard bigger guards. The two both average 20 PPG on the year, nearing All-Star status.  The rest of the team is a mixed bag. Andrew Wiggins has big moments here and there, but Lu Dort appears outmatched for most power forwards given his limited size. Chris Boucher holds his own down low and nears the league -lead for blocks, but has some issues staying out of foul trouble over the course of starters minutes.  Overall, the team flies around .500 all season long, and fights for a playoff spot. Unfortunately, the league stuck them in the Western Conference to split them from Toronto, causing them to barely miss out with a 40-42 total record."
"I don’t trust stats when it comes to defense, I rely on the eye test. Stats also had Jamal Murray as like one of the best defender in the league and was rated 5th best defender in the league purely off of that but if you actually watch Jamal Murray defend, he’s nothing special. He’s an average to decent defender, nowhere near what his defensive stats portray. If you actually watch Draymond, you’ll see how smart the man really is and his timing is absolutely perfect. A lot of his help D, forces a pass compared to an easy layup which doesn’t show up on the stat sheet. I understand using stats for offense but defense, I rely much more on the eye test"
the 18 rockets would absolutely wax the 09 cavs as would most of that list. The 09 cavs are the Jamal Murray of this list
"Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Middleton, Pascal, Jute Holiday, Sabonis, Wall, and Tobias Harris are some other guys you didn’t mention that there could be an argument for, albeit some more than others."
Jamal Murray or Ayton?
"What?  The lack of understanding about the point I was making is astounding, haha.  You seemed to miss my point -- I'm not saying it's bad, just that expectations for the Nuggets should be a top 8-10 net rating for their best trio.  2/3 of this lineup is a top 2 MVP candidate and Jamal, who is having a *fantastic* year and an absurdly good month last month.  This rating is very impressive, but the Nuggets are to the point where they should be expected to have a trio with a top 10 net rating.  Look at all the #3 options in this table -- Seth Curry, Donte Divencenzo, Gary Trent, Royce o' Neal, etc.  The duos are what carries this ranking.  Don't act like this ranking is because MPJ has been amazing, it's because Jokic and Murray have been amazing and MPJ has been real solid.  My point isn't that it's worse than it should be or a bad net rating.  My point is that, for a team that was in the ""final 4"" last year and has had a top 3 seed in the west several years in a row, at a certain point it should just be expected that their top 3 is in the top 8 for net rating.  Just like it's not surprising the Clippers or Bucks or Philly has a high rating.  They have really good duos along with a good 3rd player and were expected to be really good this year.  That's my point.  Not that it's bad, but that it's not something to brag about because top 8 is pretty much what we should be expecting based on recent history and performance.  You act like MPJ is the primary reason for this rating when really it's Jokic and Murray and it's awesome that MPJ has been good enough to keep it so high."
"Jamal Murray for me. He’s a supremely talented scorer and a fringe all-star, but his performance in the Bubble had people debating that he was better than Mitchell, Tatum, Simmons, and Brown."
"Jamal Murray for DPOY, we all know he is the true heir to the crown"
Kawhi half broken robot is not putting clamps on quick super athletic guys anymore. E.g. getting BUSTED by Jamal Murray so bad they had to switch george back on him
Jamal Murray apparently
Jamal Murray too based on what he did in the bubble and what he’s doing recently
"Yeah drop coverage effectiveness goes way down in the playoffs when you go up against elite guards more consistently who can make pull up threes at a great rate.   For example, D-LEBRON had Rudy gobert as the best defender in the league by a good bit last regular season. His D-LEBRON ranking in the playoffs was in the 50s lol. Jamal Murray torched drop coverage"
"His passing numbers are fine. He made more passes per game than Ja Morant, marcus smart, donovan mitchell, terry rozier, Jamal Murray lmao. He had as many potential assists as Murray, Lonzo, Dragic... He's not some crazy ball hog."
I think that will be different this year with Kawhi and Jamal Murray missing significant time.
"Suns went through no ad and a still injured Lebron, no Jamal Murray and then no kawhi   We went through the Heat who almost swept us the year before, KD and Irving and the just KD and then Trae who dropped 50 and was close to doing it again game 3.   Conference doesn’t matter when we are talking about injuries. Y’all faced two teams that would have for sure beat you guys while we faced one.  As I said both teams got lucky but it’s laughable to say we both had a similar difficulty getting to the finals.  Anytime I see someone talking about the championship it’s “but they were one millimeter away from being eliminated “ so not sure what you’re talking about."
I give Luka   Pg: Luka  Sg: Jamal Murray   Sf: Joe Ingles   Pf: pascal siakam   C: myles turner   Sixth mans : carmelo/ derrick rose.  Base off your criteria and realistic cap space. These players would fit his skill set.
"Possibly. I'm not sure how likely teams are to even run into that problem as 3 players on supermaxes grown from the same team is pretty damn rare, and OKC wouldn't have maxed Harden anyway. Teams with 3 max players already exist too. MPJr's max brought him, Jokic, and Jamal Murray as homegrown max players already."
Jamal Murray still recovering for m ACL.
Injured Jamal Murray* not Mitchell since they didn’t play against the Jazz.
"&gt; While the nuggets had Jamal and MPJ miss 30+.  MPJ played at full strength in the playoffs despite having a history of injury.  &gt; You can spout whatever biased nonsense you want but I’m backed by data you aren’t.   How's this for data.  The nuggets were better without the often injured Murray despite career highs this year.  I think you over rate how good he is based on how he played in the bubble, where many players played above their normal level.  We beat you easily in 4 games.  It was never in doubt who was the better team in that series.    &gt;And it’s even worse that you said teams who made deep runs were more prepared that’s a brain dead take in all honestly.  I never said that, reread and work on your reading comprehension.  Better luck next year."
"Why were they allowing him to play hurt in the regular season? Sounds like a really poor decision that ended up apparently preventing them from winning the championship or at least making the finals, according to you.    &gt; Again this isn’t the suns who had all off-season to heal and train while all the other contenders were getting beaten up and asked to return after like a month off.  First off, this is just objectively wrong.  Go look up how much time between Jamal's lady game and the start of the regular season.  Second, players have been dealing with consistently playing longer in the playoffs for quite a long time and dealing with it just fine.  I would be more willing to entertain this logic except for the fact that they got a large break in the middle of the season so they weren't going into the playoffs with as much wear and tear as normal and I'm just not buying the an in his prime Jamal Murray couldn't handle only having 3 months off between the playoffs and the start of the new season.    The Sun's were just an objectively better team with or without Murray on the nuggets."
Didn't the nuggets have a better record without Jamal murray?
"1. he doesn't fit with the bulls. lonzo need the ball in his hands, just like simmons though he cannot create for himself in a half court setting. but he doesn't need to because lavine will take 20 shots, derozan and vuc both are scorers. adding kyrie makes no sense. and who is to say derozan isn't the 4 this year anyway, did u forget about patrick williams at the 3?  2. this isn't 2K dude. murray for kyrie is a terrible trade. just because you think talent and fit wise it would work, you need to take into considerstion context and situation. no way the nuggets risk trading jamal murray, homegrown guy who has great chemistry with the team, for a headcase like kyrie  3. Kyrie would not want to play with LeBron ""father figure"" James ever again. And they just traded for Westbrook. As if they trade for Kyrie  4. Sixers want to trade Ben Simmons. The organisation (Morey) is not trading him for Kyrie. Needs to maximise Embiid's window, trading for Ky who can't even play in philly is not doing that pal  5. You can't even spell Joe Ingles' name. But this is the funniest one by far. No team says yes to this one🤣 not even the Nets."
"You got 4-0 swept dominated murked murdered, inserting in jamal murray doesn't stop our players from taking turns on MPJ and Jokic's porous defense. Nuggets just aren't as good as they think they are"
Wait... You think +1 Jamal Murray turns a 4-0 sweep into a 4-3 series win?  Pass that good shit please. Suns got better. Not worse. Jamal Murray doesn't change anything.
I’ll give a couple reasons. I live in az but I’m not a suns fan. 1. They played all injured teams to get to the finals (lakers had ad and Lebron but not fully healthy) (nuggets with no Jamal Murray) (Clippers no kawhi) 2. If klay comes back and is healthy I’d say the only team who beats them is the lakers if they get right
"Funny how you were 2-0 down while CP3 was injured.  Or that we still managed to take a game from the Lakers when CP3 was fucked and if he didn't play game 2 at all rather than just standing there killing us we probably take game 2 as well.  And the same Nuggets we had a better record during the regular season and then swept with ease, and Jamal Murray is going to swing that entire series?   We also got better during the offseason on top of it."
"Jamal Murray*  And I get players were hurt in the regular season too, but the Suns still had the best record against teams over .500 in the NBA last year.  I guess fundamentally, what is keeping the Suns from getting there?"
"&gt;Is he at least waxxed?!?!   Jamal Murray isn't, I can tell you that much."
"Is Jamal Murray disqualified due to injury? Because if not, he’s definitely in the conversation."
"I agree. I am simply wondering if they ""discussed it"" and the fact the 10th team remained anonymous makes sense with the nuggets because they would be discussing a potential trade for an injured player.  And even though Murray was critical to Jokic in the playoffs MPJ took a huge leap and has real potential to be a straight up better 2nd option than Murray on the Nuggets IMO. Idk if Jamal brings enough to them returning even at 80% in the playoffs especially with his defense.  All hypothetical. I'm sure there are better theories on who the mystery team was"
"There was a report of a Denver FO source about a potential Ben/Murray trade saying ""Not sure if that’s more insulting to Jamal or us to be honest.”"
"Because the sixers aren't going to get anyone in Jamal Murray realm and it's very likely Jamal returns by playoffs where I think he has a bigger impact on their offense (obviously) than Simmons even if he comes back at 50%.  On the other hand, you're right. It's a high risk trade for Philly, 100%. But it's the only chance they have of replacing Simmons with another player of similar caliber this season, even if the chance isn't 100%  You make good points. I don't think they will pull the trigger on the trade (the nuggets won't) but I wonder if they were the 10th team ""discussing it."" makes sense they would remain anonymous when trading an injured player is fairly taboo"
"Yeah he reminds me of Jamal Murray in that way. (Albeit better) One game you watch and think "",Jesus this guy looks like he's a GOAT"" and the next time you see him you're reminded why he isn't in that top 10 Convo"
"It’s hard to copy Denver. They’ve been one of the best drafting teams in the league. Getting Jokic in the second round is obvious, but they’ve also hit on a ton of mid to late first round picks.   ### All their first round picks were great in 2016  -	Jamal Murray (#7 Pick) -	Juan Hernangomez (#15) -	Malik Beasley (#19)  ### They got a solid player in 2017, despite not having a first round pick.  -	Monte Morris (#51)  ### Michael Porter Jr was obviously a steal in 2018  -	Michael Porter Jr (#14)  ### No Pick in 2019  ### Both their picks in 2020 seem to have potential   -	Zeke Nnaji (#22) -	RJ Hampton (#24)  ### Bones Hyland has played super well in pre-season  -	Bones Hyland (#26)"
Pathological confidence and competitiveness is a prerequisite for elite play. I remember watching Jamal Murray give a SLAM interview and he was asked about a fellow Canadian WNBA player. He gave her props but caveated his compliment that he could beat her in 1:1 though!
"&gt; Which opposing stars do you think Rudy Gobert is slowing down?  I'm going to reverse this question and spin it back to you.   With the injuries to Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard taking the Nuggets and Clippers out of play, who exactly do you think is taking advantage of Gobert in the Western Conference with a 5-out offense that is as proficient as either the Nuggets or Clippers offenses were?   Please list me the teams in the West that you think can play Gobert off the floor, I'm all ears."
"The Nuggets have Portland level of playoff defensive failure. Seriously, go look at some of the numbers guys average against the Nuggets. it's not sustainable for 4 rounds and the only reason it's not pointed out is because people like them so much. lol, people were trashing the nets defense and they are on a different level of talent. There is a reason the Nuggets are always in long series.   Which is why somehow people think jamal murray changes that Suns series when the Suns absolutely abused the Nuggets defense."
"A bunch. Played against KAT a few times back in the day, him and his family were great. He played alongside Wade Baldwin, who actually got ejected when we played him and we thought was pretty overrated but we ended up reconnecting a few years later and laughed about the whole thing.  Worked at a hotel that hosted the NBA Rookie Symposium in 2016. Served Ben Simmons, he very much kept to himself and didn’t socialize like everyone else. Buddy Hield gave me a free speaker, shirt, bags, etc. because “man we got money we don’t need this” was super appreciative. Jamal Murray was my guy too, super nice. Did not like Taurean Prince because he was offended I didn’t know who he was and was kind of a dick (to be fair, I knew most of them, but like dude you’re Taurean Prince).  Went to college with Kevin Huerter, wasn’t super close but he used to hookup with my friend and we talked a few times, he’s pretty quiet and reserved but a good guy. Bruno Fernando was hilarious, we loved him."
"He is too 10 &amp; def a all-time great.  Arguably the Melo trade didn't allow us to truly build a great contender around him - arguably.  Sure we gave up the pick that became Jamal Murray, Gallo &amp; some 1st Rd picks but the fact we were 2nd in the east, kicked the Heatles ass in the regular season &amp; only got stopped by Hibbert to reach the ECF, imo that knick team is underrated &amp; with that;  Carmelo Anthony has become underrated. We had a old ass squad featuring J.Kidd, Felton, JR, hobbled Amar'e with off the bench guys who carved a role like Steve Novak, Chris Copeland. Throw in Tyson Chandler, that knicks team was old &amp; injured but Melo deadass carried us through.  Shame we couldn't piece together another run with Melo but man he was indeed top 10."
"Jamal Murray, but for the first 4 seasons of his careers his critics were looking pretty right about him."
OP how tf were you high on Giannis? Nobody knew who he was and he had no film lol.  I was very right about Jamal Murray and Booker. I was very wrong about Ben McLemore and Jabari Parker (partly due to injury).
"Oh yeah man, I forgot Ja. He seems really cool and chill with a good head on his shoulders. I'll add Ja and Jamal Murray, I love his swagger."
"Wiggins, Jamal murray too"
"Canada is going to compete for gold in the 20's. We're coming. Every year we're putting out better and better young players and building up the infrastructure in domestic competition and youth leagues. SGA, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Shaedon Sharpe, they're just the tip of the iceberg."

Jamal Murray drew his pubes first
The only actual memory of DJ Wilson I have was him getting absolutely murdered by Jamal Murray.
"Couldn’t stick with a quick point guard to save their lives tho. Trae Young, Curry, Dame, even Jamal Murray are giving that backcourt 40 a night for an entire series"
*Insert the Jamal Murray reaction meme here*
"Cade's ""floor"" is a nice on and off-ball player who reads the floor well and can score at all levels and has a pretty good understanding of defense. His ceiling might be Paul George who passes more than scores. He's not as athletic as PG though.  Jalen's ""floor"" is scoring machine with just okay playmaking/defense. I've seen him be compared to BI and to Beal and I kind of see it. I think his ceiling seems like it'd be like Beal but taller lol.  Mobley, ""floor"" is tricky because he's still putting on weight and he's not really playing a lot of reps on center now. He's really dynamic on offense. He can move well but he's not going to do well when bigger guys bully him in the paint. I see his comparison is often Chris Bosh. Evan's a really underrated ball-handler/passer too, Mobley's got a lot of tools in his bag.  Suggs is my favorite one to think about. He's just a playmaker. He makes plays on defense and offense and just flat-out hustles. His ceiling should be about him finding his outside shot. Dude is scrappy. I see a little of Lonzo and a little of Jamal Murray in his game. His ceiling to me might be a mix of them but more defense than Murray but less scoring than him too.  Scottie Barnes, is also very interesting. Scouts were calling him 'magic johnson' and saying he had a magnetic personality. He is more athletic than Green, Suggs, and Cade. He's 6'7 and can pass and defend but his bigger question is offense. He needs a better handle too, but tall big athletic and good at a lot of important things. If Scottie can find a lot of offense to match his defense, he might be better than a few of the guys who went before him. It'll be interesting to watch."
"I don't disagree. But they're really hoping for someone better or more ready right now. They view Ben Simmons as more of a 2nd best player on your team and would like to get someone closer to what Denver has with Jokic and Jamal Murray. I think Haliburton is 2-3 years away from being that guy. And if you think he is that guy, WTH would you trade him for Ben Simmons?"
The last one that made go wow. Was the Jamal Murray- Donovan Mitchell game in the bubble.
"His ast% (impact) is elite while his tov% (impact) is on the bad side of ""okay"" (~16% in OKC, ~18% in WAS - his quote claims teammates need time to gel, so I'm anticipating another 18% year) (Harden ran 15-19% in HOU, Steph tightened up from 16% to 13% in their Finals years, Lowry fluctuated from 13 to 18% in TOR)  His ast:to ratio (efficiency) of 2.4 is firmly on the right side of good for a starting PG. Tyus Jones is usually the best at this sitting at 5-7, and Chris Paul/Ricky Rubio are the [best starters](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/assist-to-turnover-ratio) (both ~4.0 last year). I personally call 3.0 elite, but I'd be happy with Brogdon (2.9), Derrick White (2.8), Lowry (2.7), Jokic (2.6), Simmons (2.5). The other side of that metric are DLo at 2.2, Trae at 2.3, Jamal Murray at 2.1.  His good efficiency in playmaking specifically compliments his unmatched ast% to paint a picture of a dominant playmaker. The value of stats oftentimes change at the edges, which tells me that his healthy 2.4 ast:to is even more impressive with the sheer volume of passes he's making  Those are the stats I like. If you want to get more in the weeds, you can check out the [NBA passing dashboard](nba.com/stats/players/passing/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;sort=AST_TO_PASS_PCT&amp;dir=1). Last year, WB was #2 on ""ast to pass %"" (what % of his passes result in an assist? - measuring the efficiency of any given pass WB makes) and topped the chart in ""ast to pass % adjusted"" (giving more value to assisted 3's). Westbrook also **received** the most passes, which gives some credence to the idea that he's in a system where the ball always comes back to him - you could consider this an additional knock on his raw numbers and even his ast%, but it gives him more opportunity to bolster his tov% and his ""ast to pass%"" isn't affected by this"
"Dude, they got waxed. They got murked. They got buried. They got dominated. They got swept.  One jamal murray isn't stopping MPJ from getting cooked 40 possessions every game, nor is it stopping Ayton from 5 putbacks over Jokic, nor is it stopping CP3 from averaging 27 and 10 for the series."
"I think lebron, ad, kawhi, jamal murray, and others were bigger reasons why they made the finals over ayton"
"Dodging is dodging. Don’t see ur point.  Suns probably would’ve beat Denver regardless. Jamal Murray isn’t turning a blowout sweep of a loss into a win. Probably would’ve beat Utah based off of what happened with them and off of matchups. Lakers and clippers are up in the air, I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt but Phoenix still would’ve been the 3rd best team out west regardless of injuries"
"Yes he is. There are 30 starting point guards. If there are 15 starting point guards better than you then you are below average. 15th best is average. I can easily name 15 better than DLO. (Not in order) 1. Curry 2. Luka 3. Dame 4. Kyrie/harden 5. Westbrook 6. Fox 7. SGA 8. CP3 9. Ja 10. Trae 11. Jrue 12. Brogdon 13. Lowry 14. Jamal Murray 15. Conley. There are others that I’d debate as well: Simmons (I get the hate but still a great facilitator and defender), Lamelo (he’s still young but I can def see him being better), Lonzo (good defender and solid shooter/facilitator, I think his defense brings him over DLO), dinwiddie (arguable maybe leaning towards DLO tho), dejounte Murray (DLO is better on offense but his defense is miles ahead of DLO, could outweigh the offense), vanvleet (I think DLO better but vanvleet is up there), Kemba, and Rozier. That’s 15 better and like 8 debatably better. He’s def below average"
Murray going after Hield was stupid then and it’s even more atrocious now. Buddy is like 5 years older than Jamal.
"The Nuggets have had far more makes than misses in the draft since Connelly replaced Masai in 2013. All of these players are either on the Nuggets roster or still in the NBA:  2014 Gary Harris (I know he was technically traded for, but that's because that's how draft day trades work in the NBA, Denver drafted him as far as I'm concerned) Jusuf Nurkic (same situation as Harris) Nikola Jokic  2016 Jamal Murray (the very last pick acquired from the Knicks in the Carmelo Anthony trade from 2011) Malik Beasley  Juancho Hernangomez (movie star Juancho)  2017 Vladko Cançar Monte Morris  2018 Michael Porter, Jr.  2019 Bol Bol  2020 Zeke Nnaji  2021  Bones Hyland  7 of these guys are on their active roster still. The ones that were traded returned guys like Aaron Gordon and Mason Plumlee, who have been big contributers currently and formerly in Denver).  Not to mention after draft signings in recent years like Facu Campazzo, PJ Dozier and Torrey Craig.    Denver has one of the best run front offices in the NBA."
"Leaving off the dynasty spurs legends   Conley  Jamal Murray   DeMar  Dirk  Dragan bender   HM: Bird, DeMar, Pau Gasol"
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10. Embiid 11. Luka  12. Harden 13. Kyrie  14. Tatum  15. Beal 16. Paul George  17. Trae young 18. Jaylen brown  19. Jamal murray 20. Devin booker 21. Chris paul 22. Kris Middleton  23. Jrue holiday  24. Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
we want to see stuff like what jamal murray 'accidentally' posted on his IG story in march 2020
jamal murray in march 2020
"You gave the Raptors a 10/10 cause of a Klay injury even though we were outplaying them even with Klay and a KD injury in which he should have never played a single minute of that series. But you then forget the Suns played a Lakers with an injured Anthony Davis, Nuggets with an out Jamal Murray and the Clippers with an out Kawhi Leonard. If you care so much about Klay and KD being injured, be consistent when it comes to the Suns who were at best the 4th best team in the West. Either injuries matter, or they don't."
"Please tell me one top 75 player on that Lakers team besides AD and Lebron. That team was a huge net negative when he was off the floor even when AD was on his monster tear. Not to mention Lebron went through Dame who was the hottest player in the NBA at that time averaging over 35 ppg before the playoffs started. Then played against the Rockets who were the best three point shooting team leading up to the playoffs. Then played against Jokic and Jamal Murray who was shooting over 60 percent from three in the final two minutes during the playoffs. Then faced off against the Miami Heat that beat a two time Finals MVP and the Celtics with 3 all stars. Even excluding the Bubble he was the runner up for Finals MVP, and outscored and outplayed Kawhi and Giannis is back to back games. Lebron was an absolute menace during that season. If you want to ding him for having bubble AD that’s acceptable, but no one else on that team was a top 75 player and the reason it worked was because of him and the coaching staff"
"My reasoning is what it is, players in this era have performed better than players in previous eras in terms of box score due to defensive rules, pacing, and 3's. How many 25 ppg scorers were there in Melo's era, and compare that to Kawhi's era. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell dropping 50 in playoffs, when some all time greats never hit 50 in Melo's era. I just think apples to apples comparisons without considering context of eras can't be done. Melo was also on bad teams (partly his fault), way worse than Kawhi has ever been on, so playoff time, people can fully focus Melo, which they can't for Kawhi. Again, I realize controversial, but that's what the thread said lol"
"I'm not saying you said it, I literally said other people bring it up in response.  Giannis didn't have any structural damage, so that's why people 'discount' it given the context that it was not comparable to the injuries to AD, Jamal Murray, Kyrie, Harden, Kawhi"
"By individually dynamic he means 1-on-1 scoring ability (jamal murray, kyrie) but he definitely does all the things that make a team better (great facilitation, solid on-ball defender, great off-ball defender and a solid off-ball shooter"
"Monte Morris. He's a solid PG who's flown under the radar behind Jamal Murray and is already probably one of the best backup PGs in the league.  With Jamal Murray out, he should get a chance to start and get more minutes surrounded by much better talent. General high IQ player who has one of the best assist to turnover ratios in the league should really benefit and be able to take advantage of the attention that Jokic, MPJ, Barton, and even Gordon will draw. Last season he shot 38% from 3 and 48% overall, with a TS% of 57.4% and eFG% of 54.7%, numbers I think he can sustain or even improve upon with more minutes next to Jokic on higher volume as he have more opportunities to exploit defenses while he flies under the radar.  He should also see a bump in assists due to the sheer amount of scoring talent around him. On top of all that he just turned 26 so he there is potentially still another level to his game."
Ja over Jamal Murray???
?? Jamal Murray and Chubby Co... oh
"Sources told me that while cleaning out his kitchen drawers, next to the guacamole maker he has scarcely used, Simmons found an old mixtape from Embiid that Embiid made for Ben after he was drafted first overall to the Sixers. The mix was an ode to Philly - Rocky theme song, Meek Mill, even some Hall and Oates, and of course capped off by Boyz II Men’s I’ll make love to you. Well, it appears as if this is the end of the road, as Simmons tossed the mix in the trash, confidently dunking it in since he’s been working on his game all summer.   And talks stalled as Daryl Morey requested Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, six first round picks, a statue of John Elway, and six pounds of indica from the Denver Nuggets."
"I don't even think it's an argument, I think it's clear. Here are the PGs who have carried a team through playoff runs and won them series: Curry, Harden or Kyrie (whichever is a PG), Luka, CP3, Lillard, Trae, Lowry, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday.  After that, there's a huge drop off in talent. This is the top 10."
"Come on bro. in the 2 games AD played in the first they showed their true colours, they beat the Nuggets without Jamal Murray and the Clippers without Kawhi. They got real lucky."
"Jamal Murray is out, Jazz just had the best record in the league and were two wins away from going to the WCF  If only Conley and Mitchell could have stayed healthy, still think that play by PG at the end of G2 was dirty"
"it's the Jamal Murray injury, really tough for them to compete all season long without their 2nd best player."
Kyrie isn’t a PG and Jamal Murray should be in top 10
"The Nuggets were down their entire backcourt (all 4 guards; starters and bench) and the 7th guard to start the season was the lead guard (Facu) in the playoffs; with 2x 2 way players and Rivers off his couch.  Stop pretending the only player Denver was missing was Jamal.  Murray, Barton, Morris, Dosier (out or forced to return early); AG playing through an injury and MPJ playing through an injury all impacted the DEN-PHX series."
"I would say it was the fact that they were missing an All-Star caliber player in Jamal Murray, among other players, forced to give players like Campazzo heavy minutes."
"If he's the 4th offensive option while playing his usual amazing defense then he'll be exactly what they paid him to be. He's not a big scorer, never will be. But the Nuggets with a healthy Jamal Murray will have 3 *elite* offensive stars so nobody else on the team will have to shoulder a heavy scoring burden."
"idk, I'd put SGA, Wiggins, and jamal murray above him. Then you have Dort and RJ Barrett. Imo, he's fighting for 6th at best, with dudes like Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, and (if he makes a jump) NAW."
"Giannis’ performance against the Suns (playing through injury, mind) was as good as anything KD has ever done at any point in his career. But LeBron had a boo-boo and Jamal Murray is definitely the type of guy to turn a sweep into a series win so it’s probably best to pretend it didn’t happen."
"Yeah, Jamal Murray + picks for Lillard is one of the few other deals that make sense, I guess. But they'd need to include Murray, right?"
"You only played LSU twice and only won once, I tried looking it up on Youtube and Simmons really dominated the end [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dKMiX28B8Q&amp;t=4972s) [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dKMiX28B8Q&amp;t=5016s) [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dKMiX28B8Q&amp;t=5057s). The other game which you must be referring to only has highlights but it doesn't look particularly close, LSU lost by 17, I doubt Simmons trying harder would've made the difference.   Not saying that Simmons tried hard at LSU because I really don't think he did, but this narrative that they would've been a great team if he tried harder is overblown. That team was nothing special. That Kentucky team was not that strong relative to other recent Kentucky teams, but they still had five guys who played in the NBA, including Jamal Murray. Kentucky was preseason #2 in the country that year while LSU was #21."
"It's a little revisionist to include the Nuggets in this. Yes, they were missing a key player, but it was also a sweep that featured only one close game. Not saying the Nuggets couldn't have won, but it's just too generous to say the Suns wouldn't have won if Jamal Murray was healthy. Too much to say that Jamal Murray single handedly turns an easy sweep into confidently winning the series."
Jamal Murray did it for Denver against the Celtics a few years back (he took a 3 pointer) and then had a face like 'why y'all buggin' out?' when everyone got pissy with him.
"&gt; made Jokic look silly in the Denver series  The lack of Jamal Murray and Will Barton helped a ton, but Ayton did play very well defensively."
"With everything we know today, I would for sure take Jaylen Brown over Simmons, Siakam and Jamal Murray are also 2 players I would think about taking over Simmons in that scenario."
"At absolute best, he is the 9th best PG in the league.   Curry, Luka, Trae, Lillard, Kyrie, CP3, Jamal Murray, and Kyle Lowry have all carried teams on playoff runs and series wins, which Simmons is not capable of doing.    For that reason, I don't think it's possible to rank Simmons above any of them.   Next, these other PGs can be argued as being better than Simmons as of today, but aren't clearly better: SGA, Westbrook, Fox, Morant, Mike Conley, FVV, Rozier, Rose.   Personally, I would only take SGA and Fox over Simmons from that list. So for me, Simmons is the 11th best PG in the league. If your PG is the 11th best PG in the league and you have him for 4 more years on a max.... your team is totally fucked.    Where would you rank him among PGs?"
Philly was the 1 seed last year with their best player missing a significant amount of time. Portlands second player missed time and they barely missed the playins as a 6 seed. Even without simmons they'll still be good.  Embiid has just signed an extension while there is a ton of smoke around dame forcing his way out  And Portland 3 years ago went toe to toe with Portland. They were basically dead even. Now they're losing to the same team missing Jamal Murray in 6 games even with dame playing far better  Anyway the path to Philly in the finals is way more plausible than any scenario where the blazers make the finals
"I’d like to contest this claim actually; not just because of the Siakam thing either.  Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and Pascal Siakam have all enjoyed far more team success than the Sixers, all three of these teams have made conf finals. Ben Simmons has never led the Sixers to beat a team that was even good, stuck in the second round, and consistently is at the core of their issues. Sure, he made the all-star game a few times and is a defensive juggernaut, but all three of these other guys have displayed just as much all around talent I’d argue, and they’ve all been able to bring it when it mattered the most.   Ingram is ehh to me tho"
"It's not that Ayton does or doesn't deserve it.  It's that some team is going to offer him the max anyways in restricted free agency next year, you can't afford to lose him and you're going to match it anyways. I would have just given him the inevitable max he was always going to get right now.  The funny thing is honestly, Ayton outperformed his draft expectations in my eyes. He came in as a guy with all the tools, question being his defense and he answered a lot of that with his improvement on both ends. What did the Suns expect to happen, for him to transform into Anthony Davis and become a no brainer max player?  This dilemma was always coming from day one regarding this, draft a big man who isn't dominant defensively or some absolute offensive outlier like Jokic/KAT and you will be left thinking to yourself ""well does he really justify a max?"" Would have expected an insta-max even if it was controversial like with Jamal Murray and the Nuggets. I'm surprised that the Suns are backing down from their convictions at this point but then again.. Sarver.."
"Where did I say you pair them with a ball dominant player?   I said having better playmaking beside them, and him being a better shot creator would be better.   Think of it like this. If the Nuggets had their choice of MPJ or KD (ignoring contracts) they would take KD. If they could choose between MPJ or Lebron they would choose Lebron. If they could choose between MPJ and Harden, they would pick Harden.   I’m not saying put Lamelo beside them, stop making strawman arguments.   I’m saying MPJ is a great fit, but he isn’t a perfect fit beside Jokic (mainly for defensive reasons).   Since then you are now trying to completely derail the conversation.  If you designed a player in a lab to play beside Jokic and Jamal Murray, why would you make them MPJ over KD? Acting like MPJ is a perfect fit is completely ignoring defence and ignoring that great fits aren’t always perfect."
Feel like that belongs to Jamal Murray until further notice
"&gt;Not sure how that translates to wins.  Since Jamal Murray went out with his ACL tear, MPJ averaged nearly 25ppg  and the Nuggets were 13-5."
"&gt;NBA GM Survey - Which team has the most promising young core?  &gt;Atlanta Hawks - 50% &gt;Houston Rockets - 10% &gt;Boston Celtics - 7% &gt;Memphis Grizzlies - 7% &gt;New Orleans Pelicans - 7% &gt;Phoenix Suns - 7%  The Nuggets have an MVP, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon and their average age is 26.5. They probably only didn’t make the Finals last year because Jamal Murray was out."
MIP incoming (even though he averaged like 24 ppg after jamal murray got hurt so he already pretty much made the leap forward)
Someone has to explain Zach Lowe's man crush for Jamal Murray to me
"I will say Jamal Murray, because Murray plays very similar to Steph and that’s basically the mold Poole is emulating: great 3 level scorer, above average passer/playmaker, a lot of offball movement &amp; shooting off screens mixed in with iso, not great at drawing FTs."
A much better jamal murray
healthy jamal murray wouldve definitely made a difference also the suns missed the playoffs for 10 straight years before aging chris paul came to them
"This doesnt mean anything. The suns had a better record, better net rating, went further in the playoffs last season than any nuggets team ever. And they fucking swept then easily. Jamal Murray is not prime MJ. Suns in 6 at worst with healhty Murray. There is no argument for denver suns is better in every way."
jamal murray was hurt and the suns got take to 6 by the clippers without kawhi who the nuggets beat in 2020 with kawhi fully healthy nuggets beat suns
"Same, I was actually thinking why would they move Jamal Murray to the 2 when MPJ fits so much better if they really wanted to"
Notorious iron man and picture of durability Jamal Murray
I kinda think Jamal Murray is going to come back stronger than expected and they’ll have enough time to get their flow back before the playoffs.  Full strength Denver would be my favorite in the West.
At least in recent memory when Jamal Murray went down was pretty heartbreaking
Kings make playoffs   Celtics 2nd seed   Nuggets lose in round 1 even with Jamal Murray at 85%
"&gt;Jokic wasn't even top 20 in usage this year. Your boy Embiid tho was 2nd even ahead of Steph Curry who was busy with one of the most monumental carry jobs in history  A few notes here. First, that usage factors in defense as well, which puts Embiid higher. He carries the Sixers defense.  Second, the usage stat by BBREF is pretty wonky. If we look, Ben Simmons, the Sixers 2nd most important player, is 92nd in usage. Kristaps Porzingas is higher than players like Jrue and Simmons. The stat says Kyrie had a higher usage than Jokic and Kawhi and Harden which is just wonky as hell. BBRef advanced stats in general aren't reliable. DBPM and WS are 2 famous examples. Ben Taylor had a whole podcast episode on this which is why he created his own usage stats that unfortunately I don't have access to.  I was more talking about usage from my eye test, so I can expect disagreement.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;This is true but that fit never brought out the best in each other as much as Jokic and Murray does.   For what it's worth, the CP3 and Harden Rockets nearly beat the KD/Steph Warriors. Not sure there's as much merit there.   [2021 Jokic and Jamal Murray Net Rating](http://www.pbpstats.com/lineup-subunits/nba?LineupId=1627750-1629008-200794-203914-203999&amp;TeamId=1610612743&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;SubUnitSize=2)  [2020 Jokic and Murray Net Rating](http://www.pbpstats.com/lineup-subunits/nba?LineupId=1627750-200794-203914-203924-203999&amp;TeamId=1610612743&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;SubUnitSize=2)   [CP3 and Harden Net Rating](http://www.pbpstats.com/lineup-subunits/nba?LineupId=101108-200782-201935-203991-2772&amp;TeamId=1610612745&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;SubUnitSize=2)   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;97% of his 3s are assisted.  Like 93% of Embiid's career 3's are assisted, and that's with Simmons as his PG in the half court. Not a big difference to me, and it doesn't make up the defensive gap."
I assume they'll have Jamal Murray back by the yoffs
"They could be if they got an actual all star level PG for Simmons, like a Jamal Murray or maybe even a CJ type, but that window has almost certainly closed.   The worst player you could have as the #2 next to Embiid and still win it all is a pretty interesting question. He needs a real good playmaker with perimeter gravity imo."
"Don't get me wrong I love the guy, he hustles and defends and keeps his intensity for the whole game [great cardio] , but he's definitely undersized.   It's possible that he could've earned his way to the starting PG role and pushed Murray to the 2, which to me would be better than having Barton with the starters, but it was pretty clear that after the Gordon trade, the starting 5 was Murray-Barton-Gordon-MPJ-Joker.   I was kinda talking him down a bit to prove a point - that Joker is working with new pieces so you gotta cut him some slack on the defensive effort, because we've seen him do much better, especially when Gary played with him in PnR. [maybe a lot of it is familiarity?]  You're definitely right on this point too ""after jamal went down we wouldn’t be where we are now without facu,"""
"People will never concede this because it ruins the ""choke"" narrative a bit, but you're right.    Jokic/MPJ/Jamal Murray are better than Kawhi/PG/???, especially since the Nuggets had a plethora of competent wing defenders and the Clippers had no one to defend Jokic."
"I’ll believe it when I see it, best believe I’m rooting for y’all though. I wish Jamal Murray didn’t get hurt though, that way the Lakers would have a serious 1-2 punch coming in the first 2 rounds"
Don't appeal to emotion with the Jamal Murray injury - this has nothing to do with that.  Ducked the Lakers and got the same result. Going out in the first round. Down 2-0 in 5 hours. All that whining about the refs. Are the refs beating you this year too?
"I still don't know why the Knicks dealt with us. They could've just signed him a few months later. But, we got Jamal Murray out of the trade"
"Let's not also forget, he handled that Melo situation when he was in Denver as well as possible. He got some decent players and the draft pick that led to Jamal Murray."
"With the teams 2nd best player missing all post season (Caron Butler, Jamal Murray) and playing the Blazers in round 1........ ohh no  Wait then playing the defending champion Lakers round 2...."
Well he was deceptively elite to being a huge reason the jazz gave up a 3-1 lead last season.    He might be good while switching onto regular perimeter players but I repeat gobert can not do what ayton did to Jamal. And those multiple 50 pieces prove it. As much as everyone likes to talk about “Bubble Murray” he only went supersaiyan against one team and the scheme and Gobert were a huge reason why.
"That’s actually my bad, I even looked at their playoff record before posting that but definitely meant to say conference finals. I wish they had Jamal Murray this year but I’m not gonna take em seriously this year is what I’m tryin to say"
"I'm with ya man, you can't be that bad at defending the PnR and consistently go deep in the playoffs barring some miracles. Jokic/MPJ might be the worst defensive starting 4/5 in the league. And sure, you can upgrade at the 3 and the 2 (with AG and Dozier/Barton) but it's not like Jamal Murray is any good at defense either. That's 2 really bad defenders, 1 bad-to-okay defender and then 2 good-to-great defenders that basically all guard the same ""wing"" type of player. Denver will continue to get smashed by PnR's until the end of time."
"I’m not saying he’s a top 5 player all the time (but at his best he definitely is top 5), but he literally dominated the entire western conference playoffs as well as the finals. Ayton has 1 playoff game. I don’t think they’re comparable. I also think Jamal Murray was playing like a top 5 player last playoffs, but I don’t say he’s actually a top 5 player."
Jamal Murray was literally on the court during the game yesterday. I agree that they need to get control of players roaming.   That flop is crazy. Dudes need to get technical fouls when they flop and try to deceive refs. That shit is disrespecting the game.
"AD switches on to guards all the time, he started guarding Jamal Murray when he was going off in the Nuggets series and locked him up multiple times. Of course he’s not gonna be able to guard Curry or Harden or something, but no one can"
Dillon Brooks is this years version of Jamal Murray last year
"This is realistic. Nuggets I fear with Jamal Murray are toast in the end. Clippers looking vulnerable, esp if KP turns it on even a bit more, Jazz are red hot but honestly I can’t doubt LeBron out no matter what"
sideline too.  Jamal Murray was all up on the court like a coach in street clothes.
Jamal Murray walked to half court talking shit while wearing a yellow hat last night. It's getting out of hand and I do mean the yellow hat. Just too far bro
"I had ptsd flashbacks to Jamal Murray last year watching Brooks go off on us on the 3rd. Tough loss, but hopefully Mitchell will be back and Gobert will get it going on Wednesday. The Grizzlies are SCARY!"
Dillon brooks pulling his best Jamal Murray impression against the jazz
He had a great bubble but so did Jamal Murray ( Obviously ADs was better ) but we wouldn't call Jamal a superstar. For AD to be a true superstar he needs to do that CONSISTENTLY! Not just in one post-season.   I clearly said he has all the attributes of a Superstar but he simply isn't delivering on a consistent basis. Luka is WAY more consistent then AD for example and on a fairly mediocre team also. Let's see AD torch the Clippers by himself on that Mavs team.
"Dillon ""Jamal Murray"" Brooks"
He is the worst rim protector among centres in the league. Jamal Murray was talking about how the Nuggets desperately needed a rim protector a few months ago before the Gordon trade.
Jamal Murray was pacing up to half court during the POR/DEN game and was even on the court itself at times. Are they cracking down now?
"Eh you got a point I suppose. But if I just say he’s Jamal Murray without the post season success people will get offended by that too. He’s just not on the tier of the top young guys, just because the suns finally won over 30 games doesn’t mean it was because he turned a new leaf. He’s the same scorer he’s always been, and that’s fine."
[na “jamal murray playoffs” actually gives results](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gTQta9s45LM)
Same place as Jamal Murray
Tyler Herro and Jamal Murray disagree.
"Jamal ""The Players Union"" Murray."
NBA does not care what Jamal murray thinks lol
"OK, but Denver, for example, did hit in the draft on Melo, and that got them 7.5 years of Melo which then got them 6.5 pretty decent years of Wilson Chandler, 5.5 pretty good years of Danilo Gallinari, 2 1st round picks for Timofey Mozgov, the Jamal Murray pick, and the assets and flexibility to trade for Andre Iguodala. And they still have that mindset."
"I totally get why he gets booed in Denver and it was justified for a while, but it’s been 10 years now. It’s time to move on. The Nuggets won the trade and are still reaping the benefits of it with Jamal Murray. He’s a top 5 player in the teams history and was the face of the franchise during the 2000s. It didnt end well at all, but you’d think time would’ve healed those wounds by now and we can all just appreciate the guy still playing at a high level at his age and continuing to climb the scoring ranks.   It’s the playoffs and the opposing team will get booed but the singling out of Melo still 10 years later is just a bit much."
"they won 57 games the season after he left, their best regular season in franchise history.  And they got the draft pick that would turn into Jamal Murray"
"- Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Timofey Mozgov  - 2014 1st round pick (ultimately traded for Igoudala)  - 2016 pick swap (Jamal Murray)  That is a great haul even with Igoudala trade getting bombed."
"it’s been ten years, and all the good players on the team were entering free agency after the season.  At least melo got them something in return, something which became Jamal Murray"
"I wouldn't say that, the best they got out of that trade as a long term piece was Jamal Murray. Felton re-signed with the Knicks, Gallo, Chandler and Mozgov left as well."
"Yes, while I think he is not the best coach, us losing this series cannot be blamed on him. He should experiment more though, he should adjust defense a bit and play Jokic more minutes (feeling the momentum in the game is Malone's biggest weakness), I would even go crazy tall-ball with Javale on center, but in reality even Popovic cannot make adjustments to make up for Murray, Barton and PJ Dozier. We look damn good after all start break when we were complete. We were beating Clippers with ease, total control of the game from the start to end. With Jamal out champiship hopes died. With Barton and PJ, we cannot really expect some good playoff run. We may get a game or two on some Joker/MPJ heroics with combo of Portland being cold, but that is it."
"Teams tighten up defensive schemes in the playoffs, that's precisely what the talking heads mean when they say ""playoff basketball"".  The lack of shooting depth of their backcourt is going to get exposed with Jamal Murray out. Damn shame too, Nuggs are a really fun team to watch."
"yeah, I just responded to someone we are missing people at the same position where their best player Dame is. It is as if Blazers are missing Nurkic and Covington and Kanter and they have to contain Joker with RHJ, Harry Giles and Melo, while our defense can focus completely on Dame and CJ.  They would have rough time as well. Casual fans only probably know about Murray (huge loss, but we could still play evenly with Portland if only Jamal was missing)."
"Well, yeah. We lost Murray and Barton and our long guard from the bench PJ Dozier (who would be super useful against your team).  That is a lot of fire power. It is like you losing Nurkic, Covington and Kanter, and having Harry Giles, RHJ and Melo be front court against Jokic. That is where we are now against Dame. See without all that shooting power and length your team can play very relaxing defense and save themselves for offense.  Our championship hopes went away with Jamal, and our good playoff run hopes went away with Barton (even if he comes back in a game or two, he will be rusty) and PJ.  I hope we are healthier next year."
He did them a favor long term because he could have walked a few months later in free agency. Then the nuggets wouldn’t have Jamal Murray.
Jamal Murray is not better than Carmelo Anthony
Jamal Murray came from that trade.
Idk anything about ACLs but Jamal Murray already walking??
"You know what sucks about Jamal Murray getting injured? It gives nuggets front office an excuse to not fire Michael Malone.  Sure, we have a built in excuse to not make a deep playoff run, but we should still win a series."
"I wouldn’t love melo if I were a nuggets fan, but it could’ve been worse imho. Lamarcus “I want to be the greatest blazers of all time” Aldridge played coy with his intentions, resulting in him simply leaving the blazers in free agency. At least Nuggets fans got something back for Melo. And Jamal Murray is awesome."
TIL Jamal Murray is a brown uncle
didn't the pick turn out to be Jamal Murray?
"You’re right but also way to confident/conceited for playing a team that’s missing Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and PJ Dozier who would add defense to the second unit. It’s pretty lame talking shit against a wounded animal and y’all still might lose. Blazers franchise is at a sad point tbh. Dame will never have a ring and he deserves one because he’s amazing, but clowns like you make the team unlikable."
"Denver booing Melo is really the dumbest shit ever.... He could have totally Fucked over DEN by staying and leaving in the the offseason and the leaving... or by making it known that he'd only resign with the Knicks. Instead he gave DEN an out by hinting that he'd be willing to go to the Nets, letting Masai do the rest, and ultimately getting them both a Playoff capable team in the W with Gallo (until he got hurt) and landing Jamal Murray (Via the NYK Pick swap).   If Melo doesn't do that, DEN literally gets nothing."
They also got the pick that would become Jamal Murray in that trade
"There are a lot of centers who have a neutral to positive impact defensively in the regular season who are suddenly big negatives when playing a series against a shooting pg (like Dame, Kyrie, Jamal Murray, etc.)."
"You Joke but remember Jamal Murray was a top 5 DPOY candidate for a week or 2 /s. But seriously, Not having P.J. Dozier is a real kick in the ass for Denver. He has no stop of stopping Dame but dame probably would have had 4 points fewer and 1 assists fewer with P.J. playing and that could have made all the difference. But given Portland's injury history, it's about time they catch a break for once"
"It's the defense too. With his season on the line Kawhi didn't defend or get stops against Jamal Murray or Jokic last year. They barely got by Luka last year too even on that game winner Reggie Jackson was the defender on Luka.   Kawhi is in the same class as guys like Curry he only plays offense and saves his energy on defense for offense even in the biggest moments. With his season on the line Curry wouldn't guard Ja Morant even though he's the best matchup for Morant on the Warriors, and Morant sent him home.  If Lebron was in these situations with his season on the line he would have been guarding the opposing teams best player and found a way to make a defensive play or at least try to make a defensive play."
"What? He didnt have Jamal Murray, thats all im pointing out. Fans are so annoying after their team won a single playoff game smh"
Yes noted defender Jamal Murray would have kept Portland from going 19/40 from 3.
~~Taking away his playmaking~~ *Jamal Murray being out* was the biggest reason the Blazers won this game.
I mean he’s putting up the same numbers against Jamal Murray so at the end of the day who really cares
We find out if the Nuggets magic is for the team at that point or if its a Jamal Murray blessing
Itll probably be softened because of injured Jamal Murray
Yep. They've effectively taken away his elite playmaking and are forcing him to be a scorer. As long as Dame matches that then we'll be okay. Jamal Murray being out is a huge loss for Denver since they have so few players who can actually create their own shot.
Ok I may not be too fashionable but I do think Jamal Murray looks a bit redneck tonight. Not in a bad way tho he’s rockin it
JAMAL MURRAY THE NUGGETS ROBERT SACRE TONIGHT YALL
God I wish Jamal was healthy. Playoff Murray vs dame would’ve been unreal
I swear the camera has shown Jamal Murray more than the actual game
They've shown Jamal Murray damn near more than their MVP so far
Where can I get that Jamal Murray Tokyo shirt?
"Where can I buy that shirt Jamal Murray has on, ""Tokyo NBPA"""
[Video of Jamal Murray](https://twitter.com/TonyClementsTC/status/1396310374983606275?s=20)
Jamal Murray dressed like a dad at little league
Jamal Murray with the meme of the summer right there
Jamal Murray with meme potential
This is the most bizarre game of the playoffs.   *Cue trucker hat Jamal Murray for 30s*
Jamal Murray looks like a dad and a teenager at the same time
Aaaand Jamal Murray just became a meme.
Jamal Murray just became a meme
But you got Jamal Murray because of the trade.  So I'd say a win haha.
Why does Jamal Murray look like a truck driver?
Nuggets got Jamal Murray because of the Melo trade and they boo him?
It looked like to me the boos were for Zach Collins flipping off Jamal Murray.
Is anybody else seeing Jamal Murray repeatedly walk full ass on the court during play?
Lol that's Jamal Murray raising his clown stock  Are players allowed to just roam up to half court talking shit?
Jamal Murray is wearing an ugly hat
That's Jamal Murray I think lol
jamal murray
I’m enjoying sideline Jamal Murray ngl
Wtf is Jamal Murray doing?  Almost walked over to the blazers bench lol.
YALL SEE JAMAL MURRAY. ULTIMATE TEAMMATE
Jamal Murray already walking around without crutches or anything? Good to see.
"He is the main guy on that team and PG/Bev/Jackson are the guys guarding the main offensive threat not him. So he rests on defense and still plays poorly on offense like the rest of his team. He had nothing for Luka, Jamal Murray, or Jokic last year."
I have no dog in this fight and like both teams equally   However with that said..... I see Blazers taking this one without Jamal Murray playing
jamal murray 😭😭😭😭
"I see Denver warming up, and I'm so fucking sad because Jamal Murray would at least make us a lot more competitive in that series and in these playoffs. I still have hope that we win the Blazers series in 7.. I just wish Murray was back.. :("
Wow Jamal Murray clutch af
Portland because Jamal Murray is out and they got depth
"My own hot take is that we're about to see the Ewing Effect with Jamal Murray, with the Nuggets beating fools left and right, raising the question if using his max slot on somebody else \ two championship-level role players is not a smarter idea."
"Jokic is MVP but I'm not sure I agree with the rest. Jamal Murray played 48 games, it's not like he missed the whole year."
How are we not talking about randle in the MVP convo? Top 4 seed with the second best player being derrick rose. But we're talking about Jokic who has MPJ and had Jamal Murray... Come on now.
Is this your way of asking for the Jamal Murray video?
That is not really a hot take with no Jamal Murray playing.
"If everything is the same then no they are not at that level, Wiseman was a huge disappointment for them. He may be great in the future but the Warriors need to win NOW and he doesn't help with that. That said... I probably put them about where the Jamal Murray-less Nuggets are now contention wise. Puncher's chance."
Jamal Murray was there was he not
"Jamal Murray is the goat, I've seen enough"
The guy that can't guard the PnR to save his life and made jamal murray look like my player in myCareer averaging 50ppg?   Draymmond and kawhi a million times better defenders than gobert and its not close
"I mean I know it was the bubble, but last years Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray duel was insane. Both had 2 50 point games and tons of clutch buckets and game 7 came down to the final shot"
"People didn't factor in just how much better Nuggets got with the addition of Aaron Gordon.  Whatever they lost from Jamal Murray/Will Barton is made back from Aaron Gordon, and Austin Rivers miraculously turning into Steph Curry in Q4's."
"Lebron (twice), Dame a few nights ago, Jamal Murray last year, Dirk, Nash, Chuck, Bernard King, Elvin Hayes, Wilt and now Kawhi  [Source](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=nba+playoffs+most+45+point+games+on+70%25+shooting)"
"Honestly I’m not fully convinced that Denver wasn’t actually better without Murray. I’ve watched a decent amount of Denver basketball, and you can make a decent case that the offense flows better without Jamal."
"Pat Bev was there for the 1st year with MDA, Ariza for year 1 and 2, PJ for years 2-4, and Capela for years 1-3.5. I don't think that is the difference defensively between Rockets and Blazers. Don't get me wrong, PJ is an amazing defender and Capella was good but he wasn't as impactful with Rockets as he has been with the Hawks defensively. Ariza was amazing and definitely huge for the year as the #6 defense but the last 2 years the Rockets were better than the Blazers even without him.  I think the biggest issue is having 2 average at best defensively starting guards. Dame is below average and CJ is better but not amazing. In the West especially I feel like a lot of the major scoring threats are Guards. Curry, Harden, Jamal Murray, Luka, Ja Morant, CP3, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Klay Thompson when healthy. I think that's a huge reason Blazers played the Nuggets so close, especially with Jamal out. It's bad when Austin Rivers is exploiting your defense in the playoffs."
Legend Jamal Murray.....and Wilt and Lebron
"Murray, Jamal."
That's DPOY Candidate Jamal Murray for you
Any time your name is being mentioned next to Jamal Murray you know you’re doing something right
Jamal murray? Lol
Headmaster Jamal Murray
NBA legend Jamal Murray and a couple scrubs
Pubic legend Jamal Murray
"&gt; Also, if Jamal Murray wasn’t injured, the Nuggets would win it all this year.  Agreed"
"Hyped about this game. Hyped about Nets-Bucks. Also, if Jamal Murray wasn’t injured, the Nuggets would win it all this year."
- Anthony Davis - Julius Randle - Devine Booker - KAT - Rajon Rondo - Nerlens Noel - Tyler Herro - Bam Adebayo - Jamal Murray - Tyrese Maxey
"I get it. People get mad at guys like me for not seeing all the regular season games from every team. I'm a Warriors fan. I watch the Warriors games and the playoffs. The best players are the ones that show up big in the playoffs. Like Booker just did. Players like Bradley Beal are nice. Giving you 30 PPG but he's going home. The top players in the NBA play their best against the best. Booker has just taken that leap. Just like Jamal Murray did in the bubble. Or even Jimmy Butler. Before last year, Jimmy Butler was just another Paul George type player. Great but not when it matters."
"JR was the best player because the Nuggets received Gallinari, Felton, Chandler, and a pick who would eventually become Jamal Murray. A year or two later, the Nuggets won 57 games in the West with that core.   What you must remember is that back then Gallinari and Chandler had quite a bit of value as up and coming players."
If nuggets had jamal murray then this is going to 6 or 7 but I got suns in 5 or 6 at the most cause Phoenix isn't struggling with injuries and they just play better as a team
"Lakers already went all in, they got nothing to trade. I don’t think Lebron interested in chasing rings anymore. They just need AD to get healthy and try it again.   I believe this will be slow offseason, Kawhi will sign his Super Max with Clippers. Most clubs cannot give him a max contract over Salary cap threshold.  Portland can only trade Dame to Knicks for draft picks and start rebuilding for next decade. Knicks has a legit chance to sign Kawhi only if they get Lillard but less likely Kawhi would be ready to move out of LA.  Dame to Denver make more sense but Denver has to move on from Jamal Murray + picks, Murray is only 24 not sure Denver would mortgage the future for 31 year old Damian   Most teams made number of trades in past couple of seasons left them with no trade assets including picks in next 5 years"
"All I'm saying is that people should give Jokic's teammates a little more respect. He for sure makes a lot of space and elevates his team. He's a big guy who seems like he can do literally everything. However...  In the regular seasons Aaron Gordon, Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, and Paul Millsap have been putting up similar numbers on different teams for years. MPJ was one of the top prospects in 2017 and a first round pick. Jamal Murray is already good. Will Barton's numbers shot up as soon as he joined the Nuggets, before Jokic even joined them.  It's harder to tell with Monte Morris, Facundo and Markus Howard because they've only ever played with Jokic but I assume he just makes them better when he's on the floor with them, so you could be right about them."
"If they were, they weren't playing like it. Suns had a better record and net rating before Jamal Murray went down."
"Idk man, nothing will beat the ""Jamal Murray GF Jordan"" he had last year imo."
Lol thinking Jamal could lead his own team. C'mon bro. Bubble Murray isn't real
"He would probably be coming back as a backup/situational defender/locker room guy.  But it depends on what he wants. I think he’s still got love for the guys here for sure, but he may still want to carve out a path for himself as a starter where he was before the injuries. But I could potentially see him thinking “I’ve already gotten paid, I’m gonna go back to the culture and locker room I love and be a role player in a winning situation.” Maybe he does, maybe he doesn’t.  I love him to death, but after his injuries I think he caps out as a role player now. But if he proves me wrong I’ll be cheering for him all the same.  Re: Monte, I think he’s going to continue to be our 6th man who leads our bench unit/flexes into the steering unit/sometimes closes out games for us. Next year he probably starts while Jamal is out ofc, but long term I think that’s still the plan for him. He does offer some interesting options alongside Murray by taking Murray off ball and letting him do more that way, but we also saw our defense get entirely unlocked with Murray and Barton after the Gordon trade. We just had so much length and athleticism and switched basically everything. If there’s one knock on Monte, it’s his size. So there is a real opportunity cost to moving him to the starting lineup. But it’s absolutely something he can do and even once we are back to fill strength I would be 0% surprised if he’s closing out games for us over Barton (or whoever our long defensive 2 guard of the future is) in some scenarios.  There was also a pipe dream that the nuggets would trade for lonzo at the deadline/sign him in RFA this offseason with the idea that he can do about 80% of what Monte does as a floor general and 80% of what PJ Dozier does as a defender in one package. I don’t think it’s realistic that we go for him, but it would be an interesting fit for sure."
personally think the nba should think about shortening the season. we can never as fans watch a playoffs with all players healthy. we've missed out on 2 years of klay now. ad &amp; bron not healthy. no jamal murray. the list goes on. shit sucks for fans. i wanna see fit dudes going at each other on the court
"Murray doesn't need to develop more for the Nuggets to be a super team. That's on whether or not MPJ develops. And that's still true if we trade Murray for Dame.      Murray and Jokic have already proven they're an elite duo. I don't doubt Dame and Jokic would be an elite duo. But the Nuggets don't have a super team unless MPJ continues to develop.      The Nuggets best players are 24, 26, and 22, and the Nuggets are title contenders with a healthy Jamal. There's no over estimating how long that core's championship window stays open."
"A number of reasons.  First off, culture and leadership in the locker room are a thing. Which is not to say dame is lacking in those areas - he’s a fantastic leader. But trading away Jamal to get a guy that we just beat in the playoffs (regardless of his heroics) is a bad look for your locker room. Jamal is one of the heartbeats of this team. Wouldn’t happen.  Scheme wise, Jokic can make anyone work. So I’m not saying dame is a bad fit. Dame would be a great fit because of his spacing. But Jokic and Murray have an insane connection as well, and Murray is still ascending. There’s no compelling basketball reason to trade him either.  So if there’s no compelling basketball reason to trade him AND it’s a bad move for the culture/locker room chemistry that we have built AND we would have to attach assets like future picks…why the hell would we do it?  This isn’t 2K where you just trade for whatever stars you want. And we aren’t a big market coastal team where you just go grocery shopping for whatever all-nba players you want every offseason. We are a small market team that relies on our strong culture building, player scouting/drafting, and player development. Our whole motto during this ascent was “we don’t skip steps.” Skipping steps is like the wolves trying to jumpstart their success by trading for Jimmy butler (or I guess the sixers too, but they recovered well enough afterwards). Even if we fall short this year, making a blockbuster trade for dame abs giving up on Jamal before we even got to see this core-4 play together for more than 10 games would be a massive failure and the definition of skipping steps.  Before Murray got hurt we looked like legitimate finals contenders. Having Gordon along with our big 3 unlocked so much. Now, missing Murray and Barton changes so much of what we do, including Gordon’s offensive role. The spacing and pressure those guys provided opens up so much in terms of cutting and rim pressure from Gordon and mpj. We owe it to ourselves to see if that core can get it done like we think it can. No way we blow it up because Jamal tore his ACL."
jamal murray is a joke to you?
&gt;I personally think a Jamal Murray+Picks to swap the two PG’s is the simplest and most logical for both sides.  What is logical about that for the Nuggets?
Jamal Murray
"Bro this series alone he flipped off Jamal Murray, gave Denver fans the pussy hand gesture, and yelled viciously at every Nuggets player that came near the bench (see this video and the MPJ dagger for proof). Dude's not even special when he isn't hurt and wearing dumb ass clothes on the bench. Fuck outta here Collins.  Also as a Jewish person fuck Meyers Leonard too. Poor Dame for having to be teammates with these chumps"
"everybody's injured we don't make excuses for them like we do for lebron and his bruised cervix  ayton's missed games recently with a knee injury, chris paul hurt his shoulder in game 1 of the series, luka has a pinched nerve in his neck, donovan mitchell has an injured ankle, jamal murray tore his acl, embiid has a torn meniscus and the celtics lost their second best player to a broken wrist."
Jamal Murray for Damian Lillard trade. Let’s just get it out of the way
"Jazz mainly because they have more weapons than the other three. They will get tired more slowly.  Would probably be the Nuggets if Jamal Murray plays.  Then again, Booker and Luka can explode at any given game."
Denver is doing all right without Jamal Murray. I mean hes probably thier second best player but so is AD on the Lakers.
Exactly and the heat and Celtics are both out of the playoffs and the nuggets lost Jamal Murray to an acl tear so the short offseason clearly affected those teams
Jamal Murray should still be out.
"I feel like if/when the Suns beat the Nuggets people will say ""they got lucky, Jamal Murray is out"" just like after this series with AD."
"Whilst missing Jamal Murray, Dozier and Barton. Smh"
"I'm excited for this series and in an attempt to be unbiased as possible, I don't see the Nuggets being able to do it without Jamal Murray."
"No not really. If the Nuggets lose in the playoffs, you don't think the absence of Jamal Murray will have played a role?"
"There needs to be a conversation about resting after this season is over. I think teams should go as far as not allowing their superstars to go play in the olympics. Shouldn't have let players go to the all star break. Its no surprise that the two teams that played the longest are so dramatically worse this year. Tons of superstars are hurt and nether the Lakers or the Miami heat look ANYTHING like they did last year. As much as people whine about resting their players, lets see the same energy when they are \*\*supposed to rest\*\*. The turnaround was way too quick and there will be more injuries of superstars by the end of the playoffs. The Miami heat looked horrible and tired and jimmy butler wasa shell. The Lakers looked tired and absent. Seeing Lebron gassed like that was straight depressing. If we want great basketball we gotta give players a break. Jamal Murray getting hurt was the difference between them being legit contenders later in the playoffs and just a strong team. The same with the Celtics man, I went to school in Boston and I love the Celtics and seeing those 3 extra fully rested superstars just beat down on them without J.B.... I couldn't watch it.Chris Paul is playing hurt hopefully he'll feel much better with the days offJaylen Brown is outJamal Murray is outAnthony Davis is outAlso shoutout to my man Cailluo Caruso Ernie Jr getting hurt they missed him out thereJoel Emid is outTLDR screw the NBA for restarting so soon. 4 major teams just got rocked with injuries that left them with no chance"
"hey now, we dont know about jamal murray yet we couldnt see him in these playoffs"
"Woah slow down before you say anything else controversial about Austin ""Jamal Murray"" Rivers /s"
"you mean Austin ""Jamal Murray"" Rivers?"

"The league's young talent is fucking incredible. Luka has more 38+ point playoff games than games with fewer than 38, Donovan Mitchell has multiple 50 point playoff games, Jayson Tatum has had a 50 point playoff game, Jamal Murray has had a 50 point playoff game and now Booker is gonna drop 50 in a series clincher too."
"At first I didn’t think Gordon would help them, but proved me wrong. This is without Jamal Murray let’s remember that. the"
Jamal Murray is not very good imo
When is Jamal Murray back?
Case and point... nuggets just took down the blazers in 6 without Jamal Murray
"Apparently I hate karma haha. But no, not just bait. Denver hasn't skipped steps and in my mind, we'd have to ship Jamal for Dame. If I was Tim Connelly, I wouldn't do it. Would be a huge gamble imo. The Jokic/Murray connection is real."
You have no idea how happy I am to not have to face Jamal Murray.
"The Nuggets didn’t have Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and PJ Dozier and the Blazers still lost. That’s their 3 best guards."
"Only thing ""bubble like"" on the Nuggets was Jamal Murray playing like the second coming of MJ"
Jamal Murray Nuggets in 6
"But fr their GM is a legend. Jamal Murray was a solid pick but not a wild one, the MPJ (and Bol Bol) picks were both home run swings and one is already paying off! And to get both Jokic (the MVP) and Monte Morris in the 2nd round is insane - like what are all the other GMs doing?"
"And to think all you have to do is draft the greatest second round pick of all time, get jamal Murray with the 9th pick, and have a transcendent talent drop to you at 14. Why don't more teams just follow this simple trick smh"
It's insane cuz they don't even have Jamal Murray. Man I'm hella sad he can't play
Jamal Murray
and they beat them in 2019 with Jamal Murray
"I don't want Dame to leave the Blazers but my god they're letting him down by not capitalizing on series performances like this. Fire Stotts, trade CJ for a big (if they add picks, Jimmy Butler would be a perfect fit with Dame, idk if the Heat would go for that though), get some actual defenders at the guard position instead of Dame being backed up by even worse defenders.   Congrats to the Nuggets, scary to think what this team would be capable above with Jamal Murray healthy. Hope they can keep going regardless!"
"if the nuggets get jamal does everyone else become injury free? would still take healthy lakers over them. and i definitely want to see them in the second round against a team that isn’t so defensively inept like the blazers  but in this playing field, if you add murray yeah, they’re probably my favorites. jazz/suns/ and the winner of clips/mavs are all good though"
"I don't want Dame to leave the Blazers but my god they're letting him down by not capitalizing on series performances like this.

No... wtf are you guys talking about? Blazers play no defense and it still took them 6 games. Jamal Murray had an amazing bubble run but it’s still just the nuggets
And that 7th pick? Jamal Murray
The Blazers lost to a team with Facu and Austin Rivers as a back court. Didn’t even have Jamal Murray.
Denver would've wiped the floor with this Portland team if Jamal Murray was available lmao. How the hell does the best on-paper Blazers team in years go out like this?
"Did you just ignore the ""healthy Jamal Murray"" part or what?"
They sure that’s monte and not jamal murray ?
This team with first half Porter and 2nd half Jamal Murray is gonna be insane lol
"Shout out to the Blazer fans legitimately arguing with me that Zach Collins being out negates Jamal Murray being out. If anything, it negates 40% Dozier"
I miss playoff Jamal Murray :(
A new knee for Jamal Murray and for us to tie MPJ down this summer.
Can you imagine Jokic and Doncic on the same team as Jamal Murray and MPJ??
Then will he disappear like Jamal Murray though?
imagine if the 2021 Nuggets had Jamal Murray.
The Nuggets would win it all and begin a 10 year dynasty this season if Jamal Murray wasn’t out.
these guys missing jamal murray lmao
"Again, it’s a damn shame Jamal Murray is out. Denver got robbed!!"
"Bro THIS team is missing Jamal Murray, unbelievable"
Geez..if Jamal Murray was healthy and the way MPJ is playing---Nuggets would be the easy favorites in the West.
Honest question cause I haven’t watched much Nuggets ball until this series. Has Porter become better than Jamal Murray?
"Hot take: Sign and Trade CP3 and 2 1sts for Jamal Murray. Nuggets are in absolute win now mode, Suns have more time. CP3 improves the Nuggets and the Suns have their PG of the future.   CP3/Barton/AG/MPJ/Jokic is beastly  Murray/Booker/Bridges/Crowder/Ayton is beastly"
"Crazy take: Sign and Trade CP3 and 2 1sts for Jamal Murray. Nuggets are in absolute contention mode right now while the Suns have more time. Each team improves, imo"
Is Jamal Murray a PG? I thought we was a 2 guard.  Also as a bucks fan shouldn’t this season be an eye opener going from replacing Bledsoe with Jrue? Best 3 draft picks spent ever
Jamal Murray myb
Sure but Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray we're dropping 50/game in the bubble...I think most people look at much of what happened in the bubble as a really weird set of circumstances with no fans. It just wasn't the same as a normal playoffs.
Jamal Murray shoots 80% on stepback three point attempts.
"Michael Porter Jr. Stepping into the #2 role with Jamal Murray going down, averaging damn near a double double"
Never forget that the Suns were an uncalled Jamal Murray travel from being the 1 seed... looking like it might work out in our favor in round 2 though if we make it out of the first round (planning on it)
"They literally made the 8th seed with a 8 man roster in the last 20 games of the season. Any other season and they're  playoff . locks. They dealt with  important injuries  throughout the season. Also you realize they have one of the worst offenses  in NBA history without Curry on the floor? Now replace Curry with Kawhi who can't  playmake. They'd  be the worst offense in the league easily 😂Like i said, Curry would never lose in the first round with a squad Kawhi has this year. Imagine if Curry choked a 3-1 lead in the 2nd round to Jamal Murray 😂 Its crazy how protected Kawhi is he barely gets criticism for his chokejobs. Always been on good teams his whole career. Don't  bother replying, i'll be back in 2 days to laugh in your face when the Clippers get eliminated in the 1st round😂"
Lmfaooooo Curry would never lose in the first round with a team like that. or choke a 3-1 lead to Jamal Murray😂
no mention of Booker and Jokic only as an honorable mention (on the same level as guys like Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown???)
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
Playoff Nuggets just aren’t the same without Jamal Murray. Excited to see what you all look like next year in playoffs with MVP Jokic and playoff Murray.
the team would look so much better if jamal murray wasn't hurt  no one should've expected this team to make it past the suns or lakers (had IF they won) in the second round to begin with due to his injury
"No Jamal Murray, no chance."
They’re playing without Jamal Murray….it’s amazing they’ve made it this far
jamal murray becomes prime jordan against the suns in the regular season
I’ve heard Jamal Murray is quite competent
I think if Aaron gordon and micheal porter jr could hit their shots with a jamal murray to help with leadership and scoring would make this a legit 7 game series toss up.
It would be closer. Jamal Murray is literally Jesus against the Suns
"Yeah, they should try to trade for someone like Jamal Murray"
Have Jamal Murray...that way he could add some offense to cover the lack of defense...
Wishing a speedy recovery to Jamal Murray. Denver and Team Canada miss you 🇨🇦
"the Jamal Murray injury robbed us of what would have been a classic matchup, but I'll happily root for Chris Paul to make the Finals"
I don't see how Jamal Murray would improve this Denver defense
To imagine what this would've been with Jamal Murray
Hot take from me: Jamal Murray has been nuggets best player for 2 years now
Awh this gave me goosebumps. I want a best friend like Jamal Murray lol
With Jamal Murray healthy the Suns would be better at every position.
This is exactly why the Jamal Murray takes were idiotic.
This would’ve been such an epic series with Jamal Murray
"The nuggets are first just because jokic and Jamal Murray are such chill dudes. Still haven't forgotten how salty nuggets fans were last year though, was tempted to put bucks first just for that.  Imo  Nets (😘) -&gt; nuggets -&gt; bucks -&gt; 76ers -&gt; jazz -&gt; hawks -&gt; clippers -&gt; suns"
Nuggets need a W in this series.  Even without Jamal Murray.
"Quick Run down:  NBA essentially set into motion the initial NA lockdown of covid-19 after Gobert (Jazz Center) tested positive. The season was delayed until late July where the NBA setup a Bubble in Orlando, Florida with 22-23(?) teams. Essentially all the teams within playoff contention. They played 8 games in the bubble and then the play-in games commenced for the 8/9 seeds. In this case it was Portland/Memphis, as they were within 4 games of each other, with Portland winning and claiming the 8 seed. The only 2 noteworthy points during the pre-playoff bubble was the Suns 8-0 perfect run as they missed the play-in games by a single game, and Damian Lillard going absolutely nuclear. The Bubble playoffs were interesting as all playoffs go.   Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray went toe-to-toe in the first round, with the Nugs edging out the Jazz in 7.  The Chris Paul led OKC Thunder took Houston with Westbrook and Harden to 7, and nearly took it. Harden had a game saving block on Lu Dort to move on to the 2nd round.  Aside from that the first round was fairly boring.  In the second round the 5th seeded Heat surprised everyone and knocked out the Giannis led bucks in 5.   Boston and Toronto went to 7, with Boston taking it in the end.  The Clippers blew a 3-1 lead over the Nuggets.  Conference Finals ended up being fairly easy for both winners, as the Lakers won in 5 over Denver, and the Heat won in 6 over Boston.  In the Finals, the Lakers took it in 6 over the Heat.  That’s the rundown for last season’s end/playoffs. You could probably piece this season together through the almanac and other articles. Hope I could help, and welcome back!"
"“The west was the weakest it’s been in a long time”  We just gonna ignore how great the Jazz, Nuggets and Clippers were prior to the Bubble? Let alone the insane play of Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker and Jamal Murray IN the Bubble?"
"Out of the guards he often gets lumped together with (Mitchell, Booker, Zach Levine, and Jamal Murray) he probably plays the best defense along with Murray as well."
or jamal murray
"well, I like them more than any other western team with a reasonable shot.  I’m actually a Mavs fan, but I like Donovan more than the Nuggets, Suns, and Flippers. Maybe would’ve favored the Nuggets if Jamal Murray was healthy but only cause they went to the WCF last year."
Did Jamal Murray not have 3.3 per game last year's playoffs?
"I think you're absolutely wrong to assume that it's as simple as ""more scoring."" Because there is no way the average viewer likes to see three free throws in a row.  When average fans want to see more scoring, they want to see Steph Curry and Klay Thompson hit a million 3s. They want to see Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray duking it out in the playoffs with record numbers of 50 point games.  The average NBA viewer does not want to watch Marcus Morris fall on his ass on purpose and then take three free throws in a row.  It's horrible television."
Can't imagine how much better this nuggets series would be if Jamal Murray wasn't hurt.
Did Jamal Murray have some magic surgery that only you heard about?
Only chance of that is if Jamal Murray spent some time in the hyperbolic time chamber and is back and better than ever
"I could have sworn he did it last year during that incredible duel with Jamal Murray, but it seems that he kept just missing it. He went for 57, 30, 20, 51, 30, 44, and 22 during that series. So he averaged 36.3ppg for the 7-game series, but each time he scored over 50 he followed up with ""only"" 30 in the next game."
"I certainly don't. Especially not in the playoffs. I could understand someone choosing Khris over Jamal but he's certainly not much better.  Going back to the other argument - last play of a playoff game to win it, who would you rather have the ball.  One thing I'd say is I think if you could have a team where Middleton and Giannis played defence and Jokic and Murray could sub in for them on offence, no one is stopping that team"
"Just like when Jamal Murray of the Nuggets got revenge against the Clippers on behalf of Canada last year, for Kawhi leaving."
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"
"don’t follow nhl, but nuggets never stood a chance past the first round without jamal murray."
"I'll give the Lakers one more year. The fact of the matter is that LeBron is 36 (to be 37) with a whole bunch of miles on his body. It was frustratingly sad watching this sub kill the guy for not running back on defense when he was guarding Ayton because AD was out and facilitating the offense...like damn, the dude was gassed. So dependent on how he looks next year. I do believe them losing in the first round helped him out. More time to rest. So having him and AD back healthy will definitely help. At the end of the day, LeBron and AD did what they needed for the Lakers, bring them back to relevancy. Now people will want to come there.  All the other teams are solid. Suck that Jamal Murray is out...Phoenix will have to make a decision about CP3 tho...he's a great addition for them."
guarding Donovan and Jamal Murray when hot must be most depressing job in the world
"vs Jamal Murray and Jokic. Not vs PG13, kawhi, morris, batum, beverley. Its nowhere near the same thing"
Is Jamal Murray a superstar? Dude shows up in the playoffs.
"If it wasn’t for Harden to the Nets, there would legitimately be 6 contenders right now. 7 if Jamal Murray wasn’t hurt. Everyone but Atlanta   Gotdamn Houston. Why on earth would you make *that* trade"
Yeah. Jamal Murray sucks ass which is why they finished the season better without him
"Starting 5 is Murray/Barton/AG/MPJ/Jokic with Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, and JaMychal Green subbing in and out on a fully healthy roster. Facu averaged 9 minutes a game before Jamal went down and Rivers wasn’t on the team"
Jamal Murray
"He's waaaay more than capable lmao wth is this Jamal Murray slander, his passing/playmaking has grown leaps and bounds."
The Nuggets have already lost lol. They can’t win this series without Jamal Murray.
This is true. But I imagine if Jamal Murray was starting instead of Austin Rivers that would help Denver a lot lol.
Denver drafted   * Jusuf Nurkic * Rudy Gobert * Nikola Jokic * Jamal Murray * Michael Porter Jr.  * Garry Harris  this front office is so fuckin good
Only idiot Boston fans think Tatum is better the Giannis. Jamal Murray is important piece to the Nuggets. The Suns are really good. Please stop posting dumb takes.
"Ayton has been great, but it has been a lot of team defense too. Easier to clog the lane and send doubles when you're leaving Facu and Monte Morris unguarded as opposed to leaving Jamal Murray."
Not to mention the Bucks key players a completely healthy. Nuggets are missing Jamal Murray.
He also lost to the Nuggets without Jamal Murray and Will Barton
How do y’all feel about Jamal Murray? I know he is hurt rn and most of my viewing experience is against the suns who he always destroys but I quite like his game
Idk why you're getting downvoted for saying Jamal Murray is a Suns killer. That dude fucking roasts us.
I think they dont have enough offense right now to compete with phoenix. Jamal Murray is missed heavily
"Jokic: „JAMAL, JAMAL I NEED YOU“  Murray: :/"
"Jamal Murray  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakim  Jaylen brown and Ben Simmons are extremely close imo. Although Ben is an elite defender, Jaylen can create his own shot and defend really good as well. Which is why I give him the edge"
The difference Jamal Murray makes
"&gt;Those OT losses were early in the season when everyone was still adjusting to playing with each other and the Suns went through some growing pains and dropped to .500.  I mean we had a losing record then, no AG, Mpj out and Murray playing through injury.  No doubt suns are great, but with Murray, Barton, Mpj, Gordon, Jokic lineup we are just as good. Not quite as good defensively but better on Offense. The only team that was successful in guarding the Jokic Murray pnr were the Lakers with Davis and LeBron. And ayton is a great defender but even Rudy couldn't do shit vs the 2 man game, you guys are forgetting who Jamal Murray is."
The Nuggets have no chance because they are weak defensively and have no shot at stopping the Suns well-tuned offense. Jamal Murray wouldn't change that.
"Well they need Murray back and why the hell did they get rid of Harris? Gary was their shotmaker and good defender, but instead they went out and got...Austin Rivers?!? Denver is a PG away from taking it all, sorry but I still thing Jamal should slide over to SG, he just shoots way too much and doesnt get anyone else involved, Joker has to do the PG duties."
"Jamal Murray is a certified Suns killer too.   Not saying this one’s over, but it would be nice to see a full strength series against you guys next year"
It would be a much better series with Jamal Murray. Hope Denver gets another try next year with a fully healthy team.
man jamal is a flamethrower against us. i think game 3 is a bounce back from y’all but this is an entirely different series if he’s playing (obviously). can’t wait for the many fully healthy book/ayton/bridges vs jokic/murray/mpj series in the years to come
"This is where missing Jamal Murray really hurts. When a good defense can play disciplined, you need multiple threats to keep them honest."
"Missing Jamal Murray bad, can’t imagine how he feels watching this massacre"
"Jamal Murray is injured, silly."
I witness supporting cast fail time after time with big men. Teams constructed around big men always have a fatal flaw somewhere like 76ers Ben Simmons or the Bucks shooters predictably going ice cold when it matters. Jamal Murray being hurt is a big reason why Jokic is losing and also Will Barton and someone else. A big man is not the core issue but when your team doesn’t show up and you are the star you get all the blame.
Word on the street is that they plan on acquiring sharpshooter Jamal Murray this summer.
"Jamal Murray is hurt, MPJ has a stiff back, Barton just came back from injury, Dozier is probably out for the playoffs, and we're still working out the kinks with Gordon. Next year was always the year and rn we're playing with house money. At least Jokic wont be the MVP that lost in the first round"
Jamal Murray would be an All Star if the west wasn't stacked
"I really miss one (1) Jamal Murray   It's kinda hilarious how the most angry people in the game thread aren't Suns or Nuggets fans  Suns are fantastic to watch, I'm gonna have to catch more of their games in the future"
"This suns team is so fun to watch, 100% deserves to succeed, and I'm pulling for them, but you can't help but wonder how different this series looks with Jamal Murray playing."
The Nuggets have no chance in this series without Jamal Murray.  The difference in watching Chris Paul set the table (racking up 15 assists with **no turnovers** along with 17 points -- responsible for 52 of the Suns' 102 points prior to garbage time in only 30 minutes) for the Suns versus everything through Jokic for the Nuggets is painstakingly glaring.
Breaking News: Jamal Murray has undergone the worlds first successful leg transplant and will return to the Denver Nuggets effective immediately
"Are we ""blow out the Lakers and Nuggets by 30 points"" good? No, probably not. I just resent the continued narrative that the Suns haven't made a tremendous jump. We're playing out of our minds and obliterating teams. I still think we'd take both of these series with both teams healthy. Maybe that's homerism, but again, a lot of these games haven't been close. I don't think Jamal Murray necessarily adds 20+ points to what they've done in these two games. (And yes, I recognize he can score more than 20 points, but that's not how it works. You'd have to subtract the points scored by guys who've been getting his minutes.)"
I thought Kyler Murray was a family member of Jamal Murray lol  Apparently he plays in the NFL
Jokic is good enough to beat bad or mid tier teams without Jamal Murray. The suns are one of the best teams in the league and it feels like it's just too much. I really hope we get a Utah vs. Phoenix conference finals and Jamal Murray is healthy next year.
"Gotta love all the big, sincere fans of the game going: ""Man, I really wish Jamal Murray was healthy. What a series that would be.""  These same people: ""lol ADisney and Lechoker"""
I was really looking forward to watching playoff Jamal Murray again. This series would be so much better with him healthy
Jamal Murray was a massive part of that bubble run...
This series just gonna be fuel for the legendary Jamal Murray come back season
I’m confused. You don’t think teammates have an impact on a team performance? lol   Why do you think organizations pay 40 million for a player like Kawhi vs 20 million for a good role player  I congratulate the Suns. I love Booker and CP3. But sheesh guys it’s not wrong to identify that JAMAL MURRAY is out
they’re missing a guy named jamal murray
The Nuggets could use a scoring guard like Jamal Murray
Gonna need a healthy Jamal Murray for that
Jamal Murray
Denver waiting to go down 3-1 to bring back Jamal Murray. Don’t be fooled.
"Injured Kemba &gt; healthy Jamal Murray, weep about it"
jamal murray playing would add another 40+ points for the nuggets
"Nuggets passive activates, Facundo Campazzo inherits the spirit of Jamal Murray and shoots 50"
this series would’ve been way better if jamal murray was playing
Not having Jamal  Murray is too much to overcome at this point.
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
Imagine this series with a Jamal Murray
Interesting that the Nuggets organization decided that their best replacement for Jamal Murray was Campazzo
"Sure this would be a totally different game with Jamal Murray healthy, but injuries are part of the game. That’s why I’m not bitching about AD being hurt against Phoenix."
You gotta feel bad for jokic. Man I wish jamal Murray didn’t get injured.
"Imagine if he like, um, like imagine if he played with Jamal Murray or something"
Uh.....Idk if you know some guy named Jamal Murray who tore is ACL. He was a star alongside....checks notes....MVP Nikola Jokic
"I think Westbrook would be the most likely to do it? It’s probably easier to get 30 assists with LeBron and AD as teammates rather than Jamal Murray and MPJ. If they sat down and hunted specifically for this achievement, leaving Russ all the rebounds and trying to get him as many assists as possible there would probably be a slight chance. But this probably remains impossible"
"""They were supposed to make the WCF"" is quite vague. I can say that on Reddit itself, among 30 ""power rankers"" predicting what will be the WCF, 0 predictions included OKC.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9ogb2k/201819\_season\_predictions\_from\_the\_rnba\_power/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9ogb2k/201819_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/)  You can always find some singular example for something (the Nurkić example is tricky, because the experts were not predicting Portland to be bad because of the whole season... only on projected lack of Nurkić, but the 3rd seeded Portland was not really bad without Nurkić, going 7-2 without him in the reg season and also beating Denver in the next round too - does it mean Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray etc. are all awful basketball players?), but I really think that we're not getting close to justifying saying ""ALL Westbrook teams HORRIBLY UNDERPERFORMED""."
"James Worthy,  Pippen (tho we did see him as the first option for 1.5 seasons),  Ron Artest (I'm biased tho),  Steve Nash (as more of a scorer),  Goran Dragic,  Manu Ginobli,  Rashard Lewis,  Jamal Murray,   and Michael Beasley (for a tanking team)"
None of those teams are outrageous. Nuggets supporting is kind of bad and very young as shown these playoffs and I don't think k much of Jamal Murray. Suns got exposed in the finals and they haven't made any moves. Warriors are a joke and Luka has no team
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
Yk what’s crazy Jamal Murray first day off a acl injury would most likely/guaranteed 21-0 in 1v1
idk why he reminds me of jamal murray
"Nuggets fans will complain he left but he got the Nuggets a lot of assets in return, including the pick that would become Jamal Murray. Not like he pulled a KD and left them for nothing."
"Yeahh…that actually could have contributed to this injury…  Apr 9, 2021 — “Jamal Murray is once again questionable heading into Friday after missing the past two Nuggets games due to a sore right knee.”  April 12, 2021 — Murray returns against the Warriors and tears his ACL in his left knee."
"I dunno, it sure made Jamal Murray a household name"
IT Zach Lavine Dejounte Murray Jamal Crawford KPJ  all guards but oh well lol
"&gt;Also they were constantly getting killed by guards   Did you even watch the playoffs? Because this is pretty much the opposite of what happened. The Lakers faced Dame and CJ, Harden and Westbrook, Jamal Murray, and then Robinson and Herro, and really the only one who had any kind of consistent success against them was Murray, in part because he just hit a bunch of incredible shots while being very well defended. The last thing anyone who watched that Laker run should say is that they had trouble with guards because it's just not true."
"Steph Curry, or Jamal Murray when he’s in the zone"
"Other than Jamal Murray, obvs."
"99% of all games above 55 points have a large chunk of them coming from the line   That’s just how the game works, very rarely is anyone hot enough to be hitting 20-25+ field goals in a single game   That’s what makes games like Jamal Murray and Melo’s 50 point nights so special, mostly just jumpers. But hitting 60 is a different realm from 50"
"Malcolm Brogdon  Jamal Murray  Jonathan Isaac  Jaren Jackson Jr  Myles Turner   An Isaac, Jackson, Turner lineup is my dream. OG and VanVleet coming off the bench."
"Pat Bev showed a lot more foolery the past few years. Shoving Jamal Murray in the back towards the end of an already over game. Stepping on Luka Doncic’s foot among other dangerous fouls. Yapping away at Devin Booker, Suns players and fans when he thought game was over with time left on the clock. Poetic that they ended up losing.  Pat really showed me he doesn’t have a strong tough guy mentality. More so a weak one where he’s an inferior player who can’t win legit in basketball, gets in his feelings and instead tries to hurt better players. Multiple times now instead of competing in basketball, he resorts to dirty fouls once he’s out worked and outclassed. Bitch needs to get out the league before his antics hurt any more players."
"I always wondered if Jamal Murray would be considered a PG if he was on a different team without Jokic. In an ideal world where Sengun can become a player like Jokic, Sabonis, or Alvan Adams and make up for not have a true PG as long as you got some good palymaking combo gaurds."
"Well maybe not all my ideas would work but I still think we have a responsibility as a society to try something. As for does capitalism make people smoke crack unironically in some cases yes. In instances where people turn to drugs to escape the banality and humiliation of the underpayed monotonous 9-5. Or when they’re born into families that have been destroyed economically in previous generations.   My friends are clowning on my Lakers right now because they think Russ equals no spacing, ballhogging, locker room diva and they think he’s gonna ruin the Lakers. I told them to keep that same energy in ten months when they say LeBron needed Westbrook to win another chip. Chicago definitely upgraded the most but I also think if Kemba is healthy the Knicks had a really good offseason too bringing back all their key contributers and upgrading from Payton and Bullock to Kemba and Fournier. I think Denver will be right back there near the top next season with Jamal Murray back and a full season with Aaron Gordon. Suns and Jazz will probably fall back to the mid tier with the Warriors back but there is a little more of an opening for top seeds with Kawhi looking like he’s gonna miss most of the season. Nets should handle Miami and Milwaukee but their depth isn’t the strongest right now which is the only thing keeping me from calling them hands down favorites. With Boston I don’t even fucking know what’s going on over there anymore. A couple years ago they seemed like the present and the future and now they seem like neither."
"For his position? Nah. Above average starter means he's in the top 15 PGs in the league.   I have, in no particular order, Steph, CP3, Westbrook, Trae, Luka, Jrue, Dejounte Murray, Jamal Murray, Lowry, Lillard, Kyrie, Simmons, Conley, Fox, Ja, Brogdon, SGA all above him. Might have some I missed too.  Better than Graham though"
Jamal Murray is used to giving facials
"Yeah they have, but he’s only ever gone up against the clippers. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell also has great numbers against the clippers. Part of it is Lukas greatness but also part of it is the clippers do no defend guards that well in the postseason."
Our record after Jamal Murray went down was 13-5. Thats a 72% win percentage. We had the best record in the league in those final 18 games.
"&gt;We had the best record in the nba when Jamal went down.  is that true? i thought the jazz held it for almost the entire second half of the season. i remember them being undefeated since the aaron gordon trade when murray got hurt, but i thought they were still in third"
"Lots of areas of medicine have gotten 10-100x better over the past decade. Speaking personally, arthritis treatment has completely changed (much for the better) over the last few years alone.   Just guessing, but I assume Jamal Murray is also getting stem cell treatment done in conjunction with his recovery, which wasn't available prior to a few years ago. Stem cells have somewhat of a ""miracle""-esque vibe to some injuries and recovery prognoses."
I'm rooting for Emmanuel Murray. It's a shame he didn't develop in Denver. Good thing Jamal Mudiay turned out great for them though.
Jamal Murray has a few 50 point playoff games that would suggest otherwise
Jamal Murray does porn
"Embiid and Jokic are international, and both better than Gobert.  You could probably slide one of them to the four and put two of them on the court.  Jamal Murray and Siakam.  SGA.  Bogdanovich.  Probably throw Ben Simmons on there.  Fournier's getting a spot as shooter.  Vucevic should have a spot, but he might get bumped because they're so deep at center."
"Lmao Reggie Jackson is not underrated after his playoff run.   I’ll tell you who’s underrated, Jamal Murray. He took a huge leap in 2019-2020 but got injured so ppl have forgotten about him. The guy torched the Utah Jazz and the LA clippers in the playoffs."
And here I thought Jamal Murray and Eric Gordon were our Joe Johnsons.
"Canada, if Jamal Murray and Shai play. We’d have silver if they did. Murray would be an incredible FIBA player."
He wants to go to a contender so the only realistic locations/packages would be...  To the Clippers for Paul George  To the Lakers for Russell Westbrook  To the Nuggets for Jamal Murray  To the Suns for Chris Paul  To the Nets for Kyrie Irving  To the 76ers for Ben Simmons  To the Celtics for Jaylen Brown  I doubt half of these deals would ever happen tho. Philly seems the most realistic.
We know Murray and Jokic make them a Good team However Jamal Murray has Played Great especially in in the Playoffs which is why I’d pick him over Ingram. Like when dropped 50 points in a Game 7.
" https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mock-draft-2016-lsus-ben-simmons-to-the-sixers-at-no-1-looks-to-be-done/amp/      https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2016/6/22/12001638/nba-mock-draft-2016-ben-simmons-brandon-ingram-lakers-76ers-celtics  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/list/nba-mock-draft-45-rumors-stock-watch-jamal-murray-kris-dunn-buddy-hield/wpkt2od21jxt10abmlhodi2a8  do you know how the draft process works? lmao at the end of the day on draft day ben simmons was consensus #1. all three of those sites had simmons 1 on their final mocks.   “come on man you don’t have to know everything but if you don’t know you could a least do a little research” - You, like 8 minutes ago"
1. Ingram 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Jamal Murray 4. Ben Simmons 5. Pascal Siakam 6. Dejounte Murray 7. Sabonis 8. Caris Levert 9. Buddy Hield
Jamal Murray would go #1
"he prob woulda won this yr if jamal murray was healthy too, dude gave it all he had."
College was so easy for him. I wanted him to go to Kentucky him + Jamal Murray + Tyler Ulis would’ve been crazy
Lmao damn straight. When we say we want Canadians to come back home we obviously meant Dwight Powell not Shai or Jamal Murray
He is terrible at defense though. Legitimately one of the worst guys I've ever watched in a spurs uniform when it comes to dealing with screens. He's also too slow to guard guards and too little to guard bigs.  And there's no way he can be the second best guy on a championship team. Jamal Murray and especially Paul George are significantly better players than DeMar.
This seems much to do about nothing. If there’s even the slightest possibility he’s playing late in the season they wouldn’t apply for it anyways (similar to Jamal Murray).
"If you wanna argue the Lakers being hurt sure that makes sense, but the Suns had a better record than the Nuggets when Jamal Murray was healthy and are definitely are better team than even the healthy Trailblazers.  I think the Warriors are probably better with some new additions this off-season but one can also make the argument that the Suns would’ve had a better regular season record than the Warriors with Klay."
I could see Mavs/Pelicans in place of Clippers/Nuggets if there’s no Kawhi or Jamal Murray.
"I mean, I'm just giving my perspective as a neutral fan. The talent level of these finals was lower than years past. Each team got to the finals fair and square, however sometimes the NBA is a game of attrition. Injuries to AD, Jaylen Brown, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kawhi, Kyrie, Harden, and to a lesser extent Trae, Giannis, and CP3 made these playoffs not as interesting.  That being said this is coming from a fan whose team didn't make the playoffs so I'm purely neutral"
"Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakim, and probably Sabonis.  You could talk me into taking him ahead of any of those last three, but there's no scenario where he's ahead of either of the first two."
"People gloss over how elite DeMar is. His footwork is some of the best in the league, he's crazy athletic, and I remember he was always at the top at being able to draw fouls, only being eclipsed by the beard god harden. Since then he has developed some pretty great playmaking, and has shored up some of his issues on defense. People say he's bad on defense but I think that's just a stigma that we've gotten used to repeating, no way someone with this much experience, that good footwork, with that crazy athleticism is going to be terrible at defense. The way he can regularly produce a large amount of buckets without any help if he really has to is pretty top level and brings a ton of iso threat on the offense for his team. He was a pretty big ball stopper on ball movement while he was on the raptors, that was probably our biggest issue with him but pop really ironed that out of him it looks like by making him run point for a while on the spurs. The guy has only gotten better the last couple years, so I'm glad people are starting to notice him and look forward to how hard he tears it up on the bulls. The notion of how DeMar should take a pay cut to play on good teams was pretty crazy to me, he could easily be the second best player on a championship team. Im fully convinced if you put him on a team like the nuggets, blazers, or clippers instead of Jamal Murray/cj/Paul George that's easily a championship team. don't get me wrong, he was definitely a negative on the raptors because he didn't fit our offense well (could possibly have been a coaching issue too) and had his defensive issues but I think even the current DeMar would be great on the raptors (especially if Kyle wasn't leaving) and better than ever with how he's improved on all his issues, even if he produced less points for us now."
Giannis Middleton Jrue KD Harden Kyrie Trae Lebron AD Butler Tatum Steph Klay? Randle Beal Lillard Embiid Kawhi PG CP3 Booker Jokic Derozan? Luka Zion Jaylen Brown? Sabonis? Fox? Adebayo? Ayton? Donovan Mitchell John Collins? Jamal Murray? Zach Lavine? Lowry?   That’s 25 guys if you don’t include any of the question marks. 36 including question marks that I’m not sure are better but are close at this point in his career.
"You'd rather have Simmons than Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray? Embiid would do some truly heinous things if it meant he could get a do-over with one of those guys instead.  I guess you could make the argument that Simmons is better than Ingram, Siakam, and Sabonis, but it's close. I'm sure that a lot of teams would pick one of those three knowing what we know now."
"In a game with five players on the court, and the best playing 75% of the game, and on both ends, it's honestly impossible for the best player not to be on a top 64 team.   In retrospect, I think if you redraft that year, Simmons goes 5 or 6. I really doubt there's anybody picking him ahead of Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray, that's for damn sure.   When did we forget that elite athleticism only matters if the guy has high BBIQ and gives a shit?"
If you actually think SGA and Jamal Murray aren't rotation players lmao. And a team of good nba role players is on paper a great international team.
"It was insane watching Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell go against each other in the bubble. Throw in Gobert and Jokic, and Luka is still on the rise. This is heating up fast."
It’s really Jamal Murray tho

"Jamal Murray, SGA, OG, Bridges, Ayton"
"Lamelo Ball SGH OG Anunoby Tobias Harris Deandre Ayton  2nd round exit maybe. Could use Jamal Murray instead of Lamelo, or Jeremi Grant/MPJ instead of Tobias, but I think the spacing and switch ability is at its best with those five.   OG is an absolute must include though, you aren’t getting defence that versatile with serviceable offence from any other non-all star player in the league that I can think of"
"Such a bad take, there are plenty of ""zoomer"" stars that are clearly passionate about their job. I havent heard anything bad about the work ethic of Luka, Zion, RJ, Ja Morant, Trae Young, Tatum, Shai, Ayton, Jamal Murray, Fox, Lonzo, Bam etc. as the way they have continuously improved since entering the league really doesn't raise any concerns that they are ""lazy""."
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
My first thought was Jamal Murray with less 3 point shooting.
"I bet we would’ve given him that if he had a monster playoff run/won the chip. Thing is, Scrotum wanted a max level contract. Not just X amount but the way he went about it made it seem like he wanted a max contract because of the clout that comes as a “max level player”, not just getting the bag.   For reference for how ridiculous that is, there’s players like Jamal Murray who are way better than Schroder making max level money and haven’t been selected as All Stars yet. Dude is delusional."
"Kyrie has done absolutely nothing without Bron. And now will do well because he’s playing with KD and Harden. Dame would do just as well if not better in those roles.  What’s lost is that the suns team went undefeated in the bubble and were essentially a playoff team w/o CP3. Yes, CP3 led them to the finals, but they also faced a ADless lakers, no Jamal Murray nuggets and no Kawhi clippers. So, not as impressive as you make it out to be.  Additionally, that suns roster is much better than the blazers. Criminal if you don’t take into consideration.   I’m not even trying to bash CP3, just highlighting some context that you’re leaving out. The fact that you don’t think dame is “good” is mind boggling. I’d seriously question your understanding of basketball and when you started watching"
I’m super high on Myles Bridges and Dejounte Murray  I’m pretty low on Jamal Murray
"Siakim is debatable too. So is Jamal Murray, Murray is streaky af"
"I never said he was a bad player. I expressed my love for him plenty of times. I really like him as a human and as a player, but if you want me to put him above Jamal Murray, Deaaron fox, Bam adebayo, Khris Middleton, hes gotta learn to use his right hand  These are elite players in the NBA. There's no shame in being behind them"

"Because if they faced healthy Lakers or Kawhi didn't ger injured they wouldn't be in the finals in the first place  Even just Jamal Murray being gone on the Nuggets, he makes it a 7 game series"
"3v3 is a lot of running and a lot of contested shot making. IRL the top 3 were Latvia-Russia-Serbia (the latter were the favorites), and I’d say the winners would likely be someone from the Balkans.   Serbia with Bogdanovic-Micic-Jokic (just too good not to include) comes to mind. Canada with Wiggins-Barrett-Jamal Murray is up there. Honestly Latvia doesn’t sound bad at all in this either, Bertans and Porzingis are made for 3v3 and Kurucs is good enough. Can’t count out Slovenia if they’re this good in 5v5 with just Doncic.   So yeah, Serbia-Canada-Latvia-Slovenia look good. Fun question."
"30 is easy.  Steph Curry, Lillard, Westbrook, Doncic, Kyrie, Trae Young, DeAaron Fox, Collin Sexton, Jamal Murray, Brogdon, Wall, Walker, Ja, DLo, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, Paul, Simmons, Conley, Lonzo, LaMelo, Dejounte Murray, Dragic, Rose, Smart, Haliburton, Mills, Reggie Jackson, Dinwiddie, Herro, Payne, Monte Morris. And Cade Cunningham, obviously.  I'd also take Rondo, Coby White, Clarkson, Teague, Campozzo and probably Maxey over Schroder."
"The problem is the fact that none of the Canadian guys have played much together before. Luka and the Slovenians have played together many times and even with Luka going to the NBA the guys know how to play their role. Canada is trying to make starters bench guys, bench guys starters, and no one knows how to play FIBA/Euro ball. We had no big bigs at the qualifying tournament (we should have kept that Zach Edey long kid from Purdue he was the only 7 footer) and only guard play is strong.   We also were most likely one Czech game away from making the Olympics I think we just shit the bed that game and were lucky to get it into OT. That was without Jamal Murray, Shai, Dillion Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, etc.   They just need time playing together so hopefully in 3 years we should make it."
"Canada has a pretty good roster too. RJ barrett, Boucher, Dillon's brooks, jamal murray, sga"
"I think it's become increasingly clear that Simmons playing for the sixers led to him being overrated. He made the all star team this year averaging 14 ppg and 7 assists with a blatant inability to shoot. Those are Ricky Rubio numbers. I don't care how good you are defensively, if you can only muster 14/7 surrounded by 3x 40% 3p shooters and Embiid at C, you are not better than Jamal Murray who averages 24/4.5/6 on 47/40/90 in 33 career playoff games including multiple 40+ pt games carrying the team."
Jamal Murray in shambles
Bruh what I would rather have Jamal Murray even if he had no legs
"It’s all a question of health.   For next season, I’d def take him over Jamal murray, for what should be obvious reasons."
"Will? Jamal Murray and SGA are already better than Wiggins, at least on the offensive end.   Pulling for RJ to get there too.  Also put some respect on my man DORT DORT DORT DORT."
Both of them are g-league players. Replace then with Jamal Murray and KP and Lebron would still destroy them.
"Jamal Murray, SGA and RJ Barret will probably surpass both."
"RJ Barrett, SGA or Jamal Murray"
"Ontario Canada would give them a run:  Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, Jamal Magloure, Sim Bhullar, James Naismith."
"I’ve seen him slack on defense a bunch of times, also saw him play all-nba defense this year until someone threw themselves at his ankle. I also saw LeBron lock Jamal Murray up to close out the WCF. But sure, Caruso.  You’re “arguing” in bad faith."
"I was going to push back on the Lakers a bit but I looked at the teams and I think you're right, they're in their own tier in the West with Kawhi out. Man I wish Jamal Murray was healthy because I really do think the Nuggets were special."
"I was going to push back on the Lakers a bit but I looked at the teams and I think you're right, they're in their own tier in the West with Kawhi out. Man I wish Jamal Murray was healthy because I really do think the Nuggets were special."

"Only teams I’d put above them are Lakers and Suns. Everyone else is beatable in a 7 game series if Klay is 70% of himself. Kawhi is a question mark on his return, the Jazz choke under pressure, and the Nuggets haven’t improved much since and will have Jamal Murray coming back and having to adjust."
"Yeah old vets like Jamal Murray, divincenzo, deandre hunter, cam reddish, and Donovan Mitchell missing games really hurt those teams that rely on older players"
He needs to request a trade. Look at what Chicago just did for Lavine or the moves Miami made. Portland is complacent and comfortable because he signed that extension. He had 50+ &amp; 10 assists and couldn’t beat a Denver team without Jamal Murray. The Blazers can’t contend in the west at all and they’ve been wasting his career. They need to trade him to a contender and rebuild because this formula has failed for like a decade or more. Show some class and don’t waste his entire career to sell tickets and memorabilia to fans. Ridiculous! Those pickups do nothing at all. All C- players.
"Those 2 midrange shots right over a helpless (and exhausted) Jamal Murray, followed by the dagger pump fake 3 weredone of the most cold blooded shots I've seen."
Jamal Murray wasn't injured lol. He was slightly hobbled the last 2 games. Are you seriously comparing that to Kyrie and Harden being out ?
.....nuggets with jamal murray being injured  miami heat with half their starters missing games
"Yes and no. I think you're viewing it the wrong way. There are only a handful of PGs in the league who are a go-to scoring option when the game slows down in the playoffs and in end-game situations. He is definitely one of those. He has a very long list of clutch performances for the raptors in the playoffs.   PGs who can score in the clutch: Curry, Lillard, Kyrie, Lowry, Jamal Murray, Westbrook, Trae, Shai, and maybe CP3. That's literally it, maybe Jrue as well. Guys like Fox, Conley, FVV are lower tier and not really reliable bucket-getters."
"Yes he is lmao have you forgotten how he literally always kicks the suns ass without fail?. Of course you have suns fans have forgotten a lot after beating 3 teams with injured stars. 13-2 and it’s not a fluke  Literally look at the drop off for you once Saric went down, Jamal is 20 times the player saric is and it forced the nuggets to start fucking Campazzo and Rivers. Y’all were whining so much about Saric being out but yeah Jamal wouldn’t make a difference dude buddy. Fucking Markus Howard got significant minutes lmao. You literally lost the minutes when an injured Barton was playing I don’t even wanna know what Jamal would do to Booker and Paul shit would be inappropriate.   With all 3 of Dozier Barton and Murray playing the whole series no doubt the nuggets win imo. With just Jamal, a known suns killer, I give them a very very good chance. Booker and CP3 both play worse when they actually have to defend which they did none of against Facu and Rivers."
How did I ignore that? They still looked miles better with Jamal if you actually bothered to watch.   If anything you’re ignoring the massive drop off from Jamal Murray to Facu and Rivers. Hell the massive drop off from Barton or Dozier even
"yeah I was thinking like in terms of injuries to the Nets big 3, Jamal Murray, etc. In the east the Heat also look better. A few fallers I think would be the Jazz and the Knicks. Bulls could put up a fight as well, now with Lonzo and Caruso"
"They made the conference finals in 2020. The only team in the 2020 conference finals to make it to the second round was the Nuggets, and they lost Jamal Murray to an ACL injury during the season."
"I feel like this actually demonstrates the point I was trying to make. He's leading the league in assists at 11.7 a game, a full assist over the next best ""passer"" in the NBA in James Harden. Yet, he's only 11th in Secondary Assists.  Now look at the number of passes, Westbrook is passing the ball 65 times a game. That's 15 more passes a game than Curry, Lillard, Morrant, and Jamal Murray. The ball is in his hands a lot, which explains his assist numbers. Why are his Secondary Assist numbers lower than those other point guards? If he's such a great facilitator, and he averages 20% more assists than other point guards, has the ball 20% more than anyone else, shouldn't his secondary assist numbers be at least on par with other point guards?  In summary, league ranking doesn't mean shit."
"Jamal Murray wasn’t changing the outcome of that series.  I love Denver, but they were way more injured than just Murray.  And moreover, they need to figure something out on defense. And I’m one of the “Jokic isn’t actually THAT bad on defense” people too, but it really doesn’t matter in the playoffs.  Murray or not, the Suns we’re gonna go at Jokic every single time and get wide open threes if Denver brought help."
STILL Jamal Murray
"The Suns road to the finals this year (no disrespect to them, they played their hand) is easier than most years, even in the East. An injured Lakers team, Nuggets team without Jamal Murray, and a Clippers team without Kawhi. Have a hard time believing the Bulls can have an easier playoff run than that even considering the East is generally easier than the West."
Didn’t Jamal murray also start slow? Like 2-20 in his first few games
"Dare I say, CJ is underrated. The issue is, everyone looks at him as an undersized SG. But look around the league how many true PGs are there? All the guys who would have been SGs 5, 10 years ago are PGs now and thriving  (Jamal Murray, SGA, Harden , Luka).  So there’s no reason in 2021 to still be an undersized SG. Just move him to PG! That alleviates a lot of the concerns over his game.   CJ on the Sixers, Heat, or Bulls is an all star at PG"
"Do Europeans even primarily identify as ""European""?   I figured y'all identify primarily as French, German, British, etc, before European.   Americans, Canadians and Mexicans certainly don't identify primarily as ""North Americans."" If Jamal Murray wins a title, it's not like Americans are gonna be all ""Yay, that guy's from the same continent as me! N-A! N-A!"""
"Nuggets would have:  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray   Evan Fournier   With Melo, Michael Porter Jr.,  Monte Morris and Manimal in the rotation"
"Yes, but it's an accurate description of a lot good shooters in the league. Other guys with lower to Mediocre 3 point percentages but are still deadly and need to be guarded tight include Lou Williams, Luka, Trae Young, Jamal Murray, and Bradley Beal"
"Booker shoots a higher volume and tougher shots in general, its hard to compare players who have such vastly different roles and types of shots they are asked to take...I mean its a trend, guys like Beal, Trea, Luka, Jamal Murray etc all are known to be good shooters but their %'s don't back that up because of their play style. If their role was to be strictly off ball and just take spot up 3's, their % would be much different.   Feels like this is a classic case of letting the stats tell the story instead of your eyes and what we know about them"
"What about half the league being crippled this season? You seriously don't think that Kawhi, AD, Harden, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray playing is going to change the competitiveness of the season? Guess winning really does fix everything"
Brandon Ingram---&gt; Kevin Durant  Andre Roberson--&gt; Ben Simmons  Kevin Huerter---&gt;Larry Bird  Jamal Murray---&gt; Michael Jordan  Greg Oden--&gt; Deandre Ayton (actually Oden may be Ayton from the future)
"If Khris made it more of a point to be in the public eye, we'd talk about him like we do a Paul George or a Jamal Murray. Khris is good. Ain't no reason to act like he's fuckin' Robert Covington out there. Khris is certainly better than Kyrie for the Bucks."
"Nationality and ethnicity are different. Im born and raised in America but I call myself Greek-American. I am Greek first before I’m American, I just live here I can literally move and change my citizenship but not my ethnicity. My ancestors didn’t live for hundreds and thousands of years in Greece for me to not be Greek cause I live in a different place. Just like Giannis’ family and ancestors didnt live in Nigeria and have Nigerian culture for hundreds of years just for that to change because he grew up in Greece. He is Nigerian and should be proud of it his nickname is Greek freak because it’s fun. Just like Andrew Wiggins and Jamal Murray are maple Jordan and maple curry because they grew up in Canada"
"Don't talk like that Giannis. You could always win another one if LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Harden, Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, and Jamal Murray get injured in a single postseason\* again."
"He makes it close and he definitely plays well against us in the regular season, but I just don’t see how Jamal Murray swings things from a sweep to a win."
"Yes the nets are better than us, we are close to a lakers squad though, outside of lebron and AD that team was trash. And Jamal Murray doesn’t change a sweep into a win, he makes it close though."
"Right. I am super stoked the Bucks won. But, they 100% benefited from key injuries to the Nets and Hawks. The Nets with only 2 of the big 3 healthy were whooping Bucks asses.   Even the Suns benefited from injuries out west, especially to Kawhi AD and Jamal Murray.   Super Teams have been a part of the NBA forever and are here to stay, but every now and then we see a team like the Bucks… and I’d qualify tham as an almost super team.   But… 2011 Dirk tho. That was special."
I was rewatching bubble highlights a lil bit ago and noticed Bev almost seriously injured Jamal Murray in G7 with like 30 seconds left. Dude can be an ass sometimes.
"All these teams wish they have a backup player that was injured instead of their all-star impactful player like Anthony Davis, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, Jeff Teague"
"Khris maybe, to jrue? Fuck no, dude had two playoff series this run where he shot in 30s, the nets and the suns. He barley shot 40% this run. I’d legit take post acl Jamal Murray over him"
"Man nuance is always lost on this sub its crazy. The heat not having Bam for a game or two and dragic who was basically a glorified 6th man isn’t really the same as missing Kawhi, AD, Harden, Kyrie, Jamal Murray. The Raptors win over the Warriors without KD and then Klay was also different. You can say it in no way has an asterisk, but you can also say the amount of high end superstars hurt and unable to play made this playoffs a whole other beast."
"bullshit qualifiers? Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard not playing is ""bullshit""?  you really think under normal circumstances that they get to the finals? really dude?  and how young are they really with 36 year old injury prone CP3 as their engine?"
"Here's how I see it. Basketball is a team sport and that means you're depending on the team to win. If your team is built heavy at the top (depending on Lebron AD / Jamal Murray / Kawhi) and those guys get hurt and you don't have enough firepower to follow through, then you weren't the better-constructed team. When Giannis went out, the Bucks closed out the series against the Hawks, winning both games. That's just one indication that even beyond the greatness of Giannis, the team as a whole is stronger than many other teams.   We can have what-if discussions for sure, there's a place for that, but the reality of humanity is that sometimes players get injured, and it's the responsibility of the team to work with the available squad to still get the job done."
"Better question is what would have happened if Kawhi never gets hurt, or what about if Jamal Murray never gets hurt, or what about if LBJ and AD were 100% healthy, or what about if Kyrie and Harden were healthy..."
"Like Saric is more important than Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, or Kahwi"
"I like that he won, but he didnt even face a GREAT team in my opinion.   The Hawks and Miami werent really predicted to go to ECF. Not their fault that 76ers shit the bed.  Not trying to take the accomplishment away from him, but he's practically shitting on all the players that got injured. In my opinion I was looking at the Nuggets to take it all the way this year. The Jamal Murray injury was catastrophic."
"I think the east might actually be better than the west next year. Kawhi probably isn’t coming back next year and if he does, he won’t be 100%. Also who knows what Jamal Murray will look like either"
"There’s a difference between losing Goran dragic and losing ad, Jamal Murray, or kawhi fucking Leonard lmao.   No one thinks Miami would’ve somehow beat us last year if dragic was healthy(we were missing our starting point guard too btw).  Almost everyone thinks lakers and clippers would’ve beat Phoenix if healthy. Tons of people think Denver would’ve beaten them too. People still bring up the raptors in 2019 winning Bc kd and klay went down. Some even bring up 2015 still.   It’s what happens when you get lucky, people talk about it. People are gonna talk about the bucks only winning because Brooklyn died once the dust settles too. It doesn’t make the winning team worse, context is just important."
Jamal Murray in shambles
Devin Booker and CP3 are both better than Jamal Murray in my opinion.
"So what's CP3s excuse this time?    No AD for 3 games, No Jamal Murray, No Kahwi, Up 2-0 and still cant win the finals"
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"Booker is way too overrated. You got media heads saying he could be the next Kobe after every good game, but I see a good mid range but low efficiency scorer who doesn’t do anything else at an elite level. I’ll even say his defence is lacking. I’d personally take, Donovan Mitchell and Jason Tatum over him. I think he’s more in line with Jamal Murray than he is Kobe"
"Im calling BS on the Reggie Jackson take, dude was balling when Kawhi was healthy. Look at that Dallas series  Completely agree with the Denver-Phoenix take. Jamal Murray isn’t turning that series around lol"
He looks slow and unathletic. Also staying in college longer is viewed as not being good enough to make the leap at the next level. He’s huge and put up numbers on sheer height advantage but I think the scouts are looking for who’s games can translate the best to the NBA. Not just stats. Devin Booker/Jamal Murray/Tatum/Embiid didn’t put up high scoring numbers in college. You could see their ability #Eyetest matters. Not just stats.
"win or lose I dont think would change much at this point, he's been dynamite all through the playoffs and he's defended both of phoenix' elite guards at a high level  luka and steph are 1 and 2 in some order that I'm sure people can argue about until the end of time.  kyrie's up there, dame, jamal murray  I'd probably slot jrue above jamal and dame if they get the ring.  Ja morant and trae need to work on parts of their games.   Sexton and fox and brogdon maybe round out the rest of the top 10"
"And the lakers, Nuggets, clippers would have won if LeBron, AD, Jamal Murray, or Kawhi weren’t hurt...  Injuries are part of the deal"
"They just run it back. This year they were tied for 5th best record in the west, if AD tweaks an ankle, Jamal Murray comes back slow, Phoenix takes a step back or comes out slow, KP and Luka still don't get along, etc they absolutely could just be there record wise, just like they are in the middle of the playoff pack every year."
Reminds me of Jamal Murray in last year’s playoffs more than anything. I think he’s on the same level as Mitchell/Murray
"That, I would say, is a fair opinion. We both know how Jamal Murray has treated the Suns matchup over the years."
"There was a thread here earlier today about Jamal Murray liking a tweet about him joining the Lakers, and the OP just shit himself.  People, it's just a ""like"". It doesn't have to mean shit. It *can*, but it doesn't *have to*, and if you're freaking out about a ""like"", you should probably get out of the house more."
Suns injury luck was in another dimension of injury luck. AD misses games in the first round. No Jamal Murray second round. No Kawhi in the conference finals.   Raptors had two wars in the second round and conference finals to even make it to the Finals. Suns got to play teams without their stars in those rounds.  You have to be joking
So Jamal Murray isn't a 1st option?
"With how Jokic was playing this year, playoff Jamal Murray, Gordon cleaning up the boards, and a more mature MPJ, I would have liked their chances."
"&gt;game 4  &gt;Jamal - 46/6/8, 16/24 fg, 9/11 3pt, 5/6 ft  &gt;game 5  &gt;Jamal - 13/2/5, 5/9 fg, 3/5 3pt, no ft  This is the vintage Jamal Murray experience"
"Lol. The keyword got messed up. Anyway, as a Laker fan, I thought the Nuggets could have made it to the Finals if Murray was playing. Only a Nets team without injuries would have beaten a Nuggets team with Jamal Murray, Jokic, MPJ, and Gordon. The Nuggets just needs to trade Wil Barton for a 3 and D player since he’s always injured and his game doesn’t help Jokic or Jamal at all."
"His foot injury helped us tank but I wish we could have seem him and Jamal Murray play for Team Canada.  Murray, SGA, Barrett, Dort, Wiggins would be fun."
Nah u right. These people would have crowned Jamal Murray the best player in the world off of last years playoff run alone. Ayton hasnt shown this type of thing against the best centers yet. Nor even for the regular season. He still needs time. Though I also think he will get there soon. Especially off of the experience a run like this will give him.
"Ok so I like Ayton. But here’s the thing. Hes doing this in a playoff run. A playoff run where he hasnt really had a dominant offensive center test him, besides Jokic of course. Nuggets got swept yes, but thats not due to Jokic. He still put up numbers, but received little help from his cast. Now back to Ayton. He hasnt shown he can do this type of thing consistently. I had him in fantasy this year, and dude just doesnt dominate like he can. During the regular season he was meh. Sure hes doing it in the playoffs, which should be what matters. But if we were judging it on just playoff runs, then Jamal Murray would be the best player in the world. He is another similar player that balled out last year, but hasnt shown he can play at that level for the regular season consistently. Ayton still needs to prove himself both against top centers, and in the regular season. With that said. I certainly think he will. Hes young. And has the tools and smarts to be up there. But yall are way too quick to put him in that Jokic, Embiid, KAT category. He aint there yet. Even someone like Capela was more dominant than him this year. Outside the playoffs."
Delusional world of some Laker fans: We’re getting Jamal Murray.  Reality: His nephew just accidentally pressed the like button.
"Umm dude, this is a compilation celebrating Giannis.  1st clip. If you knew the [context](https://np.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/4fpmgu/can_anyone_explain_the_dunleavy_hate/) behind it, you would have more respect for Giannis rather than think he's dirty.  2nd clip is Moe Wagner being Moe Wagner. His whole job vs Giannis is to flop every defensive possession. He was the leader in charges drawn that season. He knew exactly what he was doing. And Giannis fell for his trapcard.  3rd clip. Giannis gets shoved to the floor. Any other big would have reacted the same way. Commentator: ""Rarely do you see Giannis get that upset"".  4th clip. Giannis takes an elbow to the face from Kanter (probably inadvertent). Two men end up puffing their chests. What's the big deal here? Do you even watch bball?  I could go on... The fact that But the fact this is the best you can do... Let me show you some real dirty plays by a big man: https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/l7j9oz/dirty_plays_by_the_lakers/  https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/l6nevp/neubeck_embiid_on_the_lebron_flagrant_you_look_at/  BTW: I'm a Lebron hater, and I don't even consider him dirty. You have to see these things in a spectrum. Every player lies somewhere on the ""dirty spectrum"". Even Jamal Murray has punched a dick once. You can't just lump Lebron with the World Meta Peace, Bruce Bowen, Pat Beverleys of the world.  Where does Chris Paul fall on the spectrum? IMO slightly left of the dirty players I just mentioned."
"This is Jamal Murray we talking bout, this is nothing compared to previous accidents."
LeBron and AD were both playing hurt  Denver didn't have Jamal Murray  Clippers didn't have Kawhi  Your team is obviously good but don't try to act like y'all haven't been lucky af
"Considering the Suns have played against an injured AD, Jamal Murray and Kawhi...I'd avoid referring to Saric as a huge loss"
"nah our hatred of vince is lessened.   yea he bitched out and asked for a trade and sabotaged his trade value.  no doubt about it.  but frankly our management was incompetent and didn't give him help until it was too late.  and now that we've got our ring, meh whatever.  vince put us on the map and inspired a generation of ballers from the local area, kids who would become jamal murray, wiggins, SGA etc.  and he's expressed regret at how he handled things. so whatever it is what it is.   alonzo never wanted to come here and that's fine. that was vince's fault for forcing the trade; no reason for alonzo to want to go to a rebuilding team when he was nearing the end of his career."
"I mean, who really knows with the Lakers in terms of health. LeBron is a huge question mark right now, AD never stays healthy, and their supporting cast is really mediocre.  Denver lost to the Suns by an average margin of 18 and I'm not sold Jamal Murray could take them from that to a series win over Phoenix. It's not like Ayton is going to play Jokic any worse as he (most likely) will just keep getting better and better.  Utah will be Utah and if they're healthy I could see them making the conference finals assuming they retain their core.  The only team that I think could knock Phoenix out prior to the WCF is the Clippers and again that's contingent on health. But with more experience and another year together, I don't know why the Suns would be a shock to make it to at least the WCF again next year. Any other team will need to add some good pieces to actually compete with the aforementioned teams imo"
"Definitely was gonna pick Curry/Murray UNTIL I saw you meant Dejounte and not Jamal.   In that case, Harden/Russ pretty easily"
Agree to disagree. If there's one thing I'm not gonna do it's count out Jamal Murray. The bubble wasn't that long ago and I'm not sure there were many people on Earth that were better than he was. Let's not forget he does play PG. That's a pretty important position come playoff time.
"We blew out Denver every game. You really think Jamal Murray would have mattered? What a dumb take.  And we were leading game 4 against LAL when AD went out. There's no reason to think that the Lakers would have definitely won that series as everyone is saying. Also, it's teams' owns fault for not planning around potential injuries. AD gets hurt a lot. If you're not ready for that, that's not bad luck. That's poor planning.  Injuries are part of the game. Get over it."
Sayin the nuggets would mop  these teams is disrespectful af lol.   Jamal Murray not the difference between getting swept and a series win. Bucks swept a fully healthy Heat team
"I noticed this when he got lit up by Derrick Rose on the Pistons two years ago, he just couldn't cope with his deceleration. We generally struggle with that guard profile more than most, I feel. From Jamal Murray to Spencer Dinwiddie. I'm not sure it's a new problem for him or it's always been the case. We used to have Avery Bradley then Rozier as the primary on those match ups, maybe it's always been the case."
"&gt; For LAL, CP3 had a should stinger, he only scored in double figures once in that series. And the series was 2-2 before AD was out. And if CP3 hadn't had his stinger it may have been 3-1 in the first 4 games (game 2 the Suns really missed CP3).  Even suns fans admit that AD being out and Lebron being hobbled  probably swung the series for them. They were down 1-2 when AD got hurt in game 4. AD being out made that series a cakewalk for them.   &gt; I don't care if Jamal Murray was healthy he wasn't the difference between winning the series and getting swept by an average loss of 15 points per game.  This is a horrible take. Imagine if someone said, ""Booker being out would make no difference for the Suns."" Murray was a 21/4/5 player and is far and away their 2nd* best player. And that aside, the nuggets were missing not only Murray, but another starter in Barton. A healthy Nuggets team would have matched up very well with the Suns. Another cake walk series because of the Nuggets injuries.   &gt; The Clipper series was tough for both teams, the Suns were missing CP3 for the first 2 games and took both from the Clippers, then Booker broke his nose and took some time to adjust.  The Clippers were missing their best player who was playing like the best player in the league before the injury. Laughable to compare the suns injury issues to kawhi being out all series."
"It's only easy if you ignore their own issues they had.   For LAL, CP3 had a should stinger, he only scored in double figures once in that series. And the series was 2-2 before AD was out.  And if CP3 hadn't had his stinger it may have been 3-1 in the first 4 games (game 2 the Suns really missed CP3).  The Nuggets they absolutely mindfucked, I don't care if Jamal Murray was healthy he wasn't the difference between winning the series and getting swept by an average loss of 15 points per game.  The Clipper series was tough for both teams, the Suns were missing CP3 for the first 2 games and took both from the Clippers, then Booker broke his nose and took some time to adjust.   So if you're going to say ""If XYZ were at full strength"" are we also considering the Suns are at full strength too? Because I still think they win these series.  I think they've had more breaks than hardships, which helps, but it's not like they haven't had their own adversity they've had to deal with."
I think either Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell could recapture their super-saiyan-disney-world-bubble form. Both those guys were legit as good as prime steph curry in that series
"I will take the field. History shows that we always overrate old, busted superstars and underestimate the young guys. That's why dealing for washed up superstars rarely works (Lebron has obviously been the ageless exception).  Guys like Lebron, KD, Steph, and Kawhi are all getting old and busted when you consider the task of an 82 game season. Lots of miles on those joints and some of them have always been fragile.  Luka finished the year as good as anyone. I also like Tatum, Booker, Bam, Jamal Murray. Maybe even Trae, Morant, or Mitchell. Gimme those sweet young hamstrings that can still stretch without tearing."
"Well I mean Steph and Jamal would be awesome but westbrook and harden are better, wait a minute DEJOUNTE MURRAY. fuck curry just give me Dejounte Murray. He is confirmed to be the goat."
Be honest we all assuming it’s Jamal Murray
Yes because Jamal Murray would have turned a 4-0 series blowout into a Nuggets win lmao
"If Murray comes back at the level he showed in that stretch and MPJ makes a leap, I think Jokic will be plenty happy to rack up the assists. You’re probably right, but an idealized version of the Nuggets is probably something like Jamal being the Steph to MPJ’s Klay and Jokic being some sort of super Draymond.   Well, maybe not, Jokic needs more than ~10 shots a game. So probably have a shot distribution more like when KD was there, and I guess you’re right that Steph never won an MVP in those years."
"To me, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Jamal Murray are three peas in a pod. Only Mitchell was an all-star last year, but I think the three of them can all make jumps to all nba caliber at any moment. All of them are phenomenal in the playoffs and I think that if they translate their playoff play into the regular season, it'll be those teams topping the west for a long time."
"I mean, to be fair, Chris Paul, if he wins, will have a mickey mouse ring.   No Lebron/AD   No Jamal Murray  No Kawhi  Possibly no Giannis ?   &amp;#x200B;  This has to be one of the easiest paths to a finals ever maybe"
I think Jamal Murray is better because he hits big shots at the end of games.
Bruh no one hates Jamal Murray lol  The closest thing is that he's a meme for that blowjob vid
"If he didn’t get hurt Jamal Murray. He’s a fringe all star with solid playoff success. No question he could put it all together and become an MVP candidate.  I mean Trae didn’t make the all star team this year and it wouldn’t surprise anyone if he finishes top 5 in MVP next year.   I guess I’m acting like a nuggets homer but I’m going to say MPJ, like Curry injuries have dominated his NBA story so far. Now with Murray hurt hes going to get an amazing opportunity to put up huge numbers. It wouldn’t be THAT crazy for him to lead the league in scoring, become Denver’s number one scoring option while Jokic continues to be the main facilitator. So like MPJ averages 29 ppg while Jokic averages 21 and 11 assists."
"Jamal Murray showed a glimpse in the playoffs, he just needs to be consistent."
"It is. Most of his stats accumulated in the regular season are due to the open lanes, transition opportunities, and lack of defense in the regular season. When the playoffs start and strategy becomes key he’s rendered useless. His 15, 8, &amp; 8 turns into 9,7, &amp; 7. That’s like Lonzo’s first year numbers. Give me the elite offensive player any day like Jamal Murray because it’s not like Simmons locks anyone down in the playoffs. Trae ate, Bogdanovic ate, Collins ate, Kevin Huerter ate. Who was Ben “DPOY candidate” guarding. Kawhi and Lebron are great defenders but their offensive game is why they’re both superstars. Individual defense is overrated on contenders because it’s more of a team defensive concept the further you go. Ben shoots 30% on his free throws. No way you take him over an elite PG like Murray who co-led his team to a conference finals. Avg 27, 6, &amp; 5 his last playoffs."
"Interesting how you chose to ignore what I said about Ben Simmons being the one that’s the perennial all star who’s been first team all defence and All-nba, with the much higher ceiling but it’s because you really have no counter for that arguement 😂.  You’re emphasizing the word currently which tells me you’re basing that whole take off of the hawks series lol.  Jamal Murray isn’t even the primary playmaker on your team, regardless of bens scoring deficiencies in the half court, he’s a better playmaker than Jamal and a better slasher for sureeee. Why do you think everyone gets frustrated with his lack of shot attempts, it’s bc it’s difficult to stop him when he’s driving into the lane without fouling him. Personally I think the free throw thing got into his head which is why he ain’t drive as much as he should have.   I give you shooting and off ball movement but atleast you knew better than to bring up defence 😂😂😂.  Ben Simmons is still better than Jamal Murray"
You reposted this comment like 4 times just to get a joke off about jamal murray tearing his acl? Strange.   Murray on a torn ACL is still clear of simmons btw
"You seem too fixated on this last series with regards to bens ft% and his overall offensive display in said series. I’ll take the perennial all star who’s been All nba, first team defence and who’s also the younger player with a much higher ceiling  Ben Simmons &gt; Jamal Murray my dawg"
Jamal Murray!!! Ben’s “All around stats” stuff looks good in the regular season box score but Jamal is by far the more impactful player.
Why are we doing this when Jamal Murray had a freak performance in last year's playoffs? I thought we'd have some respect for calling people bubble frauds since Murray went off so crazy
"All I know is the Nuggets aren’t ever beating Lebron and AD regardless of if they play in a bubble, in Denver or in a Colombian prison  Also Jamal Murray is never gonna play that well again so it’s funny hearing a Nuggets fan talking about bubble busts"
Such inconsistent attendance. The team hasn't played together. Getting Wiggins now is great but he's probably practiced with Team Canada like 25x maximum. Also injuries at key times. See Jamal Murray
It’s close. Jamal Murray has had the most memorable moments with the jazz and clippers series where he played all nba level.  But his regular seasons numbers are right with the other players.     But it does kind of make sense to use that as a tiebreaker.  So you won me over
Ja Morant or Jamal Murray.
"Giannis wasn't playing, Greece was not a great squad.  Beating the Turks was an upset.  Canada was running at half healthy.  Jamal Murray, SGA, Dillion Brooks, Olynick, etc. were all hurt.  Our team was not supposed to be giving heavy minutes to Wiggins playing the 4 against a giant Czech team.  I don't understand why Lithuania didn't play JV and Sabonis more, they each played less then 30 minutes and Luka was cooking them.  Not sure why they went away from their post heavy game."
Jamal Murray
Then on the other hand we have Zach Collins lmao. Seeing him and Murray beefing during games was hilarious bc they could not be further apart as players. Collins trying to pick a fight with Jamal is about half a step past a fan trying to.
"Jamal Murray, SGA, and to a lesser extent Chris Boucher are all injured. That's a pretty good chunk of talent between the three of them."
"Jamal Murray, Gilgeous-Alexander, Boucher are all out injured. I think in the past players were reluctant but I think this new generation of players certainly looks forward to playing for Canada."
Jamal Murray is not a superstar.
Jamal Murray was the same way for Denver this year. He's the soul of the team and his energy helped Denver get past Portland.
"&gt;Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, cash, a 2012 2nd round draft pick (Quincy Miller was later selected), a 2013 2nd round draft pick (Romero Osby was later selected), a 2014 1st round draft pick (Dario Šarić was later selected) and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Jamal Murray was later selected) to the Denver Nuggets; and the New York Knicks traded Eddy Curry, Anthony Randolph and cash to the Minnesota Timberwolves.  The trade isn't anywhere near as ""what are you thinking"" as people make it sound in hindsight, the issue was that the team afterwards fell apart and Amare aged in dog years."
"Because it's laughable to compare the players he did to the ones that were hurt.  Jrue, Pat Bev, Motiejūnas, and Mike Conley to:  Kawhi, Giannis, AD, and Jamal Murray??  In 2015 those 4 players had **ONE** ASG appearance between the 4.  The others have **EIGHTEEN.**"
"Honestly I don’t care. My opinion certainly doesn’t matter all that much but to me this ring with be *. I get that sports are a war of attrition but these two teams played hobbled squads.   Think about the lineup you could make out if the injuries players the bucks and suns dodged this playoffs Kawhi, AD, Jamal Murray, Kyrie, Harden, Trae.   I’m sure Suns/Bucks fans are gunna go crazy - as they should - but me as a neutral fan sees this as such an * win"
"Yeah, actually the players do have respect for it, it's the fans that really get butthurt about it tbh. You don't see kawhi, or AD, or Jamal Murray claiming the sun's are frauds because they were hurt becausee they are disappointed but understand it's apart of the game and they move on and enjoy their off-season. Meanwhile you have fans that can't let it go and wanna call the team that's still in it frauds 24/7 like their life depends on it."
Jamal Murray doesn’t get hurt we might’ve seen it this year.
"Jamal Murray is a FIBA god too btw, him and Barrett had some great moments for us and are pretty committed to the program. Add SGA and future projected top 3 pick in Elijah Fisher, we got some great talent coming up. Also having Wiggins finally enter the program is huge, very few non-USA teams can match his natural athleticism, he can basically get buckets whenever he wants.    We came a long way from Cory Joseph and Tristan Thompson being the faces of the program, but I'll always rate those guys."
"Almost every star this playoff got injured though, especially on the teams they faced.  You saying almost every team built a team of injury prone players?  Anthony Davis,  Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Jaylen Brown  I mean even Chris Paul got hurt, and Booker broke his nose.  Those are just the guys who would be considered stars."
The best layup since Jamal Murray in the bubble
"As a suns fan I’m also hoping for a healthy and competitive finals, however I think it’s exaggerated how much the suns benefited from injuries.  Lakers series- AD started 5/6 games while CP3 was also hurt and played absolutely terrible for 3 games.  Nuggets- Jamal Murray does not turn a sweep into a nuggets win Clippers- this might be more subjective, but I feel Kawhi being out is about even to what the suns dealt with. CP3 missed 2 games and wasn’t really back until game 4 (although his game 3 performance can’t 100% be pinned on covid) Book broke his nose and you could tell he was playing through pain the entire series, especially with all the facial contact coming his way. Along with cam Payne missing 1.5 games, I feel it was fairly even"
"Damn, Bucks really did it. Been a few years coming, and it's great to see them get into the finals, even if it's without Giannis.  Obviously disappointing to get 2-0'd by the Bucks without Giannis, but still an unbelievably exciting time for the Hawks. Cam Reddish popped the fuck off tonight, and Reddish+Hunter developing next year is frightening when you see what the Hawks already did this year. Not to mention further development of Okongwu/Huerter.  While players like Bogey/Galo are some of the most skilled offensive players in the world, the defensive athleticism of Hunter/Reddish/Okongwu is scary, combined with Capela as the anchor and Collins who is solid too. The Hawks are going to have so many options, assuming Hunter can stay healthy (he looked amazing before going out again) and Reddish further develops.  I don't believe in ""unofficial asterisks"" when it comes to championships. Unless there's an actual, official reason that changed the way a championship is earned, I think that shit is stupid to even talk about. Last year the bubble, this year injuries, it's still 16 teams playing bo7's after regular seasons longer than the strike season.  With that out of the way, I just want to highlight how insane the blood-soaked path is for the Suns. First round, they play the Lakers and AD gets (re)injured, Lebron not 100%. Second round, Nuggets with no Jamal Murray or Dozier, Barton still working his way back. Conference finals, Clippers without Kawhi or Ibaka, and Zubac out the last two games.  That's not like a few random injuries to decent players. That's AD/Lebron, Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, and Giannis. MVP's and finals MVP's out the ass. Pretty insane.  I'm really happy that my two favorite teams to watch this year (pls come back Sonics) are into the finals. Just hoping Giannis is able to come back at some point, even if it's 3-0 and doomed. Suns have easily been my favorite this year, but I've been rooting hard for the Bucks these last couple years, so I guess I won't know who I want to win until they start playing."
"That’s crazy to me. I guess because this season was so fucked up they had a hard time getting players? You’d think Canada would at least be like a top 5 team, *at least.* Nick Nurse, coach. A roster with NBA players on it. But where are like SGA and Tristan Thompson and Kelly O and Dillon Brooks? Was Jamal Murray planning on playing? How has Canada missed the Olympics 5 straight times???  I hope they get their shit together and put together a squad."
"Injuries too, and players of all nationalities prioritizing rest because of the short offseason, and the craziness of the past two seasons. Like off the top of my head I know Jamal Murray, who is so Canadian he literally lived in the Schitt’s Creek motel, is out."
"Despite the roster's wealth of NBA experience, Canada is missing a number of notable talents.  In addition to injured Denver Nuggets shooting guard Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Memphis Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks, Boston Celtics big man [Tristan Thompson](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/6364), Houston Rockets big man [Kelly Olynyk](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/2041), and Toronto Raptors bigs [Chris Boucher](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/46591) and [Khem Birch](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/11121) are sitting out the qualifiers."
"People pull the same asterisk shit every year. They just be mad their teams are out or something.  So tell me, you think AD being out for 1.5 games caused the lakers to lose by 2? You think Jamal Murray being out caused the suns to sweep instead of losing the series? You think Kawhi being out doesn’t cancel out with books broken nose, cp3 missing games and cam Payne missing games? You’re delusional if that’s the case. And like I said, injuries are part of the game. It’s some luck but it’s also a matter of load management and play style."
"The problem is our good players skew heavily towards guards that play a similar style. We have a lot of good players, but a lot of good players all with similar strengths and weaknesses.   You can make that work if your good players are LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, but when they're Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, you need some chemistry."
"Asterisk my ass, stop making excuses. CP3 was hurt during lakers series and AD only missed 1.5 games. Suns still outplayed them with AD on the floor. Jamal Murray does not turn a sweep into a nuggets series win. Maybe it’s closer, but suns still win. Yes Kawhi was injured vs clippers, but cp3 missed games, cam Payne missed 1.5 games, book had a broken nose. No excuses."
"Donovan Mitchell, Curry, Dame, Steph, Jamal Murray, Magic  Sorry I have a top 6"
"Damn wtf I feel like Canada must have the most NBA talent on their roster outside of team USA, seems hard to believe they wouldn’t even be able to qualify for the olympics. Although I guess most of their guys I’m thinking of are all like 25 and under, maybe they just need more time. No Jamal Murray doesn’t help either"
Mannn imagine if jamal murray was playing too
"And Jamal Murray, Dillon Brooks, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olnyk, Tristan Thompson, etc."
With Jamal Murray and SGA I imagine this would have been different.
"We needed Jamal Murray, SGA, dillon brooks, chis boucher, kelly olynyk and khem birch."
"Stay healthy then. But yeah, I’m sure Jamal Murray would have turned that sweep into an easy win."
Wish we had Jamal Murray and Shai Gilgeous Alexander.
"Because it’s not like anyone asks to be hurt. Most of the time with injuries it’s just dumb luck. The suns beat the lakers without AD, the nuggets without Jamal Murray, the clippers without kawhi, and may beat the bucks without Giannis or the hawks without Trae. A champion is a champion and you play who you play.... but it’s not the same when every team they beat has had incredibly significant injuries"
Jamal Murray but I don't think any Canadian should count. Or they should idk?   Bogdanovic x2 tho.
A fully healthy Canada (w/Jamal Murray and SGA) could've made things interesting. Maybe in 2024.
"Kyrie will be an all star in 5 years. What about Embiid, Jamal Murray?"
How would we not beat a healthy Nuggets team. Do people actually think Jamal Murray would’ve changed a series where the Suns dominated each game in a sweep. There is no asterisk on any ring unless the team cheated. Teams can’t control whether the other teams are healthy or not.
"Carmelo and Chauncey for Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Mosgov, Raymond Felton and 2 draft picks (one that turned out to be Jamal Murray)"
"Replace Simmons with Jamal Murray*  Nothing against either Jokic and Embiid, but both were without a starting point guard who can shoot"
"It’s probably on a spectrum. Like if you’re 70% you’d be kinda mad like Mitchell, but if you were 20% at best like Jamal Murray you’d be immensely disappointed, maybe even crying out of frustration but you won’t even entertain the idea of going out there."
"This is my draft order: Jaylen, Jamal Murray, Brandon Ingram, Ben Simmons.  Tbh you could probably swap between Jamal and Ingram depending on what a team needs. Jamal's shined a bit brighter so far, but I'm confident BI will still end up being a great player."
Jamal Murray 🍁
Jaylen Brown probably goes 1 or Jamal Murray
"Sixers do it straight up.   Even if you think Simmons is better than Murray, you'd have to concede that Jamal is a much much better fit next to Embiid. Sixers massively improve their team by doing this trade. Morey pushed the button on this in a heartbeat."
"you don't know if Kawhi gets hurt, but then you get to play a banged up AD &amp; LeBron, a Nuggets team without Jamal Murray, and then the Suns.  Everyone was saying the Suns had an easy path to the WCF. Well every team, ESPECIALLY the Clippers, could've gotten the 2nd seed and had that route. But they didn't."
"Injuries are terribly disappointing for fanbases but I will never shed a tear over a superteam with players that forced trades losing a key piece. Giannis, Jamal Murray, Trae on the other hand are very disappointing."
"His assists were hampered by having Jamal Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier out.   You can throw as many perfect passes as you want, but if they're to Austin Rivers or Facu Campazzo they're not going to register as stats and people on reddit will say you're not an elite playmaker."
"Without Jamal Murray that's extremely difficult to do though, he needs someone else with scoring gravity or else it's easy to defend against. That's why we never did that with Facu"
Jamal Murray 50 on 24 shots WITHOUT free throws
He did similar shit to Jamal Murray when he got eliminated last year too.  He needs a psych eval
You’re that big of a Jamal Murray fan?
"Congrats on having a healthy team. Would've been nice to see how y'all would do against AD, Jamal Murray or Kawhi in your run so far -- hopefully whichever East team emerges has a chance for their superstar to recover and play."
Whats worse is its not like this is the first time. Dude undercut jamal murray last year when they were eliminated by the nuggets. Dude cant control his emotions and he takes it out on opposing players
"We were about to tie the series when AD went down and you're not gonna convince me Jamal Murray would have swung that series for Denver. Maybe they win one or two, but we outright dominated every game in that series.  Kawhi is a different story. It's possible they win the series with him. But he gets hurt often so the team has to plan for that."
"So.. we can't judge anyone's actions ever?  You could say the same thing about the worst humans that have ever existed (I won't name any here because it would be offensive to compare that to a dumb thing like a push in a basketball game).  But, what is your point?  Yeah he's human, everyone gets frustrated sometimes.  But 99% of players don't go and cheap shot another teams player (or foul hard at the end of the game like he did last year to Jamal Murray after we already beat them, etc.)  This isn't just one action, the dude tries to hurt people all the time, and never seems remorseful until after the fact when he realizes people are talking bad about him.  He hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt."
some of my favs:  * Splash Mountain -&gt; Brook Lopez * Maple Curry -&gt; Jamal Murray * Girth Nowitzki -&gt; Nikola Jokic
Jamal Murray + a 2nd round pick for Ben Simmons.
"Excellent Logic.  As much as i wanted to go with the obvious on #4, i thought the fact that it weirdly specified ""first five"" games of a series meant it was gonna be someone unexpected and inconsistent. I was thinking Jamal Murray (for the same reason you thought Mitchell) and ultimately went with Dame."
"The only reason blazers arent trading him is because dame is too hesitant to go back on what he intiially said on winning his own way.   but the blazers arent going anywhere, the dame CJ experiment is dead water. especially when they lost to nuggets without jamal murray    its time we also acknowledge that you are not winning a ring with dame as your best player.   not when you can still list at least 6 players better than dame on the playoffs   he is a perfect fit at philly. its a big market, and its not an automatic win like KD to warriors but if he wins, it sure as hell is going to be big time, which is essentially what he wants"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
Before the season I said that Jamal Murray was clearly a better player than Simmons and got downvoted into oblivion for it
"I swear, Jamal Murray tearing his ACL might have been one of the best things to happen in terms of his perception"
Jamal plays in a completely different system than Murray. Spurs have historically spread their numbers throughout the team rather than a one man show.  Dejounte has way more defensive and play making responsibilities within the team.  Not throwing shade at jamal tho. He's a terrific player. He's a pure scorer and above avg play maker.
Jamal Murray doesn't turn a sweep into a win
"Thanks my friend! I’m not going to pretend like I’m an expert on many other teams, but I watch 90% of Mavs games, and I think we’ll improve because:  Covid less of a factor  KP was pretty good in the regular season and has a healthy offseason  Luka got Olympic experience (hell so did Josh green!)  Several impact players have improved year over year and I expect them to continue doing so; maxi, DFS, Jalen  Brown and bullock complement this team swimmingly. I’m not saying we’re a title contender but with Kawhi and Jamal Murray injured and the Lakers old, the west seems more open than the warrior years"
"Jamal Murray, TS%: 58.8% PPG: 24.3, 33 games"
I think part of it at least in these rankings is more Kawhi and Jamal Murray injuries lowering their teams in the rankings.
"I’m a Suns fan. The absence of Jamal Murray is equivalent to the Suns without Devin Booker, so his injury was the biggest factor. Not sure what the outcome would have been if both teams were fully healthy but it definitely would not have been a sweep. Deandre Ayton didn’t outplay Jokic, but he contested him enough to prevent that from being a weakness for Denver to exploit and he held his own sufficiently. MPJ didn’t shoot well the entire series, I remember there being some speculation regarding his back and I can’t remember if he was playing through a back injury or not, but he’s still young and has a high ceiling with a ton of room to grow. And Phoenix was 100% healthy that series. CP3’s shoulder was back to 100% after injuring it in game 1 of the Lakers series and nobody was injured. That series was when the Suns kinda peaked during the playoffs and it was against a banged up team missing their second best player."
"Lol reading your argument thoroughly doesn’t help you out, it’s a bad argument. The Suns had the 3rd best net rating in the west… as the second best team record… and the 2nd best net rating team in the west lost kawhi. You said the Suns would regress, then showed that they were 0.1 behind the 2nd best net rating to a team that lost their superstar for the season, and then you showed that the Suns had a phenomenal record in close games.   Those aren’t good arguments. The Lakers were not far and away better before they got hurt, the Lakers were 19-8 in the 27 games Lebron and AD played together last year, good for a 50 win pace… or less than the Suns. The Jazz finished one game ahead of the Suns. “Far away” lmao. And so you’re saying the Nuggets had a worse record than the Suns with Jamal Murray… then Jamal Murray tore his acl and will miss a substantial part of next season… and you think that helps your argument for the Suns regressing….?"
"People who say that the Suns deserved to be in the Finals because they had the second best record, and that it wasn't due to all the injuries to their opponents in the playoffs miss the fact that the Suns were also extraordinarily healthy during the regular season as well. CP3, Booker, Ayton and Bridges all combined to miss only 10 games last year, while LeBron, AD, Kawhi, PG and Jamal Murray *each* missed more than 10 games. That kind of relative health really helped Phoenix get that 2nd seed.  The truth is Phoenix was probably the 4th or 5th best team in the West last year, with the Nuggets and both LA teams ahead of them and maybe Utah as well. But those teams all had significant injuries and that allowed the Suns to get that second seed and make the Finals. They were super fortunate last year, but I don't know if that's something they can count on again."
What would you guys offer? Jamal Murray?
"Nuggets out the top 5? Jamal Murray the guy who went off in the bubble? With mpj improving he could be their 3rd option.  Mavs too high, id go suns/lakers, nuggs, clips/jazz unless im forgetting someone.  edit: gsw if they play to their abilities are on a similar tier as the nuggets, if this is a list for the playoffs id throw the jazz or clippers out and put the warriors in, if it's regular season only id bet the jazz get a higher seed than most."
"I’m sorry, the injury argument is reasonable to a certain extent, and I’ll take the clips and lakers being somewhat better than them. However the nuggets got swept by the suns missing primarily Jamal Murray. Murray is a great player but I just do not believe that he elevates them beyond the suns given how dogshit the nuggets defense was in the playoffs. He might move it so that the suns take 6 games to beat the nugs but they got fucking SWEPT without him, he is simply not that guy to be the difference between a relatively uncontested sweep (pretty much only game 1 was close) and a series win."
"Jamal Murray isn't going to be back until January at the earliest, and players don't usually come out guns blazing after a serious injury (except kd, I guess)."
"rlly? He guarded KD pretty much the entire nets series and did a solid job.  Guarded Luka this year, Jimmy, Jamal Murray, etc.  He's also got smart and JB, two great defenders, on the team."
"Denver vs. Bucks  If Jamal Murray gets back healthy, there’s no guarantee AT ALL that Lakers are the top team in the West. Denver was amazing post-AG Trade and now they have also added a bit of depth with Jeff Green.  Each playoffs, someone has been hurt (Barton, Murray, Monte Morris, or Gary Harris) and yet Jokic has been great and Denver has had some big wins.   Bucks I think has to be a bet on Nets being injured. Especially now without PJ Tucker who was needed to guard KD, I don’t see any chance the Bucks getting past a healthy Nets team. It needs to be KD that’s hurt for the Bucks to advance imo."
"Dude i get what you're saying but you're wrong on a couple different levels. Bone structure and your untrained weight (natural muscle) is the starting point, and a lot of players like cousins, Drummond, Adams etc have an easy 40+ lbs advantage of just their frame + natural muscle than other players like KD, Bosh, siakim etc...  I'm 6'3"" and have gained 25+ lbs of mass since I started lifting 5+ years ago, and I weigh like 195 lbs lmao. I don't see myself ever getting above 205 lbs unless I go above 15% body fat. Jamal Murray looks like he's never trained for bodybuilding in his life, looks significantly smaller than me at same height and he's 219 lbs....."
"I think the Bucks are the clear best team in the the East. There's really no other team that I think is on a par with them.  Coming out of the West, with Kawhi injured, I like the Nuggets as the best team in the West.  Out of the two of them, I like the Bucks to repeat, since the matchup I think hinges on Jrue Holidays ability to contain Jamal Murray or at least stop him from going off for 40 every game."
"Became a Knicks fan around 2011, but been diehard since 2013.   Where do I begin?   Alexey Shved or Langston Galloway being legitimately the best player on the floor at times in 2014/15?  Losing our pick in 2016 to the nuggets, who drafted Jamal Murray?  Jarrett Jack and Ramon Sessions getting reps at PG in 2018?  Getting backstabbed by KP in 2019, followed by falling to the third overall pick in the 2019 draft?  Drafting Kevin Knox instead of MPJ, and Frank Ntilikina ahead of Donovan Mitchell?  It's been a dark eight years. Let us have this moment with a competent FO and team."
"I’m biased but I don’t think Nuggets, Sixers is out of the question if Jamal Murray comes back as good as he was before the injury and the Sixers get the Ben Simmons situation right.  I think whoever gets home court advantage wins the series in 7   Also, any combination of Suns, Jazz, Nuggets, Warriors vs the Bucks is a solid finals pick IMO"
Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray
"Clippers with Kawhi I can agree on.  There's no reason for anyone to believe Jamal Murray is able to transform a 18 ppg deficit beat down sweep, very few players can do that and Murray isn't one of them. The Suns just matchup too well with the Nuggets by having Ayton down low, incredible wing defense, and a pick and roll game that abuses guys like MPJ"
"I think the Nuggets are the better team rn but if some Hawks guys take another step up next year and MPJ doesn't the Hawks might be better by the end of the regular season, especially if Jamal Murray takes a while to fully come back. Honestly I think the West is overrated so I think the Nuggets are more likely to win it all."
"Phoenix didn't have anybody on Jokic's level when they swept the Nuggets with three blowouts. No-one's underrating Murray, they're just sceptical that the addition of Jamal Murray is the difference between being easily swept and actually winning a series against the same opponent. There's probably very few players who could do that, and not controversial to say Jamal Murray doesn't make that list."
This sub honestly thinks Jamal Murray would have won 4 games all by himself for the nuggets against the Sun's
"I'd love to see Ingram put on another 15-20 (maybe more, idk) lbs, we saw it really helped Jamal Murray coming in to the bubble"
It’s not Jamal Murray is it? Everything is the same but I can only find 15 ast. You’ve had me doing research for a while now lol
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray. K-town rep
Deandre Hunter&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jamal Murray confirmed? lol
Jamal Murray has had some insane spin moves
Jamal Murray - how to delete an Instagram post
Jamal Murray in the the bubble
Ben Gordon for Jamal Murray was a solid one
Let’s just leave out the fact Jamal Murray was hurt and Jokic played every single game last year…but yeah. And Minnesota got how far?
Jamal Murray
OH JAMAL MURRAY  I thought he meant Jamal Crawford.
"Kawhi first finals was year 2 and they lost, he balled out and won FMVP in year 3.. then again in 2019 with the raptors lol. I was talking about Tyler Herro. For the Drake one, it’s rumored he’s tryna get with Sonya Curry. For the top, that’s Jamal Murray"
"And this year he lost to the Denver Nuggets without Jamal Murray   Sure, he lost to the Warriors dynasty but he has some very bad losses outside of that too"

Jamal Murray
Jamal Murray?
"i doubt they'll get a DPE (for dario saric, ACL?)  doctors have to agree that he will likely be out till 6/15/22 for the team to get one for him, at the current point in time i don't think any doctor would project his recovery going so poorly that this would happen (same goes for jamal murray, and kawhi, although i wouldn't be surprised if kawhi just didn't play this season, but i don't think that's the same as a doctor agreeing that he _can't_ play).  they have until 1/15 to apply for the DPE, i guess if he suffers some setbacks in the meantime it is possible."
&gt; Jamal Murray is the guard who actually plays like Steph.  This is completely true and I don't understand why it doesn't get mentioned more. People who compare Trae to Curry don't really know how curry plays. The closest players to Curry are Jamal Murray and maybe FVV.
Jamal Murray
Jameer Nelson - Jamal Murray - Kyrie Irving
Clippers make one mickey mouse conference finals in franchise history and fans start feeling cocky. 3-1 jamal murray jokic comeback ended your franchises dreams and aspirations
"His trade value is high because he is irreplaceable. He brings things that nobody’s else in the nba brings. You look at players like mitchel, Jamal Murray, and such Jaylen brown who are All star calibers shooting guards but there are 10-15 1/2/3 guards who can get you points and play d maybe not as good but will only be a slight drop off. You can’t find another player who effects other teams offense like Gobert."
How can you say that when walking bucket jamal murray was out? 40 pts a night from him easy.
jamal murray as another eeveelution
I’m not sure if jamal  Murray is enough to turn a 4 game brutal beat down into a series win. Should be close though. Suns in 6 against Denver with Murray IMO
"Trae &amp; Dame play nothing like Steph outside of shooting deep 3s lol. Trae &amp; Dame are 2 of the most PNR heavy guards in the league, don’t do much of anything offball, Trae’s shot diet is a huge amount of FTs &amp; floaters.   The Warriors run the least amount of pick and roll in the league, Steph obviously does a ton of damage offball etc etc.  Jamal Murray is the guard who actually plays like Steph."
I think ur overrating mj maybe Jamal murray
jamal murray created covid so he didn’t have to see his gf’s dad
"I actually think Shaq over Kyrie and Jokic. If he stays in his orlando shape, then he's a plus defender and elite scorer who can't be stopped. I just think it's so much easier to build around a positive defensive centre. Plus if you can get a star whilst shaq is still on his rookie deal averaging 27/12, you are instant contenders.   Kyrie is a slightly better jamal Murray, like how close does that take Jokic to contentionike seriously?"
Jamal Murray v Donovan Mitchell
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
"Alright, next trade will be Jamal Murray and MPJ to the 6ers for Ben Simmons."
"Dreamt jamal murray was sucking my dick and my pubes were long af, was a weird dream."
"Suns have two top 20 players (Booker/CP3) and one top 40 player (Ayton) and a really good coach and surrounding core  Jazz have one top 15 player (Spida) and one top 30 player (Gobert) and a really good coach and surrounding core  Nuggets have one top 10 player (Jokic) and one top 30-40 player (Jamal Murray, hard to judge after ACL tear) and a really good coach and surrounding core.  Theoretical TWolves have one top 20 player and two top 40 players in Simmons/Dlo and a good surrounding core/unknown coach  Not a ridiculous stretch to think the TWolves could be a top 4 team in the regular season. Please think for yourself"
Vince Carter Tracy McGrady Allen Iverson Kobe Bryant Brandon Roy  Honorable mention: Jamal Murray
"Strong teams suffered injuries last post season. Jamal Murray, Kawhi, AD...   Clippers and Lakers were contenders. And Nuggets has been in that convo too."
Jamal Murray👍.....with DLo and Wiggins. Thats it as far as NBA regulars go on Feb. 23rd apparently 😂
Suns were just the 2 seed I don’t think I’m underrating the nuggets especially since Jamal Murray is going to miss a good chunk of the games this year.
Jamal Murray is the best in the playoffs so I'll take him.
Point guard would be Andre Miller.     Shooting guard Jamal Murray.      Small forward Rick Fox.      Power forward Horace Grant.     Center Brook Lopez (back when he played post).       This answer is NOT wrong.
Jamal Murray after the sweep by the suns
Jamal Murray and Dejounte Murray
"That's a lot of good players to choose from, but I'd probably pick Sabonis or Simmons (and not pay Simmons like the 76ers have)  Also I think Jamal Murray is perfectly reasonable"
Jamal murray
"that season was craazy dude. look at the standings. 3 freaking wins between the 9th seed and the 3rd seed. like, wow. still remeber jamal murray crying during press conference, but dude used that as fuel. gotta love him"
No 2x finals mvp Jamal Murray? smh
Jokic was a 2nd option to fucking Jamal Murray for half his games
Jokic  Jamal Murray  MPJ Junior  Will Barton  Paul Millsap
"I've often talked about that with my buddy -- Murray, more than maybe anyone, has the wildest ""highlight reel-to-career accolades"" ratio of any player in the NBA.  If you show someone who had no idea about the current landscape a Jamal Murray highlight reel, even just from the bubble, they would think he was a HOF-level player.  Like MVP candidate.  But dude has never been an all-star, haha.  His highlights paint him in a much better light than his career accolades do.  He's one of those ""if you know you know"" players  Like his best games, best highlights, and his highest highs are literally as good as almost anyone in the NBA.  His issue has been consistency, but fortunately it seems like that's finally coming as this year (before the injury) was an entirely different level of efficiency and production than before.  I genuinely think he has leveled up from the bubble and this season, so I can't wait for him to come back.  If he is able to get back to that level and then continue his progression, he will continue to be one of the most dangerous players in the league when he is on.  Fingers crossed man, Jamal is my favorite player in the league"
To put it into perspective: Jamal Murray averaged 18 points per game that season. For him to have multiple 50 point games and a 40 point game in one series is insane.
I don’t see Jamal Murray being the difference between getting swept and winning the series
Check out social media like Instagram on Twitter. I’ve seen upvoted comments saying Jamal Murray is better than James Harden in the playoffs
"Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons, Blake Griffin. I’m gonna guess 25, 15/0 and 23."
"Their best players are 26, 24 and 23 years old, and all of them will most likely be locked up long term as soon as they're eligible. Why would they trade all of their assets, and lock themselves up for a 3 year championship window?  Jamal Murray was better than Damian Lillard at the same age, while he might not reach Lillard's peak he's definitely on the right track. Trading Murray &amp; MPJ + assets for Lillard right now is the equivalent of trading Klay for Kevin Love back in 2013, that's the type of stuff that could set your franchise back for years if you don't win RIGHT now."
"Man I hope Jamal Murray comes back better than ever.  One of the better players to not be an all star yet, I thought he should’ve got the nod last season over Conley for a replacement"
"I think winning with the guys who have been there year after year is more more meaningful than trading one of your stars and fan favorites for a disgruntled superstar. Ask any Denver Nuggets fan and they will tell you Jamal Murray is beloved by the city of Denver. It’s the same reason why the Mavericks/2015 warriors/Bucks championships feel so much more meaningful and exciting. You could compare trading Murray for Lillard to Derozan for Leonard however by that point it was obvious Derozan just didn’t have what it takes. You need to give Jamal Murray a chance and let the Nuggets see this core group through. They’re all still so very young it wouldn’t make sense trading a core piece so hastily. The nuggets are doing exactly what they should be doing, making the playoffs year after year and trying to stay poised for a run at the chip. You would be a bald faced liar to say they didn’t have a chance last season prior to Murray’s injury."
"Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, and Rudy Gobert come to mind."
Dame cant even torcher Jamal Murray lol
"This is an interesting post, but I think going back 20 years is a BIT too far since the criteria in the 2000s was entirely different than the criteria in the 2010s. In the 2000s, the award generally favored guys that were drafted mid-late first round or in the 2nd round. Basically they were given to guys who weren't really expected to be good coming into the league but ended up breaking out. Players like Bobby Simmons, Aaron Brooks, Boris Diaw, etc all fit that bold - guys who were drafted outside of the lottery who had an amazing season for their standards.   If we're looking at the past 10 seasons, every winner for the award was either a first time all star/all NBA or played a very key role on a playoff team. The only winners that didn't make an all star team/all NBA the team were Ryan Anderson, CJ and Pascal Siakam.   Ryan Anderson was a typical 2000s MIP, 21st pick who reached a career high in scoring (at that time) and played a critical role in his team's success. However, if we were to pick the award based on today's criteria I'd wager that Andrew Bynum most likely would've gotten the nod over him. CJ despite being a lottery pick increased his PPG from 6 to 20, and Siakam went from a stiff to a 2nd option on a championship level team despite not making an all star team that year.   If I'm a betting man looking at next year's potential winner based on the pattern for the past decade, it's going to be someone that either makes their first all star/all NBA team or someone that plays a huge role on a playoff level team whose numbers improved tremendously.   Zion/Zach - I'm going to write these guys off because they're already too good, and have already made an all star team. I don't think we've ever had an all star level player get the MIP even if they made a jump to a MVP worthy season. Steph Curry didn't get it, Derrick Rose didn't get it, I don't see the case for Zion or Zach Lavine.   Shai - He's already putting up 24/5/6 on great efficiency, basically numbers that Brandon Ingram put up when he won it. He can obviously get better, but how much better can he even get at this point to get MIP? The opportunity is there, but it just feels so unlikely that he improves SO much from last season that he wins it IMO.   MPJ - Probably has the best odds to make it IMO. He has the talent and most importantly the opportunity with Jamal Murray out for most of the season. If he can take on more of the scoring load and put up around 25PPG on similar efficiency &amp; improve his defense while making the all star/all NBA team the award is as good as his.   I'm not going to bet on any of the sophomores, because historically you need to see a HUGE improvement to win MIP as a sophomore. Improvements from lottery picks like Edwards/Williams would be expected, and Bane would have to average 20PPG which I don't see happening given his role.   Guys like JJJ/Garland/other top 5 picks would really have to get their first all star selection in order to be in the conversation for MIP. I just don't really see it for those guys right now. Injuries aside, I just don't see JJJ make the all star team this upcoming season over Ja, and I DEFINITELY don't see the Grizzlies have more than one all star player.   I really like OG at those odds, he just fits the criteria the NBA is looking for in their MIPs IMO. The only things he really needs to be a good offensive player at this point are tighter handles which he has reportedly been working on all summer. It's really hard to judge the Raptors right now because their season in Tampa was so unorthodox, nobody knows how much playing away from Toronto has affected their player. If the Raptors look good before all star break and OG is putting up 20PPG + great defense, he could very well sneak into an all star game and end the season on an all defense team. +5000 odds I feel like this is a no brainer.  In regards to NAW, I love NAW but I just don't see opportunity for him to take a huge leap like that. The Pelicans already have two stars in Zion &amp; Ingram, how many minutes/shots are realistically going to be available for NAW? I guess not having Bledsoe/Lonzo on the team anymore helps his case, but we also have to consider that they also brought in JV who's going to command a LOT more touches than Adams. I feel like the minutes might be there, but the opportunity might not necessarily be there. But then again, his PER 36 stats do look good so at +3000 it's still pretty good.   Anyways, my picks for MIP so far is probably MPJ/OG/NAW."
1. Ben Simmons  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Jamal Murray  4. Mike Conley  5. Fred VanVleet  6. Colin Sexton  7. Malcolm Brogdon  8. LaMelo Ball  9. D'Angelo Russell  10. Lonzo Ball
"I was just debating with someone letting them know how bad the Nuggets would be without Jokic. They certainly wouldn’t make the playoffs. His argument: they have Jamal Murray. My retort: Jamal Murray is not a top 10 pg in the NBA. I don’t think he has ever been in the top 10 in PER, although he did have that crazy 2020 playoff run."
Jamal Murray: an Instagram Story
* Jamal Murray Gets Brain * Tristan Thompson Cheats Raw * King James' Royal Staff * Nick Young: A D'Angelo Russell Joint * Gilbert Arenas Punks Nick Young
people are really upvoting “i’m taking taking Jamal Murray over Westbrook”  😐🙄
1. Jamal Murray (assuming health) 2. Ben Simmons 3. Mike Conley 4. Kyle Lowry 5. LaMelo Ball (Hot take?: Will be #2 end of the season) 6. Malcolm Brogdon 7. Fred VanVleet 8. Collin Sexton 9. Lonzo Ball 10. D'Angelo Russell  I think its pretty cool that D'Angelo Russell is like the 20th best point guard in the league. We're really stacked at that position and should be for a long time since we seemingly get 1-2 franchise point guards in the draft each year.
Easy: Jamal Murray

"&gt;And the player the Pelicans need based on this team would be a Jamal Murray, Shai, Fox, etc, not Lonzo. We need guards that can create offense for themselves and others.  Well, maybe your front office will address those needs in the inevitable Zion trade."
"&gt;And the player the Pelicans need based on this team would be a Jamal Murray,  Shai, Fox, etc, not Lonzo. We need guards that can create offense for themselves and others. Lonzo is more of a wing than a PG in the half-court.  If you're actually trying to build around Zion, I thought having the ball in his hands worked pretty well last year, in which case someone like Lonzo fits better than Murray/Shai/Fox"
Now tell me would you trade Jamal Murray for Ben Simmons? Would you trade Aaron Gordon for Tobias Harris? How about Danny Green for MPJ?
Jamal Murray is the absolute pinnacle of unpredictable microwave guard. You don't know if he's dropping 10 with mediocre efficiency or 50 with 100 TS%.
Jokic literally won a series in 6 with a starting backcourt of Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers last year my man. Jamal Murray is not better than Jimmy Butler….
"The Pelicans aren’t even exactly sure what they need right now since they haven’t seen the whole team play together. And the player the Pelicans need based on this team would be a Jamal Murray,  Shai, Fox, etc, not Lonzo. We need guards that can create offense for themselves and others. Lonzo is more of a wing than a PG in the half-court.   We definitely could’ve used Jrue, but he requested a trade to compete for championships, and we allowed him to do that because he was an amazing player and person for our organization."
"I think our two most promising players, Jamal Murray and SGA both comitted to play, but were both injured. Unfortunately Olynyk couldnt take us to the promised land lol"
Why Jamal Murray have a dad bod now?
"Issa copypasta, don't worry we know we only won because ~~AD~~ ~~Jamal Murray~~ ~~Kawhi~~ was hurt, regardless of the fact that CP3 and Booker were both playing hurt and we didn't use Saric's injury as an excuse"
That's such a narrow way to look at it but ok.   Anyways in the bubble they lost to the Lakers in the conference finals. And it was 4-1 but all the games were close which is respectable against the champs.   Last year no Jamal Murray how far are they really supposed to go.
"Yeah and then we've also beaten the clippers, the Nuggets, and the Thunder all as the underdog in that same timespan.   It's almost like we win exactly as much as you'd expect us to   Jamal Murray wrecked Gobert dude. He didn't wreck their small guards. He killed Goberts inability to play high in the PnR. ...the exact thing that Mitchell did right back to Jokic"
"&gt;The blazers definitely don't undeperoform lol. Not being able to beat the Warriors doesn't make us bad. We've won more series as the underdog than we've lost as the favorite.   I didn't realize getting swept by the Pelicans (as a favorite, which means underperformance) and losing to the Murray-less Nuggets (Lillard seemed to think it was underpermance) counted as losing to the Warriors.  The Wizards don't do much of anything, but I'm saying that's in large part due to their best player being an undersized shot hunting guard.  Jamal Murray absolutely wrecked Utah's small backcourt, off the top of my head.   Bottom line: the track record isn't good. And the examples I provide are all top-level talents."
"&gt;He's having an even BETTER season than last year somehow.   &gt;   &gt;\#1 in the league in RAPTOR   &gt;   &gt;\#1 in the league in EPM   &gt;   &gt;\#1 in the league in PIE   &gt;   &gt;\#1 in the league in WS/48   &gt;   &gt;\#1 in the league in BPM   &gt;   &gt;\#8 in the league in NRTG   &gt;   &gt;Basically every impact metric has him as the best player in the league this season, and he was #1 in most of these last season as well.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;His points, rebounds, steals, and blocks per 100 possessions are all UP from last season. His TS% is up as well. And he's leading the Nuggets to the 3rd seed without Jamal Murray or MPJ.  That's his argument.  I'm only responding to what I'm reading here.  The vast majority if not entirety of his post is about this season.  There's one singular line about last season's #.  The crux of his argument is in the very first line ""He's having an even BETTER season than last year somehow."""
"Luka and  tatum, Towns and Embid , Jamal Murray and ja Morant and Zion is in his own league in his position."
I remember jamal murray randomly getting called for one last year it was so odd
"Wow man this thread has been insane but this is by far the worst take I’ve seen hahahah. You’re saying out of Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Embiid, AD, Tatum, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Ja, KAT, Fox, SGA, Lavine, probably like 15 more guys, there aren’t generational talents? What a wrong, Scrooge-ass opinion hahahah"
"[Murray is considered out indefinitely, and earliest return would be April, so basically not a factor this year](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/how-long-is-jamal-murray-out-injury-timeline-return-date-latest-updates-on-nuggets-star/7gfy79brp6jh1toue98qiwyri)   Kawhi's injury isn't considered as serious as Murrays, so there's a chance he returns, but most people think he takes his time cause it's Kawhi."
"I'm pretty sure about nuggets and clippers, though.  kawhi might really be back, and if PG isn't completely exhausted by then from carrying the team they should be really good.  and jamal murray should be just fine, even if mpj winds up not being good this year for whatever reasons."
probably needs a player like jamal murray to help out. Also he finished like 3 games behind denver the lats few years. Its just how the west goes.
Jamal Murray never made all star?   Wow that’s insane
Honestly to me Jokic is the most impressive out of all of them right now. Without Jamal Murray he basically has to pray that Will Barton or Aaron Gordon have a good game. Barton’s been very good so far but he was awful tonight.   Steph and KD have way more help.
"Lucky suns are the 2 seed in the west only because Jamal Murray isn't healthy, frauds."
"Pretty sure that's what happened to Jamal Murray, Nuggets were losing to the Warriors in a blowout and he injured his ACL"
"6 months ago this dude said the Nuggets were the “Hornets of the West” and “will struggle to make the playoffs.” They proceeded to produce the MVP, lose Jamal Murray, still get the 3 seed, and still win a playoff series. In other words, this guy’s opinion is worthless"
we’re getting mad disrespectful in here. was Mike Conley a role player before he made a allstar team? Is Jamal Murray a role player?
"If we re-draft 2016, where does Ben even get picked?  Hypothetical lottery re-draft:  1. Jaylen Brown 2. Jamal Murray 3. Brandon Ingram 4. Domantas Sabonis 5. Pascal Siakam  IMO these guys all get picked before Ben. Would you guys take Simmons over someone less talented but with fewer glaring weaknesses, like Brogdon or Levert? In a playoff series it's something to consider."
"Nuggets fans could say the exact same thing about Jamal Murray.  If he was healthy,  the Blazers wouldn't have had a chance."
"Jamal Murray   MPJ  Bogdan   OG  Simmons  Bench- Seth Curry, Smart, and Christian Wood"
"G - Jamal Murray  G - Mikal Bridges  F - Bojan Bogdanovic  F - Ben Simmons  C - Klieber  Bench:  F - Covington  G - Hardaway Jr  C - Gasol  Everyone on this team are good 3 point shooter and do not require the ball to be effective.  Murray and Bogdan are capable of getting their own shots and play-making.  Simmons would be the main ball handler as well as the main screener and roller.    Defensively, this group can switch 1-5.  Switch Kleiber or Bog with Covington for an even more elite defensive unit depending on the matchup,  Switch Gasol in when facing embid, jokic etc"
"PG - Jamal Murray  SG - Mikal Bridges  SF - Michael Porter Jr  PF - Jae Crowder  C - Ben Simmons  If he's gonna be shit at shooting even free throws, small-ball 5 it is for Ben."
PG Jamal Murray  SG Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF OG Anunoby  PF Ben Simmons  C Christian Wood
Jamal Murray(Russ was right there and yes very unsurprising)
"I just figure Ben replaces AG’s value to the Nugs much better than Barton’s. Jamal is the PG, Jokic would obviously command the ball more than Simmons, so this would effectively make him a 4. He could focus on rolling/cutting/pushing in transition, along with his defense.   Murray/Barton/MPJ/Simmons/Jokic lineup sounds dangerous with shooters off the bench IMO."
"Dude if they would've had a PG that can literally put up like 12/7 they would've won this series. Having your BALL HANDLER scared to shoot is uhm....not a great recipe for success. Look at Jokic. He really went down a level in the playoffs bc no Jamal Murray. I love that skilled centers are a thing, but gotta have a good or better ball handler (that can shoot)"
"Cool, so I’m curious. What trade value do you think he has? Who can the 6ers get for him? Book? Trae? Jamal Murray? Barrett? Wiggins? PG13? Jrue Holiday?"
"&gt;made the WCF with the Rockets in 2018  With James Harden.  &gt;carried an OKC tank squad to the playoffs,   With a bunch of players who turned out to actually be pretty good, between SGA, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Dort, Noel.  &gt;made the WCF with the Suns in 2021  With Devin Booker playing at a superstar level and Ayton being one of the best 2-way bigs in the playoffs, and with his competition being the Lakers without AD, the Nuggets without Jamal Murray, and now the Clippers without Kawhi."
"Dirk also didn't play a Portland team missing LaMarcus Aldridge (Lakers - Anthony Davis), a Lakers team missing Pau Gasol (Denver - Jamal Murray) or a Thunder team missing Kevin Durant (Clippers - Kawhi). On top of all that, Paul may get to the finals and avoid the Nets or the 76ers. Milwaukee or Atlanta, no disrespect to either, would probably be one of the easier finals opponents in the last 15 years."
"1. Jaylen Brown   2. Jamal Murray   3. Brandon Ingram   People live Ingram I know but the thing people have to remember is we’ve never seen Murray or Brown as a #1 full time, so everything we’ve seen from them is actually only a portion of their potential. Murray’s ceiling is bubble Murray , 1st team all nba caliber. Brown for those few games Tatum was out was …putting up the same numbers as Tatum. He’s a 27-5-5 type wing . They are all-nba, alpha , lead a team to a title type studs   Ingram? Imo is a notch down. A true #2. I like him but he’s kinda on the flip side as far as opportunities. We’ve seen him as a #1 and we’ve probably seen his max level. He’s good, very good, but not as high a ceilings the other 2…  Oh and since it’s relatively close I’d also factor in his demeanor. I don’t see Brandon ingram as a leader of a team, whereas I see Murray as a good one and Jaylen brown ascending to a GREAT one"
Jamal Murray was drafted from our pick so him
Lock him in a gym with Jamal Murray.
Yeah but this sounds better than Injured Jamal Murray and the Denver Bench Mob
"Even Luka, it far surpasses his regular season production. The reason why one might say you can expect it is because of what he did last year..but that was also against the Clippers who got lit up by Jamal Murray as well"
"True, they could have ended up with worse options buy I'm just thinking how much better off they'd be with Jaylen or Jamal Murray paired with Tatum from the next draft."
"Crazy to think that in that span 76ers hit big on Embiied and missed with Michael Carter/Nerlens Noel in the 2013 draft (could have had CJ Mccolllum, Giannis, Gobert), Elfrid Payton in the 2014 Draft (could have had Lavine or TJ Warren), Jhalil Okafor in the 2015 Draft (could have had Kristaps or Booker), Simmons in 2016 Draft (this may not be fair yet but could have had Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray) and finally Fultz in the 2017 Draft (could have had Tatum or Fox).     Really is not fair to do that, because hindisght is 20:20 and at the time a lot of those picks lined up with conesensus expectations.  I also like to exclude Giannis because over half the nba passed on him but it's crazy to think Philly could trot out a starting 5 of:   PG: McCollum/Murray  SG:Booker  SF:Tatum  PF: Warren  C: Embiid"
"Idk you’re forgetting about guys like LaMelo, Fox, Ben Simmons, Bam, SGA, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, MPJ, and Ja."
I'm not sure who you can trade Simmons for. Donovan Mitchell? Porzingas? Jamal Murray? It's gonna be tough to find an even trade. Sixers are gonna have a tough off season. I only throw Mitchell in there because the Jazz are gonna have an equally tough off season.
"Jaylen brown, taTum, Middleton, lavine, butler, hayward,klay, demar, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal murray, cj mcollum Are all better than him easily. Powell, Anthony Edwards, hield, mikal bridges, etc are arguably better."
Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakam
Philly could have had Jamal Murray
"I don't know how he can comeback full healthy all the sudden......We saw how Lebron,  AD and Harden looked right after their injuries.....now Kawhi has to get back his legs even if it was just a weeks break..... he could risk the next season as well like Jamal Murray...Clippers should be careful coz Suns play a little dirty...."
probably a Luka/Jamal Murray/SGA backcourt
"hello friend, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Jamal Murray?"
Trae Young is in the same tier as Jamal Murray while Luka Doncic is in the same tier as James Harden.
I thought that was Jamal Murray?
Honestly the only one I think that I would like to redo is draft De'Aaron Fox over Josh Jackson. Jamal Murray over Dragan Bender but ideally I think Fox &gt; Murray.
PG: Jamal Murray (2016)  SG: Devin Booker (2015)  SF: Michael Porter Jr (2018)  PF: Jayson Tatum (2017)  C: Joel Embiid (2014)
The only trade they should be making is for a perimeter player who can create their own jumpshot. You don’t want Russ shooting   Philly should see if they can get a package around CJ with Cov or something as well.   Or they should put together a package for Jamal Murray. With Maxey and picks.   That is what they are missing. Someone to create an efficient shot if defenses tighten up and/or double Embiid.
"The thing is this. Luka and Trae are better than their entire draft class and will be better than a bunch of other guys in the league. I'd put them a tier above Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, De'Aaron Fox, maybe Devin Booker (we'll see) for sure. These guys are gonna be the next LeBron/KD/Harden/Steph/Kawhi of our era."
"Simmons was the consensus number one pick though, he had next lebron hype. He was clear cut over Ingram and if they took jaylen brown or jamal murray number one they get laughed out of the room  He had all the tools he just doesn’t give a shit about basketball"
"Kawhi Leonard might edge out Donovan, or AD if it's positionless. Jamal Murray and Jerami Grant are solid 2nd team options as well."
"I don't think it's fair to blame the Nuggets series on him.    They had 0 answer for Jokic on the roster, who ended up as the league's MVP this year and they were playing a healthy(and on fire) Jamal Murray."
How would a Jamal Murray and Ben Simmons swap look like? Doesn’t have to be 1 for 1
Lol there’s a world the sixers have Jamal Murray instead of Ben Simmons  Of course that’s some crazy hindsight but it’s wild how philly basically got the worst case version of simmons. Just a lot of bad luck for philly honestly
"Imagine this sixers team with Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, or Jamal Murray"
There’s not even 500 players in the league lol just how bad do you think Jamal Murray is?
I’ll take Jamal Murray
People were calling Jamal Murray a superstar after last year. Jazz fans think Rudy Gobert is a superstar.
I’ll give you 50 that I think are at least arguable. These aren’t ranked and I don’t necessarily think every one of these guys is better but I can see how others might. Let me know if you see repeated names.  1. Steph 2. Beal 3. Dame 4. Embiid 5. Giannis 6. Luka 7. Lavine 8. Zion 9. Kd 10. Kyrie 11. Tatum 12. Mitchell 13. Jokic 14. Booker 15. Trae 16. Fox 17. Lebron 18. Kawhi 19. Kat 20. Jaylen 21. Harden 22. Ingram 23. Shai 24. Vucevic 25. Pg 26. Davis 27. Westbrook 28. DeMar 29. Butler 30. Siakam 31. Jamal Murray 32. Brogdon 33. Middleton 34. Sabonis 35. Hayward 36. Tobias harris 37. Ja 38. Mpj 39. Bam 40. Jrue 41. Collins 42. Lowry 43. CP3 44. Bogdan 45. Conley 46. Lamelo 47. Capela 48. Ayton 49. Sexton 50. Myles Turner
Canada is the silver favorite.  Even without Jamal Murray.   Entire roster is made up of NBA players.
Paul George has played like Michael Jordan against the Suns the last few games.... We all know he torches the Suns.... Him and Jamal Murray.
"no, I think it has to do with this season being terrible for the health of the players in the league. Just look at the list of top players who have either missed time, were out completely or played through injury this playoffs:  - AD - Kawhi - Harden - Kyrie - Embiid - Jamal Murray - Conley - Mitchell - Jaylen Brown - Kemba  I'm probably missing some guys too, this is just off the top of my head. Not a good look for the league and not good for the quality of play, the teams left in the playoffs might look different if there weren't as many injuries."
I haven't seen anyone talk negatively about Jamal Murray.
"Woulda coulda shoulda...  AD, Kawhi, Deandre Hunter, Jamal Murray, Conley. Literally every team has had to deal with an injury that alters the way they play."
"Nuggets would have been fine if Jamal Murray didn't get injured. You can say that for the Nets and Lakers superstars too, shitty year for injuries"
"&gt;To add on, here are the same stats for the players who just missed the cut:  &amp;#x200B;  |Player|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG|TS%|TPG|\# of Game 7s played|Record in Game 7s| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Jamal Murray|24.3|4.3|4.5|0.5|0.0|52.02%|2.3|4|3-1| |Draymond Green|19.3|11.0|5.3|1.5|1.3|66.79%|3.0|4|2-2| |Blake Griffin|20.0|8.8|5.0|1.0|1.2|56.74%|3.0|5|3-2| |Terry Rozier|10.0|4.7|3.7|1.0|0.7|47.89%|0.7|3|2-1|  Why were these players removed from the list?   Is the sample size too small?"
"Bro stop, imagine Simmons clogging the lane for the usual Jokic midrange, or clogging the lane for a driving Jamal murray, or clogging the lane for..."
Move Ben Simmons to 5th or 6th and where is Jamal Murray?
"To be fair, the Nugs had playoff Jamal Murray.  Playoff Jamal Murray is something else. I missed him this year greatly."
How does Jamal Murray catch strays in a Nets vs Bucks post? Lmao
"&gt;he's just being defended one v one like he's Jamal Murray  Idk why he's not being doubled, but don't hate on Murray lol."
*Jamal Murray video has entered the chat*
"Imagine harden, jamal Murray, MPJ and bol bol on the same team..."
He aint no ~~Jamal Murray~~ Serge Big Cocka
He aint no Jamal Murray
Question is is: A) can MPJ become average on defense and B) can Jamal Murray get to above average on D?  Plenty of guys to trade that teams will want.
"Imagine if the Nuggets replaced Austin Rivers with Jamal Murray, that'd be sick."
"Canada has a sneaky good team. If Jamal Murray was healthy, it would be a contender"
"When have you seen a postseason where almost every team in both conference dealt with injuries to their stars. Lakers- James, AD, Nuggets- Jamal Murray, Clippers- Kawhi, Brooklyn- Harden, Washington- Beal was hurt, Jazz- Spida, Celtics- Jaylen Brown. Sixers- Joel Embiid, Hawks- Trae Young"
"Denver, I actually think they can compete for one within the next 5ish years, and I know injury fucked everybody but with a healthy lineup including of course Jamal Murray I could have seen them at least getting out of the West"
"Jazz seem to always end up the same way in playoffs. They lose to different teams but in a kind of similar way.  Tormented by Harden, bombarded by Jamal Murray of all people and now dismantled by Mann..   The whole regular season they shoot 3s and Gobert locks up the paint, but come playoffs, the opponent shoots more 3s and Gobert is a headless chicken."
Nuggets were missing Jamal Murray  The Jazz… definitely overhyped
"I think the trade would feel a lot different if Jamal Murray hadn’t gotten hurt.  Had the Nuggets known Murray would get hurt, they wouldn’t have made the trade."
Jamal Murray?
Jamal Murray &gt; Donavan Mitchell   Don't @ me
Does anyone else remember when Simmons for Jamal Murray and stuff was a popular trade idea (maybe just people who follow the Nuggets noticed it)?
Jamal Murray and Reggie Jackson
Jamal Murray and Damian Lillard
"This 100%.  He goes by 'gut' feelings and also just likes to play the 'best' guys.  Last year's playoff, Zubac's +/- numbers were positive while Harrell was mostly negative but Doc was saying something like you can't base your lineups on numbers and that there are other factors that need to be taken into account.  Then he proceeded to just play Harrell over Zubac all series and let jamal murray smoke the paint all day.  Doc is overrated.  He plays favorites with his players and also doesn't develop rookies or younger players."
i don’t think the list is unreasonable but personally i am not sold on jamal murray yet.
Build around Jamal Murray?
"Ok but you see the difference between Donte Divincenzo and Jaylen Brown, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell right?"
I'd swap Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray for Bam and MPJ
"Even if it goes the absolute worst, that's still 3 picks. We drafted Jamal Murray, Juancho Hernangomez and Malik Beasley with almost those exact picks"
"I think there's been eras of the NBA where Simmons would contribute more to a winning team than Jamal Murray. Big body, great defender, etc.  But in today's NBA, I think it's practically a 100% Murray over Simmons. I feel like more than ever, this is a shooter's and ballhandler's league."
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, maybe another player, and picks.   Could be beneficial for both teams if Luka does want to leave"
"Brown, BI, and Jamal Murray are better than him."
The idea of Simmons is better than the idea of Jamal Murray but no doubt the majority of teams would take Murray over Simmons for winning purposes
I'd rank Jamal Murray over him too
"BI, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Sabonis, Siakam  He's not better than 3 of those guys"
Jesus 2016 sucked  Edit: Jamal Murray is better than all but Brown
"Sure maybe it helps a guy like Jamal Murray, who maybe otherwise wouldn't be making the same amount of money. But Cuban specifically gave the example of Lebron, who would be making *at least* double the max if it didn't exist and he just wanted to take in the highest salary."
"False equivalency mixed with modern knee jerk overreactions   -Every title team doesn’t win it overnight. There’s this little thing called “adversity”. Yet nowadays if a team doesn’t win in 2 years it’s ‘blow it up’  -If Jamal Murray is healthy they would be favorites over Utah and Phoenix (I had Denver winning it all after the Gordon trade)  -If harden doesn’t get better, and if Kyrie is confirmed out, the Bucks STILL may be top favorites to win it all! Like relax a little bit. Forget the Durant performance, they also got 27 on 7 3s from Jeff green! It isn’t crazy at all that they would beat BK. And if so, I think they would be favored vs every single team remaining (with Kawhi likely done)  -Sixers just have a Ben Simmons problem. Need him gone. If Embiid stays healthy, they’ll be fine"
"Murray who? Jamal Murray denver hangs up and Dejounte is laughable. And sure, I'm biased, but I don't see DLO or Brogdon being better options/players than CJ McCollum.   Lavine would be a good one though. Not sure how Chicago fans would feel about that, but if I'm Philly I'd trade Ben for Lavine."
I was down voted into oblivion on multiple occasions for saying Jamal Murray &gt; Ben Simmons. And not just by Philly fans
"He's going for the honorary Canadian thing though.  He did this extremely cheesy 30 minute holiday special sponsored by a national grocery chain here, it had Jamal Murray on it and a few other Canadiana icon types.  There's 9 major sports teams in the entire country, he coached the only title from 1994-onward.  So he probably figures he can milk that relentlessly for at least a decade, and he is RIGHT."
&gt; Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray  Lol
Ok we get it Jokic isn’t playing in the olympics and your not happy about it. It’s not like my team Canada is missing their two best players in Shai and Jamal Murray. Or all those times Andrew Wiggins and 2 time mvp Steve Nash failed to show up. These circumstances has not only diminished our chances of winning the qualifier but also our chances of obtaining a medal.  In fact I’m kind of happy that Jokic isn’t participating because it gives Canada just that much higher of a chance to still obtain a medal.
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
&gt; Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray straight up.  LMAO  Markus Howard for Seth Curry straight up.
"Why Sabonis instead of Murray, I feel like Jamal is much better ?"
"I’m on record saying I wanted Nate McMillan as 76ers coach when Indiana let him go (which I have no idea why they did??)   We need a closer, like a real one. Embid much like Shaq is not a closer by himself.   Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray straight up."
"There are 5 all-star players in that draft (Simmons, Ingram, Brown, Sabonis, Siakam), plus Jamal Murray, who's almost certainly a future all-star. Those six are without question the first 6 picks. There's absolutely no way Simmons goes later than 6th."
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It’s one of the better drafts we’ve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"7th, behind Ingram, Jalen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Dejounte Murray, and Siakam, only one that debatable is Dejounte imo"
Is jamal Murray kawhi Leonard? Didn’t know we had another set of twins in the league! Nice
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
"Of that list, the only players that being injured is surprising is Lebron, Harden and Kawhi. Every other player has had a history of being injured. Jamal Murray was playing through injury during the playoffs so his seem inevitable if he didn’t rest"
"They were the 1 and 2 seed before Jamal Murray went down and the Clippers were healthy all year, too. The Nuggets were actually the 5th seed when Murray went down then they finished the season 9-1. The Sixers and Bucks have been healthy and the Suns had a better regular season record than them as well.      You can make a case for the Nets and Lakers or even the Clippers but you just don't know"
If Jamal Murray wanted to sit up in the box I would have no problem with him doing so and I doubt the team would either. It’s his own personal choice to sit with the team.
Jamal Murray was on the bench with crutches
Jamal Murray
"Murray is worth it, he has better *career* playoff numbers than Booker has this run. Jamal is really fuckin good"
"Yeah, we can say “injuries affect the title every year” but it’s never affected it this much.  Just off the top of my head  LeBron - high ankle sprain  AD - groin strain  Harden - hamstring strain  Kyrie - high ankle sprain   Kawhi - possible ACL tear  Embiid - torn meniscus  Jamal Murray - ACL tear"
"So we can both agree 1 game of Conley and Patrick Beverley doesn’t really compare to Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard, right?"
"Mike Conley missed a singular game against the Warriors, and it was only game 1 my guy. Jrue Holiday played all but game 2. These injuries do not compare to Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray."
"Warriors had Jrue, Pat Bev, Conley for like a game where he played with a fractured face, and Kyrie  Suns had AD/injured Bron, no Jamal Murray, and no Kawhi Leonard.  Maybe Warriors faced more players out, but none of the guys missing in the Warriors runs compares to AD/Kawhi"
"This year is an outlier though. 8 all stars have missed at least one playoff game, which has never happened before in NBA history. That doesn't include Jamal Murray, who is pretty close!  And besides all stars and top level star talent, this is the most injury filled year for role players in recent memory as well. Rotation players have missed 108 games in the first two rounds, 85 was the previous high - for an entire playoff!  This year is an outlier from an injury standpoint, also an outlier with cramming 72 games into a Christmas start!  No such thing as an asterisk championship but let's not act like this is normal, this is a historic injury filled playoff and fans/teams are deservedly frustrated by it."
"As a Clipper fan, I'm cool with this. We've exorcised a demon in historical fashion winning back to back 0-2 series. Team showed heart and Ty Lue showed wit, something you can't say about our past teams. If we can come back from 3-1, man just give us the chip.  My only problem with the playoffs now is that the Suns got through Lakers without AD, Nuggets without Jamal Murray and if they get past the Clippers, then not having to face Kawhi. I guess it's poetic justice for Chris Paul who has always been injured in the playoffs, but I guess it's better to be in the right place at the right time than have to meet at the summit and see who the better team is. The Suns aren't the best team the West has to offer and really the Hawks out of the east? Bucks deserve their chance, but the Hawks in Trae Young's first playoff appearance? All teams that didn't have to deal with the bubble or an extended run in there in the Buck's case. Not the best of what the NBA has to offer."
And he's 22! People tall a lot about Luka and Trae being so young but this man is going toe to toe with some big names and winning many of the matchups. Looking forward to following his career.   I'm playing a suns career in 2k and he's become my best player by far. Ahead of booker and Jamal Murray (traded cp3 bc vets don't really make a difference in the game). I don't even try to get him the ball and he scores at least 20 and grabs minimum 12 boards a game.
"He's like Jamal Murray in my opinion. He is a SG who's fast and has handles good enough to play point, but he isn't really gonna be the center of the offense from either guard position (think how Murray plays more as another SG and secondary ball handler to Jokic)"
"Fair or not, if PHX does win this, many will place an asterisk by it. Again, not even saying it's fair. But, it's reality.  Down 1-2 in the first round. AD gets hurt. Series over.  Sweep the second round, but the Nuggets were missing Jamal Murray. We're talking about Denver's second-best player and a guy coming off a season where he showed he can perform big in the postseason.   Third round. No Kawhi. They are up 3-1, but take away PHX's free timeout in Game 2 and the Clips' all-time awful shooting in Game 4 and the series is a bit different.   I won't personally hold anything against the Suns if they win it all. You still gotta play and win. But, I see the point of those who may make the argument and, well, games like last night do make you wonder how the series would be different with Kawhi."
"That whole ""every run has some luck"" thing starts to run thin when literally every team they face is injured. Especially when it's the top players injured. Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Will Barton, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris. Probably missing more, but that's all I can remember"
You guys are good but luck has been on your side as well.   Lebron/AD injured Jamal Murray injured Kawhi injured  And then you have an injured hawks team or a team coached by Bud waiting for you in the finals
"I remember watching that live and thinking “Hold up, since when is Jamal Murray one of the best players in the league. Did I miss him being this good always or something"
I feel like Reggie is one of those guys that just doesn't do much during the regular season but turns it up a notch during the playoffs. Like Jamal Murray
"They’ve also been missing the player with more MVP votes than Kawhi, Anthony Davis and Jamal  Murray combined for half their run and are going against experienced teams that should be able to handle things on their own. If one player missing is enough to cripple your team then your team didn’t put enough effort into player development. The super team strategy of the Lakers, Nets and Clippers is a potent but incredibly fragile one. When you sacrifice stability to go for a glass cannon run with all your paychecks in one small handful of players, you are risking a flameout just like we’ve seen here. Teams shouldn’t be able to just buy their way to a finals, and only rewarding teams for winning against healthy players ignores the fact that developing a deep roster like Phoenix has done and developing team chemistry and a next man up approach is part of the process of building a championship roster. The Lakers, Clippers and Nets couldn’t be bothered with such things and they paid the price for it. Don’t blame Phoenix for playing the right way and winning games because they set themselves up properly to do so, just because some other teams didn’t."
Lebron-Anthony Davis  Jamal Murray  Kawhi Leonard-Serge Ibaka  There’s the example. It’s not his fault obviously but it’s a pretty factual statement that CP3 has benefitted from injuries this year.
No disrespect to the Suns but they have the easiest path to the championship ever.    - LeBron wasn’t 100% - AD got hurt  - Jamal Murray was out - Jokic got ejected - Kawhi is out  - Morris knee bust - CP3 faked COVID for rest  Mickey Mouse!
Can't put Devin Booger anywhere close to the level or Jamal Murray and D Mitch with the way he's been playing this series.
Jamal “dick Grayson” Murray
People shit on the nuggets for playing worse without Jamal Murray but Booker shitting the bed because he has to wear a mask is excusable lol
You could have swapped out Jamal Murray for Michael Jordan on offense last postseason and I don’t think I would’ve noticed
"Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard"
"Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis"
Jamal Murray was a god last playoffs.  Dude entered the zone. He was in the Basketball Avatar State.
Jamal Murray was box office in the bubble
Not true I already knew about Jamal Murray from his playing days
"I’d probably go Beal, booker, Jamal Murray, Lavine, mitchel"
Is Jamal Murray even an all star? Ayton also
westbrook &gt; jamal murray
Steph   Harden   Kyrie   Luka  Trae   Dame  Ja  Simmons  Jrue  Lowry   Lamelo  Conley  Fox  CP3  Jamal Murray    There you go
Jamal Murray
"This is legit the biggest asterisk year ever though. No playoffs ever have had this crazy an amount of injuries. Harden, Kawhi, Kyrie, AD, LeBron, CP3 partially, Jaylen Brown, Embiid (maybe), Jamal Murray, and all the starters who are out."
What’d Jamal Murray do to the Lakers lol… they smacked him 4-1
Jamal Murray did it better
"Jamal Murray had ACL surgery and was on the bench, couldn't even walk. I don't get why there's still a collective out there that believes he requires surgery. From what we've seen of be required surgery, he wouldn't be moving as freely and does t appear in any pain."
"Yeah,  shit happens.   Nugs might be through if Jamal Murray played. Can't asterix a season on injuries. It's silly and insulting to the players who are going out there and putting it all on the line."
is there any way to make this sub 18+? maybe put the jamal murray IG story on the sidebar or something
"Nah I knew that if it was an actual respectable pistons legend, this post would have like 300 upvotes. when I saw it had 3k, I immediately assumed he was gonna be pulling a jamal murray or some shit lmao"
Depends if Jamal Murray healthy
"No, he said ""his pubes looked like Jamal Murray"" not ""his facial hair looks like Jamal Murray’s pubes"". That's why u/fourpinz8 's correction was necessary."
Jamal Murray 2021 - never known what could have been!
"KD GOAT twitter, Jamal Murray GOAT IG"
"Jamal and Dejounte Murray!  Then like Darius Bazley, Terrance Davis, Taurean Prince, and WCS. Qickley, Maxey, and Patrick Williams as rookies.  So... you can go real young + Kawhi, or very Murray + Kawhi."
Jamal Murray was doing the absolute most on the sideline. Cringe worthy level.
"Revisionist history. As a general rule, if you’re a top ten player, you have claim to superstar status. Just look at the All-NBA teams for reference. After Jimmy’s run last year and his performance in the Finals where he got 40 point triple doubles, people were debating his status. He was absolutely being considered for top ten player. The only reason people even gave the Heat a shot this year was because of Butler. So yeah, people were talking about it, as they should have been cuz it was an amazing performance. But my point is to slow the fuck down on that kind of talk.   Players can have great playoff runs. Jamal Murray also had one. That can’t be the sole determining factor for a superstar."
"Lebron KD Steph Kawhi  Harden Giannis Luka   Dame Embiid Jokic AD  I feel like those guys are definitely ahead of Trae at this point. The next few are where he slips in now, IMO (Beal Booker Mitchell CP3 Tatum Jimmy Klay Kyrie Gobert PG13, prob missing someone)  But he could totally slip into that top 11 or so if he sustains this level of play for a consistent enough time. Don’t forget that Jamal Murray had a very similar level of play last playoffs then regressed somewhat to his more typical play in the next Reg season. Murray was legit in peoples top 10s after last playoffs but now he’s lucky to be in peoples top 20s."
"Confidence is fine, this dude is on his Kenny Powers.  &gt;people act like we’re the Jazz or whoever the clips faced.  He means the 1st seed Jazz with Donovan Mitchell injured, and the Nuggets with Jamal Murray out, while they're playing against the Clippers without Kawhi."
"Jokic has been terriffic in the playoffs for three straight years, putting up numbers much closer to this MVP season than those regular seasons  2019: 25.1/13.0/8.4 on 51/39/85  2020: 24.4/9.8/5.7 on 52/43/84 - injured Will Barton/Gary Harris - defeated Championship Contender Clippers  2021: 29.8/11.6/5.0 on 51/38/84 - injured Jamal Murray/Will Barton  I think that he's been near (not at) this level for longer, but just has been the type to really crank it up in the postseason."
"Lmao oh no you lost cam Payne? Wow that’s so impactful compared to fucking Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray and Anthony Davis, all of whom have better playoff track records than Booker lol"
"Send him here, and when one of him or Jamal has a turned ankle we can have Jamal Murray Sex Tape"
"Jamal Murray played all five games last years and they lost 4-1, so…"
"There’s literally nothing wrong with it, as usual with Kawhi. It just goes against what you typically expect.   It’s just funny when they talk up Kawhi’s influence as a coach on the sidelines or whatever, when it’s clear that he’d just much rather leave the coaching to the, you know, *coaches* and just take the unexpected free time to be with his family.  We’ve seen guys like Jamal Murray pacing the sidelines and being the first guy to high-five everyone in timeouts and it’s just more to do with his personality than anything else, it isn’t expected from every player"
"Rockets are better than a Team Canada that could run RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, etc etc. Really dude?"
"What does COVID protocol have to do with anything? Injured players are allowed to sit on the bench, they’ve been doing it all season. If anything, I’d think sitting in a suite then joining the team would cause more concern from a COVID point of view.  As for the injury itself, I’m not saying he gotta be jumping up and down like a cheerleader and putting unnecessary strain on his knee but lots of players had lower body injuries that kept them out these playoffs and they still managed to be on the bench supporting their team in any way they can. If he needs treatment that’s one thing but Conley, AD, Danny Green, DeAndre Hunter, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray etc etc all were on the bench"
Jamal Murray is absolutely better than sabonis. He’s not that different from Donovan Mitchell and Booker. Sabonis is just Dollar Store Jokic
Jamal Murray got the max putting up worse numbers on worse efficiency and not even playing that well in the playoffs yet.
"Top 3 in west or east easily, jokic was pretty much 3rd seed after barely even having Jamal Murray play, imagine with Luka.   In the playoffs, I'd say conference finals on east and west is likely, none of these players have won a ring, the closest being Dragic last season so overall Finals experience is important too so that might be where the team doesn't get the job done."
Sure bud. Kawhi/AD/Jamal Murray are the same level as House/Barton (who also missed games vs the Suns btw)/Bam. Suns fans are so fucking insecure
"Sure, but injured players are usually on the bench. Ibaka has been there all playoffs, Jamal Murray was on the bench with his squad of injured Nuggets etc..    Meanwhile Kawhi isn't even ruled out for the playoffs and he's not even on the bench?"
Yes.  There was a Jamal Murray in the 1920's who murdered thousands of children over a five year span.  Why anyone would name their child that is ridiculous to me.
"I mean I think the reality is you guys just don’t have the pieces to get a true high level #2 (ala Jamal Murray, Middleton type guy) as long as Ben’s value is as low as it is right now. So CJ is about as good as it gets. He can also be really good."
jamal murray has pubes on his _____
Can we put Jamal Murray in the starting 5 somehow
"&gt;Mavs took Luka Doncic over this guy   Is this bait??  Or copy pasta..    You know how insane Doncic is, and how even more insane he could be with a better team. He has been the best player on the floor in every Playoff game he has played so far, and still so young. AND HE'S IN THE WEST   &gt;   Trae Young has been GREAT, but even Jamal Murray and Jimmy Butler did crazier Historic shit just last season in the Playoffs..     This Atlanta team is playing such insane defense all around. Defense is what makes the difference.   No one talks about that   &gt;  This subreddit becomes an absolute cesspool of incel shit show during the Playoffs.  Brain dead recency bias"
"You know that guy is joking right??  It's classic bait. Copy Pasta  &gt;   Luka is better.. with way more potential. He was the best player on the floor in the last two Playoffs.   His team failed him, but that's just the unfair game and unfair life.   It happens   &gt;   Trae is insane too. But he might not look like this again next year.. So hold the brakes.  Did you forget what Jamal Murray did last year in the playoffs? Or Jimmy Butler??   HISTORIC shit.   Even greater than anything Trae Young did or doing in this Playoffs run  &gt;   We'll see who does what in their careers, long term. The end matters the most. Unreal consistency is the difference between just a few and the rest   It'd be premature and ignorant to even talk about all that right now. Especially when you just have to be biased"
I didn’t say Trae we were talking about Murray and Harden has definitely had better playoff runs than Jamal did last year
"The whole post is a reaction to a lot of fans I see here always saying ""what if"" and giving excuses for why their team is out of the playoffs as we speak, and the entire idea about championship teams having *asterisks beside their names just because of injuries to the opposing team.   The Championship should be awarded to the teams that react and prepare for any and all eventualities that may happen to your team during the course of the season. My point is that it's not totally on luck and that there are some teams that handle it better than others...case in point is Denver. After Jamal Murray went down, they strung together a 13-3 record leading into the playoffs and were playing their best basketball after the Aaron Gordon trade. In short, they controlled what they could control DESPITE injuries to their best guard.   I believe prevention is also a huge part of the equation and also planning JUST IN CASE injuries happen because they will at some point in time. If you can make your team play through injuries by having BETTER PLAYERS ,which is a function of an outstanding coaching and player development staff, then you are better equipped to handle injuries when they occur. The point is, the organizations that do their homework and preparation will have a better opportunity to control their own destiny and help their teams win despite all the bad luck that may happen along the way, which may include injuries to their best players."
This is reminiscent of Jamal Murray last season in the bubble. People were saying with their chests out that he was a top 5 guard.
"Like on God, at the very least he gotta pull a Jamal Murray for this to even be half valid as an excuse."
"Ibaka is a waste of salary for this team. Give me Taj Gibson for the vet min $2.4MM.   I'm gonna get wild with it and move it and move Jamal Murray to the 2 and add De'Aron Fox as a second max player.   Replacing Anunoby with Crowder for the salary savings.  Also, using 2021 salary figures.  PG: De'Aron Fox ($28MM)  SG: Jamal Murray ($29.5MM)  SF: Luguentz Dort($1.8MM)  PF: Jae Crowder($9.7MM)  C: Clint Capela($17MM)  G3:TJ McConnell ($3.5MM)  G4: Alec Burks ($6MM)  Wing3: Dorian Finney-Smith ($4MM)  Wing4: Nic Batum ($2.6MM)  C2: Taj Gibson($2.4MM)"
Jamal Murray is also only 24 and generally plays out of his mind in the playoffs
"My hot take is that you could probably expand this list to 10-15 young stars who could do something similar if they were on the right team. Not necessarily as good, but comparable.  Players are getting more and more skilled offensively while changes to the game make it easier and easier.    Tatum, Shai, Lavine, Zion, KAT, Ja(how quick we forget) and Jamal Murray.  Maybe Sexton?"
Jamal Murray too
I agree with everything you said but I want to add Jamal Murray into your list even though he's injured this postseason.
"30 points and 11 rebounds ain't hurt imo. Better than playing against ADisney, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi lol."
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they’d take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De’Aaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant"
"If he does it again next year, absolutely. Jamal Murray was sensational in the playoffs last year and didn’t get that treatment, but if trae can replicate what he’s doing I will absolutely call him one of the best players in the league. I think it takes execution and replication."
"No, it takes more than a great season personally for me. Jamal Murray would be a superstar based on making it to the WCF last year with how well he was playing."
Without Kawhi. Denver without Jamal Murray and the Lakers without AD for game 5 and 6.
Top 10 probably.  You could say same for Jamal Murray last year.  Have to see what he’s going to do for a couple more years but he is definitely the Bitcoin of the nba right now.
Bubble Jamal Murray is up there
"Bruh, we didn’t tell the Lakers to play AD until his fucking groin tore  And we took advantage of the fact that other than Lebron, the Lakers have no playmakers  We still went up against the Nuggets and the league’s MVP and beat them in 4 games  Again, Jamal Murray being injured wasn’t our fault   Now against the Clippers, Kawhi is out (again, not our fault, and injuries will always happen in the playoffs)  But even with CP3 out, we asked Cam Payne to go up against Reggie Jackson, and he still competed at a high level and carried us to those wins    If you actually cared about basketball, you wouldn’t be bitching about what the suns are doing, or how they got here  You should realize that our entire team is build to step up and play no matter what"
"If you give Luka Jamal Murray, Jerami Grant, MPJ, Millsap, Barton, Morris etc., I think he makes the WCF easy."
Without AD. Without Jamal Murray. Without Kawhi Leonard.
"How are they bad excuses when it's an actual fact? Lol, come on man. And that is utter bullshit. I believed the Lakers would win IF THEY WERE HEALTHY. I said that the entire final quarter of the season, but guess what, they weren't and it cost them. The same way Jamal Murray blowing out his knee cost Denver, Conley and Mitchell cost Utah, Kyrie and Harden cost Brooklyn and so on and so forth.   Part of winning a title is luck, not only with catching lightning at the right time, but health. This year has highlighted that moreso than others. Doesn't mean that what you accomplish means any less, it's just the reality of it."
"The Nuggets could definitely offer something better the Sixers. MPJ, Bol Bol, and picks or Jamal Murray and picks are way better than what the Sixers could give."
"Ignoring injured players, sure, but your phrasing makes it seem like you forget that the Nuggets and the Clippers are missing some of their superstars too (i.e a 4th/5th string guard [Dozier] being 1st string due to injuries, Jamal Murray out due to ACL, and Kawhi Leonard out currently against Suns)  If Kawhi doesn't return, then yes, I would agree that Lakers would be the best team they've faced, but you can't ignore that the Nuggets and Clippers have more critical injuries than what the Lakers dealt with"
So are you saying Chris Paul injury equals the absence of AD. You have the iq of a brain dead monkey. You are saying that the Lakers losing AD is equal to the suns losing Chris Paul. Idiot take.   You are implying that the Nuggets are better without Jamal Murray. Idiot take.   You are implying the absence of Chris Paul is equal to the absence of a top five player in Kawhi. The guy who literally single handedly killed the Mavs. Idiot take.   Do you even watch basketball?  Its not underachieving if the team gets injured. I don't blame Brooklyn at all for losing. I don't blame the Warriors for losing in 2019. I brag about winning the championship. But I would never be so dumb to think we curbstomped Miami. Because even though we did. They were injured.
"Hard to tell.   Going by last years playoffs, Jamal Murray should have been an All Star, but he regressed in the regular season"
Playoff Rondo and Playoff Jamal Murray
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
"They've played the best and most consistent against teams missing AD, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard but somehow everyone ignores that aspect unless they're using it to dunk on the Bucks."
"So if all you need is one of your parents to be Nigerian...   I guess this means,  Victor Oladipo  Bam Adebayo   turned them down?  Nigeria's got one of those teams to watch, in that they got a lot of NBA talent so feasibly they match up well with the USA, the other team I reckon to watch being Canada (no Jamal Murray though.)  Men's Olympic BBall should actually be amazing this time."
Imagine Jaylen Brown or  Jamal Murray next to Embiid
Using SI's rankings which has Ben at 21:  PG Jamal Murray  SG Donovan Mitchell  SF Khris Middleton  PF Ben Simmons  C Zion Williamson  **Bench**  Russell Westbrook  Kyle Lowry  Trae Young  Jaylen Brown  Brandon Ingram  Nikola Vucevic  Kristaps Porzingis
"Trae Young 5yr / $207 Biased but 100% worth   Michael Porter Jr. 5yr / $172M Hot take: Will never sign another big deal, but not due to basketball reasons Just from a basketball standpoint I think it's an overpay. He was stupid hot last year and won't keep up the %  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 5yr / $172 Probably worth, right now an okayish max, if he improves definitely worth  Jamal Murray 5yr / 170M Not worth, he can give you 50 on some nights but on average is not worth the max imo  De'Aaron Fox 5yr / $163M Will be worth it  Terry Rozier 4yr / $97M Clowned the Hornets for signing him to 3/57, turned out he's good. Will be the better guard out if him and Lamelo for the majority of the contract and worth it  Aaron Gordon 4yr / $92M Imo slight overpay, but still an okay contract If he improves a bit, especially scoring wise he'll live up to it"
Fav: Jamal Murray  Least: Fred vanvleet... I hate his stupid hair and beard so much plus he fucking cooks me in 2k
Philly can get no one else except maybe John Wall. Simmons can’t produce on offense so they can’t get a Mcollum type player. He’s worth a fringe all star like himself. He’s not a Jamal Murray or CJ type player. He’s not even on the same level as Draymond
Definitely not Jamal Murray. He only averaged 21 PPG in his best season before his career-altering ACL injury. 21 PPG for a max player with trash defense is hilariously overpaying it.
It’s a ridiculous take in my opinion. If Jamal Murray averaged 36/10 would they give the credit to Jokic?   Or does KD get the credit for Hardens play?
"Don’t forget an injured Nuggets and Clippers. And ALMOST Bucks injury to Giannis.   But they’ll let you know that it was 100% fair and square. If LeBron, AD, Jamal Murray, Kawhi were all 100% healthy and played, Suns still beat them"
Jamal Murray can return healthy
Jamal Murray their second best player will miss a huge chunk of the season
"Lol I feel like sponsors might not wanna be associated with fouls. Like ""Beverly just called for a State Farm flagrant 2 on Jamal Murray. Like a good neighbor State Farm is th-oh looks like Murray isn't getting up."""
"I’m not here to say we aren’t the worst, but I would like to throw in consideration for the 2016 and 2017 drafts for the Phoenix Suns. With two top 10 picks in 2016, they drafted Dragan Bender at 4 (in front of Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield) and Marquese Chriss at 8 (in front of Sabonis). In 2017, with the 4th pick, they selected Josh Jackson in front of DeAaron Fox,  Bam Adebayo and many other players that have been more notable. Those Kings picks in 2011 and 2012 are still worse IMO because the talent in each drafted was better than 2016, though blowing two top 10 picks in one draft and then missing on Jackson in 2017 is a very rough go."
Play-in yeah. Especially with over half a year of Jamal Murray.
"It's gotta be within the next year though. They can't wait around more than a year with this or you risk Embiid wanting to leave and Ben's value being even less having not played for over a year. Harden, KD, Lebron, AD, Tatum, Steph, Luka, Giannis, Kawhi, PG, Mitchell, Middleton, Booker, Jokic, Butler, Trae, KAT, CP3, Irving, Jaylen Brown, and Jamal Murray all seem to be off the table. Beal seems pretty adamant on staying and Lillard maybe next offseason is on the table so maybe a possibility. Fox isn't getting traded with 4 years left on his deal. Lavine if Chicago is terrible at the deadline maybe but that seems unlikely and even then he'll be a free agent. Just feels like they are putting all their eggs in the Lillard basket and if that doesn't work out they might walk away with the same thing they would have now with a year of Embiid wasted."
"For me it was weird. Jamal Murray first showed up at our Grade 3 basketball tryouts and within 8-10 minutes he was moved to play on the Grade 5 team. Later on we played against him in highschool in grade 9 (freshman) and he whooped our ass so bad he had 30 by halftime. He got moved to the senior team promptly for the rest of the season. Couple years later we play against him AND Thon Maker. We got absolutely brutalized in the first quarter but somehow only ended up losing only by 10 or so if memory serves correct. Been to a couple camps that Jamal has, honestly one of the kindest and more sincere people out there and big beacon of hope for young basketball players in our area."
"Yeah. Even if Jamal Murray plays this season, he probably won't be his normal self. The heat are a good team but not real contenders. The suns are pretty good but if CP3 declines, they'll be worse than last year and he's pretty old, it could happen at any time for him."
"Atlanta has more Depth but Denver has a big 3, so they have more star power, which is why they’re in similar positions  We gotta remember Denver was 8-0 when Aaron Gordon came mid season and Jamal Murray was still playing, it’s a short sample size but that goes to show you the potential their core has.  They had 3 guys averaging 20 last year while Atalanta had more guys averaging 10+"
"I played against Cory Joseph in the provincial championship tournament in Ontario in 2008. I scored 2 points on him. The one thing I remember was just how quick he was. He could score at will (obvs) but he took it easy on me because his brother (Devoe Joseph) was the star of the team at the time.  Fast forward about 10 years, the company I work for was shooting a basketball Canada commercial which Jamal Murray and Cory Joseph starred in. I got to talk to Cory for a short bit and mentioned how I scored 2 points on him back in the day and he quipped back ""that was 2 more points than you should have had"". We both laughed, I got my picture and that was that."
"Their most important player is 36 years old with an extensive injury history. They just enjoyed a playoff run where they dodged Anthony Davis for most of round 1, Jamal Murray in round 2, and Kawhi Leonard in the WCF. And all their young players are about to become very expensive."
"I didn't specifically say he was worth a Jamal Murray now. But in 2018, you would've 100% traded Jamal Murray for Ben Simmons"
Of course lol. Jamal Murray would’ve been a much better fit (in hindsight obv) than Ben
"In his first season as a starter, MPJ just put up the second most efficient 19ppg scoring season in all of NBA history after Wilt. If that isn't the kind of sign you need then I don't know what is. Nuggets fans are very happy right now, and MPJ is broadly expected to make the leap into stardom this season, especially with Jamal Murray out for most of the year."
"Jamal on most teams, unfortunately including the sixers and denver, but there are more than a few exceptions.  Along with most bad teams I'd take Ben for the Clippers and Nets.    Biggest thing is you are pretending Murray is fully healthy when he's about as far from it as you could be.  I also think that while the playoffs are a more important test they are also a smaller sample so I wouldn't ignore regular season performance. Maybe, just spitballing here, a guy could go ice cold from the line at the wrong time and it'd cost him his confidence as a driver for a short time."
"Ben Simmons is clearly better than Jamal Murray, in the playoffs AND the regular season dude"
"Jamal Murray is clearly better than Ben Simmons, in the playoffs AND the regular season dude"
"&gt;Simmons is as good as Murray  He's not  &gt;overly simplistic to call Ben a three-time all-star, all-nba, runner-up for DPOY and Jamal none of that  Accolades and all-stars mean nothing if he can't perform when it matters most. Jamal is all-star caliber but has dealt with a loaded West. And I really could not give a shit if he ever makes an all-star game because he has shown he can perform when we need him."
"Ben is acting like a baby, but he's shooting himself in the foot if he wants to leave.    The report from yesterday was that the Nuggets responded to rumors of a Simmons/Murray swap by saying, ""I don't know if that's more insulting to us or Jamal"".  I get that fans are sour on Ben league-wide and his performance in the playoffs was poor but Simmons is as good as Murray and, more importantly, isn't going to miss all of next season with an ACL tear.   It's overly simplistic to call Ben a three-time all-star, all-nba, runner-up for DPOY and Jamal none of that, but accolades are given for a reason.   We've reached a place where teams are just dunking on Ben to build up their own players because Simmons has made himself toxic and no GM could bring him on board for reasonably fair value without the fans revolting.    Simmons and Embiid have been very successful when they've shared the floor.  Buddy-Bagley is an idiotic deal for the sixers, as is Lonnie Walker-Luka Samatic.  We've reached crazy-town and while Simmons has been the conductor NBA fandom got their tickets and rode to the last stop.  Ben didn't want to get fouled because he shot 30% from the line in last year's playoffs but that's a huge outlier for him.  He needs to come back to the sixers, I hope they don't let irrationality reign and trade him for OG Anunoby and Dragic."

Jamal Murray is Naruto
&gt; Pain just attacked the Leaf Village and Jamal Murray is Naruto.  I had to look this up. I'm so old.
"I would pay good money to see Jamal Murray dunk on Naruto, figuratively and literally."
People are so dramatic tweeting about the NBA like Pain just attacked the Leaf Village and Jamal Murray is Naruto.
"96 bulls vs kd warriors vs nuggets with a healthy jamal murray. who knows who would win, it’s going 7 regardless"
"Melo demanding a trade instead of just leaving a year later directly got them Jamal Murray. I know it probably still stings, but the way Melo did it helped the Nuggets a ton."
Jamal murray will get picked on just like Steph did. They have Aaron gordon and at most 1 more good defender in there best lineups. It’s concerning.
MPJ in games without Jamal Murray last season:  23 PPG  7 REB  1 BLK  55/45/86 shooting splits
"I mean he's def right. Obv all those four are, even if they're not all at their peak right now, 4 legendary pg's still going hard every season. Only real snub is Kyrie, but the other 3 people keep mentioning (Trae Young, luka and fox) are all around his age and his direct competitors/his generation he's obviously not gonna think or say any of them are better than him. And harden as a lot of others mention definitely is a pg (he's played there all of last season and many times with Houston played either a combo guard or straight-up point guard) but whenever he comes to mind it's as a shooting guard, not many ever think of him as one of the best pg's or as a pg at all.  edit: shit i forgot jamal murray and Jrue as also being up there"
Naah. Dame is not the GOAT player in his franchise either. Bill Walton and Clyde Drexler are better than him. Beal is not that good. Neither is Westbrook. I would gladly have Jamal Murray on my squad rather than Bradley Beal or Westbrook.
i think it's jamal murray
"""I'm fully vaccinated"" - Nikola Jokic  ""I'm fully vaccinated"" - Jamal Murray  ""I'm fully vaccinated"" - JaMychal Green  ""I'm fully vaccinated"" - Tim Connelly  ""It's a private matter"" - Michael Porter Jr."
"Lots of guys on max contracts that aren't #1 guys though (Jamal Murray, etc.) If they're still tanking to try to get a #1 or #2 overall then they think there's someone better."
Jamal Murray on regular basis
"I think that list was kind of bad. I think Jamal Murray probably should not be in the top 10, probably not Ja Morant either. Michael Porter Jr. and Fox should probably take their places.  I think Fox is better than Morant he is just stuck under a sub par coach, poorly constructed roster. Murray is often injured and I would say Michael Porter Jr. is a more important piece of that same team."
"Top 5 PGs in the NBA at the moment:   1. Steph  2. Luka  3. Dame  4. Kyrie 5. CP3  6. Trae   Jas got the right attitude, but he is probably the 7th best PG in the NBA at best, and even that is a big stretch, since weve also got other people like Russ, SImmons, Jamal Murray, Shae, and DeAron Fox"
"See my comment above. I think the reality is they are very comparable as young players. My initial comment was snark aimed at the guy calling Murray overrated.  I do think Ingram is overrated on this sub. He's probably underrated by certain analysts who like to gloss over the fact that progress isn't linear.  That said, Murray is 100% underrated by pretty much everyone. That Simmons / Nuggets thread is the first time I've really seen people giving him his due here without the cloud of snark related to a bubble mirage.  Outside of an injury plagued first month to the season, Jamal averaged 23 and 5 on 50/44/92 (30 game, 2 month sample) last season. So basically bubble stats on less usage (and thus points).  He's become elite off ball, has wickid chemistry in the 2 man game with Jokic and plays an ego-less brand of ball where he tends to let his teammates eat in the 1st half and then feasts in the 2nd half and clutch...   I also admit that, as someone who has lived in LA 15 years, I watched a lot of Ingram on the Lakers, and that his year with Lebron (as well as your team underachieving last year) has probably colored my perspective of him. Plus the fact that Jamal didn't get a chance to shine in the playoffs (and may not fully regain his old form) has most Nuggets fans defensive over him."
Jamal Murray is the best player in that deal.
"&gt; If it’s perimeter defense you want, you might want to pay attention to Murray. The Denver guard is responsible for closing out on 6.8 shots per game of 15 feet or more, and his impact on those shooters is great. Normally accurate 37.7 percent of the time from that range, Murray has them down at 28.8 percent, a gain of 8.9 percent.        https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-ben-simmons-steals-no-1-spot      Tell me more oh wise one       *Also:   https://lakersnation.com/nuggets-jamal-murray-worked-on-post-defense-with-kobe-bryant/2021/01/20/       https://www.denverstiffs.com/2020/12/28/22202906/five-tidbits-to-watch-jamal-murrays-strong-start-defensively"
"People really need to stop overrating the shit out of individual defense.  The idea that adding Ben Simmons would solve Denver's defensive issues on the perimeter is just silly and completely untrue.  No contending team is going to trade for Ben Simmons, let alone for an assassin like Jamal Murray.  You do not want Ben Simmons on the court at the end of a playoff game with everything on the line, and this thought that it's ok because he ""won't be asked to score"" is not how basketball works. He wasn't asked to score in Philly either, as evidenced by his 5 points in game 7...until he was and he blew it because he didn't belong on the court."
Jamal Murray is fearless and an absolute hooper who averaged 47ppg over 3 games against Utah to come back from 3-1. He dropped 40 in game 7 vs LAC to advance to the conference finals.      It's beyond disrespectful to discredit him and compare him to an arrogant man child that disappears when his team needs him and then blames everyone else.
MPJ or Jamal is going to be a hard no for the Nuggets. I think Simmons would thrive next to Jokic and Murray offensively. Or at least have the proper role where he would be effective on offence. Denver doesn't have anything to offer tho.
"These are all during BLM, the entire league had something to say about this which is cool but he actually didn’t do anything different there by speaking out. Many players did, including Jaylen. Yes it’s disappointing they only speak up on these things when its convenient for them hence why they are silent now that we need more people to speak up for vaccination.   Yes every single one of those players disappoints me immensely as well! And I will be sure to speak about that when a thread about them is created! Don’t you worry my dude! My opinion isn’t solely based around Murray or Jaylen! So you can relax with the defensiveness.   Unlike you people I will not settle for Jamal only speaking up about one thing, players only speaking on what is convenient for them. If they truly care about society then vaccination should also be talked about. Also my point that he doesn’t portray himself as an intellectual is important, Jaylen does so that’s why I’m more upset at Jaylen.   I promise you I will not be silent about this situation when threads for other players are also created so you can put down your “Jamal defense force” helmet now.   I singled out Brown because he has gone and given speeches, spoken up about social injustices but is completely silent when it comes to vaccination. I will not support this selective activism.   It’s not ridiculous to do it on a Jaylen or LeBron post, they are even more hypocritical because they have already taken strong social justice stances but don’t say a word for vaccination. This is called selective activism, do some research on this.   This world will get no where with you guys accepting the bare minimum from the people in society who have the most influence."
Why would you trade a guy who can drop 50 on any given night for a guy who is afraid to shoot? The sixers are screwed bc Simmons isn't considered a superstar anymore. I'm sure they could still trade him but there's no way they're getting anything close to a Jamal Murray unless they get some draft picks and get lucky
"&gt; Murray doesn’t portray himself as an intellectual or a voice when it comes to social justice which is disappointing as well   Seriously? That's not true at all, dude.  He has spoken out about social issues many times.  This interview went viral, even:   https://youtu.be/6WSWsWn4XsI  Jamal has absolutely made an effort to be an activist for social justive.  https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/05/jamal-murray-nuggets-starts-conversation-about-race/  From NBA.com:  https://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/murray-wants-change-20200606  You really come across as ignorant calling it ""disappointing"" that he hasn't when he literally has, you just weren't aware of it.    Here's a list of players you can criticize for not speaking up about the vaccine:  Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, Jokic, Doncic, KD, Harden, Tatum, etc....virtually every single player in the league outside of Steph, Kanter, and a few others.  Many of whom *have* spoken up about other social issues.  I agree silence is compliance in a lot of instances but you are holding several players to a different standard than literally every.   other player in the league.  Criticize all you want, but to single Brown (and evidently Booker) out is ridiculous.  And also do a bit of online looking before saying Jamal doesn't speak up about social issues in your ""silence is compliance"" comment.  And if you want to make this sorta comment on every thread about any player who hasn't actively spoken up pro-vaccine, then you are welcome to do that, but it's an entirely pointless thing to do outside of making you feel like you're better than strangers who mostly agree with the pro-vax position but don't need to boast about it online to strangers on r/nba"
We would’ve if Jamal murray wasn’t injured but fair enough bro
Having Simmons and Gordon on the floor at the same time would suck Wang for our offense. Gordon isn't terrible offensively but having Jamal MPJ and Jokic all have at or above 40% from three is just too much for defenses. Yeah our D would be better but I think out offense would suffer way to much. Also no I don't think MPJ will take many shots from Murray. I don't think anyone on the team has an issue with porter attempting 8-10 threes a game if he's hot. Also having MPJ and Murray means one of them can have a sub par game offensively and it not be a huge issue. Ive seen a lot of possibilities for Simmons to the nuggets but none of them make actual sense for the Nuggets to do. It won't happen. People are also under the assumption porter will never get better on D but Im pretty confident he's gonna be a pretty serviceable defender in a year or two.
"Nahhhhhhh Fuuuuuuck that I’m a Heat fan, and Jamal Murray is a rising superstar with an actual real life jumper, plus much more!"
Lol. Igram overrated as fuck. Murray better.  As seen by the fact that Ingram's teams have never made the playoffs while Jamal has never lost in the first round.
"I always thought DLO would be great for the Sixers. Sixers fans I’ve seen hate DLO, but love the idea of Jamal Murray, when throughout the regular season, Jamal is usually always worse than DLO, except one year I’m pretty sure. People just remember Jamal for 2020 really. DLO though had a great run with the Nets once."
"&gt; They aren't in a race here, they'd rather have a much higher chance to win in the next 5 years than maybe a slightly higher chance this year.  That's often not how things work anymore.  The clock isn't the players ages.  The clock is how many years they've been on the team because contracts.  Teams are almost invariably together much much shorter than that teams fans think they will be.  Especially when you're talking about a team that's about to have 3 max/near max deals.  Jamal will miss most of this year and the next year Murray, Jokic, AG, and MPJ will be the whole 115mil salary cap by themselves.  They're definitely on a clock"
"I’m still a big, stubborn Simmons believer, but why the fuck would Denver trade Jamal Murray? They can put more effort into coming up with their bullshit lol"
The idea that Denver would trade Jamal Murray for any deal involving Ben Simmons is the most hilarious thing I've heard in a long time. Ben Simmons + Joel Embiid doesn't get you Jamal! You could put up half of Philly and Denver would have to be stark raving crazy to give it any consideration.  Denver needs to improve their defense without doubt. But that's much more straightforward than dealing their core assets for speculative assets in return. Ben + 2 first round picks doesn't get you Jamal.
"Klay Thompson is a great shooter, but he is not great at the step back. Donavon Mitchel is a great shooter, but he does not have a great high post game. You are just not appeciating how skilled someone like Jamal Murray has to be to be able to perform all these facets of scoring. Summed up, you are over conflating shooting percentages with pure skill"
"Don't ever disrespect Jamal Murray like that again, thanks."
"I think it’s also an example of an organization standing by their guy. Technically Murray and Simmons are pretty comparable in value (although I think Jamal is better both in a vacuum and on the nuggets). But you want the team to say “no, we believe in our guy.” The nuggets front office clearly knows something that the sixers organization doesn’t, which is that what you say publicly about your players affects their desire to play for you.  You have to consider Jamal is probably aware of the trade rumors on social media. This is the front office sending him a message that he’s valued and he’s secure."
"Ja Morant is overrated, RIGHT NOW. I have hopes of him becoming a superstar player, maybe even MVP, but it's ridiculous how there's people who think he's better than players like Jamal Murray or Bam or Fox"
"I've seen people say he's better than players like Jamal Murray, like come on. There's potential and then there's how good he is right now."
Simmons is a top 40-50 player Jamal Murray is a top 25-30 player
"Ben Simmons is a top _____ player  Jamal Murray is a top _____ player  If you think they're completely different tiers of players, please fill in the blanks"
Jamal Murray could be the only piece going to Philly and Philly would slam that accept button rapidly
"I agree that trading Jamal for Simmons would be bad for the Nuggets, but acting like Simmons vs Murray is an insult in terms of caliber of player is not it."
I feel like Denver for Jamal Murray is a nice dark horse.   Philly loses a year; Denver greatly improves their defense.  But I can’t see them getting a better player
"&gt;Well this last playoffs luka averaged 7 more ppg far more efficiently with slightly more (but negligible) assists  You do realize you are basing this opinion on 7 games vs 16 games, right? Those are absolutely miniscule sample sizes in the first place, but *especially* so if you're using it to say that the guy who played 7 is better than the guy who played 16. You wouldn't use this same logic to say Jamal Murray is better than Trae, would you?  &gt;along with more rebounds  6'1"" vs 6'7"", but yeah, to your credit that's in Luka's favor.  &gt;and is less targetable on defence.  They're both garbage on D. Maybe Trae a bit more so, but they're both defensive liabilities lol.  &gt;and was a better regular season player than trae all with a worse supporting cast.  They're very comparable regular season players actually. There's a bit more of a disparity between their counting stats this season, but like you said, that because Trae has a better supporting cast now. He's taking less shots because the offensive load isn't so heavy on his shoulders, and that's why he was able to lead his team to the conference finals. All you have to do is look at last season when Trae had less help to see that his numbers were debatably better than Luka's. Luka had the advantage in rebounding, Trae had it in points, assists, and TS%. Neck and neck.  &gt; I say that while acknowledging there is no case for trae&gt;luka   I agree that Luka is better. I just don't understand how people have Luka at like 6-7 and Trae at like 13-15 when they're super similar statistically, with Trae having more post season success."
"Denver (Jamal Murray), Sacramento (Hield, Mitchell, (Cleveland (Love, Sex/Land) seem like other options."
"I think everybody is sleeping on Westbrook as a third option and secondary ball handler. The league didn’t have an answer for Lebron/AD, now you put WB into the mix and you’re probably looking at one of the most efficient transition offenses ever. That’s where they’re going to outscore the better shooting teams. In the half court they might struggle with spacing, mainly because of WB, but they’re so dominant inside that I don’t think it will matter much. Plus Westbrook isn’t as bad of a shooter as people make him out to be. He takes a lot of bad shots. I think playing with high IQ leaders will reign that in, you’re not gonna see him shooting pull up threes 5 times a game. He can at the very least catch and shoot as well as Rondo did for them. He’s not Ben. He’s also still explosive enough that they can use him in the dunkers spot. If they run Lebron/AD 4/5 like they said they’ll have 2 other floor spacers. Offensively they’re gonna be fine barring a significant drop in production from lbj.  Defensively they were one of the best teams in the league in 2020, but they’re missing Caruso, KCP, and DG now. Replacing that with Melo, WB, and Trevor Ariza’s corpse won’t bode well for them on that end, but they’ve still got probably the best mobile big man in the league, and one of the best defensive coaches.  Look end of the day it comes down to health and their competition. Luka on his own cannot beat the Lakers, the Nuggets got exposed by them in the playoffs already and now they’ve got Jamal Murray coming off injury. Suns are good but I don’t think they can beat the lakers with AD healthy. Clips are done without Kawhi. Their only competition in the West imo is Utah, and mayyybeeee GS of Klay comes back in demon mode.  tl;dr: healthy lakers go to the finals"
Nuggets with Barton Dozier and Jamal Murray out with a hobbled Monte morris is absolutely a worse team than the mavs without Luka.
"Based on raw finishing % (Shots 0-3 feet), it's actually Jamal Murray."
I thought Maple Jordan was Jamal Murray?
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
1. Demar Derozan 2. Pascal Siakam 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steve Nash 6. Jamal Murray 7. RJ Barrett  8. Jeremy Lin 9. Norman Powell  10. Jayson Tatum
Jamal Murray has like +4 although he haven't played many playoffs games yet. He's a fucking superstar in the playoffs.
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"that shit was so funny. Dream scenario for a team desperate for shooters (and any passable wing talent) like every year, jamal murray and buddy hield both drop to 5, but no... not on our watch."
Who else is super glad Thibs took Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray?   Even after he said he actually wanted to come play [here!!?](https://dunkingwithwolves.com/2016/06/21/jamal-murray-wants-to-play-for-the-timberwolves/amp/)
"Jamal is a leader of this team. He has also proven to turn it on when it matters. These are difficult skills to ignore. No doubt MPJ has potential to be more valuable, but as of right now, Jamal Murray is more important."
"1. Because they went 2-7 without him, good enough for worst in the league. 2. All-Star or not, Jamal Murray is obviously better than any teammate Steph had this season 3. MPJ has also been better than any teammate Steph had this season  I'm not even arguing who should win, it's obviously Jokic, I'm just pointing out that the idea that Steph had the worst roster to carry of all the MVP candidates is pretty much indisputable and he deserves to be a finalist.  Reality is this, if Steph had somehow managed to push the team to 8 more wins and tied the Nuggets he would have the MVP in the bag without question, because everyone knows which of these players had to carry a worse team and getting this Warriors team to 47 wins would have been an impossible feat."
"I disagree, they have the MVP, basically an all star level player in Jamal Murray and MPJ with good depth. Malone’s a good coach too. I don’t think you can confidently say they wouldn’t win."
"Totally, a nuggets fan would probably have a more educated opinion but Im not so sure that MPJ shouldnt be the 2nd option and murray be the 3rd... and i love jamal murray too"
"Jamal Murray averaged like 24 his first year (albeit, on average efficiency, but you get my point). He elevates his game in the playoffs."
"Part of my reasoning for not being a fan is because of the 1st round last year against the nuggets, I remember vividly watching game 7 when it was close, Jamal Murray's got a hand off from the c, whoever's the backup was, and Gobert got switched onto Murray at about the free throw line, from there Murray drove and made a simple right handed lay up right on Gobert, If it was from the 3 point line and Gobert would've had to keep up, I wouldn't be so hard on him, however it was the free throw line, and Jamal didn't even have to attempt one of the crazy layups he did so often during the bubble. Most times I would get over it and not care, but for some reason I really wanted Utah to win and that sequence made me mad at him, I'm not even a Utah fan and should probably lighten up on him, but nah"
"I'm not your buddy, pal.  To most people it looks like he twisted his ankle and is heading to the bench. Marcus Smart just this week literally turned his ankle and had to be taken out of the game, and returned a quarter later.  Is it bad form to cheer even if you think a guy's just heading to the bench with a mild ankle twist? Yeah. Is it as evil as the media made it out to be? Not even close.  You watch it again, by the time it's clear he's heading to the locker room and not the bench (literally less than 60 seconds after he first falls down) the Raptors fans are cheering in support of him.  &gt;I'm absolutely certain that if it was a Paul George or Gordon Hayward or Jamal Murray type injury where they're clearly crying in pain that they would have quieted down almost immediately.  Do you disagree with this?"
"I said this at the time, and I'll say it again. ""Raptors fans cheered at KD tearing his Achilles!"" is such a stupid, overblown, lazy, and frankly false narrative.  [Watch the replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYrA30qcvK4). Is every fan in attendance supposed to have X-ray vision? For 99% of the fans in the arena, it looks like KD fumbles the ball, leading to a turnover and fast-break. *Any* home arena in the Finals is gonna go crazy over that.  As the fast-break is happening, KD is sitting on the ground, looking dejected but not obviously in any significant pain. He's helped up by his teammates literally 20 seconds after he falls down and hobbles around, again it's totally reasonable for 99% of fans in the arena (possible exception of those sitting courtside) to think that he twisted his ankle a bit and is salty about turning the ball over.  After the severity of the injury became clear and Raptors players told the crowd to quiet down they quickly complied.  I'm absolutely certain that if it was a Paul George or Gordon Hayward or Jamal Murray type injury where they're clearly crying in pain that they would have quieted down almost immediately.  It was an intense sequence that lasted just a couple minutes in a Finals game where fans got hyped over what for all intents and purposes looks like a routine stumble, turnover, fast-break, and quieted down after realizing how bad it was. The next day, after *everyone* knew how bad the injury was, a bunch of nephews on the internet took a couple of 30s clips of Raptors fans cheering juxtaposed with KD sitting on the ground to try and paint the Raptors fanbase as a bunch of evil dicks."
I wish Murray was like 4 inches taller so they could run Facu Murray lineups. Having Facu coming off a elevator into motion would be gorgeous to watch. Jamal running the high pick and roll at the same time - so many good passers on that team.
"Curry is a terrible defender ask Kyrie in the finals , there’s a reason Klay would guard the best guard because curry is a liability on defense. The west was much weaker this season with all the injuries , Donovan Mitchell , Jamal Murray, PorzinGod , Lebron, Anthony Davis. Curry is better than Lillard yes but his numbers will see a big decline when Klay is back m. He’s not the mvp point blank period ."
"Dude our supporting cast was not there till the AS break lmao. Murray playing injured, mpj in covid protocol for about a month, and just when it was clicking our players started dropping like flies.  Jamal, Monte, Thrill, PJ"
"Never said he was one of the best playmakers, but that's what he does.   I don't follow the 76ers too closely, but Ben runs the point and plays defense.  My point is how does Simmons fit on a team where Jokic runs the offense.   Denver looks pretty good and if you were trading Jamal Murray, I'd go for a much better shootet."
"When you got 3 bigs on the floor with the Lakers (one being the ultimate playmaker, mind you), who’s gonna guard Lebron? Ok Kd. Who’s then got Ad? An older Jeff green or older Blake griffin? Umm sure. And then who’s got Drummond? Washed-up Deandre Jordan?! Lmao.   Do you see the problem? These other teams have defensive issues when it comes to guarding the Lakers. I’m not saying the Lakers can fully guard the nets, they got firepower out the ass, but the Lakers are one of the best teams equipped to defend them.   Jokic doesn’t have Murray and if they couldn’t knock off the lakers last year, they aren’t doing this year without a Jamal Murray. So bringing up the nuggets is just dumb.   But idk why you are now bringing up other teams. You started with the suns, and sorry to say the suns are not beating the Lakers 4 out of 7."
Denver guy. Idiot who thinks Lakers only beat Denver 4-1 because of the ref despite Jamal fucking  Murray shooting the same amount of fts as LeBron James lmao. Braindead.
Shades of Jamal Murray vs Lebron
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"Getting Nurk in foul trouble means Kanter. Last I checked, portland beat Denver, with Jamal Murray, just Kanter with a banged up shoulder last time these teams met. Just saying."
"To be 5th or 6th they'd have to jump Lakers and Blazers and Mavs  &gt;LeBron/AD injuries  &gt;Jamal Murray, Barton, Dozier  &gt;Porzingis  If they weren't injuried, would the Warriors really get 5/6?"
So like  I don't even know how the play-in works  Do we play the Grizz again? What happens to the loser? How high was Jamal Murray that he went on IG Live when he simply meant to record?
Jamal Murray????? Or kyler Murray lmao you have a better chance with kyler
"Jimmy was not more important than Joel Embiid in any series ever. You mentioned Embiid struggling against *double teams* in your previous post, which in itself would indicate that Embiid was the Raptor's focal point. Of our offense and our defense. When he wasn't on the court we couldn't defend shit and couldn't score.   Jimmy had a couple great games in that Raptors series but so did Jamal Murray against the Clippers in the bubble. But that does not mean Jokic was not the most important player on that Nuggets team last season."
"I'm really curious to see what kind of defense they roll out against Steph. We did a good job of shutting down Harden and Dame in last year's playoffs, but Jamal Murray and Jimmy Butler went off against us. [KCP has historically done well against Curry](https://twitter.com/SamQuinnCBS/status/1394321817146380291), plus we have Mathews, Caruso and THT to run around chasing him if KCP gets tired."
Jamal Murray doesn't even own a car.
Most guys on the rookie extension typically it’s a bit of a hope they develop to be worth it. Jaylen brown is one example same with Jamal Murray. Some guys do end up being worth it and some don’t
"Jamal Murray and Middleton caught me off guard a bit. Like, I'm not saying they *haven't* been playing at an All-Star level, but he just kind of threw them in there without any elaboration, like it was *obvious.*"
"True the top guys have not played as well as they can and it is on them to perform. Green and curry are much more limited than what I was thinking, nobody is scared of a Seth curry pick and roll. I just think this team would be insanely hard to stop if you replaced Tobias Harris’s salary slotwith a guy like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, maybe even Kemba walker or Jrue holiday etc..   obviously that’s true cause most of those guys are all better than Harris but also cause every other high level playoff offense we’ve seen has somebody who is a legitimately good perimeter creator and the sixers have the least perimeter creation of any contender and I think that imbalance is largely cause they gave all that money to Harris. It’s also bad because every team has to play big against embiid and the sixers do a terrible job of taking advantage of slow bigs by forcing them to play in space because their guards are so limited"
It's not because he literally showed his stats since the last time it was done. Its a weekly thing to assess all the rookies.   But this guy is a bum and this ladder isn't indictive of the ROTY voting. he's the same guy who put Jamal Murray top 5 DPOY one week.
realistically (i.e. a realistic team composition)? no  &gt;I would put him on the level of Klay or CJ or Jamal Murray.  i think he's better than all three of these players but still cant win as the #1
Jamal Murray was BALLING out all playoffs. And Lebron casually decided to lock him up.
Where's Jamal Murray again?
"Dude point guard the deepest position, schroeder definitely is below median for starting point guards. Can name 20 that are better in no order: curry, dame, lowry, holiday, fox, sexton, walker, kyrie, paul, westbrook, conley trae , brogdin, dlo, lamelo, Ja, dejounte murray, jamal murray and then simmons and doncic if u count them"
"Well the clippers lost in the second round and the lakers went on to win the title so wouldn’t say they’re neck and neck.  Yeah rondo was good in 2012, that’s what I said. That’s the last time he was the best player on a team that went anywhere. This is 2021, not 2012.  You seem to be confusing prime rondo with the rondo who played on the lakers last year. I’m not discrediting his previous accomplishments at all, but they’re completely irrelevant to his current ability. He’s an incredibly smart player who knows how to command an offense but he’s not a star anymore. Don’t know how you can possibly argue otherwise. Idk why you keep bringing Lowry up, he’s a much better player at this point in time than rondo is. In their prime, rondo was better but that was a long time ago.   I can’t believe you just said LeBron’s defensive IQ is trash, that’s one of the worst takes I’ve ever seen. He’s a multiple time all defensive first team player and one of the best help defenders still even though he’s 36. You clearly spend more time on NBA Twitter than you do watching basketball if you think he’s a bad defender. Not even 1 year ago he locked up Jamal Murray 1 on 1 in a close out game. He’s an incredibly smart defender, he just can’t guard the other teams best player for 40 minutes anymore while also leading the offense. He was one of the best players in the league in terms of defensive win shares last year. Stick to Twitter."
You can't get anymore for Kemba.  Like maybe Denver Nuggets because Jamal Murray is so injury prone?  What about the Lakers? Would Kemba be an upgrade over Schroeder?
They passed on:  Jamal Murray  Buddy Hield  Pascal Siakam  Dejounte Murray  Sabonis
"Siakam, Sabonis, Levert, Jamal Murray and Brogdon were all selected after the guys the Suns picked."
"Ehh they also got Booker at 13 which was fantastic, Bridges at 10 was also really good, Cam Johnson has been decent as well.  If you include guys no longer on the roster there’s TJ Warren, Markieff Morris, and although he wasn’t good for them Josh Jackson looks decent enough on Detroit.  Len was in a really weak draft, and Chriss was the 8th pick in what was considered an 8 man draft at the time. Bender is the most disappointing pick but even then the only real huge miss not counting the diamonds in the rough later in the draft was Jamal Murray.  So not amazing or anything, but far from the worst drafting team of the last decade"
"I’m worried about Denver in the playoffs, not just about playing them but because I’m worried we’ll see how much this team misses jamal Murray (which the nuggets have fucking valiantly stepped up to overcome).    But also, no yeah I’m definitely still scared of playing them"
"I do it to Clippers fans who delude themselves on here, which has happened a lot more recently as yall have come out of yall caves again in the past couple months.   Above there's a Clips fan claiming Rondo clamped up Jamal Murray, Harden, Jimmy Butler and Dame last playoffs for us and that he &amp; Danny Green was our defensive leader ahead of LeBron and AD, lmao. That's insanity  Not blaming you, just letting you know we're gonna talk smack back. Barring massive injuries (like the Warriors in the 19 Finals or something like that), the better team in the NBA always wins."
"&gt; You can't compare the Nuggets that lost Jamal Murray to a veteran team like the Clippers that are literally Championship or bust.  The Nuggets have done it for three years in a row at this point, and it's not like they were marred by injuries the last two  years or anything."
"Eh, but then you are talking about players like PG3, Jamal Murray, Tatum etc.   There's a few guys that make you contenders. LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, Durant, Harden. Then there's guys like Lillard, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Doncic and CP3 who are a step below that. And THEN there's another 20 players who are all stars."
"Conveniently left out Jamal Murray who was healthy for at least 2/3 of the season, meanwhile you think Wiggins or Oubre (who missed his first 17 3s for the beginning of the season &gt; MPJ? HAHAHA 🤡 I’d love to trade straight up, but you’d have to add salary to make it work! MPJ and Murray both have better BPM than anyone else on the Warriors. Oubre (the guy who missed 17 3s to start the season) has been out at least 10 games. Draymond threw a game by himself with technicals. Poole was literally in the G-league at one point this season. I’m starting to think you’re talking out of your ass"
"The Nuggets? Utah were a much worse team and took them to seven last year, and that was with Jamal Murray playing.  Utah have easily the highest point differential and are quite clearly a true contender."
It's a crazy even series now that Jamal Murray is injured
Iirc Jamal Murray was a pick from a pick swap with the Knicks.. that was the last piece of the Melo trade.
Maybe not a stomp but I remember last year when Jamal Murray went nuclear and legit looked unguardable but they still lost. Lakers don't have Dwight to bully Jokic but Gasol can fill that 15 min. D role. Unless MPJ plays out of his mind I don't see how the Nuggets win.
Did people forget we were up 3-1 until Jamal Murray turned into Michael Jordan for 3 games lol
"you gettin shit for this but   &gt;Lonzo Ball, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, Michael Porter Jr, Nikola Jokic  this would definitely be a REALLY good starting lineup  nets are gonna be favorites as long as the big 3 is intact tho"
"Whoa man i love jokic too but you're talking Jokic turning Austin rivers or campazzo into a superstar like player Jamal Murray, thats utterly ridiculous. In playoff basketball where you're facing the same team 4 out of a possible 7 times then players like Rivers/Capazzo get exposed while real Superstars like Murray don't need Jokic to up his game. Jokic killed the Clips last playoffs but Murray ripped their heart out. Without Murray then Jokic is gnna have to rely on Rivers or campazzo to make a play when he's out and that isn't gonna happen.  Whereas Gobert knows that Mitchell, who is a superstar will take up the scoring load and leadership while he just plays defense.   Jokic may end up getting some great games from MPJ/Milsap but AAron Gordon may get lost in his 1st playoff series and c'mon now lets face reality here Austin Rivers is not gonna make the same impact that Murray does."
"Jokic has Austin Rivers who can't do anything anymore instead of Jamal Murray.  Gobert has Donavan Mitchell.   I think the Jazz win that one easily. If Murray wasn't hurt i would agree with you 100% but with Murray out, the Jazz with Mitchell/Gobert are the harder out."
With Jamal Murray AND MPJ? lol and how is that even a counter argument when a Curry less team would be lottery bound
?? I remember you had a Jamal Murray guy for a solid chunk of the year
"I was really bummed when Jamal Murray went down; maybe we can still have a wildly fun playoff series, but it wouldn't be the same. Hope y'all can make another deep run this year regardless.  P.S. Jokic MVP."
I don't think so as both Utah and Dallas both won 2/3 from the Clips in the reg season and why should the Clips be scared of a Nugs team without Jamal Murray? I would say the matchup better with the suns who they beat 2/3 times and would have an easier time against the Nugs who are without Murray.
Actually its DPOY candidate jamal murray
"&gt; if they did that without Jamal Murray and how beaten up they've been, that would be very impressive.  This is true.  But the reason you're wrong about:  &gt; they have no reason to try in this game  Is because they'd rather risk falling to the 4th and taking an overall harder path than play the Lakers in the first round. They can still get Dirk'ed if the Clippers lose tonight. Ironic that it would be to the Mavs as well."
"There was an article literally a couple months ago about Jamal Murray controlling his heart rate. Tons of athletes do it, christ. Your Curry love is cute"
"Or they just don't care about the Lakers problems because like I said, they have no reason to try in this game.  Also the Nuggets would have to get to the WCF to face the Lakers if things played out the way they are now, if they did that without Jamal Murray and how beaten up they've been, that would be very impressive."
"Ideally he would be the Sixers Jamal Murray, a score first guard who can reliably run a traditional PnR for mix ups and match ups, but Simmons should absolutely remain the primary PG."
Why would Denver want to play the team that manhandled them w/Jamal Murray last year ? Lol tanking is the obvious choice for them
"There's no one that has come close to Jokic this season  The fact he has played every game when a fair share of the league's stars have been injured including his own teammate Jamal Murray, cements the MVP even further."
Who are they besides Jamal Murray??
"Bro didn’t Jamal Murray put up like 50 PPG in a series for y’all last year lol, the Nuggets are fuckin stacked, you don’t have to pretend they aren’t to boost Jokic’s status"
why the fuck would they want to face the lakers who beat them in 5 last year without Jamal Murray?
Jamal Murray?
"East  1) Sixers   2) Nets   3) Bucks   4) Knicks   5) Hawks   6) Heat  7) Celtics  8) Wizards   Sixers vs Wizards = star duo matchup   Nets vs Celtics = Revenge of the KG/Pierce trade &amp; Kyrie vs old team   Bucks vs Heat = Rematch of last years domination   Knicks vs Hawks = Battle of the playoff upstarts with elite bigs and guards.   West:   1) Jazz  2) Suns  3) Nuggets   4) Clippers  5) Mavs   6) Blazers   7) Warriors   8) Lakers   Jazz vs Lakers and not Warriors?! What?! Simple. Lakers lose their position to the Warriors in the play-in.   Suns vs Warriors = Steph vs CP3 for the millionth time.   Denver vs Portland = Revenge of the 2019 WCSF series, except instead of Jamal Murray it’s MPJ.   Clippers vs Mavs = Rematch of last years series, only this time Unicorn remains healthy (fingers crossed)."
Jamal Murray secretly wanted to play for his home team so he faked an ACL injury
Jamal Murray is the only reason we made it that far. Rating showed that after game 5 against the jazz it consistently inclined every game Murray went off and then we did the same shit against the clippers including drastic ratings increases in game 5 against the clippers. Nothing matters to the league except ratings and money get real. At that point Clippers or nuggets moving on was a win win.
The NBA couldn’t predict that Jamal Murray would go absolutely nuclear in the playoffs. They can try and steer it a certain way but that’s about it
"Man, Donovan Mitchell is playing as well as he did last year. I wish Jamal Murray was healthy so he could duel him again. That shit was epic, I want round 2."
"&gt;Sweep or Gentlemen sweep...that is a big disappointment compared to last year and a piss poor performance. So you think this years version of Oladipo is a needle mover for Miami like AD, Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray. Got it.  I think for the Heat loss of Jae and Olynk from last year would have been ok by adding Dipo. Yes i think another person that can create his own shot would have helped this Heat squad.   &gt;I guess you don't like stats? Less injuries =/= more injuries.  Stop comparing discussing league wide statistics, when its clear the discussion at hand is regards to the bubble teams. The only teams that had short off seasons were those that got invited to the bubble and then even more for those that made the bubble playoffs.   Why would i care about league wide data? The shortened off season is going to affect specific teams."
"Excuses ? All 4 teams that were in the conference championship have dealt with injuries. Jamal Murray ? (Torn ACL), Jaylen Brown (Broken wrist), LeBron (High  Ankle sprain), AD (Achilles), Butler (COVID &amp; Back &amp; Knee), Herro (Foot). These aren’t bench players either these are key impactful players. This season really didn’t benefit those teams, it’s very unfortunate because this season would’ve been better."
"Bubble AD had massive outlier shooting splits though, using just that is like using Bubble Murray to say Jamal is an MVP-level player."
Trae Young or Jamal Murray?
Jamal Murray was shooting around before game 3 most injured players do
Don’t forget nuggets/trailblazers series could look different if Jamal Murray didn’t tear his acl
"Your comment on player movement were so vague originally. It seemed like you insinuating a change in guard for Lebron and Kawhi's off season movement but not a reason for this years changes...  Sweep or Gentlemen sweep...that is a big disappointment compared to last year and a piss poor performance. So you think this years version of Oladipo is a needle mover for Miami like AD, Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray. Got it.  [I guess you don't like stats?](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-says-injury-rate-down-slightly-from-normal) Less injuries =/= more injuries."
"Did playing 4-7 games more really make that much of a difference. Let’s be real for Boston browns injury was just a fluke. Kemba is just done at this point regardless of the off-season he didn’t even play half the year. Miami was a lot worse across the board this year were healthy in the playoffs and got smacked.   Lebron just had a freak incident with his ankle, someone fell into it has nothing to do with the off-season.   The only two I’d really say were Jamal Murray and Davis. Davis never looked right all year and Murray had a potential overuse situation causing the acl injury."
Love Jamal but I think if he plays Dame goes off even more than he already has and we still have the same results until today. Still calling blazers in 7 with or without Murray
"You’re a Jamal Murray fanboy. Nuggets are going further this year than they did last year. Watch dumbass and remember me when you’re celebrating at the parade...  Jamal Murray is a ball hog who takes shots away from other players, including MPJ"
"Damn shame Jamal Murray is out, he's a different beast in the playoffs."
"#1 Brown never made it to the postseason and other C's are injured #2 Murray is out. The Jamal Murray who helped come back 3-1 twice and was close to pushing the Lakers to 7 had Miles Plumlee defend weird. #3 The Heat were just dealing with injuries all season and weren't able to get their chemistry together. To paraphrase Sir Charles, you just don't get up and play basketball. #4 Lakers got hurt LeBron and AD."
Jamal Murray had a tough stretch for part of this season compared to his playoff performances but overall he's been a killer.  Maybe could argue Tyler Herro was looking like a potential future superstar based on the bubble.
Im sure it will never happen. It is just fun to imagine for the Nuggets to have a shot creator bail them out in tight spots. A Jamal Murray replacement but way better
"Imagine if the nuggets had Jamal Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier...this series would be over already. Blazers go full rebuild if they lose"
Similar to Jamal Murray last yesr
"I mean, we said that about Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell when they both had 31 3s IIRC before Game 7 of that series and look how that turned out. Both players went ice cold."
"This is gonna be a terrible hot take from someone who has never watched Jordan, doesn't remember the LeBron game, and didn't watch Dame.  I'm only posting it to hopefully add to the discussion. I know it is long and probably weird and dumb lol. I also go in circles a bit. I'm just having fun tbh.  Please keep in mind the competition and stage was different and, as I trust others more, I am likely wrong. I am sharing cause I feel like sharing my opinion, even if it is dumb. Sorry. I'm sure seeing these games would likely swing my opinion so I realize I am not trustworthy.  The efficiency of Dame is pure madness. 70+% shooting and only 1 turnover. By comparison, the two games mentioned had 4 and 5 turnovers, along with 53.7% and 59.4% shooting. Dame also dropped some nuts ts%. Not sure the exact number but I've heard 96.83% and 97%. Don't know a reliable place to check advanced stats yet. By comparison, the other games had 62.7% and 69.2%. I mean, the ts%, if the site I'm looking at is up to date, is the third highest of 50+ point games in any game, regular or post. (On a side note, tf did Van Vleet and Jamal Murray do and how did I miss it lol)  I mean, based on the stats I'm seeing, Dame played a near perfect game.  And now, for the rare prepost edit: [Perhaps I shouldn't have focused so much on ts%?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2zpdp1/ts_promoting_efficiency_or_masking_inefficiency/).  I think I'd have to look at more stats which I don't know where to find and don't feel like calculating right now. I'd say I'm tired but I seem to also have way too much energy as I'm writing this while thing out lol so idk.  Really, the pure efficiency is shooting %, ts%, and the lack of turnovers show a beautiful game with nearly no mistakes. I think that is something special. While it is hard to continue that with quantity, at a certain point it becomes extreme. I mean, how do you compare 8 more points on 17 more shots? Or 4 less points on 8 more shots? Plus he put up more assists and blocks, though he lags behind in rebounds on LeBron and steals on Jordan. But what about the teams he played against? How much does the efficiency get diminished because it wasn't against an all time great Celtics or Warriors team who each defines an era of basketball.  Honestly, idk how to determine which one is better. I just wanted to talk about how amazing and mind blowing the efficiency is.  If you read this far, thank you.  What do you think?"
"Jamal Murray went out for the season with his injury, and the nuggets certainly aren’t as good, but I don’t think they suck without him."
Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray had season ending injuries. It definitely had an impact.
"Tobi has size, true. That’s why portland would want him. CJ would be a significant defensive downgrade, but having a guard that can score at his level, really run pick and roll, would be great for the sixers. Bigs like embiid/simmons need the yinyang that comes from being paired with a dynamic scoring guard. IMO jokic without jamal murray is an example of that- their p&amp;r was the nuggets best play, and their offense loses bite without it.  Seth is a very moveable contract. And seth being 50% of CJ may be true, but it also oversimplifies the situation and undersells how big of an upgrade cj could be."
Jamal Murray game 4
"I could lean into the stereotype and bandwagon the Nets.  But I really like the Jazz, and if Jamal Murray was around nuggets would be my next favorites."
Jamal Murray makes this team a contender. It sucks he got hurt. I love Jokic. I might buy his jersey.
It’s crazy how this nuggets team are. This is without Jamal Murray!
Jamal “Team mom” Murray
"I'm slandering the hell out of Jokic if he allows Dame to do this in his house, idc if Jamal Murray isn't playing."
"Monte ""I'm Jamal Murray now"" Morris"
Healthy Jamal Murray and Denver would be even more disgustingly scary.
when u think about it rivers is just a thinner jamal murray
looks like jamal murray to me RN LMAO!
Austin “Jamal Murray” Rivers
"Jamal Murray not playing, game doesn't count‼️"
Austin “Jamal Murray” Rivers
the blazers game had a huge box of Jamal Murray literally just existing on the sideline in the middle of the game. it’s the fourth quarter
wtf was that i dont want or need to see a fucking video of jamal murray on the bench fuckin horrible production
man I wish Jamal Murray were healthy
"Howard "" Jamal Murray"" Markus !!!"
Nah Villian Brooks is a side hoe for Utah compared to Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell. They might have the best rivalry in the NBA besides KAT and Embiid
"One of these isn't like the others...umm quick opinions would be-  Conley is the only one who'd be difficult to criticize on that list.  His statistical impact on paper definitely gets watered down- given Utah's style of play, but he's playing at an elite PG level.  MPJ will never not excite, simply because of that talent- but I wouldn't say his game has improved since the playoffs began by any means.  Guess we're all still waiting.  Booker is still a strong net positive in almost every quarter he's played but it would be cool to see him be the Booker that gets rapped about or go into playoff mode hard like say Jamal Murray or Donovan Mitchell did last year.  For a player that's felt excluded from the prime time each postseason you'd expect an uptick at least but it hasn't happened.  Simmons' FT shooting is painful to watch, but at the end of the day he's playing well.  I don't understand how players with every resource available can't crack 70% FT percentages when struggling college kids can in half a season, but he's honestly good enough it might not matter for Philly so long as Embiid can shoulder stuff later.  So in summary my playoff thoughts would have to be...  Simmons: Learn to shoot because it's embarrassing but keep doing you.  Philly will survive even if Ben's ego doesn't.  MPJ: All of r/NBA is jealous of what you were basically born with.  Now we're waiting to see those talents get developed when legacy's on the line but yeah... haven't yet.  Even with the offensive void Murray left him.  Booker: Underperforming.  I get that his stats were always a bit fluffed since he carried so much of Phoenix's offensive load for so long, but we should still be seeing efficiency improvements now that CP3 is calling the shots.  Probably just an adjustment period and I'm not worried whatsoever, but he needs to shine just as brightly now alongside the new structure since it's the playoffs.  Conley: ummm...wish a couple more 3s had landed?  Lol I dunno the eye test just screams *~experience~* every time he directs the offense.  He's the only one you mentioned where you're gonna sound silly being critical.  Dude understands basketball so much better than me I'd feel guilty even typing out a critique."
"I was at that game, sitting right by under the other basket.  That was a BOMB he threw.  That was the game Jamal Murray tried to score 50 as time was running out.    In context Coach Malone was SCREAMING at him not to shoot it and he still did.  The possession before Monte Morris got a rebound and was going to dribble up the court and run time and Murray was yelling him to ""PASS THE FUCKING BALL."""
I just really really miss Jamal Murray tbh
when Murray comes back though I think there will be a real convo about whether MPJ or Jamal is better. Not a bad spot to be in
"The “people” you speak of are mostly media pundits or casual fans. Everyone in the NBA knows and understands Jokic’s dominance because they witness it first hand.   It’s all a moot point though because DEN has already committed to Jamal Murray and likely will do so with MPJ. It’s unlikely they will have any salary cap room left over to attract anyone besides MLE tier players for the next 4 years anyway. It’s sad because we would be witnessing some awesome basketball if Jokic ever got paired with someone like Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, or Trae Young."
"I'm still reeling over Jamal Murray man, that was my team to watch. Just one year nba gods, just one year is all i ask.."
Lol is that Jamal Murray he’s faking out on that first pass fake?
If they had Jamal Murray I'd pick Denver in a heartbeat
"Why are you shitting bricks? LOL Bro, we are still tied in this series without Jamal Murray. If we take this to 7 then I am so happy. I am rooting for my team to win but I am not going to lose sleep if we lose tonight and this series anyways. I am proud of this team this season after the way they came back from the bubble and I hope Jamal Murray comes back healthy with 0 setbacks. If you ask me last year playoffs, then every game after game 5 vs Jazz was feeling like that but this year nah. Just enjoy the Jokic show"
Jamal Murray/Ja Morant—sounds about the same to me!
Do you have any of those turn into Jamal Murray pills on you?
What if JJJ or Brooks turn into Jamal Murray?
We don't have Jamal Murray sooooo
"But that also means that every team going into the bubble got the same 5 month break that allowed them all to heal up before the playoffs started. Just because the Lakers had the benefits you mentioned during their run in the bubble, so did everyone else. The Celtics might not have made it to the ECF had it not been for the break because Kemba's knee wasn't fully healthy around the all star break and he was good in time for the playoffs. All four teams that made it to the conference finals in the bubble had to deal with the shortest turnaround going into this season and three of the four (Lakers, Nuggets, Celtics) had major injuries to their star players this season going into the playoffs (LeBron and AD, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown)."
"Full disclosure of my rooting interest / biases: I’m a Sixer fan. We got swept in the first round, so we barely had a cup of tea in Orlando. Consequently, we stayed relatively healthy this year. The Heat and Lakers had like 90 days off then had to get right back to the grind. If anything, I’d say that makes THIS year’s champs less of an accomplishment. The eventual champs likely won’t have to deal with the Lakers. The Heat. Jamal Murray. Etc etc. But again…it’s personal opinion. Your mileage may vary."
"I don’t know I feel like drawing a superstar talent to DEN via free agency is pretty likely if you have Jokic long term. Everybody wants to play with a guy with vision and a skill set to distribute the ball. Not to mention he plays a premium position @ C so it’s would be easy to pair him up with any type of wing/guard scorer.  MPJ is probably going to cost close to the max given his age, skill set, and physical/athletic attributes. He’s basically the perfect small-ball PF that fits in today’s game. For the record I’m not as skeptical on MPJ and his future prospects as I am on Jamal Murray. MPJ will always fit well with Jokic as he can thrive playing off ball."
We're watching Dillon Brooks become a star before our very eyes. Feels very similar to how Jamal Murray balled out last season in the post season
Jamal Murray?
Why on earth would Dallas even entertain the idea of trading Luka? Especially for Jamal Murray?
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it’s a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line…  Put the ball in Tyler Herro’s hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‘Gary Harris’ guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it’s the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He’s not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‘5 guys who average 15 a game’ blueprint has never worked"
"In a weird way, Jamal Murray? Not as good obviously"
"Out of Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine and SGA that always get compared to each people usually say something like Murray &gt; SGA &gt; Mitchell &gt; Booker = Lavine on defense."
"Lebron is old, AD injury prone  Kemba injury prone too, Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray just ""freak injuries"" that happen every year  Heat just incredible instance of overachievement last year  same with total ACL tears or other big ligament injuries this year, normal frequency nothing out of order"
"Jamal Murray. Everyone knows the Nuggets’ offense would be significantly better if Murray was healthy. I’m from Portland but I don’t think we’d have a shot in this series if Murray was still playing, and Barton and Dozier were here to help defend our guards."
I just don't want another Jamal Murray incident. They already lost that game but still played the final minutes and then that shit happened.
"Grant could guard 3s and 4s too but would also produce on offence. I'm just saying that our overall roster is not exactly better than last year, so the ceiling for this team would probably again be the WCF (assuming Murray would play insanely good again). These healthy Nuggets aren't better than the healthy Nets, Lakers, Sixers, Jazz, or maybe even Bucks. They had higher odds than every one of those teams on sportsbooks even before Jamal got injured, and I don't think sportsbooks would get it that wrong."
'm so mad Jamal Murray is injured. West would be wide open right now for Nuggets run. Ngl it looks like the East is better at the top seeds than the West
"I wish Jamal Murray was healthy, this seems like the perfect year for a Nuggets run :("
Ja Morant leads his team unlike Jamal Murray who is the second option.
"Completely disagree.. people ONLY complain because the Lakers smacked everyone.   Look at any Laker thread. It’s always pure hate towards them. Now people PRAISED  the Suns in the bubble, it was outstanding basketball and so impressive. People PRAISED  Jamal Murray, People PRAISED Spida and their dual and how it was amazing performances.  All love towards Luka and that match-up.  A historical comeback by the nuggets that won’t ever be forgotten.   Ohhhh Lakers won, well that shit was super easy. Somehow every NBA player turned into shells of themselves and it doesn’t count...."
So is it too soon to congratulate the Nets on their championship?   Would’ve been the Nuggets if Jamal Murray didn’t get hurt.
"Ja Morant isn't already a star though. Next season is when he shows if he's a star or not and takes it to the next level. He's having a good playoffs, like Jamal Murray. Doesn't make them stars.   Based off what would you say Darius Garland isn't above an average starter? Garland shot 45% from the field and 39% from 3.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/moranja01.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garlada01.html  Ja does more as he has the ball in his hands more not playing with a Sexton and a better roster and coach. They aren't crazy far apart in most categories.   I also have watched a good amount of Ja as he actually gets TV. How many times did you see Garland this year?   This isn't my first time making this statement. I'm standing by it and we'll see. Hopefully they'll be pointing this out in a couple years."
Jamal? As in Jamal Murray blowjob vid???
So from Jamal Murray to Jamal Murray
"From Dillon ""Jamal Murray"" Brooks, to Dillon Brooks"
"Uh oh. I’ve heard those words before, except Dillon Brooks was replaced with Jamal Murray"
Man I think the biggest thing I wish we had this year was Jamal Murray playing because we will never know if bubble fraud is real
"I have a dream: when King Lowry leaves, I want his replacement to be Jamal Murray. That would mean a lot for the city of Toronto"
I miss you so much Jamal Murray
PG - CP3  SG - DBook   SF - MPJ  PF - Aaron Gordon  C - Nikola Jokic  6th Man - Jamal Murray  Record I think would be 68-14
feel bad for nugs / jamal murray
Damn this is actually pretty close between all these guys 5 years into their careers. They’re all  great in their own different ways so it’s tough to perfectly list them. I’d probably say something like:  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons   Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis   I’m mainly basing this off who I would want in the playoffs.
"Jaylen Brown - best 2 way  Jamal Murray - best offensively  Ben Simmons - best defensively   Brandon Ingram - solid 2way wing, still want more  Pascal Siakam - will need to prove he's up to his pre-ASB 2020 self to jump ahead  Domantas Sabonis - Worst defensively, very talented, but not sure if it drives winning"
1) Jamal Murray  2) Jaylen Brown  3) Ben Simmons  4) Pascal Siakam  5) Domantas Sabonis  5) Brandon Ingram
"I like BI a lot but he hasn't been able to elevate his team to get to the post-season.  Jamal Murray is an elite second player on a title contender and elevates his play come playoff time.  It's not to day that BI couldn't do that but until I see that level, I'd keep them ranked that way."
Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons   Sabonis  Jamal Murray   Siakam   Ingram
jamal murray -healthy that is  ben simmons  jaylen brown  domantas sabonis  brandon ingram  pascal siakam
Jaylen Brown: I’m a biased Celtics fan  Jamal Murray: established second star on an elite team  Brandon Ingram: already a second star to a rising Zion but has shown consistent improvement  Pascal Siakam: championship winning 3rd option that would be a beautiful fit on the Celtics according to this biased Celtics fan  Ben Simmons: above Sabonis because he is elite at everything except shooting  Sabonis: below Simmons because as good as he is on offense he can’t defend well enough to be a primary big
Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Domantas Sabonis  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram   Pascal Siakam
Domantas Sabonis  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Jamal Murray
1. Jaylen Brown 2. Ben Simmons 3. Jamal Murray 4. Domantas Sabonis  5. Brandon Ingram 6. Pascal Siakam
There’s a guy named Jamal Murray that they should look into. He’d be a great fit next to Jokic
If only the nuggets had a good shooting secondary ball handler that might help. They should try for this Jamal Murray guy I've heard talked about before
"this team would looks so, so different with Jamal Murray and Will Barton in there.  All of a sudden everything you get from Millsap, Rivers, Campazzo &amp; Green would be found money instead of ""need to have it every night.""  We've all seen Aaron Gordon when a defense can key on him, it wasn't the best.  As a 4th guy who can play the Shawn Marion role and live off action from others he was pretty potent and Denver looked like the real McCoy."
MPJ - anti-vax vegan nuthouse  jamal murray - one of the most punchable faces you'll ever see  coach malone - kinda seems like a dickhead
"I think the suns will win, they are much better well rounded, and they have been on a roll in the playoffs. Especially with Jamal Murray out the suns will win this game, and the whole series."
"w.. why?  MPJ a future all star.  Jamal Murray streaky but hot as the sun when he’s on.  Malone a great guy, solid coach most of the time."
Jamal was getting praise for that for months lmao. If it weren’t for her we wouldn’t have gotten Bubble Murray.
"Just a dick pic, nobody cares about Jamal Murray** getting head in that insta either. Shit happens."
Nah. Jamal Murray was the GOAT in the Bubble. You can't expect to stop Luka. And Donovan is just special + they were coming off a Game 7. Let's not overreact.
Was he supposed to be called a superstar after that 1 playoff run then? People were still waiting to see him back it up. Same with Jamal Murray.  I swear people cry hate about anything. Mitchell is a baller. No one's hating on him when they don't call him a superstar for 1 run in the bubble.
"Blazers : CJ fractured back, dame played 4 Games dislocated finger and knee Injury, Collins injured during series   Rockets: Westbrook played hurt 18 ppg on 30% shooting, danuel house suspended   Nuggets: jamal Murray injured hamstring last 2 games   Heat: dragic torn ligament in foot, bam out for 2 games shoulder/neck strain    That’s why nobody else won"
"Jokic had a worthy season, but if Jamal Murray never got hurt Curry probably wins the award."
It would be over if Jamal Murray didn't get hurt because we'd see Jokic on a real contender and we'd see how big of a problem his defense and if you can actually win a title with an average ish defensive center
Trae young  Donovan mitchell Devin Booker  Joel embiid  Nikola jokic  Stephen curry  Klay Thompson Zion Williamson  Pascal Siakim Lebron james  Karl Anthony towns  Julius randle  Bradley Beal  Jaylen brown Tatum  Kyrie Irving Kevin Durant  Bam Adebayo James harden Jimmy butler De’aron Fox  Cp3  Jrue Holiday  Jamal Murray  Dame  Luka  AD Giannis  Kawhi  Ja morant  Brandon Ingram  Russell Westbrook  Ben Simmons  Zach Lavine  Jaylen Brown
"Jokic, after Jamal shoots 2/16: ""You're awful, Murray"""
Ngl I forgot about the Nuggets but no I dont see them winning that series. Their gonna miss Jamal Murray
"Maybe Murray? Amazing playoff run (Steph, 2013 Jamal,2020). Injury setbacks. Plus, Murray is probably the player that plays the most like Curry, with his offball interplay with Jokic."
Bro Denver has been more successful then you in the playoffs and if jamal Murray plays they might be the favorite
The disrespect to DPOY candidate Jamal Murray
"Still rising. Similar to Jamal Murray, his stellar playoff performance has to translate to the regular season"
"It's so constant. Some of these dudes either have no clue about basketball or let their personal feelings judge what they see. I can't stand Jamal Murray, his face just irks me but I'd be damned if I said he wasn't a pretty damn good ball player."
"Donovan Mitchell scored 57 in his first playoff game. Jamal Murray scored an insane amount of points. Teams that were there played there asses off, that title still matters IMO."
oh shit I thought it was Jamal Murray
had PHX in 6 since CP seems to be getting a bit more spry. you can tell with his midrange game and drives.  sucks jamal murray is out. this would've been the BKN-MIL game we thought it was gonna be.
"Jamal Murray makes this an entire different series.  With PHX and DEN's young cores, I expect to see a lot of post-season matchups"
"That Nuggets team had a Jamal Murray playing at god mode. Denver is totally solid, but to act like this Nuggets team is pretty much the same as last years is inaccurate."
"Replacing Austin Rivers, Facu and Markus Howard with Jamal Murray, Barton and Dozier would probably end games before OT lol"
"Jamal Murray missing is kind of a big deal though, given that he's their second best player and probably their best scorer"
Nuggets aint what the used to be. I'm not sure if it's only Jamal Murray missing that's making them look so inadequate but man... this is not anywhere near the powerhouse they were last couple years
Feels real bad that Jamal Murray is hurt :(
"Jamal Murray getting talked about more than anyone actually playing in the game. I get, having him would make this Denver team a monster."
"Yep, him, Jamal Murray and Will Barton. I thought there were murmurs of Barton coming back a few games ago but still no go. I'm amazed how well we're doing."
My current best casual fan doesn’t give a fuck/know a fuck roster:  PG: Jamal Murray   SG: Norman Powell  SF: khris Middleton  PF: John Collins  C: Deandre ayton
Denver making the finals without Jamal Murray would be amazing. Jokic is certified top 5 if that happens.
"Idk, I'm not sure anything will top the ""jamal Murray GF Jordan"" from last year. That one haunts me still"
"Part of it is Dallas just doesn't have a real 2nd option. It's masked a bit because Luka can shoulder that burden really well.  Like if the Mavs have someone besides him who can run an nba offense he probably doesn't score 35 per game, but they also probably win this series.  I think he definitely has the BBIQ to coexist beautifully with a Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker type scoring guard with playmaking skills. Someone to play off of who can also effectively run the offense while he takes breaks."
Damon shame Jamal Murray is out.
"Lol you seen Jokic play in the playoffs? He's 100% capable of being that guy. Jamal Murray isn't a true 2nd option on a Championship roster, a bunch of good roleplayers won't fix this. But it's not on Jokic, he's virtually unstoppable and his impact translates to the post season as he's supremely skilled."
Jamal Murray out here putting shots up. Dudes coming back from injury at warp speed
&gt; especially because we all know Jamal Murray plays winning basketball which Trae has yet to prove  What is this take...do people actually think like this?
I would rather pick Trae but I think an interesting question would be if Nuggets would rather have Trae Young or Jamal Murray as their PG since they don't need as much playmaking since they have Jokic and might value Murray's defense more.
"&gt; Ayton only averages 2.8 personal fouls this season, but against the Nuggets he’s totaled three, three and six fouls this season.  I'm pretty sure you wrote it this way to be intentionally misleading but yeah so he went from his season average of 3 fouls to 4 fouls? Given his success guarding Jokic 1 v 1, if Ayton stays out of foul trouble for two of every three games the Suns are winning in 6 easily.   Nuggets also played one of those regular-season games without Booker and another was the OT loss the night before in which he got injured in. In that game Jamal Murray traveled before hitting a game-tying three that went uncalled.   A shocker, the Suns were not very good without Devin Booker and followed up the Nuggets games with a loss to the Thunder. At that point the offense was still struggling to gel and they were 8-8. They have gone 47-15 since then.    Taking away anything from those games as a future predictor is really dumb idea. This whole post screams ""I am very smart"" but without having actually watching the games lol   One more thing Cleaning the Glass can tell you is since April 1, the Suns have had the best offense in the NBA."
"I agree with your list maybe add in Jamal Murray, and Jokic"
"Maybe if there was a 3 month off-season before this year's playoffs we could've seen every team at full strength (with some exceptions such as Jamal Murray)  Not saying we should do that, but if anything last year's playoffs were a more even playing field than most"
Confirming that Bubble Jamal Murray was total bullshit.
"I can't believe this guy got paid more than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown this season."
"Problem with the Portland statement is that the team they just lost to is in the same boat. Nobody teams up to play in Denver but alas here they are.     Jamal Murray (pick 7), Nikola Jokic (pick 41), Michael Porter Jr (pick 14), Monte Morris (pick 51), Capazzo (signed overseas),   Do better Portland"
Monte is a good one. I really hope the Nuggets use him more like they did in Game 6 in the pick and roll with Jokic. He's not Jamal Murray but he was still very effective in that role.
"The SGA and Jamal Murray injuries gutted our backcourt.  Also on a personal note, I live in Victoria where the qualifying tournament is taking place at the end of the month but they recently announced no spectators even though our case count is absurdly low so that fucking sucks."
"This article from april 18th had missed 15% of games this season which is the 2nd highest ever since the 1972 season and there has been a higher number of double digit blowout wins than any season since 1972. This seasons mvp race every candidate besides jokic missed major time, lebron, embiid, kd, and harden. In the playoffs we've seen mitchell, harden, embiid, davis, brown, kemba, and jamal murray all miss playoff games or not play at all. Players getting covid to the point where teams like the wizards just missed like 10 days of play and all the covid protocols made this season one of most anomaly filled ones ever along with the 99 season where an 8 seed made the finals."
"Of course it applied to every team. That's how you end up with Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell turning into prime Steph Curry for a series.   Things that would never happen happened, for any team. It was nothing like a normal title run."
Canada is missing Jamal Murray who would have been huge for this
"&gt; Just looking at the West. Would you take KP over Ayton/Booker, Jamal Murray, Gobert/Bogdanovic, or Paul George? Those are all the second options he's competing with, and I'd throw in at least a first to swap with any of them.  As if any of those teams would accept KP and a low first for any of those players"
"nice. i been looking for that fear factor like you said but havent seen it (probably because just watching highlights.) ill watch more.   also i guess just miss the absolute ""killer"" vibes of MJ or Kobe. see it in Jamal Murray tho but I want to be a fan of Book, lol"
"Honestly most of our role players are fine. THJ, DFS, Kleber, Brunson are guys you can definitely have contribute on a championship team. Our problem is that our second best player is considerably worse than any other remaining playoff team's second best player.   Just looking at the West. Would you take KP over Ayton/Booker, Jamal Murray, Gobert/Bogdanovic, or Paul George? Those are all the second options he's competing with, and I'd throw in at least a first to swap with any of them.  Our problem is that Luka has to play god mode for 40 minutes for us to have a chance. We need someone else who can be the focal point sometimes and suddenly we are a championship competitive team."
"Without Jamal Murray, I’m sure"
"This was against the Nuggets last year not this series. Kawhi blocked a Jamal Murray dunk... not literally with a single finger but it definitely was just one or two fingertips, and this image was born"
Luka played against a team that could very well take the West. With Chris Paul hurt and a Jamal Murray less Nuggets their only true contention is the Jazz. I mean that’s a heavy contention but still
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
"I mean, let's be real here. Kidd doesn't want the job. The Dame thing is \*very\* convenient if you want a way to say no but you don't want to have to make it clear that you think the Blazers are going no where any time soon with their roster. He doesn't want to be tied to an organization that's nearing the end of a prosperous time and is almost certainly going to have to enter a rebuilding phase within the next few years in a small market.  Switch the Blazers out for the Nuggets or the Suns and I guarantee Kidd doesn't give a shit if Jamal Murray or Devin Booker publicly calls for him to be their next coach."
"The way Jamal Murray played in the bubble, he certainly was at the time. Same goes for Jimmy Butler."
Was Jamal Murray a top 10 player going into this season after the last playoffs?
"Jamal Murray, Zeke Naiji, Bol Bol, and 3-4 future picks would do it lol"
"&gt; It’s not blindly taking backcourt players,  Yes it is, when you say ""the 6'8"" PG... everytime"" that is blindly taking it.   &gt;The proof is simply in the success the guy has had with the lack of supporting cast he has around him.  I disagree about Luka's supporting cast. I really think if the Mavs didn't have Luka instead but had another starting caliber PG they would be a team somewhere between the Nets and Clippers 2019 teams before they had any stars but both still made the playoffs. Both teams had no stars but just had a solid roster with no holes. The Mavs are a deep solid team that is very well coached but Luka gets all the credit because he has an insane volume. The team he has had these last two years is better than any Lebron team before he went to the Heat. I think if the Mavs had a PG somewhere between Malcom Brogdon and Jamal Murray tier they would still be around the same record wise. If they had CP3 or Lillard instead, I actually think they would have had a better record this year. People are seeing these godly insane volume stats from Luka so it makes it seem blasphemous not to give him much of the credit. I have many reasons to doubt these stats that I can go into but it looks like both of us have made up our minds and going on further would be pointless especially when you make statements like ""In the nba today I’m taking the 6ft 8 pg over the center **everytime.**"""
"divincenzo is out, but obviously he is not on the same level as the others: ad, jamal murray, embiid, cp3, and harden"
"This year LBJ, AD, KD, Harden, Jamal Murray, Kawhi, and Embiid all missed significant stretches due to injury, and half of those guys will have missed playoff games as a result. Those seasons are not comparable to this shit lol"
Remember in 2021 when AD/Harden/Embiid/CP3/Jaylen Brown/Jamal Murray got injured
Luka is by far better than both and would b the head player on either team. But if you flipped teams with fox and morant. Not entirely sure my gut says they make the playoffs..but do i think fox performed as well than morant in his first playoffs. That is really up in the air could fold could go straight Jamal murray.
"Denver with AD wouldn't have enough playmaking. With a healthy Jamal Murray, of course but it's a different story. LeBron and Jokic with the current supporting cast.. it's difficult.. Defense liability would be obvious"
Jamal Murray did it better
That’s first player in NBA history Jamal Murray.
"Don't stop there.  The Suns beat a Lakers team missing Anthony Davis, a Nuggets team missing Jamal Murray and a Clippers team missing Kawhi Leonard.  Flip *any* of those injuries and the Suns would have been the underdog."
"&gt;No. No it’s not at all. Playmaking is not dependent on scoring, not even a little bit. Steve Nash is one of the greatest playmakers in NBA history, he never averaged 20 points a game. Magic Johnson is THE greatest playmaker of all time, he never averaged over 24 a game. Chris Paul is one of the two or three greatest playmakers of his generation, he never averaged over 23 a game. Scoring ability and playmaking operate together, but playmaking is NOT dependent on scoring ability at all. I played legit high level competitive basketball as a point guard, including in high school against guys that made the league, but you want to pretend like I’m a dude who got my knowledge of the game through podcast lmao. Fuck no, don’t project your bullshit on to me, I’m an actual student of the game.   They weren't as crippled as Ben Simmons who refuses to shoot from anywhere on the floor that isn't 3 feet from the rim. All of those guys were threats from elsewhere on the floor and could hit their ft's consistently which is something that Ben can't do.   &gt;How tf are you simultaneously going to argue that playmaking is dependent on scoring ability while also saying Jamal Murray isn’t a great playmaker?!?!?! He should be your best case argument for that lmao, shitting on your own takes. “You only want to read what fits your narrative” is laughable, I encourage anyone who reads this to look over the two or three arguments I’ve had with this dry ass Ayton hater and decide who that’s more applicable to. Feel like you’ll see pretty quickly.  I said scoring and playmaking were tied to each other. If Jamal Murray had a better feel for the game he'd be a much more effective playmaker than Ben Simmons, I mean why do people want Ben Simmons to shoot the goddamn ball? Because teams can't pack the paint and play the passing lanes since they know he **won't** shoot.  But keep on quoting me without context and trying to paint a narrative that doesn't exist."
"I mean, even this post-season .... Paul made the Finals, but no Anthony Davis, no Jamal Murray, no Kawhi....    The path was pretty easy for Paul and the Suns, compared to other seasons."
"Jimmy Butler is top 5, Luka is already a top 40-50 player of all time, Jamal Murray is top 10, are all takes I heard last year lol."
"Lebron wasn’t injured - there’s a difference between hurt and injured. He played the whole series. Chris Paul was hurt that series too.  Would Jamal Murray have made that big of a difference? The Suns won each game with relative ease in that series. Even if Murray was there, he’d take shots from Jokic and Ayton did a good job on him. Sure, they might have won more than 0 games but to say they would win the series is pretty out there.   We didn’t have CP3 for the first 2 games of the Clippers series, he was recovering from COVID when he came back, he had some torn ligaments in his wrist, so when he finally starts feeling better he drops 41 and we beat them by 30 while they get an extra 21 FTs. This team swept the Jazz in the reg season. To say the Clippers would have won this series is also a little out there, while I think it would have changed to 7 games I could still see the Suns beating the Clippers with both teams at full strength. Book was also playing with a broken nose this series and the mask was clearly affecting him."
"&gt;Does he not have elite playmakers now? I mean Ayton was averaging 16/10 on 61% TS as a rookie with 39 year old Jamal Crawford and Isaiah Canaan as the primary point guards... you don’t think he would’ve loved to have Jeff Teague?   Look at what KAT was averaging his rookie season and then compare. And no I don't think so because Teague would have dribbled the air out of the ball and refused to pass to him (he did this to KAT constantly). Teauge in his ""prime"" was a scoring PG not a playmaking one.  &gt;Cool, shift the goalposts. I said name centers without an elite guard creating for him, Simmons absolutely does that and it’s not debatable, even if Embiid creates a shitload of his own shots too.   But Simmons isn't an ""elite PG"", he's an elite player because of his other attributes but as a playmaker he leaves a lot to be desired.  &gt;Cool, you said Jokic is a top 10 center who doesn’t have an elite playmaking guard. That, again, is just wrong no matter how you frame it.   Because Murray isn't an elite playmaking guard? He's a SG who's to small to be the SG so he plays PG.   &gt;Either you don’t know the absolute basics of basketball, or your hate boner for Ayton is absolutely blinding you while you’re watching the games then. Ayton has like 2-4 shots a game he creates for himself, your biased ass probably just thinks hitting 15 foot baseline fadeaways are spoonfed buckets he didn’t create for himself because there was an assist. That’s not how that works.  It's a ""hate boner"" to think that the guy isn't as **good** as you scream he is? So he has 2-4 shots he creates for himself out of the 8 he takes?  Again if he could create for himself don't you think he'd be shooting a lot more?"
"&gt;So KAT doesn’t play with the guy who was second in assists per game last year? Plus DLo, who was an allstar almost entirely based on his playmaking. But DBook and Cam Payne are what’s doing it for Ayton lol.   KAT was an all star and all NBA with Jeff Teague as his PG.... And D'lo was an all star for his scoring primarily (not to mention they've barely played together)   &gt;Simmons is an elite playmaker and it would be insane to say otherwise, he’s just not the scorer most elite playmakers are.   He's a PG who can't run the halfcourt offence and can't run the p&amp;p. Give Embiid a PG who can shoot and you'd actually see him excell.   &gt;You’ve been crying about Jamal Murray not playing in the playoffs against the Suns, now he’s not an elite playmaker? Not to mention Jokic is much more of a ball handler and playmaker himself than any other center in NBA history  Because Jokic is the primary playmaker for the Nuggets?   &gt;Yes, it is bs to say he can’t create for himself. Like clearly not even watching the game, just letting your bias be confirmed when he does hit an open shot in the lane and ignored all the other shots.  Because he can't? I've watched KAT,Embiid and Jokic play and yes I've **watched** Ayton play. If you'd make a mixtape of all of Ayton's buckets these playoffs they'd either be putbacks or dunks, that's not creating for yourself.  I really don't get why you all find this offensive. Like its literally a fact that Ayton won't be given the ball to backdown the opposing big man and score in the post or he won't be spotting up or shooting off the dribble. Do you know the reason for that? Because he can't do any of that or can't do it at a clip where you can justify giving him the ball."
"So KAT doesn’t play with the guy who was second in assists per game last year? Plus DLo, who was an allstar almost entirely based on his playmaking.

I would love to be Jamal Murray for uhm many reasons.
Wasn't that the game where Murray shot a 3 with like 2 seconds left when everybody was just letting the game end?  I love me some Jamal but fuck man... You just don't do that. That'd get you a black eye in the 80s/90s.
"Considering we beat the fully healthy lakers game 1 with CP3 shoulder jacked up and unable to dribble, and swept the Nuggets and the MVP who were the 3rd seed still after almost 2 months of no Jamal Murray, yes I think it’s very possible we still make it"
It is extremely weak no kawhi ad Giannis Lebron tray young or Jamal Murray in the playoffs or finals at this point. The eastern conference will have no all stars most likely. All role players.
"The dude took out Westbrook's knee after a timeout in 2014 and knocked him out for the entire playoffs. He horse collar fouled Jamal Murray last year and tried to hurt him by falling on his legs in the process. This isn't an isolated incident with him. It doesn't matter how hard he plays or how well he performs in his role, if he's trying to hurt people, especially after whistles and even with their back turned, that's the definition of a bum imo. Bush league, not even g league"
Also nearly took out Jamal Murray last year: https://youtu.be/Ga-P_7QQgA8
"He is. But he's not ""that"" guy. The guy you need to take over a game. Giannis is a limited superstar. In a tie game with one possession, you can't just give Giannis the ball and clear out. He needs that other guy. Like the way, Jokic has Jamal Murray. Middleton and Holiday have shown that they're just really good role players. He needs a robin and the Bucks still don't have one."
A lot of the injuries are just freak accidents or people who already injury prone players. The only injury I’d say could contribute to such a condensed schedule was Jamal Murray and even then he was already hurt and in a game where they had it won.
"6 all stars was the previous NBA record. Not some regular occurrence lmao. And yes a 65% increase over the previous NBA record for the most all stars to miss a game during the playoffs is indeed ""crazy.""  Especially because that 10 doesn't even include star players like Trae Young or Jamal Murray who hardly missed the all star game; or stars like LeBron that were noticeably slowed down by injuries but didnt miss any games."
"It is close but I personally have Nash above Paul.  IT above both.    36 year old Nash would make the finals too on this roster.  Paul's a better defender but who did he have to defend these playoffs?  Schroeder?  No Jamal Murray.  Pat Bev?  As much of a better defender CP3 is over Nash, he can't stop any of the top PGs in the league either.  Hasn't been able to in the past 4 or 5 years. In the playoffs Nash was more consistent too and did more with less.  Got to the WCF one season when Amare was hurt.  CP3 always seems to get hurt too.  Meanwhile Nash get's elbowed in the face and the swelling closes his eye and he still puts away the Spurs.    I also prefer Nash because he helped change how offense is played today.  Paul is an all around great point guard with little to no flaws(aside from his height which isn't his fault).  Basically the prototypical point guard.  But Nash was literally a wizard on the offensive end.  The 7 seconds or less style was something that was never really seen before with such success and it was so much fun to watch.  He would honestly be even more effective if he was in his prime during this era.  Nash averaged 43% from 3 and only shot like 4 threes a game.  Imagine if he had doubled that volume.   Nothing against CP3.  He is a great point guard on a championship caliber team.  But to me Nash was the engine that ran one of the most revolutionary teams ever.  Those Suns should've won at least once.  Ring or no ring I personally prefer Nash slightly but I'm not gonna tell anyone they are wrong for preferring CP3."
"&gt;He also tried to pull this shit last year against Jamal Murray.  There's been way too many cases.     You could add up all the other hated players - Zaza, Draymond, CP3, etc. and it still wouldn't be same amount of actual injuries as Beverley has done all by himself."
"I don’t mind it tbh from this season the shoe is somewhat on the other foot and though I’m happy that a Suns team I knew was gonna shock a lot of people this season surprised even me, it feels somewhat unsatisfying knowing they have a free run at the ring with Harden, Giannis, Kyrie, Kawhi, AD, Jamal Murray all injured. I still could see them beating all those team fully healthy besides the Nets but it’s tough they never even got the opportunity to"
"1 or 2 series I can understand what you're saying. A bench player, x factor type player important role player I can understand your point.   But when it's literally every single series missing KEY players....not talking about role players or x factors, were talking about star power to the highest degree.....it ain't nothing special what the Suns got going, literally the most underwhelming Finals since KD went to GoldenState. And yes if Kawhi was healthy I don't think the Suns would win, maybe they beat the Lakers with a healthy AD/Bron as well as the Nuggets with Jamal Murray.   And guess who they get to play in the finals?!?! Either a Bucks team with their best player injured or the Hawks with their best player injured and no DeAndre Hunter.   Its just weird as fuck"
"at least we'll have probably 30 of them to look forward to the next five months lmao after seeing ""is Jamal Murray already a top five player?"" and ""is Jamal Murray better than Harden now?"" all off season, nothing will surprise me"
"I dont know about easily. The nuggets didnt have jamal murray, utah had mike conley out, even the lakers had a hobbled lebron and no AD.   Do i think fully healthy the clippers were the best team? Probably. But easily wouldn’t be the word id use for the western conference."
Didn’t have a max contract player Jamal Murray who was easily their best player last playoffs
I'll say this then I'm out. Kawhi and AD both have extensive injury history. Their issues with injuries is a constant. Nobody should be shocked.   Jamal Murray has been out for awhile and the Blazers still managed to triumph over a lot of teams and squash the Blazers.   We played who was in front of us. We were the 2 seed no some underdog scratching their way from the bottom.
"The fuck? You’re comparing injuries to Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard all in one run to what the Lakers faced last year? Suns fans have gone off the deep end lmao.  The Lakers probably would’ve beat the full strength Heat anyways. The Suns probably would’ve lost to the Lakers and Clippers."
"They are moreso rewarded for playing 3 teams all missing star players. AD and Lebron both injured, no Jamal Murray, and no Kawhi/Ibaka.   Definition of a cakewalk. And now either of the 2 East teams will limp into the finals."
Yes lol. Historically so. He injured KD. Someone linked his dirty play against Jamal Murray last season. and plenty others. He talks a lot of shit and plays dirty.
"Would a backcourt of Jamal Murray and Barton/PJ have helped the Nuggets over a backcourt of a free agent and a rookie? Tough call but, I'll say yes."
and jamal murray  and mike conley  and lebron
Anthony Davis Jamal Murray  kawhi Leonard and now either giannis or tray
"Bad guys? Clippers came back from 0-2 twice. With Kawhi, they would've swept the suns. If anything, the suns are the bad guys. They won against a poor lakers team without AD, and lebron doing all the work. They won against a poor nuggets team without Jamal Murray, and jokic doing all the work. They won against a growing clippers team without Kawhi, and a tired Paul George. Now, they're gonna go up against possibly  either a hawks team without trae or a bucks team without giannis. And to add, they have Chris Paul, who's hit the floor more times than he's actually shot this series"
No Anthony Davis No Jamal Murray No Kawhi Leonard and No Giannis or Trae Young Suns ring should come with a pair of crutches
[He also tried to pull this shit last year against Jamal Murray.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga-P_7QQgA8)
I’m just pointing out that a poll put together by ESPN and Vegas odds don’t have more merit than basketball references MVP tracker.   The fact is both were viewed as neck and neck and this was before Jamal Murray went down and Jokic carried harder.
"Partially, Suns faced a Lakers team without Anthony Davis, a Denver team without Jamal Murray and now a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard, it's almost identical to the Warriors first title run just with more star power being out. Warriors faced a Pelicans team with a hobbled Eric Gordon.... A Grizzlies team who missed Conley in the first game arguably their second best player after Gasol, fully healthy Rockets squad and then a Cavs team basically without the 2 best players after LeBron.  Overall it's about the same in improbability since those Warriors is obviously a better team than the Suns this season and the level of competition the Suns faced is skewed since the teams they faced so far didn't have their number 2 or even number 1 option in Kawhi. However without CP3 being out I guess it cancels out Kawhi being gone."
"De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray"
lol looks whos talking. You're an AD hamstring from being a 1st round exit and a Jamal Murray ACL from being a 2nd round exit and a Kawhi Leonard knee from being a 3rd round exit
He walked under Jamal Murray in the closing seconds of Clippers/Nuggets Game 7 last year. I definitely remember him diving at LeBron's knees during a fast break in the Lakers/Clippers bubble game. No one was hurt either time fortunately so they're not talked about as much.
"Yeah, except Jamal Murray isn’t a top 20 all time kinda guy"
I’m still mad the NBA voted on a shortened offseason. The injuries have been HORRIBLE this year. I was so excited to see Jamal Murray in the playoffs. 24 and has to rehab his injury for at least 12 months. Anthony Davis and his knee injury. Etc.
I mean it's pretty obviously injuries. Jamal Murray was obviously out and now kawhi is out. The Suns have also had their own issues with Paul so it's not like any of the teams in the west are full strength
They called this same BS a few years ago when McCollum knocked it out of bounds against Jamal Murray in a similar situation.
Give me Jamal Murray
"2019 Coby White, North Carolina – Chicago Bulls   2018 Wendell Carter Jr., Duke – Chicago Bulls   2017 Lauri Markkanen, Arizona – Minnesota Timberwolves   2016 Jamal Murray, Kentucky – Denver Nuggets   2015 Emmanuel Mudiay, Guangdong Tigers – Denver Nuggets   2014 Julius Randle, Kentucky – Los Angeles Lakers   2013 Ben McLemore, Kansas – Sacramento Kings   2012 Harrison Barnes, North Carolina – Golden State Warriors   2011 Bismack Biyombo, Congo – Sacramento Kings   2010 Greg Monroe, Georgetown – Detroit Pistons     2/10 times in the last 10 years the picks actually hit at 7, would I give up someone like Ben Mclemore and Wiggins for Dlo?

"I think it's because the Bubble is the only time we've ever seen Murray be ""that guy"" for a long stretch. I feel like if you asked the average NBA fan how many points Jamal Murray averaged last year they would be so far off. He averaged 18 points a game last year. He wasn't even a good scorer by modern NBA's standards. He went nuclear in the playoffs out of nowhere though."
Noone expected Jamal Murray to explode like that.
Jamal Murray is really good. He was great in the bubble and then struggled early in the season so I know this subreddit was ripping on him. He's a similar player to Donovan Mitchell. Not always the most consistent player but when the lights are bright they play well and can carry a team.  MVP Jokic + playoff Murray would have been really fun to watch. Porter could have just done his thing as the third option and Aaron Gordon could have focused on his defense and energy more so. I know there were a ton of injuries for these playoffs but I feel this one was one of the biggest.
"Dwight Howard is a lock, Ginobili as well, Blake Griffin is borderline I know he said injuries but if he could maybe get a couple more All-Star appearances or at least be a valuable contributor to this Nets team on a championship level that could get him in         Jimmy Butler's borderline, and the NBA right now is so guard heavy, there are some damn good guards that I could see not making it just because of the competition level obviously he's injured now but look at a Jamal Murray even compared to his other peers that are 25 and younger just as an example so it's tough to say"
The nuggets could cut Jamal Murray and sign Jamal Crawford if they wanted to for some odd reason
"The Nuggets and Bucks’ success required a lot of luck. A few teams were very high on Giannis. I’ve got a great anecdote in the book about Danny Ferry trying to trade up past Milwaukee to get him. Denver, they didn’t know Jokic was going to be the MVP when they drafted him at 41, and they also got lucky the Pelicans took Buddy Hield over Jamal Murray. Nailing the draft has a lot of layers"
But does the carpet match the drapes?  \-Jamal Murray
"Jamal Murray is Canadian, OG is British"
"Kawhi and Jamal Murray for me. While all injuries suck, I just find it quite deflating to see new contenders for a title lose their chances due to injuries."
"I think potentially you could have found 1 team willing to take BI over him, but I can't think of any other player. At the time it's a two player draft. Turns out you got All-stars and All-NBA players like Sabonis, Jaylen Brown, Pascal, Malcolm Brogdon. Otherwise, you got Jamal Murray, Buddy Hiedl, Dejaunte Murray, and Levert. Not a wonderful class there. In fact only Pascal and Ben have been on an All-NBA team."
5 All Stars plus Jamal Murray is a weak class? I know there may not be any HOF’er but that still seems like a pretty strong class.
"I think the players now in contention for the number one pick for a redraft would be Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Sabonis, or Ingram. I don't think Simmons is better than any of them tbh."
