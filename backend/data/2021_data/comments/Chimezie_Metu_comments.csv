They desperately need wings though. Starting Chimezie Metu or Marvin Bagley alongside Richaun Holmes is not going to be a winning formula nor is 30 minutes a night of Moe Harkless.
"I mentioned this elsewhere, but I think it's fair to throw out the games/performances from every Nigerian athlete. The [nonsense](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/31925820/chimezie-metu-questions-nigeria-government-lack-support) they had to deal with would cause problems for any athlete.  The Olympic Committee and country reps fucked up their travel, lodging, and testing. They arrived late, players were given incorrect information, coaches were stuck in quarantine, players couldn't practice and workout, etc."

"None of this is that bad. Jonas V literally yanked Chimezie Metu down after he dunked on him (breaking his wrist in the process). But nah, making a hard (but  clean) foul when the game is over and the other team is trying to disrespect you in the final seconds is bad. Sayings it’s an undercut is such a stretch. Gtfo lol. This shit happens all of the time, it’s just you casuals that love to latch on to these narratives. Oh and he accidentally hits Parker in the face when trying to poke the ball away. Lol gimme a break.  Edit: and even his screen foul in this last game was overblown. How many times does a guy that is 100 pounds heavier than him do this? Again, gimme a break. He’s probably talking shit because Bev (at175 pounds) somehow injured Jeff Green at 230 or whatever. You guys are ridiculous."
they allowed chimezie metu to have his wrist broken with no flagrant.  They then ejected JJ Redick for bouncing the ball too hard at the Almighty Referee.  The league says smashing a man down off the board is safer than merely tapping a referee.

"Hi I’ve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I’m not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that’s assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs— and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I’m expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he’s at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it’s been in like 10 years. Yeah, it’s not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we’ll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we’re gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go “wow we had no idea they were gonna be so good” I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"

Chimezie Metu from the Kings. Loved him at USC. Solid rebounder/hustle guy. And he's even added a serviceable 3 point shot which he never had in college
"Not really. Nigeria’s leading scorer, Gabe Vincent, averages 12 minutes a game in the NBA. Josh Okogie averages 5 ppg in the NBA. Chimezie Metu averages 6 ppg.    Mills and Ingles are legit NBA players, but they’re role players. This whole thread is full of jokes about Keldon Johnson, and he’s better than anybody on either Australia or Nigeria. Team USA played 7 NBA All Stars."
The Kings are prepared to offer one Chimezie Metu. Fox and Halliburton are still off the table.
"\&gt; Most of these guys on the roster were helping their NBA squad try to get into the playoffs a few months ago  Team USA has like 5 guys that average more ppg INDIVIDUALLY than Josh Okogie, KZ Okpala, Gabe Vincent, Ekpe Udoh, Michael Gbinije, Chimezie Metu in the NBA combined. Combined.  Granted smaller roles and less overall playing time, these guys aren't even in the same stratosphere at least yet. They are all bench players / rotational players. I mean Gabe Vincent is averaging 4.8ppg and .38 fg%.  You acting like you're some kind of basketball savant that saw this coming is incredibly disingenuous.  The reality is 7 guys shooting between 50-100% from 3 is highly unlikely (understatement) to be sustained and USA will adjust."
"Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat   KZ Okpala, Miami Heat   Miye Oni, Utah Jazz    Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves   Jordan Nwora, Milwaukee Bucks   Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings   Jahlil Okafor, Detroit Pistons   Gabe Vincent, Miami Heat  Alzo Michael Gbinije and Ekpe Udoh have experience in the NBA."
"NBA players on their roster include:  Precious Achiuwa, Kezie Okpala, Miye Oni, Josh Okogie, Jordan Nwora, Chimezie Metu, Ekpe Udoh, Jahlil Okafor, Gabe Vincent."
Isaac Bonga/Chimezie Metu/Jevon Carter. An unstoppable trio.

Put some respect on Spurs standout Chimezie Metu
"We were missing literally our entire starting front court for almost all of this game. We ran a Marvin Bagley/Alex Len combo for most of crunch time. We had Chimezie Metu and Terence Davis guarding LeBron at times. This is the gutsiest win I can remember, but the Lakers should be ashamed"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Here's something I wrote for a different Kings post (after the Luke Walton firing).  ---------  As far as roster goes, I think everyone's movable at the right price. However, the biggest issue is the lack of decent players at every non-PG position. Peep their depth chart.  PG: Fox | Davion Mitchell | Jah'mius Ramsey  SG: Haliburton (also PG) | Terence Davis | Robert Woodard II  SF: Barnes | Hield | Mo Harkless  PF: Metu | Bagley  C: Holmes | Len | TT | Damian Jones  Let's get the first issue out of the way. Their roster stinks. They have maybe 5 rotation-level players (Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes/Hield). But then what?  Davion Mitchell is an all-D, no-O rookie for now. Terence Davis has some scoring ability, but is rightfully stuck behind three decent guards and D Mitchell.  Mo Harkless has been a body at his recent stops. They've started Mo Harkless in 11 games. They started Chimezie Metu recently. Not saying either is bad bad, but would either even be getting playing time on most teams?  Alex Len has been hanging on in the league by a thread for a few years now and wouldn't be able to play onto most contenders' rosters. TT is washed (partially because of the direction the NBA took) and is a walking trade chip at this point.  Ramsey and Woodard would be two-ways at best on most teams. I don't think Damian Jones has ever been good, even when he was on the Warriors. And Bagley hardly plays.  You look at other mediocre rosters and they all either are clearly developmental (Rockets, Thunder) or they have at least 8-10 NBA level players on the roster, if not more.  The Warriors, Phoenix, Utah, Wizards, Nets, Bulls, Heat, Cavs, Bucks, 76ers, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, and Knicks all have a decent list of players who they can play who aren't complete liabilities (that's half the league, at least). Even for the 4-11 Spurs, you can point to 8 guys who should be on a contender's 10 man rotation (depending on positional excess). The Kings pretty much only have five rotation-quality players, and no amount of coaching will salvage that.  -----------  Their roster is talent-dry AND they don't enough have any assets worth a damn. They have +2 second rounders in total. That's it."
Damn the front office gave Luke Walton a roster where Chimezie Metu is your starting forward and really thought he'd be able to take this team to the playoffs.   What a joke.

"I don't understand how Walton thought these adjustments would save his job.  You had four dynamic guards in which you could have three of them in at any time. You had switchability on the perimeter and passable spacing even if all Harkless did was flit around the perimeter and miss too many open 3s. Hence Barnes could shoot 8 threes a game and thrive doing it and get downhill whenever he wanted. You even had a big body in Len that could help stem you physicality/rebounding problem.  Was it even particularly good? No, and the 4 game slide proves that. They're missing another forward. They choke too much. But if you kept at that, I could've easily seen him keeping his job. Their net rating was the best since '06.  Then he completely flips the switch and goes with full-sized lineups again. At ALL times. He doesn't even just start with a full-sized lineup, if Metu isn't in, Bagley is. He forces Barnes back to be a full-time goddamned 3, kills the spacing, clogs the paint, and kills the switchability on defense.  This is the guy who has played Kyle Kuzma and Harrison Barnes at C. He goes to this NOW?!  And all of this for the saviors of Chimezie Metu and Marvin Bagley. For their rebounding problem. When neither of them are good defensive rebounders.  Bottom line is they were a flawed team that was using its best attributes to its advantage.  May make some statement wins, may lose pretty badly. But ever since the OKC game, they've looked like a bottom 3 team.  He has to be smoking rock."
"Let's just say out of Alex Len, Hassan Whiteside, Damian Jones, and Chimezie Metu, he's easily the worst"
