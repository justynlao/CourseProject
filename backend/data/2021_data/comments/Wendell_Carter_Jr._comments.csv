"Coby White, Garrett Temple, Patrick Williams or Otto Porter Jr, Thaddeus Young, Wendell Carter Jr. Not the worst pretty good."
"I'm a Coby fan, but people who don't like him aren't unreasonable in my eyes because he might be legitimately the worst defensive player in the NBA, not exaggerating.  Wendell Carter Jr is also pretty polarizing on the sub. I was shocked to learn a lot of fans want him traded. With him being out for a few weeks now I think a lot of those people are gonna have their minds changed about his role."
"I'm still convinced the Bulls should have drafted this kid instead of Wendell Carter Jr at the #7 pick during that draft year.  The Bulls were just starting their rebuild having blown up the roster the season before, so taking a chance on an injured former consensus #1 overall draft pick was a very low risk, high reward move for them.  They would have had to redshirt him his first year like Denver did, but that would have netted them a better draft pick the subsequent year (it was #7 again, Coby White) and they could have rolled in to last year with Dunn, Markkanen, LaVine, Porter, and a top 5 pick from 2019 heading in to last year."
"Yeah, they have different skill sets. And Embiid is amazing. But if I were a GM on most teams, I’d take Jokic over Embiid if I were lucky enough to have that choice to make. What I’m saying isn’t wildly controversial, people debate this all the time, and I readily admit Embiid is an amazing player, so I’m not sure why you’re acting as if I said Wendell Carter Jr is better than Rudy Gobert or some ridiculous shit."
"We would have taken Wendell Carter JR, which would've given us a superstar lineup of Dennis Smith Jr, Wesley Matthews, Dorian Finney Smith, Harrison Barnes, and WCJ. I'm sure we would've gotten at least 8 wins that year :)"
"OKC Fan: I fucking love this team. Dort is a reddit darling and MIP candidate. Shai is the super star you build around. Baze is still only in his second year and getting better. Theo Maledon looks like he should have been a top 20 pick. Poku is a meme lord atm but has a crazy ceiling.   I'd argue every player on the squad sans Horford and Hill are underrated. Even Roby and Kenny ""hustle"" Williams are actual NBA players.   With the situation we're in (picks for days) we're the least applicable team for this hypothetical. Reading though this thread though I'd LOVE to have some of these guys people are giving up on.   Colby White, Lauri Markennen (sp), Wendell Carter Jr... Bulls you want to go for the playoffs?... Have Hill and Horford.   &amp;#x200B;  John Collins... He'd be awesome in OKC.   &amp;#x200B;  Bagley. Kings WANT to be good. George Hill and Muscala for Bagley?"

"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Junior, Denzel Valentine, Tomas Satoransky, Patrick William, Gafford (idk his first name)"
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
"i have one with lavine, markkanen, wendell carter jr, and otto porter jr... surprisingly it hasn’t been that bad but kind of funny to be ride or die with the bulls"
"&gt; Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I mean, most of those players shoot well below league average on 3's, a few &lt; 30%. I would argue there's only a few true stretch 5's   &gt;  Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP  On that list, 40% play the 4 more than the 5. That's my point, we are seeing more an evolution of the 4 than we are of the 5. Your center is still most likely the bruiser inside rim protector they have always been."
"Wendell Carter, Jr. really needs to work on his three-point shooting.  He's 3/14 for the season.  Granted, he's shooting about twice as many threes per game as in his first two seasons, but it still amounts to about one attempt per game, and one make every three games."
"You are right that most are there for their defense/rebounding like Gobert, WCS, Biyombo, Drummond, Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Capela, Adams, etc.  But there are also many that can spread the floor (some much better than others) like Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I think it depends on the team's playstyle because sometimes the 4 is more defensively oriented and/or the 5 is more for spacing. Many of the best centers can shoot pretty well like Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP, if they're playing the 5. Also, Vucevic? I know the drop off is steep from the top 3/5 but I think he's pretty comfortably like 6 or 7th."
"Yeah he's 109th in Usage%. Below random guys like Horford, Wendell Carter Jr., Kuzma, Kanter, etc."
"Would I be foolish to want to trade MPJ for Patrick Williams + Wendell Carter Jr?   Part of me thinks so because MPJ could be really, really special. I'm pretty convinced he could average 25+ PPG on 50/40% splits *right now* with the right team/role.   But on the other hand, it also feels like pretty good value unless I'm overestimating Williams and/or WCJ"
"Most surprising: maybe Gafford, he’s been really good as a center coming off the bench. Disappoint: probably Wendell Carter Jr, he had a really good game today but literally ever game Stacey King points out shit he does wrong on defense"

How has Wendell Carter Jr been this season Bulls fans?
Wendell Carter Jr. is not a bad defensive player and Embiid just ate him alive
Brogdon  They need a true pass first point guard who can run the offense. A horford like center who can pass the ball would be great like Wendell carter jr.  Lonzo would be nice too.
"It makes no sense for the Wolves to make this deal. They have their franchise cornerstone, why trade him for a guy who’s just a worse big man in Lauri, and a Center without superstar potential in Wendell Carter Jr. Rebuilding teams don’t trade away young franchise players, I’d say there’s a 0% chance that KAT is traded within the next 2 seasons."
At least Chicago have Wendell Carter Jr &amp; Thad Young. And with no Lowry it’s gonna be rough. I’m just hoping we can make it competitive.
No he fights centers like Wendell Carter Jr. and Luke Kornet
Wendell Carter Jr - can see him as a top 10 C

As someone that has drafted Wendell twice in a row in fantasy... Here’s how it goes.  -	Wow Wendell is starting slow. That’s ok just taking some time to get going. -	Wow that’s the game I wanted to see! Here he goes. -	Shit another string of awful games. -	Wow he’s actually playing really well! Finally hitting his stride. -	Wendell Carter Jr. is out for 2-4 weeks with x injury. -	Wow Wendell is starting slow. That’s ok just taking some time to get going. -	...
"😳🤦🏻‍♂️ ughh.  Lol.  Soo, lemme get this straight:  you’re surprised that Chicago selected Wendell Carter....over a *worse* player than Wendell Carter?  Am I reading this correctly?  ...the Bulls goofed up by not taking, ya know....the 22 year old that is currently averaging 23/6/7 @ 34mpg, is in All Star talks in his *third year*, and looks poised to become one of the next great guards in the game of basketball?  Yeah, that guy lmao.  That was the pick @7.  The WCJ over SGA pick will be the one that Chicago will regret for years to come, duh.  Old news lol  Michael Porter sucks.  The Bulls &amp; every other team dodged bullets by not biting on his HS hype.  He absolutely sucks, no one has ever said “gee we should’ve drafted Michael Porter Jr with our lottery pick” aahahah 😂🤣  You’re joking though, right?  This is some bizarre troll bait?  These are literally the weirdest &amp; most nonsensical comments in this sub.  Seriously.  Astoundingly random &amp; utter gibberish"
"The scoring isn't empty, he's efficient. He's not a good defender, despite his improvements, and neither is most of the starting lineup so his net rating is often poor. Coby and Lauri play terrible defense so it's on Wendell Carter Jr. and Pat Williams to hold down the fort which is a precarious situation at best.      We have a deep roster so we've got guys like Thad Young, Garret Temple, Otto Porter Jr., and Tomas Satoransky coming off the bench as  second stringers and they often have much better +/- than Zach.      Our best lineups seem to be when we mix those 2nd unit vets with Zach and one of our other starters (not named Coby). However, the FO is focused on seeing the young core get minutes to evaluate who stays and who goes. Which means we're giving up more points and scoring less consistently, and taking a few more L's than we would if we were dead set on winning."
Might be Wendell Carter Jr the way Clifford had him playing
"Killian was the 7th overall pick in what many considered a weak draft.  If he ends up being a guy who averages 15/5/5 on 39% shooting and is a great passer with the ability to defend I am happy with it.  You can't ask for much more out of the 7th pick. You can see the list of 7th overall picks below:     * 2019: Coby White, Bulls. * 2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls. * 2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves. * 2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets. * 2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets. * 2014: Julius Randle, Lakers. * 2013: Ben McLemore, Kings. * 2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors"
"Bud, you guys would have fucked up luka.  Face it, you guys have been a shit organization post-Adelman and not even drafting prime Lebron is going to change that.    This isn't about the kings, it's about shitty front offices.    Lebron left Cleveland because it was a shit front office. AI only went to one finals in philly when Larry Brown got him some decent help in Dikembe and virtually nothing else.  AD couldn't get shit done in New Orleans.  Garnet, Jimmy Butler, KAT, same in Minnesota.  Booker was empty stats in phx until they got James Jones.  Lavine was being wasted in Chicago under Boylen, and they had their own high profile big in wendell carter jr. whose growth seems to have been badly stunted.  Beal, wasted in washington, point is the nba is full of good players that aren't doing shit because the organization around them sucks.  The Kings are exactly such an organization.  There is zero reason for me to believe you guys wouldn't have fucked up Luka, but go on believing he would have fixed everything."
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
"It was Wendell Carter Jr. imo, most of us saw very little promise in his play but during that Vucevic trade, the media is acting like Orlando got a stud rising player, which is good for them I guess.  Now, I guess it's probably Coby White based on Reddit gamethreads. Lots of other teams' fans say stuff about how explosive he can be as a scorer and his bright future, but a lot of Bulls fans cannot stand his defense and decision making. In my opinion, he's a 6th man at best"
"Even more surprising, a foul was *not* called on Wendell Carter Jr."

"They don’t need a superstar. They need quality starters and depth. Vucevic, Gordon, Powell, Gary Trent jr, Wendell Carter jr, Theis, Otto Porter jr, Olynyk, and Gary Harris all got flipped at the deadline. Not to mention all the players that were traded at the last deadline or in the offseason.  At some point you have to pull the trigger. All of those guys are high quality NBA players unlike the everyone on the Warriors bench. If the Warriors don’t trade their own pick this offseason, then it’s clear they’re not trying to win. There is zero argument for drafting another project."

"There was nobody available at that time lol, and nobody was valuing that pick like a typical #2  The real criticism is Lamelo, it’s not finding a trade for one, because there wasn’t one that was worthwhile.  The only one with traction was Wendell Carter Jr. and the 4th pick, but we see how WCJ looks now lol"
"&gt;Vuc will be 31 next season. So he'll be 32 in first year of Lavine's next contract. He could easily start seeing a drop off 2/3 years into Lavine's deal.  And your alternative plan is, what, exactly?  Draft an All-star with that 2021 mid-first?  When will they be an All-star?  Probably after LaVine is gone, and he'll be 30+ by then anyway.

I mean Wendell Carter JR is really freaking good.  Looking like a stud out there especially on defense.  Somehow we might’ve fallen backward into another great Center once again.
"It may be league average but he’s putting up 18.2ppg and taking 14.4 shots a game, takes tough shots, and fits the warriors offense very well. Plus TS is skewed by centers who take most of their shots around the rim. Alex Len 67.%, deandre Jordan 76.8%, Wendell carter jr 86.7% yet I don’t think anybody would call them better scorers than Wiggins.   You’re also underrating his defense. He guards the teams best wing and sometimes guards and should probably at least make all defense 3rd team."
"Picks are overrated bozo. We still have our 2nds and that’s where Karnisovas strikes gold. Lmao the last two teams to win an NBA championship both won by trading for star players. Sad to see this shit coming from a Bulls fan too when our last three lOtTeRry PiCkS have been - Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Coby White lol."
"They got Wendell Carter Jr. and Bamba to develop now. I think Mobley is probably better than those guys, but having an elite big is usually a bit of a floor raiser, not a franchise saver which is what they need. (With the exception of Jokic and Embiid, but I don't think Mobley is that good.)"
"THT came to play tonight:  4 points (33% FG) 😈  4 fouls 💪💪  2 turnovers 😤  ""Tried to end Wendell Carter Jr."" (missed a dunk) 👀👀  Better than Lowry? 🔥🔥🔥"
Is it just me or does Wendell Carter Jr have a giant head?
Wendell Carter Jr is not even close to our best player
Aside from Wendell Carter Jr this is literally a G League team we're losing to.
"Almost all their decent young players are out with injury.   They won't be ""meh"" next year when they use those draft picks and Isaac, Fultz and Anthony are all back.  However, as currently situated, they are ""meh"" unless you consider Chuma Okeke, Wendell Carter Jr. and Mo Bamba to be exciting. Maybe Chuma is but Wendell and Bamba have largely done nothing in the NBA."
"Ah yes Moses Brown, the guy who, for some reason, lead my 2025 Spurs to a title along with Wendell Carter Jr and Cam Reddish, in NBA 2K16... it wasn't always pretty but it worked."

"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"For a 7th overall pick he's a bit disappointing. You expect a guy at 7th to be at the very least an alright starter.  2019: Coby White, Bulls.  2018: Wendell Carter Jr., Bulls.  2017: Lauri Markkanen, Timberwolves.  2016: Jamal Murray, Nuggets.  2015: Emmanuel Mudiay, Nuggets.  2014: Julius Randle, Lakers.  2013: Ben McLemore, Kings.  2012: Harrison Barnes, Warriors."
I don't think Sixers fans have an optimal idea of what Wendell Carter Jr is skill wise. We've watched him get completely bodied by Embiid and than Dwight Bradley.
"This draft is deep man. Bulls sucks but I want them to get in the playoffs.   Bulls blatantly tank for Ayton/Luka/Trae/etc and ended up with Wendell Carter Jr.   They do it again for Zion/Morant and ended up with Coby.   Bulls tried to win(to with Boylen 🤣) in what majority labeled a weak draft. And landed Patrick Williams.   It's not easy to develop players. Like the Knicks, Bulls are also full of rookie prospects. And you can't just pile up the team with rookies. Because they won't win games. And players don't develop losing."

"Kevin Porter Jr. and Otto Porter Jr.  Also, Wendell Carter jr, Jaren Jackson jr, and for some reason, Miles Bridges."
"To anyone here who watched the CHI-PHI game, can you provide any insight on why Wendell Carter Jr only played 15 minutes? At half time, I thought it was foul concerns but he didn't get on in the second half."
"He played with Towns years ago and he has gotten way better since then. Im talking about the Lavine we've seen for the past 2ish years.  *It’s not like Lavine has no good players on his team*  Who? TBH I like the Bulls' future, but they absolutely do not have any ""good"" players besides Lavine.  Markkhannen has been out for over half their games and he is **barely** a ""good"" player.  Coby White is averaging 16/5 on terrible efficiency and average/below average defense  Wendell Carter Jr with his 12/8 is average at best but he's also missed close to half their games.  After that, their next best players are Thad Young, Patrick Williams, and Garrett Temple.  Again, I like the Bulls' future. I think Coby, Wendell Carter, Patrick Williams, and Markkhanan are all going to be really good players. But they are definitely not there yet. I don't know how you can look at this roster and think that is even a halfway decent roster. Even with all that though, the Bulls are half a game from the 7th seed. I truly think they are several games worse if you replace Lavine with Mitchell because while Mitchell would very slightly improve their defense, he doesn't improve anything else and the Bulls would score way less points because he isn't anywhere near as efficient as Lavine."
"You can tell people don’t watch the Bulls because they keep bringing up the fact that AK gave up “2018 lottery pick Wendell Carter Jr”. Wendell isn’t that good and can only play 40 games a year. His best asset is his defence, which doesn’t mean much when he consistently gets bodied by any damn centre in the league."

No thats Wendell Carter Jr
The Bulls did the exact same thing four years ago and instead of getting Luka we got Wendell Carter Jr because Silver forced the Bulls to bring back Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday.
"I literally screamed when he fell the 7, I thought we were set for the next decade. Still can’t believe they chose Wendell Carter Jr, idc that he was injured it was so simple."
&gt;promising young star in Wendell Carter Jr.  Lol.
"I don’t live in America either, I’m on the other side of the world yet I’ve picked a team. You choosing teams on good “runs” means you’re either a casual or a bandwagon fan.   What savvy moves? They got Allen for nothing and drafted Sexton at 8th, over busts like Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr. They have a great young core of Sexton/Garland/Okoro and Allen. Reaching the heights of another championship that we had with Lebron isn’t a likely possibility, that’s the reality of small market teams. That’s what makes us real fans, we understand this.   It’s quite clear to me that you only have surface knowledge of the sport, because you just see the standings on your nba app and think you have any understanding of the dynamics of each team. Casual"
Who’s gonna score on the Magic   Their best player is probably Wendell Carter Jr
"I agree, weird that people still think he might become a good player. He has low bball IQ and doesn't seem to care enough to put any defensive effort. Wendell Carter Jr is easily better already."
"KAT’s scoring is better, but even then it’s only +5 points in Bam on a lower efficiency. That’s not worth everything else you lose going from KAT to Bam.   Bam is a better passer than KAT, averages more assists on a similarly ranked offense.   Towns is also still bad on defense. He’s improved, and no longer at the bottom of the league for centers, but he still has a negative DRPM and is ranked as the 2nd worst starting center on defense, ahead of only Wendell Carter Jr. By the slimmest of margins (0.01) in DRPM."

We were always going to compete for the 10 seed.  What I said to start the year. Nothing has changed.  We should have traded Thad early and embraced the tank for the best chance at a top 4 pick.  Last night Garland and Sexton torched us.  6 pick and 8 pick.   Another reminder to keep your picks and draft guards over Wendell Carter Jr.
He’s been so good. Wendell Carter Jr too. Just two amazing defensive centres. What an insane trade in hindsight.
"He's looked poor, but he also clearly doesn't work work with the Bulls roster as currently constructed.  And, to be honest, given how well Wendell Carter Jr. and Daniel Gafford have been playing on new teams...  If he goes to a team with good team defense and good passers (cough Spurs cough), I think he'll succeed nicely."
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings.

"I always thought Wendell Carter JR was better than Marvin Bagely at Duke. Maybe not better offensively, but defense for sure, and all around better. Marvin Bagely still has some upside to him."
"I actually think from what he's shown on the Magic, Wendell Carter Jr. would be great for the Warriors. Shame he had to play for fucking Jimbo Boylen when he was on our team."
"I never understood the fascination with who won this trade, when the Mavs alternative was drafting Wendell Carter Jr. If they stuck with 5, they were going to draft Wendell Carter Jr."
Sad Wendell Carter Jr. noises ..
"I was actually just dicking around trying to think of someone at 4 or 5 they could trade for CJ. Is Hachimuras defense good? I havent really seen him play but I love him for 1st fg bets. He's probably too young for Dame tho. Would Washington make that trade? Cj Beal, Russ. Pj Washington? How about... Miles Turner? Indy gets a SG to pair with Sabonis and Portland gets a 25 year old big. Idk... Dwayne Bacon and Wendell Carter Jr, then Orlando can flip CJ for picks? Do they play defense? Theres some depth, 2 decent players. I dont get to watch a ton of games so im really not sure who are great defenders at the 4 or 5. Except the obvious guys. I know who's good on offense m, but not so much defense. Anunoby?"
"Imagine if the...  Magic drafted him over Mo Bomba. Johnathan Issac and MPJ is quite a long boi lineup.   Bulls drafted him over Wendell Carter Jr. Lavine and MPJ would be a damn good offense #FuckDefense  Knicks drafted him over Kevin Knox. The Knicks could have definitely used his scoring against the Hawks.  Clippers drafted him over Jerome Robinson. He probably would have been shipped off with Shai, but they wouldn't have had to give up as many draft picks. Also OKC would look even more scary."
"Sure thing. I’ll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
"Hey, at least you're not the team who passed on him for Wendell Carter Jr...  TBJ did turn into Gafford though"
"KP has Magic written all over him. So maybe Gary Harris, Wendell Carter Jr, and filler."
I thought Wendell Carter jr would be a solid 2 way center for the bulls. Bro was missing open dunks on his way out.
"We had the 5th pick, we traded up for Luka and the rumor was that we would have taken Wendell Carter Jr at 5"
"Nah I can’t imagine they called them up to agree to such a thing, they must’ve just had a strong inkling that Memphis weren’t taking Trae &amp; were fine just keeping Luka if they did take Trae.   If I’m remembering correctly, we were going to take Wendell Carter Jr. if we couldn’t get Luka. No offense to Wendell but that talent gap is wider than the Grand Canyon"
yea for wendell carter jr
"Did you see what Chicago gave up? It was 2 first round picks Wendell Carter Jr and Otto Porter Jr.  Warriors had Wiseman,Oubre (who is on an expiring contract),their own picks and Minnesota's pick,which is more than enough to make an offer that matched Chicago's."
"The Bulls have a habit of sending their bigs out into the world to fuck shit up, we go through them so quickly. Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah, Omer Asik, Threekola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter Jr., Daniel Gafford. Next in line is Lauri Markkanen."
AD turning into Wendell Carter Jr in high pressure situations it’s crazy
1. Isaac 2. Fultz 3. Chuma  4. RJ Hampton 5. Cole Anthony 6. Wendell Carter Jr. 7. Terrence Ross 8. Mo Bamba
"He was grossly under-utilized on the Bulls in favor of trying to develop Wendell Carter Jr and Lauri Markkanen as the primary bigs. The irony being neither of those two guys will be on the team next season anyway.  Glad to see he's getting the minutes he deserves in Washington, I'm always rooting for former Bulls to be successful."
Took me way too long to figure out.  WCJr = Wendell Carter Jr  MB3 = Marvin Bagley (does anyone call him this?)  Allen = Grayson Allen I'm guessing
"I don't understand being upset at the trade tho, you essentially got him for free?  Wendell Carter Jr. has no indication he will ever be as good as Vucevic. The odds of that happening right now are extremely low. And if he did become really good, Lavine would already have been gone in free agency, he wouldn't wait.  As for the draft pick - that's overvalued. Trading a lottery pick for an all-star is just cashing in, Vucevic is what you hope an 8th-13th pick could possibly (but likely won't) become in six years. You get your best case scenario pick except he's already developed for you and is an all-star.  Like what could possibly be wrong w this trade? If you already have an all-star, you don't waste your time gambling on lottery picks while he gets upset and dips. That's how you get stuck in purgatory, gotta try and win, attract free agents, etc"
"That's true, but Chicago also just forked over a top-10 pick, an additional 2023 first and Wendell Carter Jr for Vooch lol"
If you want to argue protections on the Charlotte picks I'm fine with that.  I'm gauging the value of Sabonis to the value of Vooch who went to the Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls season obviously fell apart and they ended up giving a top-10 pick to Orlando plus an additional 2023 first. That's also not including Wendell Carter Jr.
Goat is MJ  Boat is a tossup between Lonzo Ball and Wendell Carter Jr
"I don’t see him worth more than a first and maybe a B- / C+ young prospect. I’m bigger on Vucevic than McCollum and he got 2 unprotected firsts and Wendell Carter Jr. CJ is only a year younger and Vucevic is on a much better contract , both in length, annual cash amount and in the fact that it’s on a decreasing pay scale."
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."
"If we’re doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We’re lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can’t think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I’m leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
markelle fultz  cole anthony  rj hampton  chuma okeke  jonathan isaac  mo bamba  wendell carter jr  top picks coming  very exciting to me
"They have RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Markelle Fultz, Wendell Carter Jr, Johnathan Isaac, and Mo Bamba which is solid"
"A lot of things can factor into it. Luck with the draft and how your picks pan out being some of the main ones. The Cavs took Anthony Bennett #1 in the same draft where Giannis went #15.   There are always gonna be guys who don’t compare to their peers also. Look at the 2018 draft where you had Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr, Collin Sexton, and Mills Bridges go picks 6-10. You also have Shai, Michael Porter Jr, Robert Williams III, and Mitchell Robinson drafted after them. In hindsight, you would take all of those players in the top 10 (probably). You also need the players to be healthy and in an environment that encourages their development.   Take the kings for example. Luke Walton sets the development of his young players back because he has no clue what he is doing.   You need a competent coaching staff and front office if you are going to “complete” your rebuild"
"I think that’s his biggest problem.   If he had been picked just a few picks lower we wouldn’t be talking about him at all. It kinda sucks that he was picked ahead of a player on the GOAT path   When was the last time anyone heard from Mo Bamba, Wendell Carter Jr., Kevin Knox or Jerome Robinson?"
"Willie Caulie Jtein? Wondae Collis-Jefferson?   Oh Wendell Carter, Jr."
"I feel bad not knowing initially who you were refering to and first thing came to my mind was Willie Cauley-Juan 😭😭😭  Then I remembered about Wendell Carter, Jr."
I think Robert Williams and Wendell carter jr are better than Bagley
"When the Mavs got screwed by luck and ended with the 5th pick, our fanbase was already debating very hard between the likes of Mo Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr. to pair with Dennis Smith Jr.   The future looked bleak and we were prepared for more years of tanking.  Thank you Vlade for making the opportunity for a trade possible. Hands down best GM in Mavs franchise history."
"He's talking about what they ""gave up"" as in included in the trade. Not ""gave up"" as in quit.  The Bulls gave up Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr and 2 first-round picks to get Vucevic and Aminu."
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De’Andre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
The Mavs were allegedly gonna take Wendell Carter Jr if the Luka trade didnt happen too
"a pretty big selection of young guys to develop and try building around, on top of 2 top 10 picks this year along with all their picks + the bulls pick coming up  young players with potential: markelle fultz, jonathan isaac, cole anthony, chuma okeke, rj hampton, wendell carter jr, mo bamba. not a bad start"
Pretty sure it's Wendell Carter Jr. but I'm with you. I find it really frustrating some of the shit people abbreviate here.
Wendell Carter Jr. Only reason I know that is cuz im a magic fan
"From a Mavs perspective, the darkest timeline is someone takes Luka and we take Wendell Carter Jr. (that's who we were going to take if not for Luka).  So we probably have DSJ and WCJ leading our franchise right now."
"Isaac.  Fultz,  Cole Anthony is pretty good.  Terrence Ross.  Gary Harris is the main defensive reason Denver beat Utah in the bubble.  Wendell Carter JR so yeah, we aren’t the least talented team in the NBA.  Teams may have a better top player than us like the Kings or the Rockets or Pistons.  But overall I’d take our team as a whole over them."
Wendell Carter Jr I still think can put it together
"Yes, we would have obviously been better off staying at 5 and drafting who we originally going to draft, Wendell Carter Jr. Building around DSJ and WCJ is the way to go."
"Honestly I think they’d both be good fits if they swapped places again. They have a lot of similarities in their games.   The Mavs won the trade though, because without the trade the Hawks would have Luka and the Mavs would have picked Wendell Carter jr. or Mo Bamba"
"Yup, Rick said if we stayed at 5 we would have drafted Wendell Carter Jr."
"You do know we weren't drafting Trae right? Saying we lost is implying we would have drafted Trae. At 5 we were drafting Wendell Carter Jr. So by saying we lost you are saying we would would have been better off with DSJ, Wendell Carter and the 2019 1st round pick."

"That move felt like a pure “we need to sneak into the playoffs” move. Best case scenario was that trade got the bulls into the play in game, and now they are out 2 firsts and Wendell Carter Jr."

"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
Their [draft board](https://i.imgur.com/L41sJSq.jpg) was leaked last summer. They had Wendell Carter Jr #2.
"IIRC all reports were that Dallas would’ve picked Wendell Carter Jr. if Luka was off the board. Would’ve been interesting cause I really think the magic might have picked Trae over Bamba, or if he fell to NYK, he’d be everywhere rn"
Wendell Carter Jr. Jury is still out but ending up at a laughing stock of a franchise has really hindered his development.
"Dejounte Murray is easily San Antonio's best, easily.  and the Magic I'd say is Wendell Carter Jr. I really have to see Fultz continue to stay healthy, same thing with Isaac. and there's no way it's already Suggs he hasn't played a regular season game yet"

"&gt;I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is pretentious.  If you are taking that from a pure text comment on the internet, then that says more about you than me.  But, I already said in my first message that I couldn't think of a comparative trade being close to the same value, so if you just put a response about what you think, without backing it up with anything, yeah, you should expect people to call you on it.  &gt;He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then.  His statline this past year was a rounding error off from the previous year, despite COVID and displacement craziness. The only stat that dropped considerably was his three point percentage, but his other shooting stats all improved, most importantly his midrange stats (he was up about 10% from 10-16 and about the same from 16-3p, on increased volume) and his free throw rate (a classic indicator of shooting ability, which jumped above 80% for the first time in his career).  He also improved his playmaking this past year, up a full assist over the previous year, with turnovers going down.  I used the ""has made an All-NBA team"" thing so I didn't have to deal with the ""but he's not an All-NBA player just because he made one"" argument. I'm sure there are plenty of players who made an All-NBA team that you disagree with, but the fact that none of them got traded for a package the size you are talking about is the point.  &gt;Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing  This is probably the closest comp out there for a deal the level you are talking. It was considered a steal of a deal at the time, but Cousins was a notoriously problematic personality (which had been a concern going right back to College, and the reason why he dropped to the Kings in the draft). He was a dominant player, but he was also suspended several times by both the team and league for unprofessional behaviour. He also was traded with a year and a half left on his deal, and Sacramento was going to lose him in free agency if they didn't deal him.  He never actually even led the Kings to the playoffs, either, but he did make All-NBA, so there is some similarity. Still, it does represent the bottom of the market on that type of player (before even considering the context), and I like to think of Masai as being better than Vlade Divac at his job.  &gt;Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  This one isn't comparable, though. Vucevic was 30 at the time of the trade and had never been anything more than a borderline all star player. He has never gotten a single All-NBA vote, let alone made a team. It's a package comparable to the one you are talking about, but for a much lesser and older player, with less team control."
"I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is incredibly pretentious. You request information as if you’re talking to your secretary or you’re a teacher requesting homework from a student. It’s obnoxious and something you should work on.  For the record, Siakam’s value is not “all nba level player”. I personally don’t give a shit that he’s made a single all nba team. He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then. He’s a fringe all star and not a top 15/20 player in the league. He’s closer to top 30-40. Players as good as Siakam get traded every single year. I’ll give you some examples, but I guarantee you that your response is going to either be “this player isn’t as good as Siakam” or “that package is better than the one we’re discussing now”. There is no example that will cause you to actually change your opinion, but I’ll give it a try.  1. Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing   2. Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  Are two trades off the top of my head that roughly fit what you’re asking for"
"Tyrese Haliburton  Wendell Carter Jr.  Deni Avidja  As a Celtics fan... Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford and Payton Pritchard  I still believe in Markelle Fultz... he won't ever be a superstar in the strictest sense of the word or the best player in his draft class but he has a Jrue Holiday type ceiling  Jamal Murray I think his ceiling is a lot higher than probably most people think. I wanted the Celtics to draft him 3rd in his draft"
He also said he would take Wendell Carter Jr. at #1 in the 2018 NBA Draft.
"Bulls fan here. Almost all our guys we drafted post Jordan era showed flashes of stardom but ended up being sort of nothing:   Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Taj Gibson,  Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr.   No, I don’t count Derrick Rose. He won MVP, all star starter, blew out the big 3 Heat in the ECF in Game 1, and single handedly stopped the Linsanity."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."

His rookie contract elapses at the end of the year, and if he disappoints again we will let him walk or trade him at the deadline. I believe in Mo though, he will turn heads this season.  Wendell Carter Jr is in a similar situation, but less precarious. He's shown enough in the short stretch post deadline that I think he is a solid NBA player with a lot of untapped upside. He struggled in Chicago but I think a lot of it was mental, and it was night and day coming to Orlando with a chip on his shoulder."
We got 2 FRP and 22 yr old Wendell Carter Jr who has a ton of potential (even if Bulls fans disagree).
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I’m not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we’ll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, “That is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],” I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I’m not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: “He is not a good runner; he’s an amazing runner. And then he’s an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn’t really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he’s a great kid, he’s smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He’s a treasure, really. He’s going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.” Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I’m positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan — and his shot looks as good as any player’s in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don’t fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I’ll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: “He is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He’s an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he’s a coach on the floor. He’s such a smart player.” Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, “If we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?” Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He’s a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker–type player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him “the best defensive player I have ever coached.” Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
"**Offensively, they are a superb fit.**   Zach doesn't need the ball in his hands to do his thing, and for a lot of last season he did not because the Bulls were desperately trying to make PG Coby White work (it did not). When it wasn't Coby, the ball was often in Thaddeus Young's hands to be a playmaker. There is a reason why Bulls fans were so desperate for a PG.  You have to actually watch Lonzo to realise this, but Lonzo isn't a great point guard. He has great vision, but his subpar handle makes him struggle to playmake in the half court and in pick and roll. DeMar can do all of that at a high level. I don't see why you think the offence would stagnate with the ball in DeMar's hands - he's not a scorer that passes sometimes, he's legitimately a good primary playmaker. Lavine is someone who fits in the former category and the ball is definitely better in DeMar's hands for a team offense.   Caruso will be backup PG alongside Coby White, letting him go back to his natural role as a scorer and end the terrible PG experiment. They fit well together. Is 8m or whatever Caruso got too much for a backup PG? Maybe, but that's what they needed with Sato gone.   * Lonzo will thrive when he doesn't have to be the primary playmaker, and he can act as an elite glue guy offensively.  * Lavine will thrive going from 0 playmaking around him to 3-4 playmakers in the starting unit, and the best spacing he's ever had. * DeMar with thrive with 4 shooters around him, giving him space to operate. * Patrick Williams is a guy who can fit anywhere on any team, but we will see how improved he is next season. * Vuc will play with guys who can really collapse a defense and draw attention away from him for the first time in his career. He won't be getting doubled in the post with the shooting around him.  4/5 guys are very efficient offensive players, and I feel like each one of their starters is going into the best situation of their career.  Their bench is a little dicey atm and we need to see what moves they have planned, but I think the Caruso/Coby back court is a great fit.  **Defensively, they will be bad**  Chicago had really poor defensive schemes last year. Vucevic was a neutral defender in Orlando, mostly because Clifford's excellent defensive schemes and our mostly decent perimeter defenders were able to limit situations that were bad for him (i.e. Vuc was rarely caught out in an island guarding a small). Wendell Carter Jr was called a horrible defender by Chicago fans pre-trade, but the situations flipped after the trade. Wendell seemed like a pretty solid defender, if a little small, and Vuc was seen as a horrible defender. The difference is not in the players, but that the schemes in Chicago basically sacrifice the big because their perimeter defense was so bad. Rudy Gobert would be a neutral defender at best on last years Bulls. Lonzo and Caruso were upgrades, but I think they need a new defensive coordinator or something because a couple of good but not great guys aren't gonna fix it. DeMar and Lavine are bad defenders too.  Also to your point about 1on1 defenders, you are right but I think Patrick Williams can be that lockdown guy. He was decent but not great on defense, but that's to be expected for rookies. He has the tools to be a monster on that end.  I expect the Bulls to have one of the best offences in the league, especially if they can shore up their bench (maybe via S&amp;T for Lauri). Their defense will be bad, worse if they keep doing what they were doing last year. We will see I suppose."
Mavs because without the trade we end up drafting Mo Bamba or Wendell Carter jr.
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
Imagine the Mavs with Dennis Smith Jr and Wendell Carter Jr and you have your answer.
"We were drafting Wendell Carter Jr at 5 if we didn't trade up. So even if it's 7 years of Luka, that's a hell of a lot better than DSJ, WCJ, and a future 1st"
"Troy Brown - probably not going to be a star, but, I believe he'll be an important role player on good teams. Feel the same way about Mo Wagner  Wendell Carter Jr. - solid to really good starter. Possibly an All Star"
"&gt; If cam even becomes an above average scorer and stays a defensive beast ima say the Hawks won.  Even if that were to happen, do you know what the Mavs alternative was? They weren't drafting Trae at 5. We had DSJ at the time. We were drafting Wendell Carter Jr. So by saying one team won, suggest the other lost. So is DSJ, Wendell Carter, and 1st we traded better than Luka?"
Wendell Carter Jr. might be better atm
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."

"His value won’t change as long as he doesn’t play, but GM’s have different opinions on him. I’m sure some small market teams see superstar potential in him but they don’t want to pay over his current value. It’s more so teams going into tank mode that want to give away their stars. Vucevic got traded for two picks, Wendell Carter Jr and Otto Porter Jr. Aaron Gordon got traded for Gary Harris and RJ Hampton. Other players will lose value and deals will become available."
I remember him kicking Wendell Carter Jr. ass. Like all third stringer do.
I was so excited to see him get drafted to our team and then we picked Wendell Carter Jr. 😒
"John Wall when healthy was a top 3 PG  Fans and sometimes teams overrate the hell out of assets.   Example if you’re a middling or average team that can trade for an allstar or allstar level player that will more than likely make you way better you should do it. That random 1st round pick you’re holding so dearly onto will likely never be as good as the player you’re trading for, and if you’re trading for a GOOD player you shouldn’t have to worry about the pick being incredibly high. For example the bulls basically trade Wendell Carter, Otto Porter Jr, a first round pick that will likely never be an allstar,  and Franz Wagner who will likely never be an allstar for Vucevic and they should and would do it again.   Another example could be that Heat pick from a few years ago. Teams thought they hit a gold mine with that one Heat pick and what did that turn into? 18th pick Tre Mann right?"
"You would undoubtedly have seen that already imo if LaVine was in Utah in Mitchell’s place. Playing next to some legitimate NBA point guards (Rubio, Conley) and shooters over the years on a team with a perennial DPOY candidate center, I’m extremely confident that an alpha scorer as efficient as Zach would consistently have that team in the playoffs. I’m hesitant to say he would “lead” them to the playoffs because I’m hesitant to say Mitchell “leads” Utah to the playoffs. He’s undoubtedly their lead man offensively but Rudy Gobert is the guy who drastically raises the floor of the team and makes them as a playoff lock.   I’d like to see Donovan Mitchell lead Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Denzel Valentine to the playoffs."
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
"MPJ  But I've been irrationally high on MPJ since he was a senior in high school and projected to be the #1 overall pick the following year until he had back issues.  I *really* wanted my Bulls to scoop him up when he fell to #7 (Wendell Carter Jr) as it was a perfect situation for them to red shirt him his rookie year while developing Lauri, Lavine, and Dunn, their new toys from last year's trade, which would have meant an even worse record than they cobbled together that year, which could have meant an even better draft pick than #7 (Coby White) the following year."

"Hopefully man, we love him. Similar note but I hope Wendell Carter Jr becomes something solid for y'all. He needed a change of scenery from here; Jim Boylen hurt his development and just made for a rotten experience here in Chicago. I love the contract he got from you guys though; friendly to the team in that it's not hard to move the contract if they want to trade him later, but still showing he's valuable piece for the teams future."
"Wendell Carter Jr. is only 22 and should develop and improve as time goes on. JV pretty much is what he is at his age. It's definitely an overpay, too much money for a traditional big. Griff seems to have a hardon for such players though. I think if the Pels had waited they could have re-signed JV next summer for half what they just gave him. Nobody else was giving him that kind of contract, and once JV saw the lack of offers he'd have come back for whatever the Pels gave him."
"they got him for barely more than wendell carter jr., it's a solid deal"
" Jameer Nelson, Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkolu, Ryan Anderson, and Dwight Howard  vs  Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner, and Wendell Carter Jr  Not to mention, it’s SVG vs Jamahl Mosley, who is making his debut as a head coach.   The 2022 team is absolutely fucked"
Does only Orlando frontload contracts these days. Cavs could have gotten him big bucks early to see what he delivers today with the potential of offload in the cheap later if need be. Magic were doing it with Aaron Gordon and now Wendell Carter Jr

Still feels like yesterday when Luka and Trae  were never going to be a top 2 pick.  People agreed with Ayton but said Sacramento was going to screw it up picking Bagley.  Ayton was a big with small ball being the offense for most NBA teams and Bagley wasn't great at Duke.   I liked Trae and Michael Porter Jr. as the two players in that draft. As a Bulls fan fuck Wendell Carter and I even said it at the time.
Orlando got back picks and Wendell Carter Jr...  Is that the type of move you think Philly makes?

"Great win but the refs were in that 4th quarter like Trae, Harden, CP3, Lebron the day after talking to the media about his ft rates and Tom Brady after a DB stands withing 3 feet of him were on the floor.

I'm not trying to disrespect Valanciunas - he's a good player - it just never made sense that people were claiming that he's a floor-spacing 5"

"Oh, I must’ve gotten him confused with someone else. I thought I remembered the Magic declining some option. Sorry about that.   I still feel like Wendell Carter Jr and Mo Bamba don’t fit great together, especially once Johnathan Isaac returns.

"I don’t watch HS hoops, so all I know about his HS hoops career is that he was teammates with Ayton.
