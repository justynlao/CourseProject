"I think it was always a deep draft. A lot of guys have came in and helped their teams, even some late picks second rounders.   Pritchard has been great for the Celtics. Theo Maledon has looked very good. Xavier Tillman and Desmond Bane are effective rotation players and spot starters for a .500 team. Immanuel Quickley looks like he's gonna be a very good player. Isaiah Joe from Philly is still very raw but when they needed a shooter to insert into the lineup he played generally well.   And then I think there's quite a couple more second rounders who will become solid rotation players. Saben Lee has had some good flashes for Detroit, Paul Reed is tearing up the  G League for Philly.   All of those guys picked 20+, and then add on Wiseman, Patrick Williams, Lamelo, Halibuton with all-star potential and then Bey, Achiuwa, Maxey from non-lottery picks showing future starter ability. It's a good draft, and there's always going to be late bloomers as well"
"I've been discussing this trade with Raptors fans for months now, and they have given the exact same response. You guys don't care about Tisse or Maxey. Instead how about Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and multiple firsts (I think we can give out 3 with some type of protections)?"
Paul Reed
"Because we hate the Celtics.  That's just the way it is.  But for real, not trying to be a dick, but Nesmith is completely out of your rotation.  He has no value right now despite being a good prospect and a high draft pick.  That's like the Sixers saying Paul Reed has trade value cause he's killing it in the G League.  He most certainly does not have any value right now either"

Paul Reed
Getting off that contract is huge.   If they give us Paul Reed I‚Äôm okay with it. PJs about to be gone for 2 seconds anyways
Paul reed and some seconds and I‚Äôm down
paul reed. o u t t h e m u d
Paul Reed will win MVP 12 years straight once we get him out the mud.
Paul Reed snubbed
No. It‚Äôs Paul Reed. We just need to pull him out the mud.
"No need to be a condescending dickhead. What I said isn‚Äôt really that outlandish. Think it was actually relatively objective.   Yes, Smith was a miss. The circumstances around his situation sucked. Was high on him before the draft and would‚Äôve loved to see him actually develop. But, overall it was still a successful draft considering that year we got Shamet+the heat pick - which became our third ‚Äústar‚Äù in Tobias Harris, while also grabbing Shake Milton who is our best bench player.   Paul Reed was the 58th pick of the draft. If he can become our cheap backup, how is that not a win? We pay max deals to 3 players. We need to find value in later picks. Reed is currently averaging 21/12/2 with 2 blocks and 2 steals shooting .587/.412/.714 in the GLeague. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a fucking star, just saying we‚Äôre able to find good value.   Every team misses on stars in a draft. Hell, even your Bulls passed on SGA for Wendell Carter. Shit happens"
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he‚Äôs taken some spectacular leaps)  I‚Äôd say the last few years we‚Äôve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."
"Paul Reed is a Sixer and the Sixers beat the Mavs last night.  Following your nonsensical logic, Reed, who didn't play a second last night, is the one responsible for the Mavs loss."
Paul Reed would‚Äôve gotten minutes tonight.
"Like it when Paul Reed makes a FT, hate it when Paul Reed misses a FT"
Announce Paul Reed as the b2b G-league player of the week cowards
Paul Reed G League MVP szn
"Hey same, Paul Reed has been amazing"
Half-time means take a Blue Coats break on ESPN+ to see Paul Reed continue to cook.
"Paul Reed aint coming back until the G-League season ends. And, to be fair to Mike Scott, he's been out for like two months with a leg injury."
Paul reed has to be better than Mike Scott
Paul Reed still stuck in the mud ‚òπ
I would‚Äôve locked myself in my room with a tub of ice cream and Paul Reed G-league highlights for a week if the Sixers lost this game tbh
Paul Reed is really going to get G-league MVP/DPOY/ROTY/FMVP
You're all just lucky Paul Reed is in the G-League Bubble.
"paul reed the 6'9 center that's played 25% of his minutes as a small forward and not a single one as a center  looks like you're the one that's unable of having a rational discussion, literally everything you wrote was a lie"
"Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed.  Reed who was called up from the G league for that game.  But there‚Äôs probably no possibility you are going to have a rational conversation about Embiid or the Sixers so there‚Äôs no point in further discussion"
C: calling up Paul Reed
Paul Reed
It‚Äôs kind of crazy that 31 teams are fucked and they just don‚Äôt know it yet.   Paul Reed is coming and nobody can stop him üò§
Paul Reed
"It's been said Tilman was so pissed off at Morey that he wanted like every player and asset we have lol. It would be like Embiid, Harden, Seth Curry Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe out there lmao"
1. Korkmaz isn't very good and should not get minutes on a championship contender in the playoffs  2. Paul Reed will eventually get out of the mud and become the next Lebron
I'd protect Paul Reed before Korkmaz
Paul Reed aka future G league bubble MVP aka Bball Paul aka out the mud
The mud had no shot at keepin Paul Reed down
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
You mean CUrrent HOFer Paul Reed  https://rutgersnewarkathletics.com/hof.aspx?hof=59&amp;path=gen&amp;kiosk=
Watch 37 year old Joel win 6MOTY coming off the bench for Paul Reed
Paul Reed is better. No.
Paul Reed. He's finally out the mud
"Ima just say it. Paul Pierce was a good player but be totally fucked around for his Willis Reed moment he was fucking fine or minorly hurt at best. He was fucking okay, don't write him up like he suffered the same fucking injury he didn't. He bitched out his way to this God like figure and hes not. Hes takes are mostly awful as well."
Paul Reed
Paul Reed bro straight out the mud
Paul Reed?
"this man got out scored by Paul Reed, James Michael Scott &amp; Dwight David Howard II, how embarrassing"
Paul Reed 10 pts on 5/7 in 13 minutes &gt; Ben Simmons 7 pts on 2/6 in 26 minutes.
And? He did fuck all otherwise. At least Paul Reed plays with energy and makes an effort to play defense. Mike Scott looks like he is on Ketamine on defense.
"I don‚Äôt think he has. He got out scored by Dwight Howard, Paul Reed, and Mike Scott today. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but I have no faith in his offensive ability."
"I‚Äôm worried for the playoffs. The regular season no longer matters for the Sixers. Embiid is a MVP caliber player and they can‚Äôt wait on Ben Simmons much longer. He is an elite defender and does many things well, but games like today show his biggest flaws. He looks straight up disinterested at times, and even though he‚Äôs not a scorer he should not be getting out scored by Mike Scott, Dwight Howard and Paul Reed in a game without Joel. This year‚Äôs playoffs will be very interesting."
Paul Reed needs to play more and Mike Scott needs to get back into his beehive.
Poor man‚Äôs Paul Reed
Ben Simmons gotta forfeit his game check to Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe
Paul Reed
Fuck Doc tho. Give Paul Reed Mike Scott's minutes.
"So Paul Reed will break Jokic‚Äôs new record, huh."
"So Paul Reed will break Jokic‚Äôs new record, huh."
"Ja‚ÄôSean Tate‚Äôs draft class is 2018. He went undrafted and played overseas. So he‚Äôs a rookie this year but doesn‚Äôt qualify for this particular draft class. If you want a late 2nd round player who would now be a top 20 pick (and I think top 15 imo), I would go with Paul Reed."
"LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  Paul Reed, Philadelphia 76ers"
I don‚Äôt want him I‚Äôd rather get Isaiah Joe or Paul Reed but I doubt you‚Äôd give either up. Matisse is overrated.
Paul Reed?
"Well according to this [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/03/19/sixers-rookie-paul-reed-loves-the-fans-says-his-confidence-is-high/amp/) it basically means to work hard and grind it out. I believe the expression came from Paul himself on Twitter. Must be a Florida thing. It‚Äôs parallels a bit of the Sixer‚Äôs Process, it‚Äôs no wonder he‚Äôs a fan favorite."
"Since nobody else is telling you, Paul Reed, or BBall Paul was the G League MVP for the Blue Coats and is now on a contract with the Sixers.  Just the fan base meme'ing."
Paul Reed and Lu Dort
Paul Reed
Euroleague MVP Luka Doncic  G-League MVP Paul Reed
I had Paul Reed as a late first. I'm stunned he fell a full round. Happy for him
"Play Paul Reed you coward  And if not, play 4v5 instead of having Mike Scott on the court"
"This is facts.   Precious was always an overrated prospect, there were a solid amount of big men better than like Xavier Tillman, Paul Reed, Isiah Stewart.  It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs super young either which you mentioned, he‚Äôs the same age as paul reed and averaged worst stats than him in college and Reed looks better than him now as well."
"Precious was such an overrated prospect, there were a solid amount of big men better than him. I don‚Äôt understand the appeal at all.  Xavier Tillman, Paul Reed, Isiah Stewart.  It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs super young either he‚Äôs the same age as paul reed and averaged worst stats than him in college."
It would be unfair to include Paul Reed in any discussion about the best Sixer.
Only if we‚Äôre not including the Mudman Paul Reed
I wanted him to take Mike Scott's minutes if Doc was insistent on not using Paul Reed.
"Philly, they have Ben and Joel under contract for the next few years also unlike many other contenders Philly still has various first round picks over the next few years. Also they still have young and upcoming players such as Matisse, Shake Milton, Maxey, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe. They have a great combination of win now players and assets to help the team get better over the next couple of years."
And to beat Rayjon Tucker and Paul Reed in the east.
"Clippers played really well tonight. Not really frustrated at the loss from a play perspective.    I am, however, really frustrated at the officials for continually overstepping boundaries with ejections. Howard shouldn‚Äôt have been ejected 2 games in a row. What he did in these games was extremely minor.   Also frustrated at Doc for refusing to sub Mike Scott out for Paul Reed to at least see what would happen.   But end of the day, this type of loss isn‚Äôt a huge deal for this team. Clippers are great. It‚Äôs a damn shame we couldn‚Äôt watch Embiid eat Zubac Alive, but it‚Äôs not a big deal.   I won‚Äôt ever root for the Clippers as long as Marcus Morris is on their team, which is a shame considering I truly do like watching the rest of their team play."
Paul reed is just collecting dust
Dwight continues to tank for Paul Reed.
Paul Reed is winning Finals MVP this year. Change my mind.
Sixers have Paul Reed so Philly easily
Weird way to spell Paul Reed
Paul Reed
"It‚Äôs so sick, it‚Äôs funny how people might criticize him for being ‚Äúdetached‚Äù from the game as an analytics guy, but he so clearly loves the game.  He had a halftime interview during our G League team‚Äôs game where he talked about the progress of the team through the year, the importance of the program, and his thoughts in the game thus far. He‚Äôs like two weeks away from saying ‚ÄúPaul Reed is untouchable.‚Äù"
Sorry Paul Reed had to burst your bubble
No one is pointing out the random Paul Reed propaganda at the end of this article?
"I mean seriously we started a game with Isaiah Joe, Tyrese Maxey, Dakota Mathias, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard with a bench of Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and supposedly Mike Scott I‚Äôm not sure why anyone is shocked that our differential is a bit off."
Paul Reed almost singlehandedly led us to a G league championship
prefer bball paul at the 5 but I'll take any paul reed minutes
"Paul ""Muddy"" Reed hitting that sweep hook"
"The people want, nay, demand Paul ""in the dirt"" Reed!"
crowd is yelling for paul reed lol
WE WANT PAUL REED
Alaa with the Paul Reed reference. I see you OUT THE MUD!!
ITS PAUL REED TIME
Oh I hope we get a Paul Reed sighting
"No stars are available right now. I‚Äôd imagine the Embiid Simmons pairing will be allowed to prove themselves this season, and if they fall short again, there will be heavy rumours but they‚Äôll get one last shot before trading one of the two. Other than that they have pretty limited assets to trade. Maxey is an option, but he‚Äôs average just under 8 PPG and 2 APG, he‚Äôs going to be a good player, but not remotely enough to bring in a real scoring threat. Trading Harris is an option, but he‚Äôs in the second year of his 5 year $180 million contract. He‚Äôs still tradeable, but he‚Äôs a 20 PPG shot creator, he‚Äôs probably their best option now. I can‚Äôt see them trading for a better option. He‚Äôs not on a great contract, but he‚Äôs done well this year, and there‚Äôs no upgrade that they can get at the moment.  They have some other assets, but if they want to compete, they should hold onto them. Thybulle is a good asset, but wouldn‚Äôt you want to hold onto an elite wing defender who‚Äôs an alright enough 3 point shooter? They‚Äôve got lesser assets like Ferguson, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, but they haven‚Äôt proven to be more than subpar rotation pieces, and they‚Äôre just not going to net you great players. If a superstar becomes available and they can make an offer of Harris, Maxey, Ferguson and picks, then by all means do it. But at the moment, I can‚Äôt see any trade options for them."
Paul ‚Äústill ain‚Äôt made it out the mud‚Äù Reed
"who cares, Paul Reed is on"
"I think George Hill to Philly would be cool if they don't pull off the Buddy deal that's been in some unsubstantiated rumours    Hill won't fetch you a Maxey or Mitlon or anything because of age, but maybe Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed or something as the young player. I haven't looked at the salaries to see how it would work"
"Idk man, if I‚Äôm the Spurs I‚Äôd look at Paul Reed and give up Patty Mills and a second for him."
"If I were the Raptors, I would look long and hard at Paul Reed too. Dude is tearing up the G league and will develop into a really solid player. Although I doubt Toronto is interested in a package of Maxey, Reed, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and a first."
Paul Reed better don‚Äôt @
"You really wanna see Sixers fans spam Paul Reed highlights, huh?"
"Anecdotal I guess but as someone who consumes a ton of basketball media I‚Äôve noticed him becoming more mainstream. Like I mentioned his work gets brought up on the ringer now regularly and that‚Äôs a new development, same with his work being referenced on the Lowe Post. Also makes semi-regular appearances on the Athletic basketball podcast   He‚Äôs definitely respected in deeper basketball circles, I‚Äôm deep into the draft world and all the Twitter draft analysts like his work and several of them have been hired by now. Also has had a ton of the smartest basketball content creators on his podcast, like he just had the basketball index guys to talk their new metric   Also Fwiw, PER is outdated but idk if John Hollinger is. He was banging the drum for Paul Reed all of last year and now Paul Reed is one of the best players in the G league, so I think he‚Äôs still on the pulse of things"
All I know about this guy is that he can shoot and that he got his soul stolen by Paul Reed last night.
"So? All that changes is the number of jerseys sold. If you're a fan of a player the reason behind you buying their jersey doesn't change depending on how good they are. If you're gonna buy their jersey, you're gonna buy their jersey. The reasoning doesn't change because they're a star; if somebody has an affinity towards Paul Reed or Joel Embiid it isn't different. Not everybody that loves Steph bought his jersey already in the past 6 years. It's absurd to think that like everybody who would buy a Rui jersey had already done so. Maybe people are just getting into it, maybe they can afford it now when they couldn't then, etc  I still buy Ronaldo jerseys and he hasn't played in over a decade. There's no new jerseys coming out, I don't grow more fond of him. The psychology of buying a player's jersey isn't so simple as ""I like him, I'll buy his jersey."" There's a ton of factors that drive consumers"
Paul Reed
"honestly, the paul reed out the mud meme making it this far is pretty hilarious"
Isiah Thomas  Dwight Howard  Carmelo Anthony  Walt Frazier  Willis Reed  Paul Pierce  Reggie Miller
"Exactly. We didn't even get to play Isaiah Joe last season and he could use the minutes, there's no playing time to be had outside injuries. Don't even get me started on how Paul Reed has to sit to watch andre Drummond"
"True who could ever pass up springer, Joe and paul Reed?!?!"
"Yeah just completely ignore the other assets the Sixers have available. It‚Äôs not like we have the ability to trade the rights to our next 7 FRPs as well as young, promising prospects like Thybulle, Maxey and to an extent Springer, Joe, and Paul Reed."
"The likely scenario would probably be:  Lillard, Malik Beasley and Pat Bev to the Sixers    Simmons to Minnesota   2022 unprotected FRP (Sota)   2022 top 3 protected FRP (Sixers)   2023 Pick swap (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected FRP (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected pick (Sixers)   Tyrese Maxey   Paul Reed   Matisse Thybulle   Jaden Springer   Naz Reid    To the Blazers. Four firsts, a swap and four young talented cheap players (albeit no potential super stars).  They then trade McCollum for another good first or two decent firsts and start over."
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"Simmons to Minnesota, Lillard to Philly, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, 4 1sts from Philly and Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, 2 1sts from Minny to Portland"
Paul Reed anyone?
"Nice, here's a table with the top three category leaders.  |**Player**|**PPG**| |:--|--:| |Cam Thomas|27.0| |Tyrese Maxey|26.0| |Desmond Bane|24.0|  |**Player**|**REB**| |:--|--:| |Jalen Smith|12.5| |Paul Reed|12.0| |John Konchar|12.0|  |**Player**|**AST**| |:--|--:| |Payton Pritchard|8.5| |Immanuel Quickley|7.8| |Sharife Cooper|7.3|  |**Player**|**BLK**| |:--|--:| |Daniel Oturu|3.3| |Alperen Sengun|3.0| |Sekou Doumbouya|3.0|  |**Player**|**STL**| |:--|--:| |Tremont Waters|3.5| |Jordan Goodwin|3.3| |Louis King|3.2|"
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our ‚ÄúGM‚Äù). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
Still upset we haven't given him a min contract to be on our bench. I'd love to do that but Doc would probably give him minutes over Paul Reed. I just want Mike there for the locker room.
Paul Reed so you can have bball paul
This was Paul Reed - that was the adult in the gym.
Paul Reed looks so damn good. Will he get minutes this year?
"He‚Äôs so great, he and Paul Reed"
Paul Reed.
Man if you aren‚Äôt building around Paul Reed then your team may never get out the mud
I can‚Äôt believe the Sixers are going to go from Embiid‚Äôs beautiful post game to [this guy](https://youtu.be/A12E66l85dM) every time the bench comes in  (hopefully paul reed takes drummond‚Äôs minutes by the end of the year)
"If you compare number of good players relative to teams in the league you can have a pretty insane Centrr position mid 60s : Wilt, Russell, Reed, Bellamy, Embry, Beaty, Thurmond, Lucas and probably others.   Also today's guard era with : Steph, Harden, Westbrook, Paul, Booker, Young, Doncic, LeBron James PG version, Lillard, Irving, Holiday, McCollum, Lowry, Butler, George etc..."
Where's Paul Reed?
"And that list is just the call ups. It doesn't include players like Siakam, Chris Boucher, Richaun Holmes, Paul Reed, JJ Barea, Jeremy Lin, Gerald Green and others who weren't called up, but rather transitioned between seasons."
"lets go players by players  Precious is already other than THT at 21. Precious has no offensive game right now outside of rim runs and dunks. He hasnt attemtped at a 3 yet. only played 12mins a game last year avg 5 pts. Some defensive upside due to atheleticsm but rmb he is 21 so not a young rookie. at 6'8 wont be a small ball 5 either so will be a 4 most of his career. a 4 without a 3pt shot is a liability long term in todays game.  Raps didn't have complete control in the season either. Lowry was expiring then.oks like a Richaun Holmes type . Id take Paul Reed over him too but thats my homerism.  THT is still 20, has played deep into the playoffs, 6'4 guard that is jack of all trade master of none kind of guy. but due to youth and athleticism has the potential to be more. Played deep into a finals run. already has 2 years of NBA experience compared to Precious one but is younger.  Thybulle&gt;&gt;&gt; Precious and idk how its even a question lol. 2nd year NBA player. Already made 2nd teall All NBA defense. Has all defensive steals and block metrics. is already a top 15-20 iso defender in the NBA if not top 10. top 10 team defender already. lack of offensive game is true but Precious has no offensive game outside of dunks and an ineffiecient mid range himself. So lack of offensive game is a wash and Thybulle is a elite NBA defender already. No potential or projection but already 2nd team All nba defense good.  Caruso, reddits darling speaks for himself and i dont gotta explain him.  Raps didn't have complete control in the season either. Lowry was an expiring then.  Herro was never offered idk why raps fans believe that. Herro and Precious are no where the same level in terms of assets or worth. Precious is a projection potential pick. Herro has shown his value already in NBA games, and the NBA playoffs."
"Morey was thinking that our only backup 4 or 5 is Paul Reed, and that getting Drummond for the minimum is pretty good value considering it doesn't effect our ability to go out and get a stretch 5 for the MLE or minimum"
well we had paul reed but doc didn't think it was worth him getting minutes in the regular season. he'd fuck up once and then doc would bench him and didn't give him any chance to develop.  now he's going to do the same shit but with drummond who is garbage.
"it's not that we don't like him, we just didn't want a player like him on the roster anymore.  drummond is not a good compromise. i'd rather just not have a player of that profile on the team in general. much rather would have run out our rookie as backup C or Paul Reed.  now doc will play drummond a million minutes. barf."
"Sixers fan here:  I feel like there was a narrative that got established about 30-40 games into last season that ran something along the lines of ‚Äúhey! Dwight still has something left in the tank! Look at that! How‚Äôd the sixers steal him away on a vet min? Lakers really blew it!‚Äù etc  To be fair, I *was* all aboard this train around last March, and given the track record of backup centers during the Embiid era, I think it‚Äôs fair to label Dwight‚Äôs time on the sixers a [Good Time(https://mobile.twitter.com/LaurenMRosen/status/1378025905734483971). I mostly enjoyed watching Dwight and his antics, and for the first half of the season he was a pretty solid backup for Embiid.   I think it‚Äôs probably gotten lost in the *sturm und drang* of our All-Star point guard‚Äôs spectacular mental implosion in the playoffs, but the wheels *reeeeeally* started coming off the Dwight bus sometime after the ASB. Just take a gander at [his game log](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/howardw01/gamelog/2021) and ask yourself why his minutes got so low at the end of the season while Embiid was out, Dwight was nominally healthy, and the Sixers were fighting for a (sadly useless) #1 seed.  I know the Simmons situation takes up most of people‚Äôs attention, but Dwight did not have a good playoffs, to say the least. He had more fouls than minutes in the playoffs. He could somehow pick up offensive fouls while his team was taking free throws.   I know there‚Äôs plenty of exceptions to The Wisdom of the Crowd (especially on Reddit, lol), but go take a gander at the sixers sub if you want to see how completely100% OK sixers fans are with this signing (pay no mind to the deranged Paul Reed stans; they‚Äôre mostly harmless)  I know people have thought Dwight‚Äôs career was cooked before and been wrong, and maybe there is something left in the tank, but as a Sixers‚Äô fan (and denizen of LA who values an entertaining Lakers team over a good one), I‚Äôm not worried about losing Dwight in the slightest, even at a vet min."
Dwight and Paul reed would bring back gold in so many sports
CJ+2 firsts+*maybe* Covington(if Philly sends 28 and Paul Reed back)
got the next Giannis last year. Paul Reed baby
i love Paul Reed but isn‚Äôt he like 4 years older than Kuminga
I don‚Äôt get the Kuminga hype at all. He was terrible in the g-league where Nico Mannion and Paul Reed looked like Nash and Hakeem. If Kuminga went to college his draft stock would be a lot lower like BJ Boston.
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
Paul Reed era begins
"I'd love to get him, but it's hard to figure out who on our roster we'd be willing to move for him. Boucher is basically a fast-forwarded version of what Paul Reed projects to be (with better shot-blocking). For a UFA that will likely leave anyways, maybe a picks-driven deal. I really just want to pair him with Matisse and watch them fling themselves around at shooters for 10 minutes a game."
"Paul Pierce and Vince Carter. ESPN had them ahead of players like Bob McAdoo, Willis Reed, and Dave Cowens all who were MVP, or near MVP level in their time."
"The funny thing is that our fan base wanted to trade for Paul both of those years.  That‚Äôs how desperate we were for a playmaker who could shoot.  But let‚Äôs be honest.  We‚Äôre not matching up with the Nets regardless.  If they get hurt, we‚Äôre not matching up against the Bucks or the heat.    Simmons unwillingness to improve is the primary reason for that.  I don‚Äôt think he should be rewarded for destroying the franchise.  I would get more satisfaction from punishing him then from being a four or five seed and getting knocked out in the first round.  I‚Äôm fine resting Embiid and using this as a developmental year for Maxey, Shake, Thybulle, Reed, Joe and Springer."
I saw Chris paul his rookie year walking around OKC (hornets - when they relocated for Katrina) and talked to him for a little bit. Super nice guy. Also saw JR smith and he was ok but didn‚Äôt really wanna talk to people   Met willis reed and he was cool. I shook his hand and they were HUGE
You mean Paul Reed? NO DEAL
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
"We are only two seasons removed from 2018 (considering he missed 19) where Cam threw for 3400 yards, 24 touchdowns, 13 INTs on 68% completion, and rushed for an additional 500 with 4 TDs. That's basically Baker Mayfield from last year, with 300 yards more rushing and a better completion percentage.  That was Cam's highest completion % for his career, tied for 2nd most TDs in his career, lower than average INTs, and his second highest QBR (icky). and probably his best overall year of his career except for his MVP year which just looks like an insane outlier in comparison.   I think maybe the issue is that people are looking at that 2015 year and assuming that was kind of how he was playing for a few years there, but he wasn't. That year Cam had 11 TDs more than his next best year, tied for the lowest INTs, the most yards he threw for since his first 2 years in the league, and the second most rushing TDs he ever had.   If you take out that year from the equation then his ""prime"" lasted until he got to NE which was a terrible fit for him. Every year was wildly similar to each other. The only thing that was different in Carolina year by year was the team around him, not really Cam at all when healthy.   I think we are both overrating how good Cam was outside of that 2015 year, and underrating the consistency he had up until he got knocked out in 2019.   I think the best comp for Cam might be DeMar DeRozan in that sense. Had that stellar 2018 year and then everything else around it is just, like, the same. Other guys in that same mold are Arenas (though his career was entirely derailed due to injury, not the teams around him or anything else), Jermaine O'Neal (3rd in MVP in 04-05), Bob McAdoo, and Willis Reed.  If that Panthers team stays together, Olsen is healthy, Peanut is healthy, O-line stays healthy, running backs stay healthy, Benjamin doesn't eat himself out of the NFL, I think we would probably have a much different view on Cam. He would probably still be in Carolina too. Though, the injuries may have caught up to him by now because a guy in his 30s who took some of the most insane hits during the year probably isn't recovering like he used to. Still, I wonder how he would have done if he went anywhere other than NE considering the last healthy Cam we saw, again, had his 2nd best season of his career individually with a pretty shitty team.  * Also there exists the rumor that the Denver Broncos in 2015 broke Cam Newton mentally and he didn't recover from that. Not sure if there's any validity to that but if that's the case maybe Cam is Paul George or a supercharged Nick Anderson."
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.   Ben Simmons-JaDeveon Clowney  Blake Griffin--Tony Romo  Chris Paul--Phillip Rivers  Lamar Jackson--Allen Iverson  Ja Morant--Kyler Murray  Jimmy Butler--Richard Sherman  Draymond Green--Donta Hightower  Kevin Garnett--Ed Reed  Rob Gronkowski--Shaq  Kyle Lowry--Steve Smith  Dirk Nowitzki--Antonio Gates
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
"He's pretty close with some of the Guys on the team, like Maxey and Paul Reed. I doubt hes going to want to ruin the games for them just to be petty towards the 76ers Organization."
Ben Simmons trade won‚Äôt get done by the start of the regular season and Simmons doesn‚Äôt play - Matisse Thybulle and Paul Reed get playing time and surprise a lot of people.
"Haha, in shambles? We‚Äôre currently discussing Charles Bassey and getting Paul Reed out of the mud"
"As a blazer fan from 2004- June 2021 I would love cj on the team. He fits great with Joel due to his lack of need of pnr, has a decent half court off ball passing game, and his huge amount of gravity anywhere on the court relative to his nba value. The whole summer I was an advocate of CJ + Roco for tobi + Thybulle + Paul Reed as I think it would push the blazers to being easily one of the top 5 in the west and the sixers into championship contention.  That all being said, I don't think CJ + Tobi + Joel is a championship contender. What ever somewhat possible trade happens in the next couple of months, up to and including Anthony Edwards, the sixers will be in a worse possition. CJ + Roco + Simmons + Nasir does not replace the value of a 24 year old all nba player on a 4 year contract. What the sixers need are trade assets and players that are easy to build around. CJ is great, but D'Lo is a better facilitator. The blazers assets exist, but are not as good as the Timberwolves."
Yes sir! Paul Reed is also there.
"Based on what? And what do you mean by European? Euroleague teams or just a random team from Germany or Turkey? Do you have any idea how many great NBA players spent time in the G League? Just this year KPJ played a good 10 games in the G league and scored 50 points in an NBA game. Do you actually think that Jordan Pool or Jalen Green are less talented than many Euroleague players. Do you have any idea what a monster Paul Reed is? Obviously the game is played differently and rules favor a different playing style but the talent level in the G league is amazing. My claim isn't that Euroleague competition isn't better (see my original comment), teams are well coached, rosters stay longer together and the motivation to play hard for the team is higher."
No such thing as Europe as it pertains to basketball. The best G league players are bench warmers in the Swedish league? Here are some of the players playing in the g league last year: Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green   jordan Poole.  Paul Reed.  Jared Harper.  Henry Ellenson.  Jeremy Lin.  Nico Manion.  Oshae Brissett.  Kobi Simmons.  KJ Martin.  Jalen Adams.  Vernon Carey jr Antonio Blakeney.   Any of these players can play for top European clubs. Some would dominate. Some actually signed with European clubs and many more were called up to the NBA. Some were sent for development and played a good 10-15 games.
"Paul reed is a big question mark. He may turn out to be great and someone like the names you mentioned. I think most of the people I listed were people who are already established as either busts (Bender, Okafor) or ended up being really good (Bam/Ayton)."
"Paul Reed (who‚Äôs also a PF/C) had an even better summer league this year and he‚Äôs not on your list.   Reed just needs a chance to play. He‚Äôs got Siakam/Wood like potential (both were end of the bench players early on), but he just can‚Äôt get a chance to play in Philly. Ironically, Simmons holding out and not being traded for like McDaniels who plays an overlapping position might end up netting him a few extra minutes, although they don‚Äôt overlap too much in position."
"Probably around 10th, but it also depends on the exact team that‚Äôs drafting him and what their needs are. Charlotte who drafted Bouknight would be a team that could have drafted THT if he were available. However, a major flaw with THT is he‚Äôs not a good shooter - worse than a lot of these lottery picks, and that‚Äôs something that isn‚Äôt helped by the fact he‚Äôs had 2 years of NBA training and hasn‚Äôt improved that much.   Call me crazy, but I actually think Paul Reed (who was nearby undrafted last year) should at least be a late lottery pick in this same draft - he just needs an opportunity to play."
Just give Paul Reed more playing time - problem fixed.
The hope (or at least my hope) is that Doc is willing to play Paul Reed in that role. He needs to get more run.
"It‚Äôs completely arbitrary. There‚Äôs really only a handful of stars in the league today  Steph, KD, Lebron, Paul Reed"
"Yeah, it's weird Paul Reed isn't involved."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
McDaniels is hardly an entity in the NBA let alone a centerpiece in a trade for an perennial All star. It‚Äôs the equivalent of saying that Paul Reed is the centerpiece for the Sixers offer for Lillard.
"I was thinking about it more and it was Simmons, Thybulle, Springer, and Reed for CJ, RoCo, and someone I think (McLemore? I can't remember).  Reasons this is bad for Portland: we're giving up 2 starters including our best forward and our best SG.  Additionally, we're acquiring Ben Simmons while giving away 1/3 of our spacing.  CJ would be gone either way, so if you ignore his 40% 3pt% at near 10 3pa (what he was averaging pre-injury), we're still losing our 1 out of 2 bench shooters and our only forward who's a legit shooter in RoCo (not to mention our best defender atm and would-be 2nd best if we got Simmons).  RoCo is the only forward we have which could share the floor with Simmons without a detriment on offense due to his outside c&amp;s ability.  Thybulle obviously is a great defender, and in a vacuum I'd take him on the Blazers.  However, the reason he can't get more minutes is his lack of offensive ability.  In a package giving up 3 shooters for 2 non-shooters, we're shooting ourselves in the foot here.  The garbage contracts they're sending are irrelevant outside taking up 2 roster spots.  So yeah.  There's why the trade is bad.  Our fan base is definitely torn (I did a poll on our sub yesterday about it) about Simmons, but the mild consensus is a CJ-Simmons swap.  The rest of the trade ruins it.  The same is true when someone proposed CJ+Simons for Simmons+Maxey (after the report Rich Paul wanted Maxey out).  I said no to that, too, since we kill our outside shooting.  Maxey could very well be better than Simons, as early as this season even.  But Simons' 40+% 3pt shooting is what makes Simmons even an option for us.  Replacing him with an undersized SG with 30% 3pt is just making us worse."
"Tbf I don‚Äôt know who/what else leaves Philly but I don‚Äôt like the idea of 3 for 1, especially when Russell essentially consumes the Simmons minutes minus a couple, and further pushes back the younger guards. Likely because I am a Sixers fan but I really like what they could get out of Maxey, Milton, Thybulle, Joe at guards and Paul Reed at the 4. This doesn‚Äôt even include the potential of the draft picks this year. I know that the contracts they‚Äôd trade for wouldn‚Äôt last forever, but a number one pick like Simmons feels like someone you‚Äôd keep for the majority of their career and I‚Äôd expect these three to be Sixers for a long time in exchange, at the cost of giving their own picks playing time. Unless this trade comes with a corresponding deal for a different top player, I‚Äôm not a big fan of it"

We‚Äôll give you Ben Simmons and Paul Reed for him. Gotta give us Maxi Kleber too though.
Maxey and Paul Reed
Everyone gets to watch the best center Paul reed now
% we see Paul Reed tonight??
I'd argue that paul reed is better than both
"Sixers would protect embiid, simmons, harris, curry, thybulle, hill, maxey, and milton. so out of anyoke else that isnt a free agent, itd have to be isaiah joe or paul reed. if i had to guess, a team would want joe simply for the shooting"

Maxey has more value than wiseman... Paul Reed and Joe are both young interesting guys to throw in as well.  Sixers have the best offer from a contending team.
"Maxey Thybulle Simmons and 2-3 1sts is a great offer.  Not sure it would take all of that honestly. Sixers probably wouldnt want to give up Thybulle if theyre losing Ben.  Throw in a Paul Reed, Isiaha Joe or a Shake Milton."
"Start Paul Reed, cut the other two."
"Lebron, KD, Paul Reed"
I truly don't understand why Paul Reed wasn't taking some Mike Scott minutes.
Unfortunately just had to settle for some scrub like Paul Reed to get em out the mud... its a rough life
Put in Paul Reed. None of this mike scott bs

Clearly Paul Reed is the most underrated player.

It's Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed time. In the playoffs.
Paul Reed - The mud
Don't forget Paul Reed came from heaven.
Paul Reed is clearly the best playoff performer of the last 3 years.

"Paul reed , playoffs and finals mvp"
Alright. We have Mike Scott. We have Paul Reed.   Give me Isaiah Joe for ultimate disrespect.
Does Paul Reed not exist?

The team with Paul Reed
"They got 3 soon to be co-DPOYs in Embiid, Simmons and Thybulle  Maxey looks like a young, more athletic Tony Parker out there, soon to be an all-star candidate  Paul Reed might be a meme right now but he's probably peak Paul Milsap by next season  Harris should've been an all-star  Embiid was MVP if he played enough.  I think they're one of the best teams in the league for the foreseeable future.  Nets in 5."

Two words: Paul Reed.
"It's in reference to one of our rookies, Paul Reed. He didn't get to play in one of our first games and he tweeted saying he needs to ""get out the mud"" and anytime Reed checks into a game, morey tweets that."
I'm hyped to see Paul Reed getting heavy minutes on Sunday.
"Paul Reed out da mud, I think"
"paul reed is just trying to earn minutes as an end of bench guy, that aint something to be upset about, happens nearly every game"
"I can give you 30 other guys from the 70s in the NBA alone (not including the ABA) that were clearly better and more impactful than Bing.

"There is no cap space. If they were able to somehow get rid of Ben without taking on any salary at all, they'd still be right around the cap. They're using roster spots on guys like Paul Reed and Charles Bassey, they don't need roster spots.  A few good role players and picks is not better than having Ben, it really is that simple. There is nothing gained by dumping Ben, and they already have more than enough role players. What they're missing is a star PG, and dumping Ben for anything less than a star PG closes the window. And Morey isn't going to close the window just so he doesn't have to deal with this."
Paul Reed got out the mud so that tells you something!
Thybulle and Maxey aren't even the biggest argument. The biggest argument are guys like Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed that might be second and deep second picks with great value
paul reed and isaiah joe :)
"If OKC would agree to make the sixers 2025 1st round pick unprotected, then the sixers will have all but 1 of their draft picks. Seth Curry is on a really good contract and he would be valuable to any tanking team purely to flip for draft picks.  And maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe, are all quality young players. Even Paul Reed, Shake Milton, and Jaden Springer have a bit of trade value. Are any of them elite prospects? Hell no. Notice I said ""decent war chest of assets"". Not the best in the league. There are teams with better war chests.   Let's say dame became available in a trade. The knicks, nuggets and warriors could probably all beat the sixers best offer. But would the knicks be willing to go all in on Dame this early into their rebuild? We all know what Lacob has said about wanting to build for the future. Now maybe the warriors would go all in on dame, but it would cost a pretty penny to beat the sixers offer, and it's not clear that they would do that. And would the nuggets be willing to offer murray AND mpj? They can't even trade MPJ until next year because of the poison pill provision."
"Random thoughts:  Dwight should probably be above Drexler, Havlicek, and Grant Hill.   Nash and Chris Paul peaked higher than Isiah and Stockton.  Allen Iverson is too high. No way he added more offensive value than Nash.  Don't know how I feel about Elgin over Scottie, but it's hard to say because Elgin had a relatively short peak because of injuries and I don't have a great idea of his prime ability.  And for the previous 25...  They had Pete Maravich ahead of Reggie Miller. There's no way you want Pete ahead of Reggie on your team unless your only goal is to sell tickets.   D Rose is pretty low at 65 but that's sort of a pleasant surprise considering how deified he is on r/NBA and Twitter.  Carmelo should not be ahead of Paul Pierce, Kyrie, Frazier, Reggie Miller, or Reed."

"maxey, thybulle, green, korkmaz, milton, drummond off the bench, with Paul Reed and Isiah Joe as deep bench rotation guys during the regular season aint bad.  problem is we'd have 3 injury prone starters that are all guarenteed to miss time, likely overlapping, at which point we'd be boned.   Frankly it's probably the best we could get at this point, so TBD.   i do wonder if this is smoke screen to try and force Minnesota into a panic trade where they over offer for simmons for fear of missing out."
Paul Reed feeling blessed
"Paul Reed was near my building in the city and my girlfriend asked for a picture and he was an incredibly nice dude.    That said, there‚Äôs no shot he was 6‚Äô9‚Äù. Looked way smaller than I‚Äôd have thought"
"Finally, I spent the whole summer worrying about how tall Paul Reed is."
Paul Reed ~kinda~ got out of the mud hence the one inch increase
Oh yeah these are bot upvotes lmao. Your argument is that Paul Reed shouldn‚Äôt have thrown him under the bus? Get to the end of your comment lmao.    Ben Simmons nor spica know you you don‚Äôt have to de all day
"quitting on your teammates is real alpha dog shit for real lmao. The organization doesn‚Äôt matter they‚Äôre just a business but the guys on the team need you and you‚Äôre just not showing up? Not just the Embiids chasing a legacy but like, Shake Milton, Paul Reed, Isaiah Joe, these guys need the team to succeed, need a role on a strong team that performs well to get them another contract. Not talking about the dudes making 110 million, the guys making $2m and hoping they have another contract in their career so they can set their kids up for life. But I guess if the ‚Äúfuck you I got mine‚Äù is alpha shit then"
"Which FMVP's have gotten a triple double:  Jerry West: yes Willis Reed: no Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: yes Wilt Chamberlain: yes John Havlicek: yes Rick Barry: yes Jo Jo White: no Bill Walton: yes Wes Unseld: yes Dennis Johnson: no Magic Johnson: yes Cedric Maxwell: yes Moses Malone: no Larry Bird: yes James Worthy: no Joe Dumars: no Isiah Thomas: yes Michael Jordan: yes Hakeem Olajuwon: yes Tim Duncan: yes Shaquille O'Neal: yes Chauncey Billups: yes Dwyane Wade: yes Tony Parker: yes Paul Pierce: yes Kobe Bryant: yes Dirk Nowitzki: yes LeBron James: yes Andre Iguodala: yes Kevin Durant: yes Kawhi Leonard: yes Giannis Antetokounmpo: yes  1) why did I do this 2) by my calculations, 33 different players have won FMVP 3) 6 of them have not recorded a triple double (18% of FMVPs)"
"You want Paul Reed to set up a press conference in the middle of the summer just to support Ben Simmons? This is a bizarre request. That's not how things happen in the NBA, just looks desperate."
lmao you could hear Marv's paper rustle trying to figure out who in the hell Paul Reed was
Paul Reed
Paul Reed?
"Everyone but Mike Scott, Isaiah Joe, Anthony Tolliver, and Paul Reed. The only one I do not want to see on the floor under any circumstance is Scott.   Ceterum autem censeo Mike Scott esse delendam"
Paul Reed?

Yep. Win tonight puts the Bucks out of catching us. Let's get it done and give the people the 40mpg Paul Reed run that they're craving!
Used to be Vincent Poirer. The problem with Paul Reed being your victory cigar is that he‚Äôs good enough to actually be in our rotation but Doc hates young guys
Why are they burying Paul Reed rn
PAUL REED OUT DA MUD
Paul Reed? THE Bball Paul? Hes larger than life.
Pretty sure it's  Joel Ben Tobi Dwight Paul Reed  Just another way my guy can get out of the mud
shocked Chris Paul Reed isn't top 3
Paul Reed got it out the mud though.
Paul Reed
"We‚Äôre not the best but I‚Äôm honestly just happy that we‚Äôre in the conversation now after years of having the most painful bench in the planet.   Shakes become a legitimately good 6 man when he‚Äôs put in an offball situation.   George Hill plays exactly how you want a bench Pg to play.   Thybulle is as elite as it gets on defense and should be on the 2nd team for All Defense.   Korkmaz seems to have finally figured it out with a bit more consistency and can catch fire from deep while also handling the ball surprisingly well recently.   Dwight is having a historically good rebounding season by minutes played. Has finally been the guy who can somewhat hold down the fort when Embiid is out.   Tyrese Maxey isn‚Äôt needed for big minutes, but when the game gets sluggish, his pace of play has provided some awesome moments.   Tolliver can be a body when needed. Wont bring much to the table but won‚Äôt actively hurt the team.   Scott sadly has taken a step back and seems to be cooked.   Paul Reed was Gleague ROTY and MVP and has been electric in garbage time lol  And Isaiah Joe‚Äôs shot has translated and should be ready to take on more minutes next year assuming Korkmaz leaves for more money.   Combo of smart signings, trades and draft picks have given us our first legitimate + bench in a very long time"
Being named Paul Reed
&gt;2-way players are literally at end of the bench.  And then starters in the G league...  &gt;Guys that were All-G-League don‚Äôt even have rosters spots.  Uhhh what?  Moses Brown plays for OKC often   KPJ is a stud on Houston   Paul Reed plays for Philly   Malachi Flynn literally just won rookie of the week/month I forget   Mamadi Diakite has played 12 games for Milwaukee  Jordan Poole plays for golden state
Paul Reed imo
Paul Reed
"Great, just one more vet for doc to play over Paul Reed."
76ers need to get rid of Mike Scotts fucking Minutes and give Paul Reed more
"Lamelo, Haliburton, and Edwards are all trash  Paul Reed ROTY"
Lebron James is like Paul Reed but without a cool nickname.
"It's ""Bball"" Paul Reed or ""Bball Paul"" Reed, not Paul ""Bball Paul"" Reed. If the nickname precedes the person's given name, you put it in the *beginning*. You wouldn't say Mike ""Iron Mike"" Tyson or Steve ""Stone Cold Steve"" Austin.  Get it together, man"
"I had Paul Reed as a top 15-20 pick on my big board before the draft, i still can't believe he fell to the bottom of the draft lol. Shout out to the Sixers, they got some good ones this year."
LeBron James is like Paul Reed with worse hair
paul reed
Yo Paul Reed is the fucking man
"Look at paul reed man, so inspirational üòÇ"
Noooooo. And worse yet this means Paul Reed isn‚Äôt getting his well-earned pt over Tolliver and Mike Scott.
Paul Reed.  Because he's out the mud
Paul Reed
"pfft, clearly its Paul Reed"
BBALL PAUL REED HYPE
Paul Reed
"Rest of the list:  6. Isaiah Stewart, Detroit Pistons  7. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks  8. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies  9. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers  10. Cole Anthony, Orlando Magic  Unrankable because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair: Paul Reed, Philadelphia 76ers"
I guess it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to give Paul Reed 6th man of the year AND the MVP
"&gt; Paul ‚ÄúBball Paul‚Äù Reed  Mike ""Iron Mike"" Tyson  Steve ""Stone Cold Steve"" Austin  Gene ""Mean Gene"" Okerlund"
The real story of tonight‚Äôs game was the 10/9 in 10 minutes from BBALL Paul Reed.
PAUL REED
Paul Reed.
is paul reed playing today?
No. They should have drafted Paul Reed.
They were missing Paul Reed too
If this game shows anything it shows how important Paul Reed is to the Sixers. Get blown out by 40 without him in the lineup. Truly a cornerstone for the team.   Hopefully hes healthy for when the games actually matter otherwise the Sixers might be in danger of not getting out of the 2nd round again
"No Embiid, No Simmons, No Win. This is gonna be an incredibly ugly game. Don‚Äôt even have the possible bright side of Paul Reed experience since hes out with contact tracing.   Going to be a ton of Mike Scott and Anthony Tolliver minutes at center...."
I mean last night was the second of a B2B and the third game in four nights. We were losing that once the schedule was released. If I was Doc I would have started that game with Paul Reed as my PG and he would have led the third stringers against the Bucks in that farce.
"Paul Reed, he was the g league mvp this year. Very rough some nights, but other nights you can see the potential."
Put Paul Reed in
"Who's ready for some hardcore analysis to dispel this myth? For purposes of this exercise, I'm going to define the Knicks ""winning"" as reaching the second round of the playoffs. Seems like a fair benchmark that I'm sure Chris Paul would agree with.  From 1946 to 1953 the Knicks were fire! Six at least second round appearances (which were the conference finals in those days), and three finals losses to those pesky Rochester Royals and two against the Minneapolis Lakers (where there were actually lakes), led by ARGUABLY (as in, you are free to argue it) the best big man in Lakers history, George Mikan!  Were the 1940s and early 50s they glory days of the NBA? Probably not! But I'm sure it was great returning after kicking the Krauts' asses in WW2!  The Knicks then suck through most of the 50s and 60s, likely because they don't have Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt, Russell, Oscar, or like the three other guys that mattered or knew how to dribble a basketball at that point in history.  Then in 68-69, those Knickerbockers blow up and start kicking some ass, behind Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Bill Bradley, and Dave DeBusschere! Even Phil Jackson was on the bench reading On the Road. Over the next six years, they go to the conference finals every year, and go 2-1 in the finals. The true golden era of Knicks basketball, but how about the rest of the NBA? Kareem got here, the 60s guys were old and broken, but still chugging along, and then everyone did cocaine and no one cared about basketball until Magic and Bird arrived. What are the defining moments of this era? The Lakers winning 33 in a row? Willis Reed or Clyde Frazier (I don't even remember which one!) hobbling out to participate in a final's game? Someone on the Celtics driving a cab? I think the general U.S. populace was either fighting in the jungle or too stoned to give a shit about this era of NBA ball.  Then the Knicks suck or are sporadically (sup Ty) decent over the next 13 years. They're swept in the second round in 78 and 83 and they go 7 with Boston in 84.  So from 1974 to 1988 the highlight of Knicks basketball was one good 47-win season when 1980s Melo (Bernard King) scored a bunch of points. Seriously though, Bernard King BALLED in that Celtics series, averaging 29 on 54.5% from the field. This also happened to coincide with the era of the Showtime Lakers, Celtics, Bad Boy Pistons, and fo-fo-fo 76ers, so actually this great era of ball was in a world when no one cared about the Knicks.  Literally, we still have to endure everyone giving a shit about the Knicks because some guy hobbled out on a bum leg in 1973 and Bernard King gave Bird the business in one series.  88 until 2000 was the second most memorable time in Knicks history, when Ewing came to prominence, Riley came over, they brought in Oak and Mason, and they had a Heisman trophy winner for a point guard. Over the next 12 years, the Knicks make the second round 11 times, the conference finals 4 times, and lose in the finals during an MJ-sabbatical and in the lockout year when the rest of the east was old Reggie Miller and Alonzo Mourning. The NBA in the 90s was great for one reason - Michael fucking Jordan. Sorry if I don't pine for Ewing hitting 12-footers with bad knees and Oak and Mason beating the shit out of Rik Smits and Rony Seikaly en route to a 72-67 win.  And.... the Knicks have sucked since, except for one year when they lost to baby Paul George and Roy Hibbert in the second round. Melo had like 1.5 fun seasons in New York, Amare's knees lasted about 18 games, and Jeremy Lin was good for two weeks.  And the NBA has fucking ruled since basically the 2008 finals, so no, no one gives a shit when the Knicks are good. I hope Julius Randle goes to Phoenix or something."
"Man, there's always some late 1st/2nd round prospect that I'm irrationally high on who ends up going to the Sixers.  Really loved Paul Reed in last year's draft, was *obsessed* with the thought of drafting Thybulle the year before, had soft spots for Shake Milton and TLC in previous years."
"Celtics would have no answers for Furkan Korkmanz and Paul Reed though. Checkmate, haters."
Myth: Availability decides the MVP  Truth: I alone decide the MVP and I choose Paul Reed.
"If Paul Reed, Jalen Green, KPJ, Trevelin Queen, and Cam Reynolds were on a team they would have a good chance of doing well"
Mike Scott was so bad that Doc put Paul Reed in the game in the first quarter.
Where is Paul Reed?
Paul Reed is not ready to play
"Why doesn't Paul Reed exist?  (This is for Doc, not Morey)"
It used to be Paul Reed but he‚Äôs getting mainstream
What? That doesn't answer my question. Do you think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs right now? Do you think Alen Smailagic is better than Evan Mobley right now? Paul Reed better than Jalen Johnson? Kyle Guy over Davion Mitchell?
Paul Reed.
Paul Reed is the only one who can stop Alize. G-League this up.
The league is lucky Paul Reed didn‚Äôt want to steal everyone‚Äôs thunder
Embiid-29.6  Steph-30.4  Matisse-3.9  Paul Reed-2.7  Furkan Korkmaz-9.2  75.8 PPG.
Neither is Paul Reed?
Paul Reed obviously
"Paul Reed is gonna be better than Draymond, I think that‚Äôs a reasonable bet to make"
Paul Reed
"**Sixers rookies:**    Maxey: literally the goat. Doesn‚Äôt fear anyone on the court. Maxey would drive to rim against Rudy Gobert or Anthony Davis, it‚Äôs insane to his confidence. Floater is literally wet as fuck, it‚Äôs his best tool and he rapidly looks to be up there with guys like trae and harden in terms of players with best floaters. Good midrange too and the three is better than advertised. Needs to work on getting other guys involved tho, as if there‚Äôs times when his shot isn‚Äôt falling, a good point guard needs to be able to play-make so they stay on the floor.   Isaiah Joe: looked rough his first couple games, although he was getting spotty minutes and seemed to be really testing the waters in terms of what shots were working best for him. Recently though, he‚Äôs been pretty lethal as a catch and shoot guy, like two or three games ago he dropped like 18 and then followed up the next night with like 16. Guy was shooting from pretty deep too. Defensively he‚Äôs been alright. Looks like he is already a good team defender, he‚Äôs had some smart plays whether it be a steal or a good switch. His struggles are also mainly on the defensive end with defending bigger wings and forwards, so I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôs working closely with the strength and conditioning coaches to bulk up. Also doesn‚Äôt have enough confidence in his handle, as he can get into the habit of deferring when even a little pressure is applied by the defender. I‚Äôm not really worried in this regard, he‚Äôs a rookie fighting for minutes trying to only make the right plays and not mess up to much. Although it is harder to tell of what his full capabilities are at this point.    Paul Reed: he‚Äôs still gettin out the mud   Nah he hasn‚Äôt played much and he‚Äôs really more of a old school four aka a small ball five in today‚Äôs game and we have plenty of centers so he hasn‚Äôt been able to see many minutes."
"Tyrese Maxey is a fun, quick guard who has some crafty moves to get to the basket. Doesn't draw many fouls as a result, though. His three point shot is inconsistent but at least he takes them. He's small but tries hard on defense and has been navigating screens well. He also works hard and genuinely seems to want to be in Philly. I'm just worried for him that he'll be compared to Harden for the rest of his career because the trade never went through.   Isaiah Joe's shot definitely translated from college, he just needs to put on more weight. Despite this, he's another guy who tries hard on D. Korkmaz should take back his spot in the rotation but since he's an expiring contract, I don't think we've seen the last of Joe.   B-ball Paul Reed still has to get it out of the mud. Other than in games where the Sixers are forced to have a 7 man rotation, he's usually only in for garbage time. He fights hard for rebounds and has a nice skyhook but is obviously still kinda raw. Hopefully he can get some more seasoning when the Blue Coats start back up."
"Depends on who the young player is. Expiring salary is nice, we already have many late firsts for the second couple years. Don‚Äôt know if we need another but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt  Give me Danny, a protected first, Paul Reed and two seconds. And I‚Äôm down.  Or if we can get some confirmation that Dipo will sign with them. Up it to two firsts"
"Our best lineup is easily shake, seth, simmons, Tobi, embiid. I doubt statistically there's a better a lineup in the entire league so far with a 30 min sample min. It's a whooping +50 lineup in a 30 min sample. Our starters when healthy have been very good with Simmons, seth, danny green, tobi, embiid with a much larger sample at +15. Our starters started the season in the negative but got extremely hot before the bug hit us. Seth in particular was becoming virtually unstoppable. To Docs credit shake does close tight games.   The issue with this team isn't really who starts, the issue is really Dwight, Bradley, and Poirier all can't really play with Ben. This is also a familiar problem, we didn't have it last year because Ben and horford lineups were really strong when embiid sat. It's not a huge issue when embiids healthy because we can just keep Embiid and Ben attached.   I actually think the solutions might already on the team. I think Paul Reed and Mike Scott make should fill in for embiid when he's out. Reed can really switch on D, he's gonna be a + defender in the nba. Scott is a wide body who can set quality picks and stretch the floor. The main issue with that is Reed is on a 2 way and Scott is having trouble with fitness and health. I'm also not sure Doc gets how difficult it is to build lineups around Simmons when embiids out either. He's been very timid about smaller lineups with Simmons anchoring the defense even though Simmons has looked rock solid in that role."
"Paul Reed was one of my favorite college players last year, I can‚Äôt wait for him to demolish the nba once‚Äôs he‚Äôs out the mud"
It‚Äôs so strange watching Shake drop 28 points in real NBA games as a long time Shake stan. I assume I‚Äôm gonna feel the same way when Paul Reed starts having 20/10 games in 2 years
"If he did start trading firsts, I‚Äôd be fucking thrilled. We are in win now mode, and we have a shit ton of young talent at the same time as well with Maxey, Thybulle, Milton, Isiah Joe, and Paul Reed.   So I hope to Christ that he DOES start offloading some FRPs. Itd mean getting us that one last piece to really put us over the top."
"He had the Rockets as consistently one of the best teams in the NBA for the last near-decade. He is easily one of the best execs in the NBA. Easily. If not for the Warriors all time great team beating them, he likely has a title with Houston too.   And look what he‚Äôs done for us already in just ONE year:  Offloaded Horford‚Äôs deal for just a 1st and 2nd round pick. And also got Green back in the deal. Veteran shooter we need.   Traded Richardson and Seth Curry. Curry has been nothing short of amazing so far and is an incredible fit on this team.   Signed Dwight to a vet min deal. Say what you will, but Dwight has been a great vet presence the last couple seasons and he is a really good back up to Embiid. For peanuts.   Drafted Maxey at 21. Then went and got two more rookies in Paul Reed and Isiah Joe who have both had some really good moments for us.  Basically, he came in and fucking crushed free agency and immediately made some tweaks to the roster that have it looking like the best team in the East and then also fucking crushed the draft.   I‚Äôd take a bullet for Daryl Morey. He‚Äôs the best thing to happen to Philly professional sports since Nick Foles took us to the promise land"
"Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed, mike Scott, Dakota Mathias, Tobias Harris...its like all our players"
Paul Reed in 2 years
"Isaiah Joe, Dakota Mathias, and Paul Reed is the big 3 of the future"
"Dakota Mathias, Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed are already a super team how much help do they need ? KD move 2.0 all over again smh"
Sources: James Harden wants to team up with Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe in Philadelphia
Paul Reed played zero minutes today
They don‚Äôt want you to see Paul Reed on national TV. Wake up
We played Dakota Mathias (2 way player) and Isaiah joe (2nd round rookie) 40+ mins. Tony Bradley (3rd string) 25+ mins and Paul reed (2nd round rookie) 25+ mins.   What‚Äôs your point?
Not sure if Paul Reed is capable of consistently making 30 footers
I actually do have Paul Reed as the 2nd option on my 2028 Kings franchise lol.
"Paul ""B-ball Paul"" Reed"
"Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed, and Dakota Mathias are definitely the stars of someone's MyGM team in 2040."
"Yes, let's let it be the game where Danny green was the back up point gaurd, Dwight Howard played powerforward, and Isiah Joe, a YMCA player from Perdue, and Paul Reed got major minutes be the deciding factor"
Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed development minutes
Paul reed is so chaotic
How terrible is Paul Reed in practice where we are running regular rotations with Embiid and Dwight on the court at the same time?
I‚Äôm not sure if your whole team being out is a valid excuse against Dakota Mathias Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed
"that's what i'm talking about! why did Embiid, Danny Green and Paul Reed got cleared but Tobias, Shake, Thybulle and more didn't for the Denver game? what did those guys do that the others didn't with Seth lol?  if Beal is in quarantine because he chatted with Tatum how on earth Embiid isn't despite rubbing his hands on his face after dapping up Seth?"
Paul Reed is a solid ass 15th man on 2k tho.
"Scott didn‚Äôt play, Paul ‚ÄúB-Ball Paul‚Äù Reed did"
Paul reed is built like a spider lanky af
Blessing for me. Need to see that Paul Reed - Tony Bradley - Dwight Howard monster lineup.
"We're playing guys like Paul Reed who has 1 singular minute played in the NBA. They're playing well but make no mistake, these are mostly g-league level guys. Your team was just in the western conference finals. It's not comparable."
"who are ""Paul Reed"" and ""Isaiah Joe"" and ""Dakota Mathias"""
Maxey Joe and Paul Reed. The big 3 you never heard of
That Playoff P impersonation tho. Paul Reed is elite
Can someone explain this Paul Reed stuck in the mud thing? I‚Äôm out of the loop
lol is the in-arena guy calling Paul Reed Bball Paul?
"The Sixers PA guy, Matt Chord announces Paul Reed as ‚ÄúBball Paul‚Äù on the loud speaker. I love it"
Paul Reed just knows how to win
Holy fuck I'm in love with Paul Reed
tbh Paul Reed may become one of the bigger steals of the draft a few years from now
Paul Reed was one of my favourite NBA prospect this year so I really hope he has a nice game and so far he's doing well!
Jokic bit on the Paul reed pass fake lmao
"Danny Green, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias. Mike Scott, who has a left knee contusion, was upgraded and will dress but is not likely to see playing time, Sixers coach Doc Rivers said.  Sizers beat writer on The Athletic"
Maxey  Mathias  Danny Green   Paul Reed  Dwight
Paul Reed game
"so who is in the rotation tonight? paul reed, tony bradley, howard, maxey, scott (to avoid forefit), ??"
"At least they got one good player back, Paul Reed gonna have to go crazy so they can win."
Paul Reed. Doesn‚Äôt matter anyway with Ben and Joel out :):):)
"Isaiah Joe, Dakota Mathias, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed are so far at the end of the bench, they usually outside the arena during game time.  Maxey has been given an opportunity to shine."
"Looks like we are getting [Joel Embiid, Danny Green and Paul Reed,](https://mobile.twitter.com/wojespn/status/1347950129396019200) back but that still only gets us to 9 players. lol"
Dude I like Paul Reed too but we gotta chill.
BBP I think is BBall Paul or Paul Reed.
This but Paul Reed is Draymond
I read ‚Äúthis generation‚Äôs Paul Reed‚Äù
Page Six: Danny Green hip thrusted Paul Reed for his first time scoring
"Has Paul gotten any time?  Was a HUGE paul reed fan in the draft, I think he's got a chance to be his generation's Paul Milsap."
"You don't follow the sixers til the season starts? I was actually excited to see them all play. Isaiah Joe, Mathias, Paul Reed."
Paul Reed out of the mud.
I know there‚Äôs more important stuff from this game but I was really praying Paul Reed would play and then when he played would hit a weird looking layup and I‚Äôm really psyched he lived up to both expectations tonight. B-Ball Paul!!!
Paul Reed is officially...  **OUT OF THE MUD!**
PAUL REED GOT OUT OF THE MUD
Paul Reed!
Paul Reed is outta the mud!!!
"To actually answer your question, Paul Reed has not played in a regular season game yet, and only played 4min in one preseason game."
Throw in Paul Reed. He got to come out the mud first though
"Obviously Simmons but lowkey a lot of Sixers fans hate Shake Milton too. He takes dumb shots and has a very low bball iq. He also takes away possessions from better younger players like Maxey and Furkan.   Part of this is Sixers fans love Embiid, Furkan, Niang, Maxey, Seth, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe to a borderline irrational extent so anybody else is viewed as lower than them. Even Tobias Harris gets some undeserved hate online."
Too valuable:  Embiid Maxey Thybulle Simmons (fml)  Contract is too good: Curry Korkmaz  Upside: Basketball Paul Reed Jaden Springer  Not Harris because I don‚Äôt think anyone else would take his contract willingly. Thoughts? Other sixers fans want to tell me who I forgot? Charles Bassey?
Paul Reed
"Paul Reed is not good.  The out the mud stuff made him popular, but the g league is not transferring.  He doesn‚Äôt deserve a spot, IMO."
hes played like 18 minutes total this year and is a 2nd round rookie (53rd pick) so not that odd when hes coming into the game as the 4th center.  basically needed drummond to look like omega shit and for embiid to be out to get a chance tonight to show what he can do.  Also not sure why Paul Reed was a DNP since those usually would be his minutes so it seems the stars aligned for him today.
well if you're not gonna give paul reed a chance in this game you might as well cut him. wtf
Are you forgetting about Paul Reed MVP and DPOY
"What you quoted isn't a slight to UD like he doesn't have friends in the locker room. What is clear is that there is a difference between him and the other players on the roster, with the understanding that he's the only guy who probably won't play meaningful minutes all year. That's not what a normal teammate would be, he is akin to a practice player more or less. He can have all the close relationships and help the chemistry etc. but he shouldn't be painted as just a normal player. He is far closer to coach or practice player than a genuine NBA player. I think that's what gets overlooked inside the Heat bubble.  Normally yes, you don't get much from the 15th roster spot but over 5 years you can convert a two way guy you develop into a rotation player for the playoffs like the sixers have with Shake Milton, Korkmaz, or Paul Reed. It's not a big deal at all, Spo and Riley are gonna keep doing it regardless but I don't think it's smart to do this for so many years. A retirement year or two sure, but 6-7 years? Misuse of resources and it speaks volumes nobody else in the league does this..."
That‚Äôs the Paul reed price man
Paul Reed needs more minutes
Paul Reed is the rich man's Willis Reed.
The Sixers played with 8 guys last night including Charles Bassey and Paul Reed.  I understand what he's trying to say.
lol. you guys beat the jazz and the nets then lost to a team starting paul reed. the NBA is weird
"The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin; Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration; Paul Reed of The Philadelphia 76ers, they call him B-ball Paul; W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air, grade A badass; and Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Die, Bill Cress is super old and really mean."
"I thought I was having an episode. Like the title clearly says Paul Reed and the first thing you hear when you open the video is ""PATRICK REED""."
Paul Paul reed mightbethe most uncoordinated goofball since Bo outlaw
Sam Hauser  Bol Bol  Saben Lee  Usman Garuba  Yves Pons  Paul Reed  Jalen Smith  Joe Wieskamp (should not be on a two-way)  Malachi Flynn
"I love Paul Reed, can‚Äôt even explain how pumped I am we drafted him, but right now a team starting him at center would be beyond rough tbh. Probably a few years away from being a consistent contributor at this level"
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"

Welcome to the Paul Reed era
"Guy literally never shit talks anyone yet he is soft for looking at a ref sideways when bum ass trash cans like Trevor Ariza and Paul Reed talk to him and cheap shot him.  As always he gets his revenge by winning, like when he swept the garbage ass Heat last year."

Reggie Miller is an idiot. Kept calling Paul Reed ‚ÄúPatrick Reed‚Äù for like half the game too
Hey can we talk about how dogshit Reggie Miller is? Dude called shake ‚ÄúShake Middleton‚Äù and Paul Reed ‚ÄúPatrick‚Äù numerous times.   Also gg bucks. Grayson was a killer tonight
Let‚Äôs trade Tobias for Kevin Durant while we‚Äôre at it and maybe swing a package of Shake Milton and Paul Reed to salary match 1991 Michael Jordan
"He knows how to keep his elbow extensions subtle because he doesn't need much to push someone over. That drive on Paul Reed Jr barely extended, even Doc told BBall Paul he was toast. I honestly don't think he did anything egregious"
Bucks win but Sixers got Paul Reed so it evens out
That Paul Reed stat is absurd.  Hes throwin that mud at Giannis.
Paul ‚ÄúPatrick‚Äù Reed!!!   Also stop snitching Giannis
"Idk about Paul Reed, but this Patrick Reed kid can ball"
"Sure. That's kinda the point. Reggie Evans had a career with no offensive game what so ever, but could be ultra relevant for about 6-8 minutes a night where he just outworked everyone else while doing insanely goofy things. I feel like that's Paul Reed, except he's good. I think that's a real high quality type."
paul reed getting the sixers out the mud
Paul ‚ÄúBBALL PATRICK‚Äù Reed
that one Bucks fan in this thread is really mad at Paul Reed for some reason
paul reed makes some mighty fine guitars
Did Reggie just call Paul Reed ‚ÄúPatrick‚Äù like 4 times?
"Do we even have enough players for this game to be played? We're down Embiid, Tobias, Simmons, Matisse, Isaiah Joe, and now Seth.    That leaves Maxey, Niang, Korkmaz, Drummond, Danny Green, Paul Reed, and Shake. Is Charles Bassey our eighth man or is he in the g-league? Either way, I hope these guys stay healthy playing so many fucking minutes since this is our fifth game in the last six days."
Paul Reed because he‚Äôs out the mud
You telling me you don‚Äôt wanna see the Drummond-Paul Reed led sixers?!/s
"Paul Reed needs to play 30+ minutes, and Doc should run plays for him."
"The starters this year outside of Embiid:  Tyrese Maxey, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Paul Reed  Maxey's minutes doubled and so naturally his 3 PA went up. Seth Curry is shooting the same amount of 3PA pretty much (4.9 vs 5.2). Shake Milton is shooting 0.3 more 3PA and shooting 7% worse."
Just wait til he does dumbshit in the Playoffs like playing Paul Reed and Andre Drummond on the floor at the same time with Thybulle or something
"Testament really to Daryl Morey‚Äôs GM skills  For some reason this subreddit likes to shit on him but the man‚Äôs an amazing GM. The Curry trade, trading Horfords terrible contract for Danny Green, drafting Maxey (and Paul Reed and Joe), signing Niang, signing Drummond‚Ä¶.dude has been elite  Our role players are just awesome. We can run a shooters+Embiid lineup and it looks as good as everyone has always thought it would"
Paul reed biting on a derozan pump fake was the biggest lock of the night
Not often at all but Paul Reed and Drummond have worked very well together tonight
"Morey has really built us a good bench. Our 4 highest paid players have missed time, but we have 9 other guys who deserve minutes.   Curry, Maxey, Matisse, Niang, Korkmaz, Drummond, and Shake have all played well. Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed haven‚Äôt played much, but I believe they can contribute with more playing time.   I‚Äôd love to see Simmons come back, dress for games, ride the bench, and watch his teammates win without him. It‚Äôd never work out like that, but I can dream."

"This ‚Äúput up good numbers against professionals‚Äù stuff is hella overblown. I love Green too but we gotta stop pretending like the g league is something it ain‚Äôt. For one, there‚Äôs 0 rim protection down there, all the centres are 6‚Äô8 or smaller. He put up 17 points a game on OK splits in only 16 games, only 1 month of basketball. In that small sample size you‚Äôd wanna see better production from someone touted as a generational scorer, I mean Cade scored more &amp; shot better on double the games while being the focal point of the defence  &amp; a much worse supporting cast  Paul Reed, Henry Ellenson, KPJ, Jordan Poole, Jared Harper, Ignas Brazdeikas, Rayjon Tucker, Kobi Simmons, Moses Brown, Mamade Diakate, Jeremiah Martin, Brodric Thomas, BJ Johnson, Reggie Perry, Nik Staukas and Nico Mannion all averaged more points than Green on either similar or better efficiency man. Green‚Äôs numbers were just OK."
How dare you disrespect reigning G League MVP Paul Reed this way.
"There are 31 FMVP winners. Including  Jojo white Paul pierce Tony Parker Kawhi Leonard Willis reed Rick berry Andre igoudala Cedric maxwell Joe dumas Chauncey billips Dwayne wade Bill Walton James worthy John havliciek  None of which have a case to being higher than curry all time. So yes, non fmvps are in the top 20."
"*Agree*. If you're Portland in this scenario, you run a lineup of Maxey/McCollum/Covington/Simmons/Nurk, and that probably gets you the 7/8 seed. Your hope is that Maxey takes a big step forward and gets molded into that traditional PG blend with a 15/7 average as a starter and grows from there (which, tbh, isn't exactly the type of player I see him as -- I think he fits the ""hopes to be Beal"" mold the most). Aside from CJ, that's a strong defensive team that gives you a few pieces to deal with in the future (not just the players but the unprotected picks).   If you're Philly, thats what you want to do -- bank on the moment and not worry about the future. Lillard/Curry/Whoever/Harris/Embiid is a strong play. Philly still keeps 1 of the 3 players that has flashed potential with Paul Reed."
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
Philly at Miami last May. It was a disappointing to see Philly get blown out but at least I got see Paul Reed ball out
And Paul Reed ~~out the mud~~ off the bench
Toss in Paul Reed and you have yourself a deal
"Not if we package him with our other assets. If any all-star caliber guards become available, we immediately have the best offer with Ben + Maxey and/or Thybulle and/or Milton and/or Paul Reed"
at backup C he's more or less doing what ilyasova did for ben 4 years ago. i don't trust porter to stay healthy. i just want a stretch 5 and i doubt doc plays paul reed any minutes.
"Yep. The most fun I have watching the Sixers is when Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed, and Rayjon Tucker are on the floor. No stress, no expectations, no scrutiny, just fun."
"Kawhi is an injury milker, but this is the best chance to get a 3rd ring he'll ever see. Paul George has been AMAZING carrying the team (still lost my full respect crying about being the most scrutinized player in the league when LeBron is still active, and I don't even like LeCrybaby/Foul milker). I'm 55% sure he will come out for Game 6, playing the Willis Reed role, as it would tremendously boost the team and fans...and there's no guarantee of a game 7 here. Just seems like such a perfect way to redeem himself and cement a legacy, especially not having to see Bron and AD at their best.  He needs to put something in the tank. Losing to Nuggets, last year, has to be a blight on his soul (if he were a regular player..but Kawhi is EXTREMELY LAZY and fanpeople/media cover for it as he can be really great when motivated and they love to try to interview him to make him seem human again).  I just don't see him missing Game 6."
Paul Reed
Simmons + Maxey + Korkmaz (sign and trade) + Milton + Isiah Joe + Paul Reed + 4 Picks + 3 Swaps
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
might as well throw in George Hill Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed
"Paul Reed for the Sixers absolutely dominated the G-League bubble, winning G-League MVP and ROY putting up 22/12 with 2 stls and 1.8 blks on 59/44/79 and took them to the G-League Finals (they lost to the Lakers G-League team). He hasn't really gotten any burn in the NBA though, but put up 17/12 in 23 mins in a game at the end of the season.  He probably needs to go somewhere without an MVP-caliber center to flourish, but he's under contract for the next two seasons so could be awhile."
"He's going to have a Willis Reed or Paul Pierce wheelchair game, isn't he?"
"People like ""who is paul reed??""  They'll know very soon. Kid has massive potential"
"For those of you who are going to ask who paul reed is, look yourself in the mirror right now. Think about what you see long and hard. Figure out where you went wrong. What led to you becoming such a failure. Truly evalaute deeply the decisions you've made in life. Understand why you made them. Figure out what steps you need to take to improve. You're not doing good enough right now. You should know who paul reed is."
Bruh who tf Paul Reed and why do I care about his off-season workout plans?
Who is Paul Reed
Paul Reed has to be one of the least NBA sounding names right now
"I mean mike scott is awful and has shown during the season hes incredibly awful at the 5. Paul Reed is not a realistic option to play in game 7 of a conference semi final. I dont know what the solution is. He tried tobias+ bench, really wasnt very good. Ben+ tobias plus Bench with ben at 5. Really wasnt good. Ben plus tobias plus dwight at 5, really wasnt good. Hard to blame a coach when the roster is the problem and theres not a solution"
"Literally anything other tham the same thing over and over.   Literally put in Mike Scott and see if that works.  Put in Paul Reed. Put im Isaiah Joe at center.  I could give a fuck, just try somethimg othet then multiple stints of Simmons-Howard-Harris in the same game."
Paul reed time
How is making a joke about the sixers' deep reserve Paul Reed trash talk?  Taking that comment too seriously.. Man that's a bad look.
And Paul Reed isn‚Äôt there to get them out.
Doc has given all our young guys lots of playing time. Maybe with the exception of Paul Reed but he's just super raw.
"Wtf are you talking about, Paul Reed and Embiid barely get any mins together"
