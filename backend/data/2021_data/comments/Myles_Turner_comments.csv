Myles Turner has also played out of his mind since the trade.
"It was a stat I saw on here not too long ago. I'm not sure how to find those types of stats. Even if it is myles Turner, it's easier to rebound after a contest at the rim, than after closing out on a shooter"
"People who think most blocks = dpoy, should hassan whiteside have gotten it last year? Myles turner is a worse defender than embiid, kawhi, giannis, and gobert"
I find it hard to believe he contests more than Myles Turner. Show me the stat and I'll change my mind.
Ain‚Äôt he a PF though? Thought they had Myles Turner on C
"Myles Turner is, according to my research, the best NBA player in the league currently."
Myles 'Swatted Away By' Turner
"If you guys could land a Myles Turner type I think you'd be GOLDEN.  &amp;#x200B;  I...really think the Kemba move was a bit of an error, Kemba is a great player, but I don't think he's a max type guy and I think he's a dude with a skillset that isn't going to age well (small, quick guards...).  &amp;#x200B;  I think you have the time to figure it out, but I do think that while it wasn't all his fault at all, Ainge's big moves to surround the Jay's have all floundered a bit."
I'd probably include Myles Turner as a guy with quadruple double potential
People who only look at box scores will say Myles Turner
It‚Äôs Myles Turner lmao  r/nba is legit idiotic if they think it‚Äôs Rudy
"I‚Äôm a Pacers fan man. I wish Myles Turner had half the talent offensively that Jokic has. He would be an all around elite center, not just an elite defender. Sabonis and Turner would mesh so much better then."
"I mean, isn't 51% a large field goal percentage to be surrounding in the paint? Myles Turner, in comparison, looks freaking elite as a rim protector."
"Fucking hell Myles Turner 40% on 10 attemtps, breh"
myles turner maybe but neither of the others
"Marc Gasol, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez"
No one is saying this but should be Myles Turner
"Lol he‚Äôll never get shit man. His defense gets overlooked because his offense is so good. I don‚Äôt give a shit how many blocks Myles Turner has, I swear if Embiid was a mediocre offensive player people would be calling a him a DPOY candidate every year  Edit: and don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs missed 5 games, you know that‚Äôs not why he didn‚Äôt get voted"
even against say the Pacers. Sabonis and Myles Turner are going to eat that defense for breakfast.
Myles Turner should be first team. He's a DPOY candidate and he's averaging more blocks per game than 3 teams.
Myles Turner
People are saying Myles Turner after he fouled out defending 35 year old Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley üòÇ
Impact stats are noisy this early in the season but the top-5 defenders by RAPTOR are :  1) Gobert  2) Myles Turner  3) Capela  4) Conley (probably benefits from sharing the floor with Gobert a lot)  5) Embiid (distant 5th)
Myles Turner
Sixers did a great job but this game was on Bjorkgren   You got Sabonis who‚Äôs tailor made to just shred a zone if you put him in the middle at the top of the key or FT line to facilitate offense. They didn‚Äôt do it at all  Instead it was just pick and roll with TJ or Brogdon. They could never hit Sabonis or Turner on the roll partly because Philly packed up the paint. Easy solution is to just get a shooter on the weak side and kick it out that way amongst other stuff you can do to capitalize on it. And they never did at all. Just the same shit every time embarrassing  Also Myles Turner wanted the Joel Embiid smoke but couldn‚Äôt even handle Dwight Howard without fouling out. Also not good
Myles turner put up 9 and 5 against tony Bradley and fouled out let‚Äôs relax a little bit suggesting Embiid is ducking that lmao
[Myles Turner decided yesterday to announce he was ready to step up to the challenge of Joel Embiid and then a day later put up 9 points/5 rebounds and fouled out against Tony Bradley and 35 year old Dwight Howard.](https://twitter.com/dansbadtweets/status/1356065509880582147?s=19)
It would appear Myles Turner is not who he thought he was
"Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Jakob P√∂ltl"
"Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Lu Dort, Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons"
"I believe Bill Walton holds the record with 34 double doubles to open the season. Regardless, still a pretty impressive feat. Not a nuggets fan but can appreciate Joker‚Äôs game, wish Myles Turner was half as talented offensively."
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokiƒá - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
I don't think Zion will make the team.  he is a sieve on defense and they need at least one big like Bam or Myles Turner to defend the likes of Jokic and Vucevic.  And they would probably give Trae's spot to one of the older guards that would want to go like Mike Conley or Chris Paul.  Trae and Zion's time would probably come in 2024.
Myles Turner ‚Äî- prettiest shot award
I could be wrong but I think he was talking about Myles Turner leading the league in blocks and Rudy being second.
I‚Äôve always said that Fraudzingis is a high usage Myles Turner who chucks 18 shots a game.
"If Charlotte didn't come in at the last minute, they'd have Myles Turner"
Brought him in cause they couldn't agee on a package with Indy for Myles Turner.
"Mitchell Robinson won't make an All-Defensive team over Embiid, Gobert and Myles Turner dude..."
you forgot Myles 'Myles Turner' Turner Myles Turner Myles
"Man Rudy is playing amazingly, but saying he absolutely should win DPOY over Myles Turner is a bit suspect"
the only player to even compete with him rn is myles turner who is barely getting any recognition whatsoever
"Paul George dragged the Pacers to the playoffs (and 45 wins) with rookie Myles Turner and George Hill as his next best players, while coming off of one of the most Gruesome injures by an NBA player and still only made third team All-NBA."
"If they wanted a stretch 5 who can play defense and were already set on overpaying a center, they could simply have taken Horford off our hands  Also Myles Turner was seemingly available this summer (was offered in a S&amp;T for Hayward I believe)  though I agree that generally it‚Äôs not the most bountiful archetype, but you can at least get holdover options like playing Melli more or trading for a Bjelica/Tucker/Muscala type"
&gt; Actually you guys turned down getting a pick and Myles Turner for Hayward and wanted more.  Actually that's total bullshit. In order to trade Hayward to Indiana he first had to agree to sign in Indiana. He preferred the role and money Charlotte offered which is why we got the tpe instead.
"Actually you guys turned down getting a pick and Myles Turner for Hayward and wanted more. Apparently Ainge shopped Turner around and couldn't find anything, which made people on this sub think Myles wasn't worth much to the rest of the league.  I think the actual issue is that Ainge probably shopped him around and asked for a lot and most teams didn't want to pay the Ainge price for him, not that he had no value whatsoever. On top of that, Ainge turning that deal in the first place was an awful decision considering who they've ended up with for their front court. Theis and Thompson aren't the answer in the playoffs and they passed down on a shot blocking, spacing big(which is what we knew him as before)."
Thats cool and all but did you know Myles Turner has a HIGHER blocks per game average this season than THREE ENTIRE TEAMS?
WHERE'S MY BOY MYLES TURNER?
"Myles""&gt;""&gt;""&gt;Wizards""Pelicans""Heat""Turner"
Myles Turner says: what's up doc?
Myles Turner
Interesting that Turner and Sabonis are both top 3 for DFGA. Seems our defensive strategy is to funnel the ball into the bigs and let Myles block their shots and Domas take the rebound.
"Funny, when did Myles  Turner get on the Jazz?  Kidding, love you Pacers West cats."
"Wizards get: Myles Turner, SGA  OKC get: T.J Warren, pacers 1st, pacers 2nd  Pacers get: Bradley beal, OKC 1st"
"Wizards get: Myles Turner, SGA  OKC get: T.J Warren, pacers 1st, pacers 2nd  Pacers get: Bradley beal, OKC 1st"
Myles Turner disagrees.
&gt;You mean like the Myles Turner that they refused for a Hayward looking to leave anyway?  The way this sub locks into wrong narratives is infuriating. Hayward chose Charlotte! Ainge trying to squeeze more out of Indiana IF he chose to be a Pacer had nothing to do with that.
The first comment made an obvious reference to how Indiana was offering Myles Turner for a Gordon Hayward S&amp;T; Ainge held out when he should have gone for it
Myles Turner who is not as good on defense and is super trigger happy on offense.
"On the flip side, Nate Duncan loves Myles Turner to a ridiculous degree and has come around on Sabonis this year."
"Three $20M guys for one $40M guy, you tell me?  ## [Jerami Grant](https://www.spotrac.com/redirect/player/15391/)  ## [Myles Turner](https://www.spotrac.com/redirect/player/17839/)  ## [Aaron Gordon](https://www.spotrac.com/redirect/player/15356/)  For Curry/KD/Harden/LeBron/AD?"
"I remember this same exact stat two years ago, but it was the Cavaliers instead, both with Myles Turner"
What if we trade Myles Turner for an entire team
Nephews push hard for any scenario that helps their team and is valid in the online trade machine tool.  Nephews on my sub wanted to trade away the Tatum and Brown picks a few years ago.  Last year the Bill Simmons nephs had Indy giving us Myles Turner and signing Jordan Clarkson as our 6th man.
I would like to start my campaign by saying that both Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner definitely deserve all-star spots.   Malcolm Brogdon should get consideration. Probably either him or Collin Sexton should be the last guard.
"This isn't a bad question.  Center right now is still super undervalued... except when it's not (\*cough\* Steven Adams \*cough\*).  It's really hard to figure.  Like Houston didn't want to pay Jarret Allen.  Both Boston and Indy supposedly couldn't find any takers when shopping Myles Turner for a 1st.  It's a weird situation out there for Centers.  Seems unless you have that 'it' factor, no one wants you.  And Drummond does not have it."
I had two thoughts about the Pacers coming into this season.  Victor Oladipo is overrated based on one good year and not worth anything close to a max and Myles turner was just a shot blocker and not good a good defender.  I was wrong on one of those.
Myles Turner went from being a marshmallow to a defensive anchor
"Love Myles but counting stats like steals and blocks are pretty rudimentary and only tell so much of the story.  If you look at more advanced metrics like FG% allowed and contests and thing like that, Turner is most definitely NOT head and shoulders above everyone else.  I think he very much deserves to be one of like 2-4 guys in the discussion"
"They should go for Nerlens Noel imo, would be a good fit for the squad and he‚Äôs a better rim protector than DJ and McGee. Unrealistic options would be Myles Turner and KAT. Can you imagine KAT pick n roll with Harden? Quite unstoppable"
What about Myles Turner?
What about Myles Turner.... oh wait...
"Myles Turner is probably the answer here. Rim protector and can stretch the floor. He would be fucking lethal next to Harden, KD, and Kyrie."
Jarrett Allen. Myles Turner. Larry Nance Jr.
Myles Turner
"Jarrett Allen or Myles Turner would fix a lot of our problems at the (starting) centre position. Yes, I know neither of these trades can or will happen."
"Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty fair thought, a lot of Pacers fans (myself included) knew Myles was the better player all along. I love Sabonis but his game is one dimensional and obviously he‚Äôs nowhere the defensive anchor Turner is."
"The way the Pacers' defense collapsed in the 2 games where Myles Turner didn't play aptly demonstrated his value to the team.  Yet I saw some posts where people think the Pacers should just trade him, he's much more valuable to the Pacers than he is to most teams"
So Myles Turner but reverse?
Myles Turner
"I'm really happy sabonis is on the pacers, but he is not a great defender, by any stretch. I also don't really think he's underrated on this sub. If anything, Myles turner is."
People refuse to understand Embiid owns Myles Turner lol
Also sabonis plays PF. Myles turner is their center
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
"IDK, it seems to me like when he is fed the ball in the post he has a bad habit of just bricking LaMarcus Aldridge turnarounds.  He is a tantalizing player because he is so dominant on putbacks and increasingly (in this game at least) finishing lobs and stuff, but it just seems like he can't translate that physical dominance into an efficient post game. He's [101 in the league in Free Throw Rate](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ftr) at .264, which is pretty low for a center (Embiid is at .658). You do have more finesse / stretch type guys like Myles Turner (.252), Ibaka (.191), and Vucevic (.111) below that, but they all have much higher three-point attempt rates (.450, .301, .337) than Ayton (.047 (!) ).  I think maybe his handle and/or footwork are letting him down in the post, because he definitely shows the physicality in other parts of the game, but in iso he struggles to attack the rim and draw fouls."
"&gt;*Pacers fans had legitimate arguments last year that Turner was being unflatteringly compared to Sabonis because of his skin color*  What?  What skin color has to do with performance ? Myles performance this year/ last year was like day/night. Unlike this yeah, last year he was garbage most of the time."
"Against Embiid, Giannis, Tristan Thompson, Myles Turner/Sabonis, Vucevic and then someone like AD or Jokic??  He will get absolutely roasted"
"No. DPOY isn't just about counting stats and one fucking game isn't going to suddenly catapult him into contention. Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and Anthony Davis are the front runners and I don't see Capela breaking into the top 4, let alone top 3 for the award."
pacers didnt have myles turner either
I really don‚Äôt understand why so many in Boston didn‚Äôt want Myles Turner. He seems like he would be a great long term fit with them
‚ÄúEven‚Äù Myles Turner is really undervaluing how well he‚Äôs playing this year
"What do you mean ""or even Myles Turner"" like he's an afterthought. He'd be my pick for DPOY right now."
"Sure he can be a candidate but he isn't more impactful on defence than any of Gobert, AD, Embiid, Giannis or even Myles Turner."
Myles Turner was the best center on the floor tonight. Outplayed Vuc and Domas.
Can‚Äôt believe no one‚Äôs said Myles Turner yet.
Turner Myles.
Myles fucking Turner
A center like Myles turner who can help Zion defensivly down low
"Partly because Shaq's a great among great.  Simply saying he would be average is ludacris.  Average is for guys like Myles Turner. Poor analogy.    For my records.... Are you old enough to have watched Shaq in that era? or are you one of those ""EMBID IS THE GREATEST CENTER OF ALL TIME"" folks."
"Yeah I perosnally have thought they work REALLY well. I've been a Sabonis stan since OKC - his shot was really nice but watching him sit in corners felt like a waste. He is SO good from the DHO and his low post is SO good. He can actually bang with bigger bodies - and Turner is good enough to work off ball for blocks /  he actually is decent at guarding wings.   &amp;#x200B;  The thing that's scary is they have more they can use, that they don't a ton. With a good PnR guard you can have Sabonis still space with a PnR w/ Myles or vice versa. If they could pick up like a Jamal, Dame type of guard I'd actually put them as legit contenders. Being able to run that super high PnR with Sabonis have him run the 4v5 down hill ? Shit sounds crazy."
"Okay fine--  &gt;That would make sense if we assume Dame is an average player  Usually average players don't take a ton of shots in the last 10 seconds of close games. You're comparing Dame to other primary options in this scenario. Here is the list of players who have taken at least 3 shots in the last 10 seconds of a 1 point or tied game:  LaVine, Murray, LeBron, Booker, Mitchell, Tatum, Doncic, CP3, Dame, Brogdon, Siakam, Steph, Beal, Hield, Sexton, Damion Lee, Fox, Sabonis, VanVleet, Grant, KD, Jokic, DeRozan, Giannis, Quickley, Embiid, Kuzma, Lowry, Dort, Harrell, SGA, Terrence Ross, Rozier, and Myles Turner.   For the most part besides Quickley, Kuzma, Dort, and Damion Lee those are all #1 or #2 guys on their teams and not average players at all. So really comparing Dame to league average FGA on these one possession close game shots isn't comparing Dame to average players at all, it's essentially comparing him to the average #1 or #2 option for any given team."
"Lol they‚Äôve had so much success on their rookie contracts, you really think one down year is going to make them flee? And a second round exit would hardly be a failure.  Secondly, these guys are part of our problem too. They‚Äôre growing into becoming stars. They still haven‚Äôt ascended to making their teammates around them better. They‚Äôre still figuring out being the main option so a year like this gives them time to grow.  And what moves do you suggest Danny have done? AD, PG, Kawhi and Jimmy who all most likely leave after a season with us (considering they would‚Äôve come in our most toxic year except AD, who we had to wait until summer for because of the kyrie trade and by then, he definitely wanted nothing to do with us)?  Myles Turner? The guy Indy has made known is available and we STILL could not have gotten because Hayward would‚Äôve heard all offers on a Friday and couldn‚Äôt sign until a Sunday. The narrative that we turned down the Indy trade isn‚Äôt true because it wasn‚Äôt an option since he had to agree to the S&amp;T. And once that Charlotte deal was on the table and MJ was calling him Friday night, he was taking that over either of us.  Not sure who else were supposed to get. Harden I suppose?"
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
Fair enough. I agree Zubac is a low ceiling player. If we could swing a 3 team trade for Myles Turner or Vucevic I‚Äôd take that over Zubac or Maxey.
"Yeah I definitely agree Philly being able to offer picks makes it more interesting. Guess it depends on how many they‚Äôre willing to give up.  Alternatively, we could also expand our options beyond the Sixers and Clippers and go for a higher ceiling centre than Zubac. If we can somehow swing Myles Turner in a 3 team trade I‚Äôd be all for it. I also saw a three team trade proposal where the Sixers get Lowry, Raptors get Vucevic and the Magic get a combination of TD/Maxey/Thybulle and multiple firsts that I found interesting."
"PG was 4th on his team in scoring that elimination game behind Lance Stephenson, Jeff Teague, and Myles Turner.   I've gone back 4 years now.  The comment I was originally replying to said Playoff P was a false narrative based on the last two season and he has successfully carried his teams every other year."
Give KD Myles Turner
"We have a couple of needs but he does solve one: wing depth. We like to rely on switchability and we just don‚Äôt have the pieces to run Brads defense the best right now. We‚Äôre hoping PP can be our backup PG of the future and that Rob Will can be the 5 of the future with Theis or TT supporting him. The type of 5 we need to really become full blown unstoppable isn‚Äôt available. Myles Turner doesn‚Äôt fix our issues and we can‚Äôt get a guy like Bam or any other all star level center.  Our biggest issue is ball movement, and that‚Äôs honestly going to have to come internally. We can‚Äôt move on from Kemba and the Jays HAVE to get better at it. No place for a distributing guard. Next is a great center, no real options there. What we can do is create an unstoppable flock of wings to stifle opponents. And Barnes is unselfish, he doesn‚Äôt care about being a top option (problem with wanting Hayward or Grant), he can shoot, can defend, can attack, pass and has championship experience. And his contract ends the same time as Kemba so he can fit in with the Jays and we can let them walk in 2 years if we feel we need to upgrade"
Myles Turner or Domantas Sabonis
"Don‚Äôt mind that at all, but before that id try to swing a 3 team deal for Myles Turner"
They screwed up royally when they didn‚Äôt get Myles Turner. He would‚Äôve been a perfect fit for them.
"On D yes, big time. On offense I think he still has a spark, and now that he seems committed coming off the bench we'll get a better idea, I think.   As a quality starter he might be done. I'm not saying 100% because he's still coming back from an injury. Like if he played with a Myles Turner type of big who can cover his ass and get out of the way he could maybe be an interesting secondary option for a team looking for a floor raiser, but those situations are hard to come by."
mYLeS tUrNEr
I think you‚Äôre talking about Myles Turner there
Y‚Äôall jazz fans clowning on Myles Turner last game against Embiid where art thou now?
they said he was ducking Myles Turner before lmao
Gobert is like a better version of Myles Turner. Great at defending modern NBA teams where he just floats and protects the rim. Average 1 on 1 defender and can get bullied on the block or toasted off the dribble.
"Joel ""scared of Gobert and Myles Turner"" Embiid  back to back games on sonning them both lol.  Theyll do anything to disparage this man"
"Don't let your perception be skewed by these numbers though. Most guys get between 25-45 a night on average. The Myles Turner, Lonzo Ball, Thad Young types for example. Harden with the insane year he having usually gets about 60-70, although he has 72 tonight.  So 50+ is good, 60+ is great, 70+ is amazing  It just so happens McConnell's game tonight is the 2nd best I can remember all season (I recall Steph Curry getting over 100 one game)"
Myles Turner has entered the chat
"Only over this half a season and with 2/3rd the volume. Turner is way better over his career.  Edit: maybe the other way to say it is Sabonis is better in the post, but he's definitely the one that plays inside on offense, while Myles was more often on the perimeter in the games I watched."
"Wiseman averages like 1 min more than IQ not a huge diff. Wiseman averages higher reb, blocks, fg %, and efficiency. Also wiseman started most of his minutes and was playing in the starting rotation against centers like Anthony Davis, Myles turner, etc. I can‚Äôt say IQ has been matched up against the same competition as he‚Äôs not exactly in the starting rotation"
"An illusion fools you.   He‚Äôs ‚Äúsolid, average‚Äù when he can check other stiffs and tomato cans like Greg Monroe and oxygen-starved Myles Turner. He gets devoured by the game‚Äôs elite bigs.   I don‚Äôt care about his playoff performance in past seasons, balling up bums like Rudy and Paul George. Or his efficiency. The guy makes his layups - I‚Äôll give him that - he just lacks the ability to get to the line at an  elite rate. If your team has to win the play-in game to make the first round, you have no seat at the MVP table."
No Myles Turner did
"How many Terry Rozier, Myles Turner, or Danny Ainge posts are we gonna see between now &amp; are next game?  üò¥"
"Nah they both deserve the list, myles turner, lbj, and jamal shouldn't be (maybe turner 5th)"
"What about a number that represented the players averages that he was defending was somehow integrated into this value?  So say he scores 13, but he holds Jokic to 19 and 35% shooting, his overall figure would would increase in value as opposed to if he scored 13, but Myles Turner scored 19 on 35% shooting.  I actually think this would be a really effective way of measuring players‚Äô true value."
"Ben Simmons, Dort, Giannis, Myles Turner, Gobert  Jrue Holiday, Royce O'Neale &amp; OG Anunoby should be on the 2nd team"
"&gt;Turner *is* a player that makes you better. He *is* a player you need, that‚Äôs exactly the point. &gt; &gt;‚ÄúMyles Turner is Myles Turner but the TPE could be anything, even Myles Turner!‚Äù  &gt;   He isn't. He isn't the primary need. He doesn't solve Boston's issues.   &gt;‚ÄúA boat‚Äôs a boat but the mystery box could be anything, even a boat!‚Äù   A better comparison would be if you were looking for a house to live in and you said ""a boat can be a house, why not just take that and be happy"".    &gt;When literally every complaint you have about Turner‚Äôs salary applies for the hypothetical players you‚Äôll acquire using that TPE. As in, you‚Äôll still have to pay a ton of tax, probably even more than you would for Turner.   No it doesn't for two reasons:   - you can take on shorter term money that doesn't push into that third year like Turner does   - you can choose to only commit to long term money if the player actually solves your needs and pushes you to a contender level"
"\&gt;Name me aside of Kawhi, Simmons and Draymond green another player who can guard 5 positions.  Herein lies your problem: you're conflating defense with ''''guarding''''? What does that mean? Is it quantifiable? Or are things like rim protection the most important thing? Clearly the latter.   FYI: this season in 300 mins without Joel guess what ben's net rating is? -9 and his defensive rating is 117. really horrible for someone who is supposedly the best defensive player in the league  \&gt;Embiid is a great defender and I would have put him at the place of Myles Turner but Simmons deserves that #1 spot  No embiid is a defensive juggernaut he's not just 'great' he is anchoring an incredible defense."
Get Myles turner
"Name me aside of Kawhi, Simmons and Draymond green another player who can guard 5 positions. Did you even see what he did to Luka, Dame??? Embiid is a great defender and I would have put him at the place of Myles Turner but Simmons deserves that #1 spot. If you ever watched him play, you will know what I am talking about."
"Ah yes, noted 30% floor spacer Myles Turner"
Who needs Myles Turner with Theis/Thompson  .......Celtics
Myles Turner round and walk out the arena.
"I want to be mad about this but I can't because he's 100% right, and I love Myles Turner."
As soon as my said respectfully I already knew there was bound to b sum extra DIS-respect thrown in by Joel  He‚Äôs prob right but Myles Turner would prob prefer u just come out and say he‚Äôs been trash when playing against me  Just sayin
"He's shown 3 point range, and so even if what he ends up being is like a supercharged Myles Turner that's still a really valuable player."
Waiting on those Myles Turner &amp; Danny Ainge posts ü•±
The idea of Myles Turner is better than the reality or some shit Boston fans were peddling
"Sure, if you're comparing him to like Jokic, Plumlee is a phenomenal athlete. But overall he's nothing special. He plays Center *because* he's so limited athletically. So you can't just compare him to other Centers. Lots of guys about the same size play more athletically demanding positions because they're faster, quicker, more agile and explosive.  Just to name a few -- Ben Simmons, Embiid, Durant, Giannis, AD, Ayton, KAT, Jonathan Isaac, Myles Turner, Michael Porter are all about the same size as Plumlee and way more athletic in every way"
"Everytime Myles Turner scores I just imagine him yelling ""cap space!"""
"That is what I am wondering. Myles Turner, Justin Holiday, &amp; TJ McConnell grade out great in this stat. They must clamp down hard whenever Sabonis sits, or something crazy is happening."
"Denver should try to trade for Maxi Kleber. Not too many PFs who can guard the rim well. I think he'd be easier to get than Myles Turner, who's another option. Maybe Maxi and a first (plus more??) for Michael Porter Jr"
I could've sworn I've seen Myles Turner play just fine with another playmaking big that isn't a rim protector. I must've been imagining it.
They really need someone who can play PF who can shoot and protect the rim next to Jokic. Myles Turner perhaps? Unfortunately I don't know if the Pacers are looking to move him anymore.
"they need defense, a myles turner kind of player for the right price would be great with zion"
Myles Turner is the obvious one. A different one is Steven Adams
"I hate saying things like this because they‚Äôre so annoying to hear but I would‚Äôve tried to package the picks and make a play at a guys like Myles Turner, DeMar Derozan, Steven Adams, Bogdan Bogdonvic, Jrue Holiday, Harrison Barnes. Or if I was really confident in my draft skills I wouldve made more of an effort to move up in the draft in either 2019 or 2020"
Let‚Äôs not pretend that Celtics fans thought their supporting cast was actually decent in the beginning of the season lmao.   ‚ÄúGrant Williams next Draymond green‚Äù  ‚ÄúSemi Ojeleye has reinvented himself into a top tier sniper role player‚Äù   ‚ÄúTristan Thompson is better than Myles Turner and his championship experience will help the Celtics‚Äù
Bro Hayward wanted to go to Charlotte. Charlotte does not have Myles Turner so how does this make sense?
"They had a chance to do a S&amp;T with Indian but preferred paying TT 10 mil over Myles Turner. So yeah, they let him walk for nothing when they had a S&amp;T offer that fit their needs on the table."
"are AD and giannis getting mentioned over myles turner?  I'm not one of the pacers fanbois who is going to get pissed if Gobert beats Myles, but I think Myles is a top 3 candidate easily"
"An argument hinging on the fact that the celtics should have traded for Myles Turner, no thanks."
The Myles Turner trade fell through because Charlotte backed up the brinks truck
Losing Hayward for nothing and not accepting the MYLES Turner trade was definitely a big blow for them.
"&gt; Tell me why Rudy Gobert is not the DPOY again this year, please.  Voter fatigue and a great defensive season from Myles Turner.  Rudy deserves it, though."
Passing   one of the biggest myths is the idea of the ‚Äúfloor spacing 5‚Äù you can count on one hand the number of 5s that are actual floor spacers. These al horford Myles Turner types nobody guards them regardless of whatever their percentages are nobody cares. They don‚Äôt provide floor spacing. It just doesn‚Äôt matter people conceptualize it as way way more valuable than it actually is   Legit playmaking from a big opens up a lot in terms of how you can run your offense
"Myles Turner was great during an all-star game, his voice is smooth as fuck  Conley would be great too, smart guy and has a nice sounding voice"
I think it'd be the funniest thing ever if you turned around and traded him for Myles Turner + Doug McDermott + FRP
"The Celtics front office is frankly inexcusable. Even last year, it was clear that the Celtics needed a big better than Theis if they wanted to make any progress, and that bench depth was lacking. Also, I'm a Sixers fan, and I hate the celtics (I love Brown + Tatum though) usually, but it's still infuriating to watch a FO just tank their very good team in this way.   They did virtually nothing to help, and they completely botched the Myles Turner trade that would have been such a huge help. Danny Ainge needs to go, because his inability to make a single proper move this year is baffling, especially when the needs of the team are so clear. Even now, a move for Drummond would be a huge asset, and Kevin O'Connor suggested that maybe even Vucevic could be available?  And frankly Kemba needs to really get motivated or get benched. I don't understand how he's out there smiling and laughing like he's in wonderland when the team is getting their ass whooped. I get he's a nice guy, but dude you're losing.  The Celtics aren't a problem of core talent. Tatum+Brown+Smart (when he gets back) is a good core, but they need a big, and some back-up."
"No, he's not, but Ainge is starting to suffer the Joe Dumars syndrome, where you start seeing the decline and the bad decisions, but he‚Äôs getting a pass, because he was great a few years back.  I think there are some key problems that Ainge is having now. First, wanting to have the best deal in trades. Second, he overvalues first round picks. Third, asset mismanagement. Which is a problem, because it leads to a chain reaction like the Gordon Hayward and Myles Turner situation, where the potential trade was possible, but he didn‚Äôt do that because he wasn‚Äôt the one having the best deal and because he overvalued his position, and current roster.   I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to reach full Joe Dumars mode, because Ainge still has Tatum, and Brown, and Stevens but the decline of this Celtics team is really concerning. This team went from ‚ÄúIf they figure out they win it all‚Äù to ‚ÄúThey are 1-2 pieces from being in the top 3 in the East‚Äù ."
I wish Myles Turner got some respect. He doesnt have to win but still.
Not to rub salt in a wound or anything but imagine if Ainge had just traded him for Myles Turner
You mean when he could have sign and traded Hayward for Myles Turner + McDermott but chose not to because he thought Turner was overrated?
"Because Myles Turner has no offensive game when his jump shot isn't falling, unfortunately."
"Gordon hayward wants to play for the pacers. Pacers offered myles turner + mcdermott for hayward last year and that was rejected by the celtics who wanted oladipo or tj warren with myles turner instead of mcdermott. Gordon Hayward‚Äôs value at the moment is around what the Pacers offered last season, and some would argue the pacers were overvaluing him by adding mcdermott. The celtics were definitely brazen by trying to swipe oladipo or tj warren instead, but thats just how danny ainge plays the game. I would stay his value is what the pacers offered last season. Myles turner + doug mcdermott or myles turner + a 1st round pick."
Myles Turner and a FRP
"Can we please put the Myles Turner narrative to rest? Wyc very clearly said in his interview today that the Indiana situation was not a negotiation issue (i.e. it was a contract issue)  If Hayward actually wanted to go to Indiana and the Celtics fucked him over, he wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to the sign and trade."
Every time Myles turner throws up a turnaround I can just here it clank right as it leaves his hand
"It is definitely possible imo. I would point to John Urschel who isn't an MVP NBA player, but getting accepted by MIT to do a PhD in math while playing in the NFL suggests to me it would be possible--maybe if he had genetics that favored basketball physically. There's also really smart, talented players in the NBA, Jaylen Brown and Myles Turner come to mind. Plus admission into Stanford is heavily extracurricular-based, and well basketball is an extracurricular so it'd be impossible to even tell if all the variables in this hypothetical aren't confounded."
Myles Turner-round
Myles turner would be a good pairing
"Wow, thanks!  How about Myles Turner &amp; Malcolm Brodgon? I kinda feel like Sabonis might actually legitimately be the Pacers' 3rd best player."
Teams need to put in offers for Myles Turner
Honestly I think Bam and Trae are much bigger snubs than Sabonis...you could even convince me that Myles Turner is a bugger snub and I wouldn't disagree : defense matters a ton for that position
"They failed to turn their 5000 mid range first rounders into players that can contribute. Making a grab at Myles Turner earlier in the season would have been a big win, for instance.  The league also fucked their chance to get AD by giving Lakers and Pels picks they didn't have a shot at, thus greasing the deal through. In turn they ended up with Kemba"
"Ah yes gotta love the ""Are you new here?"" argument. My favorite next to ""You never play basketball.""  If that's a flagrant the likes of Myles Turner and Giannis will be tossed out three times per game.  Were you calling for flagrants when Danny Green did this to Klay Thompson?"
The list is really more like  1. Rudy ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  2) Myles Turner/ Ben Simmons ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  Everyone else
"You're incorrect about me. I'm open to persuasion. But nobody has given me a good reason why Gobert is so much better than Myles. And honestly, I'd take him over Turner right now. But I think it's a reasonably close fight.  Here are some stats that lead me to believe Turner is at least on the same plain as Gobert:   Blocks: Turner 3.5, Gobert 2.8  Steals: Turner 1.1, Gobert 0.7  Defensive Win Shares: Gobert 2.2, Turner 1.5  Defensive Box Plus/Minus: Turner +2.2, Gobert +2.0  I also know that Turner has the most points saved at the rim, most shots contested at the rim, and a better ""Defensive FG% Below Average"" than Gobert.  I would like to find the stat of opponent FG% as the nearest defender, because I believe Gobert is #1 in that."
"A:  There is no scenario where a player or agent admits ‚Äúx isn‚Äôt an attractive fa destination.‚Äù  It‚Äôs unprofessional.  But everyone knew it.  Pretending it‚Äôs an idea that this sub came up with is both giving too much credit to this sub and denying cause and effect.  B:  You‚Äôre not contending for rings.  You‚Äôve made 3 ECFs, but the only time you got close, you lost to a LeBron squad that got swept.  You‚Äôre not making the correct moves.  Hayward left for nothing when Indiana was offering Myles Turner and a first in a sign and trade.  That move would have made you contenders.  Kemba coming back to form is a bandaid over a bullet wound.  You do not have good enough rim defense, and in the playoffs, that matters.  Kyrie was also not the correct move.  In fact, two score first PGs with suspect passing skills and missing a fair amount of bbiq are hardly the fa additions the Celtics needed.  They took a shot, and I credit them for that, but they weren‚Äôt the right moves.  If you‚Äôre trying to ask what if, a healthy Kemba or engaged Kyrie still has 0 chance of beating the KD Warriors and right now they aren‚Äôt going to beat the Sixers, Bucks, Heat or maybe even the Raptors.  Long story short, Kemba/Kyrie were talented bad fits and even more importantly you do not have the big you need to win a title.  Getting massacred in the ECF of a historically weak east is not contending, they never had a chance to win."
I mean what would you have done pre-hayward?   Like who specifically do you think would have put them over the top without ruining any chance at future success?  Also tbh i dont think myles turner makes the current team anywhere near a title contender.
Could have pulled a trigger way before they had Hayward.   Could have done it when they had him too. Angie couldn‚Äôt even pull the trigger to get Myles Turner and chose to lose Hayward for nothing instead.
"My guy. Myles Turner is 1st in blocks. You know what else he is? 1st in fouls committed. Rudy Gobert is (I think) 3rd in blocks, and 99th in fouls committed. Myles Turner is a whirling dervish at the rim, Gobert is a disciplined expert."
Myles Turner
They are both well above average. A big part of why they are so heavily critizied is because of the market they play for. If they played for a feel good franchise like Oklahoma they'd be beloved. They have two top 20 players both under 25. They have made deep playoff runs in each of the last 3 years and are poised to do it for the next 10. Not many coaches or executives can put together a team like that.    I just think Hayward and a first for myles turner was a good deal Ainge should have taken(and supposedly the offer on the table was better).
"&gt;What about not getting Myles Turner?  Charlotte was going to make that offer before the moratorium ended and there's a good chance Hayward takes it no matter what.   If he really wanted to be on the Pacers, he would be. The Celtics and Pacers would have had a staring contest about it, but it would have happened if Hayward didn't choose more money."
"&gt;He could but he is very adamant in where he wanted to go. And he is also 32 so realistically its 3 years of prime Harden and then we only have Jayson.  3 years is long enough to win a title. Harden, Tatum, Smart, Tucker (can be added in hypothetical trade for Harden) and company makes you frontrunners and hurts the Nets because then *they* don't have him.  Also, if you make the common sense S&amp;T with Indiana like you should've before Hayward had to take the offer from Charlotte, you have Myles Turner for essentially nothing too. The deal woulda likely worked if you just immediately took it; it seemed like Ainge wanted to hold out and try to fleece Indiana for as much as possible  &gt;I don't think he will be an MVP level player but Brownsade big jumps 2 years in a row. An elite defensive wing with a great offensive game that's under team control is a big ask. Considering Nets didn't have to give up nearly as talented of a player as Brown.  He's made a big jump to being an actual all star caliber player this year, but there's no guarantee he'll make another huge jump again. Same with Tatum; they need to become superstar caliber to win with them both as focal points of your franchise.   Otherwise, trade Brown while his value is sky high and you give up not much for a top tier superstar who's playmaking is so damn good he makes all your struggling role players better  Robert Williams instantly becomes an top-tier producer with Harden on his team.   &gt;That's fair but the goal is to build around the Jay's not trade them for older superstars who have other destinations in mind. What's stopping Harden from demanding a trade from us this off-season if he was super committed to being in Brooklyn?  He was committed to Brooklyn, sure, but mainly because they were the best team willing to take risks to win and they made that offer. If you guys made the concerted effort, he'd stay the 2 years and possibly resign"
What about not getting Myles Turner?   Or you guys still think he's really that bad for the team?  I would think he's a pretty good upgrade to TT/Theis/Timelord
"The Pacers were upfront with Myles Turner this offseason about shopping him around. He said he appreciated the honesty and is now having the best season of his career.  It might not work out in every single situation, but I wouldn't unilaterally say that being honest in a potential trade situation isn't an option."
Myles Turner?
"&gt; ‚ÄúThe Indiana Pacers struck out on a Gordon Hayward trade with the Boston Celtics when a source confirmed that Boston‚Äôs trade demands became too excessive,"" Ham wrote Saturday. ""Indy was willing to part with center Myles Turner in the transaction, but when the Celtics asked for more, the Pacers passed.""  [Source](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-rumors-why-did-gordon-hayward-pacers-trade-fall-through)  So direct quote here showing that Angie asked for too many assets in a sign and trade. Hornets offered the money after, also good chance Hayward was offered around the same amount of money with the Pacers (not to mention he could have taken a discount for a preferred destination).   Sounds like you are ignoring direct information that was reported on the situation and just assume it was only free agency."
"Kemba played the entire Philly series too.   Any injury would be comparable to the injuries Lowry consistently played through.   Hayward didn‚Äôt play, and he left in free agency for nothing, because Angie didn‚Äôt want to trade assets to get Myles Turner."
"I agree with this, Boston wasn‚Äôt keeping any of those guys made no sense to trade for them. That being said I do they could‚Äôve looked more into mid level guys. Losing rosier actually hurt quite a bit , a guy like Myles turner which I know has become a meme but somebody to help fill out the roster more. Instead they drafted a bunch of young guys who won‚Äôt be able to help brown and Tatum for years"
"Most of my bad takes over the years have come from my insistence on making judgement calls about draft classes despite rarely watching college ball and only really looking at mock drafts and highlights. I'm a real nephew in that regard but I'll never change.   Some examples of my worst takes:  -Stanley Johnson should have gone top 3 (Side note, I did predict in that draft that Myles Turner would be a solid starter with star potential but only because I accidentally watched a Texas game one day because I was snowed into my house).   -Kemba Walker was a future GOAT and would turn the Hornets around for good. I had only watched his UConn highlights so I had no clue who he was. Obviously he turned out pretty good, but not quite what I thought   -i also thought that draft was the turning point for American's in basketball because like half of the top 10 picks were from other countries.   -The Celtics fucked up with Tatum, really though he was a bust. I just didn't like the way he spelled his first name.   -Same draft, thought DSJ was clearly going to be the best player.  Could go on like this forever lol. My draft takes are always trash, but it's fun"
"Myles Turner is another underrated player, 100% agreed. He also has a similar problem with Vuc, in that, contenders don't need his skill set and he's on a relatively small team.  For me, when I say top 5, it's less about 4 exact players ahead and more about being in a 2nd tier of centers. (Top tier is Gobert, Embiid and Jokic and I'd rank all of them #1 center in the league)  It's just that this season he has an argument for strict top 5 due to injuries and 2nd tier pool being thinned, so I wanted to ask the question."
Dont say Myles Turner
"Lol, you few Pacers fans w/delusions of grandeur that Myles Turner is even in the conversation w/Gobert are adorable.  MT is a player for sure, but you're comparing a Mazda Miata to a mf'n Bugatti"
"I'd try and Turn Adam's, Bledsoe and Reddick into Myles Turner. Then I'd give IT a shot, A starting Lineup with, Lonzo, Ingram, Zion and Turner would have crazy defensive potential and IT can Handle the ball and even though he is a defensive liability he can be hidden."
"I would do everything in my power to get Myles Turner on the team as long as it didn't cost Zion, Ingram, Lonzo, or Hart if Indiana is as willing to trade him as it seems they've been for a couple years now. Allows Zion to be a center on offense with a rim protector behind him on defense, like Giannis with Brook Lopez.   A core of Lonzo, Hart, Ingram, Zion, and Turner could be really nice for a long time"
"Tobias Harris?  Myles Turner + another piece?  Just 2 ideas off the top of my head. But yes CJ needs to be traded. They're about to lose in the 1st round for the 4th time in 5 years, Lillard is entering his 30s, it's just time to get serious about winning and try something new"
Portland should‚Äôve went for Gordon. Myles Turner too tbh
"Didn‚Äôt we see what the suns future is without CP3 the past like 10 years? They‚Äôre likely back to fighting for a play in game. This is their best shot at a title is these last few years of cp3‚Äôs career. I think you go all in for that. Plus I don‚Äôt think there are many options for an Ayton trade, would have to be someone like KAT. Maybe Myles turner but I don‚Äôt really know how much that changes and you‚Äôre probably better off banking on Ayton improving. But adding someone like KAT doesn‚Äôt really hurt you future in post CP3 world"
"Ah yes. DPOY candidates Myles Turner, Rudy Gobert, and Nikola Jokic"
"He missed a bunch of open looks in the first half then Myles Turner got injured in the second half and Vucevic started taking advantage of playing against a back up, he went 9/14 or something like that in the second half"
I would say Myles Turner and Domanta Sabonis are underrated. Not a pacers fan but those guys are putting up legit numbers and don't get much cred.
but you could've gotten myles turner
"&gt; The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.   That's a result of a salary cap system where you have four players taking up $130 million in annual salary, with a salary cap that is only $109 million.  The league is literally set up to make sure it becomes impossible to effectively construct a winning roster over many years. It's the sole reason why we do not have perpetual dynasties in the NBA.   &gt;They also passed on Myles Turner this summer. They passed on Jimmy Butler. Didn‚Äôt get Vuc. Passed on CP3 in 2013. Paul George on the Pacers. Kevin love in 2014. I mean seriously should I go on?  I mean, the only pass that isn't a clearly good pass there is Jimmy Buttler, and with his history of ""locker room issues"", that's hardly something you can blame them for. I'm not sure anyone other than Pat Riley could have gotten him on the right track.   &gt;He‚Äôs never been a serious MVP candidate. Has been a gem on a bad team never winning anything in the playoffs and has injury concerns. Now, am I talking about KAT or AD? Who‚Äôs the risk?   AD has absolutely been an MVP candidate.  Neither KAT nor AD are risks, but I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that AD is significantly more valuable than KAT.   &gt;Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That‚Äôs sad.  Of course it is. One ring is obviously *much* more important to a franchise that has never won one. Only 19 of the 30 teams in the NBA has ever won a championship. 10 out of 30 has won more than one.  Winning *a ring* should be the number one priority for almost every team in the league, without question.   &gt;Part of the Lakers ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Yeah, good thing they never shafted someone like Shaq.   Oh, wait.  &gt;Oh and you know who cited Thomas‚Äô situation as a reason he didn‚Äôt want to be in Boston? AD.   He sure did, but literally everyone knew his only destination was the Lakers. He also pretended like he was interested in Knicks, like literally every single major free agent player does. And none of them *actually* have any intentions to play there.  It's almost as if the publicly released statements celebrities make aren't always the truth.  Almost.  &gt;How did the bulls shaft MJ? Are you fucking serious? Do you not remember how the late 90s went for him vs the org ?   So you're talking about *the one time* Krause actually said *organizations win championships, not players*? The statement which Krause clearly and sensibly explained in a rational matter literally the next day.  &gt;At this point dude, you‚Äôre in straight denial. Read your last paragraph. Then read it 10 more times. Goodbye.  I'm not in denial, you're just trying to argue revisionist history like you're on the Fox News editorial staff."
Bledsoe made sense though because he came with a huge amount of draft equity from the Bucks. Adams move made no sense. They could have gotten Horford at the same APY basically for free or they could have picked up Myles Turner who was clearly available this offseason
"Myles Turner? He would have been my answer for most overrated lol.   I want to go with Holmes but I feel like most know how good he is, but I guess I‚Äôll go with Capela. He should be like 4 or 5 in the DPOY race. Yes, the Hawks overall have a bad defense but Myles Turner who is at 2 also is on a bad defense, but he gets blocks, the most overrated aspect of defense. Hawks with Hunter hurt would be in the running for worst defense of all time without Capela. Man is insane. Also a great rebounder and does his job scoring wise."
"The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.

Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That‚Äôs sad. Guess we should just stop trying to win cause we won some titles a few years ago and be happy with it. No wonder you‚Äôre so against being aggressive with trades. You rest on your laurels.   Part of the Lakers ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Oh and you know who cited Thomas‚Äô situation as a reason he didn‚Äôt want to be in Boston? AD.

"Nah fuck this, People are so off the mark with myles turner this year it's hilarious.  Are people really this dumb? that because Whiteside had a lot of blocks that must mean Turner is just another Whiteside? Like where is the logic in that lmao.  Pacers defense has been really good with Turner on the floor, 4th in the league.  He's disruptive around the Rim, opponents shoot less shots at a worse percentage around the Rim with Turner on the floor.   Opponents shppt 13.5% points worse in the restricted area with Turner on the floor, and only shoot 47% of there shots from there, that's actually lower than Gobert.  His post defense has been great too, the only players he cant guard is Joel and Jokic, who are destroying the entire league rn.    So yeah anyways Turner man bad, concept player, only chases blocks, team defense sucks, no paint presence!!!"
"Get a big body on him before he even gets the ball, don't let him get into position down low. When he has the ball don't swipe and stay vertical. Easier said then done, but the big difference between Gasol and someone like Myles Turner is that Turner almost always takes the bait and gets dumb fouls.   Turner is a very good defender he is just terrible against Embiid because he usually takes himself out of the game by making mistakes."
"Like the others have said, a shoot-out favours the Nets.   But if you're dead set on wanting to look at defending Embiid then LMA and DJ are the two big names to look at.   Embiid is freakishly big and freakishly talented but he always plays big before he plays talented. His first option is to try and bully you. The first step to slowing him down is having big post-defending bodies.   Compare:  * Enes Kanter - He's a terrible overall defender but in the post, he's hard to move and he wears you down.   * Myles Turner, Jarret Allen, Robert Williams - They're all really great defenders but they're too small and big post scorers walk over them.   So when it comes to guarding Embiid, you'd actually prefer to have Enes Kanter over the other better defenders.    So now let's look at LMA and DJ for the Nets:  * They're too old and slow to keep up with smaller guards - But Philly doesn't really have guards who can attack them  * They have the size, strength and experience to make Embiid earn his points in the post  They won't be amazing but they should be pretty serviceable in this specific matchup."
"One thing I've learned watching DPOY ladders for years is that blocks get overrated. They always have. I know this as a Heat fan watching Hassan Whiteside. I'm not calling Myles Turner Hassan, but he's a great defender, not a top 3 candidate and his only argument really is blocks which is just something I know to ignore as a main argument for a players defensive ability. I just don't know how you can argue Myles is a more impactful defender than everybody but two players in the league. It's just so obvious blocks are leading this argument and I know to discount that. Yes Myles is great. But he's a top 15 defensive player. Not top 3"
Myles Turner is on the 9th best East team with the 11th best defense and he's third
"Lonzo, BI, Zion can work together. Just need Myles Turner and a 3&amp;D SG to get really spooky."
"Myles Turner defense is overrated. He's great, but the only reason he is as high as 3rd is because of blocks which is the most overrated defensive stat"
"Doing more than 10 because I want to:   Jrue, Dort, Ben Simmons, Giannis, Gobert, Marcus Smart, Bam, OG, Draymond, Embiid, Mikal Bridges, Kawhi, Myles Turner, Dejounte Murray"
"Mo Bamba, Nerlens Noel, Myles Turner, etc. The league is, in fact, 90% pretty good 5's."
"He still gets bodied by bigger post centers, but yea ur right about everything else. Myles turner is a great player, but I think he‚Äôs properly rated"
"Your ""Upper Tier"" are:  * Embiid - two-way player, volume scorer (MVP candidate) * Jokic - volume playmaker, all-around scorer (MVP candidate) * Gobert - no-fly-zone paint defender, ok-scorer (2x DPOY) * Bam - 1-5 defender, 50-67% Jokic clone (All-Defense, All Star) * KAT - offensive unicorn (All-NBA, All Star) * Vucevic - efficient offensive weapon (All Star)  Those are six (6) active starting centers which constitute 20% of the league. Heck, I haven't even considered AD here yet. I don't think there is a spot for this Myles Turner guy you speak of. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Because in the scope of an offense you still don't want Myles Turner shooting very much.  Saying somebody is a good shooter implies you're totally cool with them taking a high volume of shots.
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"I think PG is the biggest position of need for upgrade. Would love a center like Myles Turner who can stretch the floor, but perfectly happy with Mitch/Noel if that's how the Knicks want to go. Would love a superstar wing like Lavine or Beal but that seems very unlikely this offseason.   Pretty much the entire team will be free agents besides RJ/Randle/Mitch/Obi so would like to see us resign guys who have been good for us like Bullock, Burks, Noel and then use our draft picks to get some NBA ready guys to fill out the bench. If we can get Frank/Knox for cheap then sure why not"
"Trade for Myles Turner. Get rid of Powell and WCS (Marjanovic is also bad) and get someone actually decent. My only concern is the fact, that it looks like that they‚Äôre playing and defending better with smaller players in the paint (especially Kleber)."
"We all know that, but our owner didn‚Äôt want to tank.  So we‚Äôre splitting the difference, which is stupid.  We should have tanked the second Klay went down.  Instead our owner demand we draft and replace Klay for the season so we could compete.  But there was no way to compete this season.  It‚Äôs a vanity project for Joe Lacob.  We should have grabbed Myles Turner before the season when we could and then grabbed someone next year to run our bench unit.  We have (or had) the assets for it.  Now we just have to hope Wiseman can get us a return this offseason."
"Oladipo, not that he‚Äôd come to the dumpster fire we have now.  But the point wasn‚Äôt to grab someone this season.  Trying to be competitive this season is a vanity project for Joe Lacob.  We‚Äôre not competitive without Klay, we needed to package the significant assets we had for Myles Turner when he was available before this season and for a 6th man type next season.  Joe Lacob telling the front office to draft and to replace Klay hamstrung us."
"If we finish top 10 we lose a draft pick.  Our owner demanded we draft instead of flipping our pick, and demanded we grab someone in free agency to replace Klay.  Those two decisions, getting Oubre and Wiseman instead of Myles Turner, is why we are failing this season.  We still have a ton of assets to trade for bench depth.  Imagine a roster of Steph/Klay/Wigs/Dray/Turner with whatever bench depth 2 good first round picks gets us, not to mention ring chasing vets once we have that roster."
"We ran a lot of PnR when we had Steph and Klay or Steph and KD (at least during KD‚Äôs first year, when he still participated in our offense instead of just calling for isos).  Dray does a good job playing downhill when Steph steals both defenders, especially with Klay waiting at the 3 point line keeping defenders from helping.  The problem is that we don‚Äôt have a sniper out there and that Wiseman doesn‚Äôt move to keep good spacing when Dray is going downhill.  Wiseman is just overwhelmed.  He‚Äôs a project we don‚Äôt have time for.  We should have gone for Myles Turner in the off-season and then next year we‚Äôd be contenders.  Now?  Hopefully we can get rid of Wiseman for a decent return."
Myles Turner has a nice arc
"None of them were this bad, but yeah, the ceiling for Wiseman is that he can hopefully become like Myles Turner.   Also a sidenote on Jokic, he was actually surprisingly good, he just didn't get enough minutes. I don't know if you've been on this sub long enough to remember, but there was some Nuggets fan named EG who kept on making posts about how good rookie Jokic was and he was so insufferable about it that he was banned."
*whispers*  He also has pretty much the same number of rebounds as Myles Turner with half the minutes....
"Put Sabonis on the Raptors right now and they would beat the Celtics and Heat in a playoff series. They would be top 4 team in the East behind Brooklyn, Philly, and Milwaukee. Put Myles Turner on the Raptors, idk probably similar result. Sabonis better player, Turner better fit. Give the Raptors any good center and they are top 4 in east."
Bruh wtf you are not trying to tell me rn that you actually believe that Myles Turner will help the pistons win more than Sabonis
"He‚Äôs one of those guys that isn‚Äôt the most talented, but is just rare. Kind of like Myles Turner, Rudy Gobert, and Yawcum Perdle."
"Myles Turner 100%, he's one of the most ideal centers you could ask for outside of a superstar player."
"Longhorns fan all day! Still very grumpy from that loss to Abilene Christian weeks ago. Frustrated as well why the Horns never reached the national championship game with such talented players like Durant, Aldridge, Myles Turner, etc. Hoping the hire of Chris Beard from Texas Tech (sorry Red Raider fans, nothing personal!) can change Texas' fortunes in NCAA tournament within the next few seasons!"
might want to let myles turner know he can score
Sabonis   ‚ÄúDPOY‚Äù candidate Myles Turner been slipping of late got absolutely embarrassed by Cody zeller the other night
My friends and I have never understood our fellow Pacers fans undying love for Myles Turner. I wish we‚Äôd have traded him a few years ago while his value was at an all time high.   Myles is a rim protector and almost exclusively so. He‚Äôs the type of piece that a contender needs to add to their squad. He‚Äôs not the type of piece that a forever-middling team like the Pacers needs if they want to make a playoff run.   It also pisses me off to no end that he has never averaged 10 rebounds a game.
"Team dependent, I think a lot of teams would benefit from a good defender/stretch big like Myles Turner rather than Sabonis."
Need a defensive center so Myles Turner
for my team (celtics) definitely myles turner
"Sabonis and Towns were born in the United States. There‚Äôs also Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Dwight Howard, and Robert Williams."
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"

"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive.

Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
I disagree.  Turner is a win now piece who could have showed up and immediately provided rim protection and spacing.  He'd have fit better than just about anyone in the league alongside Dray.  I want to be clear that Wiseman's ceiling is definitely higher than Myles Turner's.  But I'm not looking for someone who will be good after Steph/Klay/Dray are too old to compete for championships.
"That's a great chart. Myles Turner is head and shoulders above the rest of the league, except for Gobert who is in a league of his own. Crazy stuff from Rudy."
just like myles turner lol
"Our best option wasn't to draft LaMelo, it was to flip picks for Myles Turner, who was on the trading block.  A squad of Steph/Klay/Wigs/Dray/Turner with 2 1st round picks (one very possibly 1st overall) being flipped for bench depth.  Instead we have to watch Wiseman's growing pains.  No insult, Wiseman will be a beast.  But he's not there yet and Steph/Klay/Dray's window is closing."
"I agree, there's a reason a big man hasn't won an MVP for over a decade and the one who could win it this season plays way more like a guard than any other big ever.   I think general priority for high draft picks should be elite offensive engines e.g. Lebron, Steph, Jokic &gt; versatile wings e.g. Klay, PG13 &gt; versatile big men e.g. Draymond, Bam, Sabonis &gt; Specialists/role players e.g. Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen.  Obviously, not many players enter the NBA as rookies at near all-star levels like Luka, but to barely be playable even with low minutes against bad teams as a 2nd overall pick is unacceptable in my opinion.  Wiseman has a shot at maybe being a versatile big man with a few seasons of development, but it's nothing concrete and taking him 2nd overall feels like a mistake to me especially as we could've traded down and maybe gotten ourselves a decent player in the off-season."
we have myles turner at home
I was hoping for Myles Turner at the deadline but no luck.
"Yes and no.  He shows a lot of potential, but he is just extremely raw.  He is at his best when Draymond is out there directing him, telling him where to be and when to rotate.  He has excellent handles for a 7'1 center, he is WAY quicker than anyone that size has a right to be, and he has a long wingspan and can really protect the rim on a good day.  Unfortunately, he played 3 college games and then went to the NBA.  He just wasn't ready and he needs more time to be a really quality NBA player.  And he will be, I'm sure, the guy is immensely talented, has shown he's really trying to learn, and has outrageous physical gifts.  Unfortunately, Steph/Klay/Dray's contender window is closing and they need him to be further along than he is.  I like the kid, and would be psyched to draft him under different circumstances, but we needed to flip the pick and another smaller asset for Myles Turner.  Womp womp."
"The Hawks are still 24th in defense. He's absolutely not better than Gobert, KAT, or Vucevic, and personally I wouldn't take him over Nurkic or Myles Turner. And if you're gonna use Giannis, AD is obviously better."
His free-throw shooting has improved a lot and he‚Äôs developed a bit of a mid-range game that I never dreamed of him having as a rookie. I don‚Äôt think developing a Myles Turner three-point shot is a crazy idea.
"Nah, maybe it‚Äôs just me but I wouldn‚Äôt give up Wiseman and the Minny pick for Brogdon and Myles Turner. We‚Äôre getting a stretch 5 who if his shots don‚Äôt fall he is an offensive liability and a guard who looks like a Walmart version of Manu.   You have to understand that the Warriors could‚Äôve offered a trade package better than any team that big for James Harden, Wiggins+Wiseman+Wolves Pick+3 1st Rounders beats any team in the league in terms of package. So ideally what the Warriors need to get is at the very minimum a multiple-time All-Star that can shoot if they want to give up on Wiseman and are willing to add in more."
Respect for Myles Turner
"I would easily give up wiseman and the minny pick for, idk, Myles Turner and brogdon  It doesn‚Äôt have to be *that* much. I would get off wiseman now, because I think he‚Äôs duolingo Javale McGee"
"Warriors fucked up by not trading the pick.  We could have traded the puck and a small pot sweetener for Myles Turner.  With Klay back and Myles Turner, with the great assets and picks we have flipped for some bench depth, we‚Äôd be title favorites next year."
Poor Myles Turner. Will probably finish top 3-5 in voting but regulated to 2nd team because of positional circumstances.
I‚Äôd say not getting Myles Turner for Hayward  was pretty disastrous as well.
"1. Domantas Sabonis (best, not most valuable) 2. Myles Turner 3. Caris LeVert 4. Malcolm Brogdon 5. T.J. McConnell 6. Justin Holiday 7. Doug McDermott 8. **Edmond Sumner** 9. **Goga Bitadze** 10. Jeremy Lamb 11. Aaron Holiday"
"Better centers. Jo Jo, Jokic, Vucivic, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Drummond, Allen, Nurkic, Aldridge, KAT, Ayton, Gobert, Steven Adams, Clint Capella, Christian Wood Ehhh bout the same: Mason Plumlee, Time Lord, Noel, Poetl, Claxton, Kanter."
"maybe trade for Myles Turner if he is available, I mean that's why you have draft picks stack"
"Giannis is a beast at center and have been playing it a lot recently, bobby portis hve been great to play the 4.   Brook isn't just a beast of rim protection anymore like last year. He only got the size and somewhat can space the floor  Imagine if player like gobert, Myles turner in this team or heck even Dwight Howard. 3-5 block per game easily"
I‚Äôm not talking about that right now...that‚Äôs not the point of the post. But even so...I said Myles Turner or Serge Ibaka. Both better defensively than Steven Adams.
"He has huge ups and downs, which you can expect from a 19 year old rookie.  He also does poorly against really smart team defense schemes, like the Heat.  I'm sure he'll develop into an excellent NBA player, but I still wish we'd flipped the pick and other assets for Myles Turner."
"Curry is turning 33 this month.  We do not have time for his development and I was hoping we'd flip the pick for an actual asset.  Unfortunately, Joe Lacob didn't want to tank this year or give up our 1st so our front office was kind of hamstrung.  We'd be much, much better if we had flipped all our assets for a serious center like Myles Turner (who was available) and a bench facilitator."
Over who? He's not better than Gobert this season. Wouldn't be against him making the second team over Myles Turner tho. Embiids probably missed too many games to make it.
That‚Äôs what the majority of this sub thinks Myles Turner is
"I don't think he is that upset about Drummond. He seems pretty convinced that another wing was their biggest need. If anything, I think he's more upset about not getting Myles Turner last offseason."
"Shades of the 2015ish Pacers with Paul George, George Hill, Solomon Hill, Jordan Hill, CJ Watson, CJ Miles, Myles Turner, practically had to use every players full name"
Myles Turner tries out his new lead boots.
"To be fair to the Celtics, signing Kemba looked good, but the loss of Hayward has hurt them so much more than they could've anticipated. Hayward as a 4th option is a contending team 100%. Kemba comes back from an injury and now he's looking to be on the down swing. JT and JB are both excellent but not doing the Myles Turner trade is really starting to bite the Celtics. Like if this squad had Myles Turner as a big and Daniel Theis as a backup still with their core 3 and Marcus Smart (Dumb), they'd probably be looking really good right now considering how amazing Myles Turner has been this season.   The most alarming thing for Boston though is how bad they are in the 4th quarter, like this is a team that is bottom 5 in the league in the 4th quarter. Whatever happened to their ability to close out games makes 0 sense."
"The title here should be ""Myles Turner falls asleep with eyes open"""

Myles aint a DPOY candidate lmao. It's a two man race between Gobert and Simmons. Turner is fake good on that end and that specific play of Myles' perimeter defence is what casuals think Rudy is like out there.
"Damian Lillard, Devin Booker, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, and Myles Turner.  That's a mighty fine team in my opinion."
Underrated: Tj Mconnell  Overrated: Myles turner
Indiana has a system? I thought they were just playing 4v5 while Myles Turner runs around on help defense to block everything in sight
"Are people really this dumb? Yeah TJ McConnell pick is awful but Myles Turner is definitely deserving.  The Pacers post a 111.1 drtg overall, 11th in the league.  With Myles Turner on the floor they post a 106.9 drtg, which would be second in the league.  He also leads the league in blocks, for what's that is worth.  Hes not above Gobert but hes definitely one of the best this year"
Myles Turner is one of the most overrated defenders in the sport.  One of the most fabricated reputations I‚Äôve ever seen.
"&gt;Malcolm Brogdon on Myles Turner: ""He's the reason our defense is so good. ... He should be Defensive Player of the Year.""  *Stares at league average defense*"
"Charlotte really is fulfilling their destiny of becoming Celtics South. Rosier, Hayward, and now Almost Myles Turner."
"Previous tweet:  &gt;[B/R reports the #Hornets primarily targeted Myles Turner, Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, and Richaun Holmes before the trade deadline.](https://twitter.com/SwarmnSting/status/1376933083899826183?s=20)"
He's a 5 that is forced to play PF because they have Myles Turner.
"Simmons' career record without Embiid is 33-31. In a vacuum that is not a playoff team in the West but is in the East.   However, that is taking the best player off the team, if you would hypothetically replace Joel with an average to slightly above average starting center like Valenciunas or Myles Turner and it isn't crazy to assume he would take a team to the playoffs as the best player.   Simmons, Tucker, Wood, Gordon, Wall can absolutely make the playoffs in the West."
Is Myles Turner ok? Dude started the season an absolute beast but is slumping hard lately. Anyone have any insight as to why?
"Easily. Although my flair is of former Celtic great, Von Wafer, I wouldn't consider myself a Celtic fan.  What I've seen is they've made the conference finals in 3 out of 4 years but that's the indicator on what's to come indefinitely according to most die hards.  What I see is this, they've lost all those series and the entire league doesn't just stay the same as they get better. I think they really missed the boat on possibly keeping Hayward (don't know if that was entirely possible), getting Myles Turner, and making a run at James Harden in favor of building around the core of players WHO ARE GOOD, but not nearly as indispensable as fans make them out to be."
"**Indiana Pacers**:      The Jazz fanbase gets along really with the Pacers fans, as both are small market franchises that have been near perennial playoff teams for the last 30 years. We don't really get media hype when we play well and generally both finish around the 4-5-6 seed range. Myles Turner and Rudy Gobert are also both two of the leagues outright best defenders and our team success is largely attributed to the impact those two have. We both consider each other to be Jazz East and Pacers West.      **Memphis Grizzlies**.        The Jazz fanbase gets along really with the Grizzlies fans too. The common link shared is that we have primarily been built around a great defensive identity, as well as a shared love for Mike Conley (who should make an All-Star team this year). The Conley trade was mutually beneficial for both teams and so they've always been chill with each other for that reason. Morant and Mitchell are also young high flying phenomenons and the future of our respective teams."
"There were threads talking about Myles Turner averaging 4 blocks a game with half the people in there being obnoxious C‚Äôs fans sayin ‚ÄúTimelord will average 5 as a starter and is better than Turner‚Äù  They legit believe he‚Äôs a DPOY caliber player, lmao. He‚Äôs shown promise in his limited time as a starter but the talk about him is already ridiculous."
"Rockets ride or die but I also follow players that used to be here or that if I just like their playstyle, like Harden, RoCo, CP3, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Westbrook, KD, Dwight Howard, and Jaylen Brown off the top of my head"
yea outside of myles turner drummond is probably the 2nd best matchup for him lol
He‚Äôs impossible to score on at the rim. I‚Äôd put him as a borderline all defense player behind Gobert and Myles Turner
Myles Turner
"On-Off defensive rating differential.      A stat the effectively looks at how many points fewer per 100 possessions teams score when a player is on the court compared to on the bench. [Here are the league leaders this season](https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1371927990611836929?s=20).      - 7.3 ‚Äî Rudy Gobert,    - 5.8 ‚Äî LeBron James,    - 4.2 ‚Äî Giannis Antetokounmpo,    - 4.2 ‚Äî Robert Covington,    - 4.0 ‚Äî Myles Turner"
"Well to be fair..they traded for Kyrie and then he leaves to join the Nets, pretty much sucks.   Then they sign Kemba and have Hayward back and then no one saw Hayward declining a $30 million PO to sign with another team.   Then Kemba gets injured, now he's just ok for them but a bad contract overall.   They completely failed last off season, didn't manage to sign anyone to fix their team. Not getting Myles Turner is looking like a total mistake. Just tons of little things added up. It's really questionable what they do in the next off-season to fix their issues, Fournier is just ok for them, it would be a miracle for them trade Kemba. Boston is of course in a much better position than at least 90% of the league just because they have Jayson Tatum who is one of the most valuable young superstars in the league. Jaylen Brown helps too. All Boston needs is to figure out their center problem big time and they'll look so much better, plug the hole that Hayward left behind too."
"That's fair, but even then DPOY tends to go to rim protectors.  Perimeter guys need to basically have insane defensive seasons and hope that there aren't any insane seasons from rim protectors (or no good narratives, anyway) to win the award (see: Kawhi a couple seasons back).  So like, if next season say... Marcus Smart has an elite defensive season but so does someone like Myles Turner, odds are Turner would get the award because DPOY just tends to go to the big men.    Perimeter defenders are generally at a disadvantage, is I guess what I'm saying."
Myles Turner never dealt with Los Angeles media and Fans.   Indiana Pacers media + fans?? *laughs*
"Celtics fan talking shit???   Since drafting Tatum y‚Äôall has had 7 first round picks (2.3 per draft) and u guys still couldn‚Äôt make a quality nba roster. You basically traded Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Al Hartford, Marcus Morris for Kemba. You guys passed up on Myles turner for Gordon Hayward and got nothing instead. Despite losing all that talent and having so many young draft picks your team is in #20 in cap space with an Evan Fournier contract coming up. You guys are worse than the Kings, tatum can‚Äôt wait to leave your poverty squad and join the Lakers he doesn‚Äôt even hide it üòÇ"
*Laughs in Myles Turner*
"Maybe they need a Zion injury again :)  But they might need to get a bit lucky. Guys like Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Myles Turner, Jusuf Nurkiƒá, Clint Capela have all been picked in that range in recent years. We'll see."
"For real   Talk about an obviously terrible move. This entire subreddit completely shit on the trade knowing it was a terrible fit, and turned out to be 100% accurate  Like hmm, you know what I want with Zion? A center that can't shoot even a little bit and is an extremely average defender. That'll work.   Should've been trying for Myles Turner"
"Your right, but that doesn't negate the fact that Sabonis is put in a hard place on D, especially with (as you mentioned) Myles Turner out. Look, Sabonis can't be as good on defensive with his T-Rex arms, but he does put great effort on D, and I've seen it pay off. I just, personally, don't think Bam is a better player overall. He is great at SOOO many thing, but I look at crunch time. Sabonis is gonna make winning plays more often than Bam. Not that Bam doesn't, it's just in the clutch, I'm taking Sabonis."
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
Beal isn‚Äôt the scoring champ Curry is and bam is a center so it‚Äôs not over him. I like Sabonis but anchoring a defense is really valuable and while Sabonis is better offensively their numbers honestly aren‚Äôt that far apart 20 12 and 6.6 Bam 19 9 and 5 and bam is more efficient but I think Bams defensive ability made him have the better season imo. Without Myles Turner in the paint Sabonis wasn‚Äôt able to hold down the Pacers defense
"Was watching a bit of the Pacers a few days ago and with them running basically everything through Sabonis, literally every other touch was to him, like what role is Myles Turner gonna have on offence? Spot up or stand in the dunkers spot?"
"&gt;Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell... Doug McDermott... Monta Ellis... TJ Warren... Myles Turner  Seriously?  How deep did you expect these guys to take you in the playoffs?  Every team has dealt with injuries.  The Hawks have been ravaged by injuries this year.  Despite that they are 25 - 11 under Nate.  Never underestimate the value of good coaching.  Not saying he is an all time great but it's obvious he did a great job with what he had in Indy."
"It's not about his players, it's about the lack of adjustment that kills him. He doesn't want to draw from his bench like more successful teams do. He does well in the regular season despite injuries because he's forced to use other players, case in point was last year in Indiana when everyone except TJ Warren missed games. He pushed guys like Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell and the team won more games with their injured roster than in his two other years.  His problem is that when team rotations invariably get tighter in the playoffs, he refuses to adjust. Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday barely got any run even when the team shat out 8-12 point quarters against Boston. He continued to start the undersized and already on his way out Monta Ellis against the Cavs. Sabonis was killing the Cavs in limited minutes in 2018 and he refused to pull Myles Turner, who was getting dominated by Tristan Thompson in Game 7. In that same game, LeBron sat for a long time in the 4th and he refused to put Oladipo in."
"Yeah 20th may be too harsh but aytons defense isn‚Äôt really anything to write home about and there are some better passers at the center position as well.   Some names that come to mind are Myles turner, sabonis, nurkic, valacinus, capela, and if you count randle as a center (he plays the small ball 5 a lot) he could also be up there as well."
"Well speaking of the hawks, Capela should be 2nd team if not Myles Turner, but Noel is right up there with them. And just for clarification, by 'give them hell' i mean make them grind out a close 7 game series victory lol."
But Myles Turner is a rim protecting 5. KAT would get smoked guarding 4s and so would Myles Turner or is he good on the perimeter too?
I'm curious if Pacers fan would accept something around Myles Turner for Malik Beasley.
Myles Turner needs to happen
"Currently: Myles Turner  All-Time: Danny Granger, never got the respect he deserved."
lmaooo Myles Turner kills me at the beginning man
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
I‚Äôll do this era  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: AI  SF: Danny Green  PF: John Collins  C: Myles Turner  I tried to make it semi-realistic but I don‚Äôt know how realistic it would be. I tried putting 3 good defenders around (and John Collins isn‚Äôt terrible) as well as having good spacing so AI can have open lanes. Collins is also a great lob threat for him
"For the record I did try to take a look at potential Pacers/Blazers trade but guess what? Trying to match CJ's salary is ridiculous. TJ and Myles Turner gets you there but then we'd be giving up our frontcourt for a backcourt that's already flush (and Caris works better as a 2 than a 3). I'd be receptive to 3-team trades but nothing's coming to mind right now.  And I think that's underrating the Sixers who have the best record in the East; they aren't the mismatched roster from last year. As for shooting, the worst shooter in the starting lineup sans Simmons is Embiid who's at 38% for the season. Everyone else is greater than 40%.   I wouldn't mind seeing a CJ/Tobias trade don't get me wrong but I just don't know how probable that is."
"Hassan Whiteside doesn‚Äôt prove that every elite shot blocker is a bad defender, he proves that it‚Äôs possible for an elite shot blocker to be a bad defender and that the possibility shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed. The argument isn‚Äôt that Myles Turner‚Äôs not an elite defender because Hassan Whiteside isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs that Myles Turner isn‚Äôt for various other reasons and his blocks per game do not mean he‚Äôs automatically a great defender because great shot blockers can still be terrible defenders, such as Hassan Whiteside."
"Dude, centers don‚Äôt just develop defence overnight, especially if they‚Äôre already lost defensively. His offence is better than his D. It‚Äôs gonna be a long developmental process to get him to be an average defender, let alone a shot blocking defensive center. He has a *lot* to work on in that end.  He looks, to me, like he could be Christian Wood on offence and Hassan Whiteside on defence in his prime. Which is fine, that‚Äôs a good player, but it‚Äôll take years and years to get him to that level.  Why not just trade for a defensive center? Those are easy to find. Im sure Myles Turner would only cost like, Kelly Oubre &amp; a pick"
You just don't know much at all. Draymond Green has anchored some incredible playoff defences over a large sample size and was the main reason why Golden State was so good on that end of the ball for all these years.   You're an idiot. You think Myles Turner is a DPOY contender because you looked at his BPG. LMFAO. That's all the evidence we need to demonstrate how dense you are.
Myles Turner gets blocks and that's about it.
"Oubre likely isn't going to sign with the Pacers. Also if that Minny pick ends up being #4 or #5 in this draft it's worth a lot more than Myles Turner.  Oubre S&amp;T to a third team of his preference for a 2nd round pick and TPE   TPE, James Wiseman, GSW pick for Myles Turner and TJ Warren"
"Try to turn Bledsoe, Lonzo, Adams into:  Myles Turner, Kyle Lowry  Maybe a sign and trade featuring Lonzo/Adams to get Lowry this offseason, and then whatever you need try to get Myles turner while also getting rid of Bledsoe. Gonna have to throw some picks in to get him.   Ideally that turns your starting lineup in New Orleans into:  Kyle Lowry, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Myles Turner  That is certainly a playoff caliber starting 5, maybe even a team that can get home court advantage. At that point you need to fill in the bench. I'm not educated enough on their bench pieces now to know who is worth keeping, but Lowry and Turner would be my Plan A."
Who can also defend. I'm trading for myles turner asap
"2 centers can make all defense, its not strict on positions. Bam deserves it over Myles Turner 10000%"
"&gt;Brogdon and Turner are decent  Brogdon can be a solid contributor   Myles just doesn't ever seem to do much on the offensive end. The guy will just take 2 or 3 shots and disappear some nights   He's like a less talented, but taller George Hill"
"I‚Äôm not expecting him to become a better shooter overnight for sure, but he‚Äôs got all the time in the world right now since he‚Äôs still so young. And we have a shooting coach who has worked wonders with our guys, like Lonzo, and has made them better shooters. I‚Äôd agree heavily with you that the most important thing is getting his FT% up. You‚Äôre right about him probably being a leader in FTA for seasons to come. I truly have no clue what our FO is doing. Adams clogs the lane, and while he has some good qualities, is ultimately not the kind of C we need. A guy like Myles Turner would change our offense and defense completely, but that‚Äôs a pipe dream. It would also be nice to have a PG that actually plays like he wants to be here. Bledsoe just needs to go ASAP. I‚Äôm rambling at this point, but if our FO can get their shit together and build better around Zion, then we‚Äôll be in a good spot."
"Gg to pacers fans. As a fringe playoff team with mediocre fan bases and bad market coverage, it was a pleasure watching our teams.   We‚Äôve both grown with signings and trades and watching levert still have that scorer in him, McConnell being a solid pg, sabonis developing Into an all around playmaker and scorer, it‚Äôs nice to see the potential we have in the east. Anything good with Myles turner tho?   Ggs good luck in play ins"
Pacers fans want him traded so Myles ‚ÄúThis is the year‚Äù Turner can shine.
How about the 3rd pick for myles turner
"You overrate Myles Turner lol he‚Äôs not the god that he‚Äôs portrayed as.  He‚Äôs a good rim protector but he has the highest foul to block rate in the league and isn‚Äôt good on the perimeter and on the offensive end, he has no post game aside from simple stuff and he‚Äôs a very streaky and inefficient 3 point shooter"
How could they pass up Myles Turner 2.0  It‚Äôs absurd!
"Myles Turner isn‚Äôt even super amazing himself, his skills as a stretch 5 are vastly overrated, he doesn‚Äôt really stretch the floor"
You underrate your assets im not trading a top 5 pick in this years draft along with another first and Oubre for Myles Turner
"Myles Turner? maybe Sabonis?  depends on what side of the argument you're on.    ""we're only keeping one Center, who should it be???"""
"Its more that he's let players walk away for nothing. The way Kylie left, and how the pacers wanted to do a sign and trade for Hayward. The Celtics could of gotten myles turner back which would of filled a whole for them. But ainged is so paranoid about getting fleeced in a trade deal that he didn't pull the trigger."
"That‚Äôs such revisionist history bro lmaoo the rumors were there for a while that Hayward was trying to go back to Indy and there was mutual interest. I‚Äôm pretty sure there were reports of him sending his kids to school in Indiana and him moving his family there. It was Ainge who messed it up requesting another starter instead of McDermott from Indiana who weren‚Äôt comfortable with that trade. The trade could have been done way before Charlotte called, Charlotte wasn‚Äôt even prepared to offer Hayward a contract which is why they ended up buying out Batum last second to make the money work  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-gordon-hayward-turns-down-34m-player-option-for-2020-21-season-intent-on-joining-pacers-per-report/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/amp/  Hayward definitely could‚Äôve been a pacer if Ainge stopped fucking around and took the offer before Charlotte could‚Äôve created one"
Myles Turner would be perfect for this team cause he‚Äôs soft and he sucks
Didn‚Äôt help that y‚Äôall traded Hayward away for a bag of peanuts when Myles turner was there for the taking. This a whole new roster with new chemistry to build lol
"A lot of trade ideas I've had involve the Pacers, I agree they're the team in that sweet spot of having good assets but needing to blow it up. We'd have to break it up into multiple deals for the S&amp;T to work, but an overall deal like this would be great:   Warriors get:   * TJ McConnell  * Caris LeVert  * Myles Turner  Pacers get:   * Kelly Oubre  * James Wiseman  * Jordan Poole  * Minny 1st   That seems like a fair exchange of value. Pacers get a great pick, a promising young guard, and a blue chip Center prospect, plus a reliable wing. Warriors get a starting C and two fantastic bench guards. Caris becomes sixth man, TJ becomes the bench PG we desperately need.   Curry/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Turner, TJ/Caris/Juan/Paschall/Looney - I really like this rotation for the Warriors. Good mix of pieces that fit well together. Bench could use more shooting, but with Curry/Klay/Wiggins working in with them, it should work.   Brogdon/Lamb/Oubre/Warren/Sabonis, Poole/Holiday/McDermott/[draft pick]/Wiseman   Pacers get younger, gain draft capital, and still have a competitive team."
"Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Ben Simmons, Myles Turner. Two guys who are great ball handlers in Murray and Simmons, great scorers in Booker and Murray, and some lockdown defense from Bridges, Simmons, and Turner."
" &gt;	even though he‚Äôs a big, strong, mobile guy, he‚Äôs not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez.  Oh? Then how do you explain [this beautiful example of rim protection](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n6pfa3/highlight_andre_drummond_beautiful_display_of/)? I mean how do you score on this man"
"Andre Drummond is probably the most disappointing big in the league.   His size, mobility, and ability to leverage that size and strength should make him a good traditional center and he just isn't.   He's awful with the ball in his hands (no ball skills and bad touch around the rim), his shot selection is bad (steady diet of inefficient back-to-the-basket post-ups), and even though he's a big, strong, mobile guy, he's not a rim protector on the level of someone like Myles Turner, Clint Capela, or Brook Lopez."
Lol myles turner at one dollar a travesty
I was almost tempted to try to do this without him because it was so automatic to put him in   Myles Turner $1  Zion $5  Tatum $5  LaMelo $2  MPJ $2   Perimeter defense ain‚Äôt great only two plus defenders on this isn‚Äôt ideal but oh well.
You're one of those guys on r/bostonceltics that wanted to trade for Myles Turner aren't ya.
"Meanwhile in Indiana, Nate is giving away the janitor‚Äôs key to Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner.   ‚ÄúThanks for being our best players guys, enjoy your stay in the janitor‚Äôs closet. Alright... fuck y‚Äôall on 3!‚Äù"
"He‚Äôs still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he‚Äôs a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can‚Äôt do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to ‚Äúthey want to speed up the pace.‚Äù That‚Äôs true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
I rewatched the whole thing and something that I noticed was how awesome a teammate Myles Turner seems to be. Really emotionally in tuned dude. That really stood out.
"\&gt;  Celtics are a great example lost 2 all stars same off-season and got nothing back  That's Ainge's own fault . Could've traded Kyrie at the deadline and still got a lot for him. Horford was aging who cares. Hayward they could've gotten something back in S&amp;T (Myles Turner and some other pieces iirc) but chose not too.  After KD left the Thunder they changed the CBA to incentivize players to sign early extensions. Since then most stars have either signed early or worked out a trade. Beal himself has signed multiple early extensions with DC and can sign another one this summer or next, if he declines and says he wants to hit FA then he'll be traded for value. You're making up the least likely scenario  &gt;I really like Daniel Gafford, Rui and Thomas Bryant. But aside from those I‚Äôm not sure who under 25 the wizards have whose actually good. It feels like a majority of the load is carried by a bunch of aging vets (Lopez, smith, Westbrook)  Ish Smith carrying a load, that's hilarious lol. Wash have all their 1st rd picks other than the 2023 (protected), that represents an opportunity to add young talent every year. There are worse off teams who traded away multiple future picks, like the Bulls."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/boston.cbslocal.com/2020/11/24/myles-turner-celtics-pacers-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade-nba-rumors-danny-ainge/amp/  The whole point that ainge was making was that he didn‚Äôt see Turner as being worth 20 million a year (he‚Äôs correct), and couldn‚Äôt find anyone else who would give him assets for that contract, so he asked for Warren as a sweetener for taking in a bloated salary."
Could have been Blake instead of AD?  And ainge didn‚Äôt want Myles Turner. Ainge wanted Warren. Pacers offered Turner because Warren is a more valuable player.   Pacers felt that TJ Warren is too much to give up for Hayward.
"Fuck PG, dude lied about us being able to get AD. Think about it for one second and that's obviously bullshit. To get Hayward we would have had to give up Myles Turner, who's absence has been the biggest part of us falling apart and led to our defense being extremely extremely terrible, which Hayward would not have helped with. There's no win now move we could've made to become real contenders with McMillan, acting like there was is just BS"
Myles Turner + TJ Warren + 1st round pick for Hayward
"I mean would you tank with Oladipo, Brogdon, Sabonis, Warren, Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb, and then later Levert"
Incoming off-season fire sale. One Myles Turner pls
Myles Turner and a 1st for DeMar who says no
"I think they should just go with a S&amp;T of Myles Turner for DeMar DeRozan, seems fair to me"
"Yeah fuck Brogdon, Warren, McDermott, Justin Holiday. Myles Turner never hit a 3 before either, fuck him."
Myles Turner for Kristaps Porzingis and pick??!?
"Maybe if you've actually watched him instead of looking at bbref you'd see that. Most of his points come from him finishing a play and he actively shies away from contract and settling for midrange jumpers. There have been multiple games I've seen him attempt less than 5 shots a game, do you think KAT,Embiid,Jokiƒá or whoever did that in their 3rd year?  I mean look at his FTA attempts for more proof.   You also forget that at some point Wiggins looked really promising while he was in the NBA  &gt;If you are set on trading him, how are they gonna just find another top 10 center that‚Äôs 22 with potential to replace him?  He's now good as Myles Turner. Nothing guarantees you that he will improve that and he hasn't shown especially this year that he will. Myles Turner is not worth 30m"
I think they need to move on from the Myles Turner/Domantas Sabonis experiment
"totally unbiased opinion here, they should also trade Myles Turner to Toronto for Rodney Hood and Aron Baynes"
"IMO we'd rather have Turner, a Draymond Myles front court would be pretty damn good defensively while Steph Klay and Brogdon would light it up offensively"
"It depends on who‚Äôs available and for what price.    If we draft Mobley, that‚Äôs our PF going forward.   If we‚Äôre trading for Collins, Rubio is definitely in for salary.   Other than that I have no clue who we might get and for what.  Jonathon Isaac?  Myles Turner?  Sign Nerlens Noel with the MLE and let KAT play part time PF?    It really depends on who other teams are interested in trading/re-signing."
Dont think there are many people on pacers who could actually beat Bitadze maybe Myles Turner and thats about itüòÖ
They could get a huge return for each of there players.  Caris LeVert.  Malcom Brogdon.  TJ Warren.   Sabonis.  Myles Turner.  Jeremy Lamb.
"Just say you don't watch the Pacers and stop acting like you know more than other pacers fans with this revisionist history. The man wins in the regular season and gets outcoached easily in the playoffs, he had to go and history tells us that the results will be repeated because he's done this shit over a dozen times and only advanced once in his entire career  * A COTY candidate doesn't choke a 26 point lead at home  * A COTY candidate doesn't spend an entire series having Jeff Teague and Lance Stephenson switch on Lebron and Love respectively  * A COTY candidate doesn't take 4 games to adjust to Lue double teaming Oladipo  * A COTY candidate doesn't let Myles Turner get dominated by Thompson in Game 7 when he barely played the last 6 games when Sabonis was doing a great job that whole series  * A COTY candidate doesn't stick to the same rotation that crapped out an 8 point 3rd quarter in one game and then proceed to crap out a 12 point 4th quarter in the next game, and THEN crap out ANOTHER 12 point 3rd quarter the next game  * A COTY candidate doesn't get thoroughly outclassed by Erik Spolestra when he had one of the hottest players in the bubble, instead, Warren got cooled off to his averages and he didn't adapt whatsoever again"
Biggest takeaway from this is Myles Turner trying to look like Quavo
Brown had to play the 5 because Myles Turner is so fucking soft.
"The last time we saw Team USA the Celtics let down America, and Myles Turner pissed off Rudy Gobert as long as none of them are in it I‚Äôm cool   Yes I‚Äôm petty idc how good Tatum, brown and smart are"
"I got chu fam  Nate Bjorkgren, Indiana Pacers (30-34, 9th Seed in Eastern Confernce)  When the Pacers fired McMillan just weeks after giving him a one-year extension in late August, there were two traits that had clearly led to his exit: His hard-nosed style had caused consternation among players, and his unwillingness to embrace analytics was seen as a problem that simply had to be fixed. Bjorkgren, who had worked under Toronto‚Äôs Nick Nurse and made several G League stops along the way, was supposed to represent a change of direction on these two fronts ‚Äî a new-age coach to take over a talented roster.  While he is indeed far more invested when it comes to coaching in accordance with modern-day NBA thinking, Bjorkgren‚Äôs abrasive style has come as a surprise ‚Äî in interactions with players and his own coaching staff members¬†‚Äî¬†and led to the kind of frustration that has caused significant concern. It hasn‚Äôt been reserved merely for the players, either, as several sources cited instances where Bjorkgren‚Äôs personality and tendency to be controlling with assistant coaches and other staff members caused unnecessary tension.  Players throughout the roster have voiced their dissatisfaction with Bjorkgren and their general unhappiness amid a down season, including key star players in Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon, sources said. Those sources¬†say Bjorkgren has implemented an analytics style of coaching that players privately do not find suitable for the roster, and that there have been issues among the coaching staff at times. Bjorkgren has worked to address matters internally, and one source described him as ‚Äúover-communicative‚Äù to make sure he is sharing and receiving messages from the roster. One coaching source predicted that this would have a similar ending to what took place in Charlotte in 2013, when former St. John‚Äôs assistant Mike Dunlap was fired after just one season amid widespread player frustration.  Indiana‚Äôs front office, led by president Kevin Pritchard and general manager Chad Buchanan, has built a players-first culture. After a loss in early April, Pritchard had an emotional message to players: Sources say the longtime executive tried to assure the players that the season would improve and their fortunes would turn.  As always, the contracts of all the involved parties is an important part of the context. Bjorkgren and Sabonis, in particular, both have multiple seasons left on their deals and, for better or worse, are connected when it comes to their successes and failures. Perhaps all of the principal decision-makers need a sit-down to iron out issues.  Across the roster, players are having career seasons under Bjorkgren ‚Äî including Sabonis and Brogdon. The offense has been run through Sabonis throughout the campaign, and he has responded with an excellent season: 20.2 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. The Pacers, like most of the league, have dealt with injuries to key players throughout the season ‚Äî currently Myles Turner being sidelined with a partially torn plantar plate in his right foot. They had to adapt to a blockbuster trade that sent Victor Oladipo out and brought in Caris LeVert. Oladipo had averaged 20 points per game in his nine games to start the season in Indiana, and while LeVert has posted 20 points per game himself since returning from his two-month absence after a procedure to cure kidney cancer.  In many ways, Pacers officials understood growing pains would come with the first-year head coach.¬†Management had a level of comfort with Bjorkgren prior to his hire partly because of their previous history which dates back decades.¬†What this all means going forward remains to be seen. Pacers owner Herb Simon has historically been reluctant to make coaching changes this early in the process, as every coach since he bought the team in 1983 has been given at least two seasons (Dick Versace had parts of three campaigns from 1989 to 1990, but just one complete season). More recently, former Pacers coaches like McMillan, Frank Vogel, Jim O‚ÄôBrien and Rick Carlisle all had at least four seasons at the helm. Still, the level of early frustration here in the Bjorkgren era means this situation is definitely worth monitoring."
Next year pacers fans will be back to claiming that their new coach is going to turn Myles Turner into a superstar who is definitely worth 20 million a year.
It‚Äôs weird because spacing and defense are the fits he needs next to him and Myles Turner does both of those things yet they haven‚Äôt found much success together. I guess it‚Äôs one of them guarding 4s but on offense it‚Äôs a perfect fit.
"He was looking for schools for his kids in Indiana, he wanted to go there. The Celtics didn‚Äôt want to go into the luxury tax for Myles turner, thus Indiana wasn‚Äôt an option since they couldn‚Äôt get a deal done and that was the only way they could get him. He went to the team that would pay him the most after thatv"
No the Celtics didn‚Äôt want to push the luxury tax for Myles Turner so they declined the sign and trade.
Would Myles Turner be dpoy if he didn't miss any games this season?
Does Bam make NBA All-Defense this year? Who would be the other center in the mix for consideration for the 2nd team spot? Embiid or Myles Turner?
"Note that I am talking about this year. It‚Äôs different than years past. This is his best year on the boards. He gets more contested rebounds per game this year than Gafford, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Biyombo, Larry Nance, and more. These are guys who pride themselves on the glass and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre getting paid to do and Russ does it better than them. I‚Äôm saying that he‚Äôs not getting them for being in the right place at the right time, he‚Äôs putting himself in the right places. That‚Äôs what Doncic would have to do, it‚Äôs something he would have to work for."
"I feel Like the Knicks are the only team that could eat a 50mil 2 year contract for Lowry like it was nothing and not have to compromise. Still have plenty to shore up the lineup. (Maybe Myles Turner) I would watch that team. Well, I am already watching your team it should be said."
"They got Adebayo already, he embodies balls to the wall. I'd throw in Myles Turner too, he goes for every block (almost a 1:1 foul and block ratio lmao). Richaun Holmes is pure hustle too."
"Im convinced with all of my biases that Myles Turner is at least second most valuable defensive player in the league.  Edit: just to make it clear, Turner did not play in this game"
Have to think this locks up Myles Turner for DPOY
Myles turner? Are you joking lol. You think the most average player in the NBA is a guy that will likely make an All-Defensive team&gt;
Myles turner is a very good shot blocker so he‚Äôs not average. Gary Harris is a good one tho.
Myles Turner or Gary Harris
"Thybulle is great but gets bench minutes. Embiid rarely plays alongside him. I'm not going to deny Ben's perimeter defense, but there's a reason why the defense has always been great with Embiid, even before Simmons turned into the wing defender he is now.   Capela maybe, but he doesn't have the mobility of Joel. Myles, just like Clint, can chase blocks, but they don't quite deter shots like Embiid. Turner too especially is BBQ chicken in the post, even if that's an afterthought in most matchups."
"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
I don't know man... you sure he's over Myles Turner and Bitadze?
"Myles Turner. Works hard, selfless, loves his team and sacrifices his stats for the team."
"A 3&amp;D player IMO is a player who plays above average defense or is considered an above average defender (ideally someone who can guard the opposing team's 1st or 2nd best player), isn't really creating a lot of shots for themselves or others with the ball in their hands, and their primary role on offense is limited to taking and making threes. So guys like Danny Green, Robert Covington, Pat Beverley, Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and OG Annuoby would be what I'd consider 3&amp;D players.  Some of the guys you listed are good three point shooters and defenders, but they create too much offense for themselves and/or others to be strictly seen as 3&amp;D players."
And trade for Myles Turner
"I've been thinking about this for a while but would there be any interest from Portland in trading CJ, a secondary piece, and picks for a package centered around Brogdon and Myles Turner? I'm not 100% sure what direction the Pacers are planning on but iirc they floated Turner to the Celtics for Hayward and there were rumors that they were listening on Brogdon at the deadline. The Pacers could offload some short-term money and pick up some draft picks. With CJ they could either flip him to a third team or see if he can't take on an expanded role (although there's overlap with Caris already there).      For Portland it's not the flashiest trade but it could go a long way to changing the identity of the team on the defensive end while maintaining solid spacing around Lillard. A defensive core of Brogdon, Covington, DJJ, Turner, and Powell honestly seems pretty solid."
No doubt if it was Myles Turner (worse player in every aspect except 3point shooting) they wouldn't have said shit.
"Kawhi is falling apart. Beginning to be glad we didn't get Kawhi (won the chip anyway), even though AD is also made of glass, he's following Bron's workouts to a T and supposed to use those pillow bag exercises to strengthen his chicken legs.     Next year with Myles Turner rumors and sign-and-trade Shroeder, Kuzma, THT, and (sadly) Caruso all sought after targets (Thunder/Kings really want Kuz for some reason), Buddy Hield would have open shots all day."
We put a roster together with Myles Turner as his costar and Pacers fans still mad at Paul George for leaving lmao
I never said Turner was a great defender 1-5 I said he was pretty good and able to defend 1-5 if need be.  I would say Myles Turner‚Äôs contract being between Clint capella and jaylen brown is pretty good considering he‚Äôs been a dpoy candidate the last 3-4 and years and is arguably better than capella in everything except rebounding.  There‚Äôs a reason Myles Turner is included in so many trade propositions. Teams want a 5 who can play good d and stretch the floor on the end
They are going to trade him to the Pacers for Myles Turner.        Pg - Irving       Sg -Harden        Sf - Joe Harris         Pf - Durant         C - Myles Turner
"Turner isn‚Äôt a great defender 1-5.   An example of that would be someone like Bam. If I put Myles on a good PG he‚Äôs getting cooked.  &gt;Myles has a good contract  Myles deal is between guys like capella, bogdanovic (high tier starter)  and guys like vanvleet and jaylen brown (borderline allstar).  He‚Äôs nowhere close to good enough when healthy to justify that kind of deal."
Myles Turner is crazy overrated and wouldn‚Äôt actually fix any of the issues the Pels have
Yes. 1000% coulda got Myles Turner and a buncha other stuff from Indiana for Jrue seeing as they already have the other 2 Holiday brothers and Myles‚Äô value last offseason wasn‚Äôt all that high. It‚Äôs a shame what Griff turned this roster into and Pels fans fall for his speeches so they just blindly act as if we had no better options
Or that it seemed like Myles Turner a better shooting more athletic center was seemingly available at the time. I think both New Orleans and Boston have regrets about not choosing Turner
"Yeah the two egregiously bad decisions he's made so far are  1. Taking back Eric Bledsoe instead of George Hill in the Jrue Holiday trade. Zion plays almost the same style of ball that Giannis does, but Griffin didn't get the message that the Bucks were literally trying to dump Bledsoe because of how egregiously bad he was in the playoffs. I'm pretty convinced that they could've easily had HILL considering he was just redirected to OKC anyways. Hill's contract was much more manageable and he was a much better fit alongside Pelicans' core (spacing + decent defense) 2. Bringing in Steven Adams instead of Myles Turner. Myles Turner, while he is not as good at rebounding/boxing out, is a better rim protector and can actually space the floor on offense for Zion. One of the reasons the Bucks exploded was because they brought in Brook Lopez to clear out the floor for Giannis. Myles Turner was VERY AVAILABLE. The Celtics were exploring a market to redirect him and found that few teams valued him. The Pelicans coulda had him last offseason for super cheap  The team David Griffin is building around Zion, in spite of the fact that they have a shit ton of assets, is so bad that I'd be worried that Zion would take the qualifying offer just to gtfo  Pelicans need to fire him if they don't want Lebron 2.0 on their hands"
15 man roster:  Steph + Harden + Lebron + Durant + Bam  CP3 + PG13 + Kawhi + AD + KAT  Dame + Butler + Myles Turner?  The 3rd center spot is kind of rough tbh. You miss out on a lot of good guards and wings though.

&gt;Boston was willing to trade a borderline all star for Myles Turner and a guy who didn‚Äôt play this year.  &gt;Pacers refuse  This is somehow a win for Indy‚Äôs FO in your eyes?
"I've been telling r/NBA we need to trade Turner for years and they downvote me ""because his bpg and defensive play""  I guarantee they don't watch Pacers games to see Myles stand outside, not move, and take 3 shots in the game"
"They just got rid of the the coach that was the source of all the drama, the problem in Indiana is pretty much solved. As for the players, Myles Turner is the only player Indiana has any interest in getting rid of due to the over crowded front court.   Indiana doesn‚Äôt have a history of blowing their teams up and they‚Äôre definitely not going to this summer or next season."
KP for Brogdon and Myles Turner would work out pretty close cap wise.. just saying üòÖüòâ
This new coach will definitely turn Myles Turner into something else than a spot up shooter.
"even with stars like LeBron, AD, Harden, and Kyrie most likely pulling out, it is still going to be a strong US team:    PG Steph   PG Dame    PG Trae   SG Beal   SG PG13   SF Kawhi   SF Tatum   SF Butler  PF Zion   PF/C Draymond   C Bam   C Myles Turner"
"Cannot believe Myles Turner got snubbed. Only 4 players have averaged more BPG than him since 2000. Theo Ratliff had a crazy 03-04 season, Serge Iblaka and Hassan Whiteside and then Ben Wallace. Dude didn‚Äôt even get second team with the 5th highest BPG average in 20 years.   For comparison, that‚Äôs like a player averaging over 30ppg and not making an all nba team."
Myles Turner says ‚Äúsup?‚Äù
I feel so bad for Myles Turner
"He‚Äôs not competing with David Robinson, Dikembe Mutumbo, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, and Shaq. He‚Äôs competing with Bismack Biyombo, Cody Zeller, and Myles Turner"
Myles Turner didnt qualify?
"You don't watch Myles Turner. He's an amazing rim protector. Without him, our defense crumpled instantly. We were bottom of the league defensively without him and like 15th with him."
The disrespect to Myles Turner.
"myles turner had a strong case for 1 or 2nd team move his feet well in pnr, great rim Protector. capella has no case, he's your typical big man. solid rim protection great rebounder bad at everything else"
"Crazy. Unfortunately I don't have much to root for here in MN, but there have been so many Myles Turner to MN articles. Which would be nice but they are usually trash trades, and seems like it is a new player for Turner every article."
I rather have myles Turner than CJ
"it depends on the roster. if I already have a good C like Myles Turner, KAT or Capela, then PG13. Otherwise Gobert all day. On the Thunder right now? Gobert+Dort=80 DRTG"
"Yeah it's a little weird since the only element left from his days there is Myles Turner. Everything else is different. He was our biggest star for awhile, so I guess that comes with the bulk of criticism. He was smart to team up with other big names so he doesn't have to shoulder all the responsibility."
"George Hill  Monta Ellis  CJ ""Google my name"" Miles  PG13  Ian Mahinmi  Chase Budinger  Myles Turner  Jordan Hill  Solomon Hill  Joe Young"
"This might be one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever looked at. Myles Turner at 6, ayton at 12 and vucevic at 16. He should get fired for this alone"
"Myles Turner is the guy who will theoretically open up every team's offense. Pels and lately, Dallas fans are in love with the idea of him."
"Myles Turner is ass at international basketball. Why did KAT have to go to the Dominican Republicüò≠üò≠, Bam and Draymond prolly gonna have to carry if they go. It's ok tho we got Chet and Mobley coming in the next few years"
"I'll go with Sacramento.  Kings draft Cade and ship DeAaron Fox and Buddy Hield to Clippers for Paul George + Pick.  Bagley + Clippers Pick to Pacers for Myles Turner.     **Starting lineup:** Cade, Halliburton, Paul George, Barnes, Myles Turner"
Poor man's Myles Turner would be more realistic than a future star.
"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I‚Äôm not giving you names of point guards to add. I don‚Äôt want to invest in point guard. I don‚Äôt want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in adding‚Ä¶ Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
Beal to Indiana for Myles Turner and TJ Warren
"I keep hearing pacers fans and others saying he just doesn‚Äôt fit with Sabonis. But that seems like much more of a Sabonis problem. He can‚Äôt protect the rim, move his feet on the perimeter, or space the floor. Myles Turner has some flaws but he‚Äôs got a pretty complementary style to Sabonis honestly. It‚Äôs hard to think of many better.  Do you think Indy can make those two work? Or will they have to move off Sabonis?"
Myles Turner to the Nets
Myles Turner or Draymond to the Nets
"I‚Äôm stunned at how far Myles Turner dropped. I understand the team record and the injuries, but sheeesh. The man had 31 less block than Gobert in only 47 games (as compared to 71 for Rudy). He was 4th in DRPM, led the league in blocks per game, and this was all with a depleted team around him while playing with his own ailings."
"Turner is an incredible shot blocker. He‚Äôs improved this year at guarding the perimeter and the rim, but he‚Äôs far from the best in the league or DPOY. I love Turner a ton, but his lack of physicality hinders him from being able to handle the strong centers in the league (let alone the elite ones), can be bullied easily by them.   A lot of people blur the lines between shot blocking and defense. He‚Äôs not a 1 man anchor. He‚Äôs a great shot blocker &amp; interior help defender, with moments of dominance where he‚Äôs able to stifle the offence completely, but also Whiteside-esque moments where, yea, he got his blocks, but the team still defended poorly. His defensive rebounding ability is also very bad. He‚Äôs far from a DPOY player at this time.   For Myles to win the DPOY he has to be able to guard his own man better, I don't think he will ever win one or be considered that calibre if his biggest strength is help side blocks."
McCollum for Myles turner? Is that fair for straight up trade?
"&gt;The eye test should dictate 99% of your opinion on a player's defensive ability, if the eye test tells you two guys are roughly equal you can use stats are a tiebreaker. Myles Turner and Bam both look like great defenders, comparing their stats is valid.  Exactly, so find me the people who are 1) legitimately arguing that Whiteside is either good because of blocks, or neutral because despite the eye test, he gets a lot of blocks. And 2) aren't just irredeemable morons that just spew whatever emotional judgement of a player at the moment.  Until then, it's a pretty massive strawman to drop:  &gt;Except we've established that the stats are useless. Whiteside is a massive negative on defense, the eye test confirms this easily. The stats put him as a major positive. If you combine the two, then Whiteside is a net neutral when the reality is that he's just plain bad. The stats aren't just incomplete, they're actively detrimental.    No one said that. You put those words out there, so you could argue with them."
I can give you a lightly used sign and traded DeMar Derozan for Myles Turner.
Myles Turner isn‚Äôt that good
"Yeah this stupid ass front office is gonna trade Myles Turner, and we are going to have the worst defense in NBA history, by a long run."
"Working on my offseason copypasta....  We have the core four so unless we blow things up we need scoring at C. We don't need him to be a star just solid, so Myles Turner. That gives us....  Turner, Dray, Wigs, Klay, Steph  Looney/Wiseman, JTA, Poole.  Assets: 2 1st picks. Re-sign or S&amp;T Oubre. MLE.   If we could sign and trade Oubre and Paschall for Myles Turner and a bench G or SF I would be thrilled. We still need someone to play SG til Klay gets back."

We‚Äôre not trading for Kemba lol. Stop mentioning the Bulls in every trade scenario. This is almost as bad as Myles Turner being traded for a bag of chips everytime he‚Äôs brought up in trades.
"I could see him being a better Myles Turner, but injuries and foul trouble have limited what we‚Äôve seen from him thus far."
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O‚ÄôNeal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn‚Äôt mean his contract is a better value."
"Drummond? What about Kat, brook lopez, Myles turner or Jarrett Allen? Also you have Tatum twice and if you‚Äôre actually trying to pick positions I really think pg and kawhi playing pf is a little out there. Not a huge deal but for sure there are better centers than Drummond  Edit: forgot Zion as well although obviously he‚Äôs more of a pf"
"&gt; Athletic rim protectors are always up there in the lists tho, especially when they gotta fill a C spot.  Except when they're called Myles Turner. Your man deserves more respect."
"Looney, Dray, Wigs, Klay, Steph  Wiseman, Paschall, JTA, Poole, Payton (?)  2 1st picks. Resign or S&amp;T Oubre. MLE.  So a pretty solid eight and the opportunity to add 3 quality players.  With the amount of chaos this years off season Bob should be able to pick up one good player (Ig role) and one bench guy at least. How Wise does and who plays for Klay til he gets back are the big issues.   If we could sign and trade Oubre and Paschall for Myles Turner and a bench G or SF I would be thrilled"
"We'll have either ""Clippers need to trade PG for Lowry plus Boucher"" or ""Jazz, as constructed, won't get past the 2nd round for the next decade. They need to trade Gobert for Myles Turner and Levert, and trade Levert and Mitchell for a real superstar."""
"I was wrong about Wiggins.  He‚Äôs been great for us and he has figured out our offense and played great defense.  Oubre was always a terrible look and we should have gone after Myles Turner instead of drafting Wiseman.  As for the rest of our lineup, they were dog shit, but they improved like crazy.  Poole is starting to look like an absolute beast, 6th man potential and possibly all star in the future.  JTA is learning from Dray and his playmaking, 3 point shooting and defense have all seriously improved.  Mulder is limited on defense but he can shoot the lights out and moves well off ball.  If we had a Rubio to run our bench and Myles Turner to space the defense and protect our rim, we‚Äôd be a contender right now."
Maybe like Myles Turner? A big who‚Äôs able to make up for the defensive liability and is an average outside shooter.
"Do you think you‚Äôd have the draft capital to get Myles Turner - I think he‚Äôd be a great fit, because the 3 you have now aren‚Äôt starting centers in the NBA l"
"The Suns would be a title favourite. In this hypothetical, the Suns use their resources to get a center instead of CP3. No Ayton slander but center, in general, is the easiest position to fill in NBA. Clint Capela was gettable. Myles Turner. Ibaka. Steven Adams. Derrick Favours. Christian Wood. Valanciunas.  Even lower-tier centers like Mason Plumlee would probably be fine on this team, and use those resources to get another wing or playmaker.  I think you can find someone that does 50-75% of what Ayton does fairly easily for his role on this team.  I think you have to look at it from the perspective that they used resources on CP3 because the team needed a lead ballhandler and more permitter scoring and playmaking. Luka is still on his rookie deal so those resources can be used in a lot of different places.  And, of course, there is the obvious. Luka is a significantly better player than Ayton. Anyone who says Ayton is really overthinking it. Luka is on his way to his second first All-NBA team. If I had to bet right now. I would take the under on Ayton ever making a first All-NBA team. That doesn't mean he's bad, but barring a big jump he is significantly below AD, Jokic, Embiid and Gobert in the second tier with Capela and Bam."
"Ideally, you‚Äôd put 3 elite 3&amp;D guys including one Unicorn C like Myles Turner and a PG who can act as the primary or secondary ball handler."
Russell Westbrook  Joe Ingles  Jae Crowder  Michael Porter Jr  Myles Turner
Get Myles Turner

Myles Turner!
Why would the Pacers trade Myles turner for taller Myles Turner on a max?
can Mavs somehow get Myles Turner for him and something else?
Myles Turner for Porzingis.
So can we say out of the big trio of that draft class of:  Myles Turner Porzingus KAT  That Myles Turner is probably the best contract for a franchise and having your star buy into what they are capable of?  Myles loves just blocking out and popping a 3 here and there... he's healthy and doesn't cause drama behind the scenes.
"he can‚Äôt. KP isn‚Äôt a PnR lob catcher, i‚Äôve seen him do it but he can‚Äôt do it on the basis that our other centers like powell does. he‚Äôs not good in the post either. if he could play the 4 while we had an actual lob catching and paint defending center like capela or even myles turner, this team would space out way better"
"That's too bad.  This year's USA team could've been one of best one they had:    PG Steph Curry (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Dame Lillard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Chris Paul (has shoulder injury, might skip if Suns plays deep in the playoffs)    SG James Harden (has hamstring injury, prbly want to rest it)   SG Paul George (might skip if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)    SF Kawhi Leonard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet, but might want to rest his legs if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)   SF Kevin Durant (would prbly skip to prevent overworking so soon after his achilles injury)    PF LeBron James (prbly skip to promote his movie and heal up)   PF Anthony Davis (injured)   C Bam Adebayo (would likely play)      C Myles Turner (still injured?)"
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
I‚Äôve seen him on espn being hunted by an injured kemba walker. I saw him getting killed by goran dragic in the playoffs.  He gets killed off of switches.  &gt;no embiid in the west   Myles Turner fouled out in 3 quarters trying to play Dwight. Jokic would eat him.
Any team would be happy to have Myles Turner
"I think a Myles Turner + TJ Warren for KP + Jalen Brunson trade would benefit both teams. KP goes to a lower pressure environment where he, Sabonis and Brogdon would have more ball movement. The Pacers get a potential starting level point guard in Brunson. The Mavs obtain the rim protector and rim runner in hometown native Myles Turner and they get a high risk, high reward secondary offensive option in TJ Warren."
"I feel like Myles Turner is a bandaid for anybody that needs a center that can shoot 3s and protect the rim lol, I‚Äôve seen him in every trade scenario"
Myles Turner a good idea with luka??
"Definitely not Thunder, Pacers, or Kings. Sabonis, SGA and Fox are all better. Hell, Myles Turner does his role on the Mavs but better"
It was all because Myles Turner sucked. They had to play Jaylen Brown at center multiple times.
If they could somehow trade for CJ and Myles Turner that could be good. But better to try and get a legit star obviously.
KP for Myles turner
"If we're being realistic, I don't think we'll move KP. Cuban was adamant that he saw the Porzingis/Luka pair with Dirk/Nash potential, and he did not want to break that. I thin even Rick sees that they don't mesh, but Cuban has PTSD of the Nash trade, so it is more likely than not that we'll try to see what a healthy offseason gives to KP.   But if Cuban sees reality, it will take a team desperate, that honestly thinks KP will push them over the edge, or who is just willing to swap bad contracts and hope that a new place will bring out the Unicorn. On bad contracts, Kemba is the best win-win for both parties, Wall would be the most benefical for us and Horford would be just a ""fuck you Porzingis"" move. People are delirious when thinking about Myles Turner and Bradley Beal."
And to think Mavs fans want to add Myles Turner who is just as big and averages just about the same amount of rebounds
At least Hibbert was just slow as dirt.   KP makes Myles Turner look like Dale Davis man.
"Zach LaVine, get a defensive Center like Myles Turner, resign THJ"
"I don't see why the Pacers would give up Myles Turner to get back another player who has a questionable fit in their frontcourt. Plus Josh Richardson, who just isn't that good. It's straight up a bad deal for them."
"It's not just hand-checking, but defensive 3 second rules. Plus more 4s and 5s out there shooting threes. There are less enforcers and great rim-protectors in this era. Only Gobert, Myles Turner, Capela and Embiid really stand out as dominant rim protectors."
"Mavs need a strong defensive anchor that adds value off ball with Luka's usage rate.  Jarrett Allen, Capela, Gobert, Myles Turner would be attractive targets to pursue."
"Our first option should be trying to acquire Myles Turner. If he‚Äôs out of reach, Richaun Holmes should be the second option. I also like the idea of getting Derozan in a sign and trade with Porzingis if trading for Turner doesn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve also heard people mentioning trading for Marcus Smart. Not sure how realistic that is but he‚Äôd be a great backcourt parter for Luka."
"I like them going after myles turner, I think a package of DFS, brunson, powell and picks gets you in the door to start talking.  Maybe throw boban in there?  Also I'd look into getting CJ, you might be able to get a sweet deal on him if portland is looking to shed his contract"
Porzingis for Myles Turner and Justin Holiday
"Get whatever small assets for KP you can get, then try to trade for Myles Turner in the off season or trade deadline"
People are just overreacting the only problem is Porzingis not being worth his contract. That‚Äôs where the interior defense is supposed to come from. Give the Mavs Myles Turner or someone similar and use the difference in cap to fill in holes. They‚Äôll be fine. Eventually a star will be needed but Luka has Lebron carrying ability
Myles Turner with more offensive production
myles turner
"Nah, he might be 4th after Embiid, Gobert and Adebayo. Although Myles Turner and Capela have been really good this year aswell"
"Then like Ibaka, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Nurkic is adding a 3 to his game recently  These guys aren‚Äôt very good at it but it‚Äôs still something"
"Anthony Davis,~~plus Ayton seems to be making the leap.~~ Then Bam and Myles Turner I guess."
Flipping CJ and Nurkic + picks for Simmons and Myles Turner could get it done IMO. Grab a vet PG to run the offense when Dame sits.  Lillard/Norm/Simmons/RoCo/Turner could be a top 10 defense and a top 5 offense.
Myles Turner plays Whiteside style defense. He‚Äôs a block hunter and a below average team defender.
"I think he can be a starting PF but you need a perfect fit next to him at center. Oddly enough I think Myles Turner is one of the more overrated guys in the league, especially his defense."
Let's go Myles Turner!
Hot take: player struggles to defend some of the best eve players in his position.   Up next: why does myles turner struggle so much with Joel embiid
"Randle takes a step back next season, as does the team defense as thibodeau's style starts to wear on players.  They miss out on all of their big name targets and Thibodeau is fired in the offseason.   Ben Simmons is traded to Portland for CJ which ends up benefitting neither team.  Philly and Portland both end up in the play in tournament.   The Chicago Bulls end up with Kyle Lowry and the number 2 offense behind the Brooklyn Nets and end up with a top 4 seed in the east.   De'aaron fox makes his first all star appearance beating out Shai for the final spot.   Myles Turner leads the league in blocks, makes his first all star appearance and wins defensive player of the year.   The Phoenix Suns make their second straight NBA Finals appearance.   Kyrie Irving gets red hot in the NBA finals as defensive attention is given primarily to Durant and Harden and Irving walks away with Finals MVP."
Trade - Myles Turner to either OKC or NOP  FA signing - Kawhi anywhere other than LAC
Honestly a guy liek De'Andre Jordan should kill it internationally if we selected him.  Lopez would be phenomenal offesnively since teams love camping under the basket.  Myles Turner would be good too.  We have options but we ended up with Javale McGee lol... although I think he is probably plenty good enough to compete internationally.
"They need 2 way wings and a 3&amp;D Center. Not a bad defender. Thry need to go after guys like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner"
Someone tell Myles Turner to get it together then lol
"Pretty tough scenario for the Dubs.. Houston and Indiana should definitely be happy if those trades present themselves. Memphis as well, their core is young enough to grow with Wiseman and picks. I think Myles Turner is probably the best choice because he can defend and shoot well. Vucevic can score, but he‚Äôs not stopping anyone at the rim. I think C Wood has the most upside, but he‚Äôs gotta gain a lot of muscle.  Jonas is solid, but his offense is limited. Julius Randle would not fit playing off ball with the Warriors core, he needs the ball to be effective. This was a really good question, being an NBA GM is harder than it seems. It‚Äôs a real big gamble to give up on Wiseman, but their window is closing. As a Wizards fan, I would happily give up Beal for this package."
"for Myles Turner who's 2021-22 salary is $17.5mil then yeah but for Christian Wood (averaged 21/10) who's salary is only $13.6mil, you can just send Wiseman ($9.1mil) and Looney ($5.1mil) (assuming Looney doesn't opt out via his player option)"
Myles Turner averages 12/5 in 30mpg when he‚Äôs not hurt and sitting on the bench in street clothes.  To give up 3 assets for him is completely fucking stupid.
"The Warriors shouldn't trade Wiggins because yes he's overpaid but he's still a very solid 4th option and was an above average defender in Golden State this past year, and if the Warriors trade him, they'll still have a hole in the frontcourt. They should go after a center like Myles Turner or Christian Wood with Wiseman, #7, and #14."
"Trade CJ for TJ Warren and Myles Turner, idk how realistic that is, you might have to throw in some picks but TJ is expiring and Indy is always looking to lock up guys like McCollum on long term deals since no free agents ever go to the Pacers."
"Wiseman is already looking like a potential bust. Wiggins is a high volume, low efficiency scorer that adds nothing to this team Draymond hasn't been Draymond for years. At this point of his career, he's more like a Myles Turner or Jeff Green level player A Steph-Wiggins-Klay backcourt is still way below average defensively.  One above average 3 and D wing doesn't turn a team who misses the playoffs into a Finals shoo-in"
Myles Turner. The dpoy claims from pacer fans was ridiculous lmao
Like I said Zach lavine is the floor that is the worst case scenario. With Mobley the worst case scenario is Myles Turner. That is Mobley‚Äôs floor in my eyes. I don‚Äôt know where you get the idea he was this outstanding scorer that can lead an offense on his own that‚Äôs not the kind of player Evan. He‚Äôs not gonna be initiating offense at this level and to be fair kpj is certainly good enough to get him in the right spots. Also I know we were the worst defense in the league last year. We were also the worst offense. We need everything we can possibly get on that end as well. The Rockets have three dudes on the roster that have double digit scoring potential. Threee!!!! Listen I love Mobley and green and I think they‚Äôll both be all stars for years to come but defense is a skill that can much easier be learned. I just have more faith in Greens ability to become a good perimeter defender than Mobley‚Äôs ability to become a reliable scorer as a primary option. Also Wood is nigh untouchable. Unless you‚Äôre giving us an all star caliber player or a pick better than any of our current ones I‚Äôm hanging up every time.
"Man Pop's team is really working for veteran presence over all else. Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, even Christian Wood are all better players than McGee right now."
"This post beat me to a similar idea I was going to post on the Thunder sub, but I agree, no title but comfortably playoffs:  -Trade for Myles Turner  -Try and snipe Simmons or Wiggins in a Dame deal by adding extra picks to POR side of it (hopefully dumping Kemba in the process)  -send the PHX and DEN 1sts to SAC for Harrison Barnes  SGA/Dort/Simmons/Barnes/Turner, with Theo/Poku/Bazley/Kenrich and an MLE-type C should make the playoffs. Swap in Wiggins for Simmons if GSW landed Dame and the ceiling is lower but that‚Äôs still a playoff team with a leap from SGA and the young guys"
"&gt; Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Josh Richardson, Caris LeVert, Lonzo Ball  That team would be damn good as a player controlled 2k team."
Nurkic and Myles Turner
Simmons + Myles Turner
Yeah but scoring is what we need most of all and Green provides us that in bunches. I‚Äôm not super high on Mobley‚Äôs scoring chops tbh he seems like one of those one and done guys that get lost after their initial move doesn‚Äôt work. Think he‚Äôll wind up being Myles Turner on roids so I won‚Äôt necessarily be mad if we select him just kinda wondering what could‚Äôve been. Cause for me Greens floor is Zach Lavine and I don‚Äôt even know what his ceiling is. Also just not a fan of twin towers unless one of your bigs is a 40% shooter from deep which neither wood nor Mobley will ever be. Mobley‚Äôs shot is slower than Kyle Anderson stg.
"We could at least have gotten someone like Michael Porter Jr, Myles Turner, Richaun Holmes, or Jarrett Allen"
"I could see the team moving on from Brook Lopez to improve the roster. Giannis and Middleton are too potent to give up on as both players are still in the front end of their prime.   Purely hypothetical, but a line-up of Giannis, Middleton, Jrue, Seth Curry, and Myles Turner, with Divincenzo, Portis, Tucker and Jalen Brunson off the bench. Or even swapping Jrue with someone like Brogdon would help (though I think Jrue's defense is a huge part of the Bucks' overall chances).  Point is, with Giannis, you've always got a chance, and with Middleton, you've got a legitimate 2nd option that can create his own shot. This team can contend for a very long time no matter who fills out roster."
I would love to know who the other options were? Did they call Myles Turner? Did they even talk with a Zeller brother? What about Mike James?
Surprised Myles Turner isn't being considered
How is no one else talking about Myles Turner? He is exactly what the team needs
"Myles Turner, Harrison Barnes, Kyle Lowry"
Myles turner probably dont want to risk getting injured again after a long injury. Jarret allen is RFA. I thought they will call mason plumlee or wood but javale is a suprise.
"Curry also basically plays like a 2 since he is a very off-ball player and Draymond is their main handler. Dame could handle the ball more if he wanted. If we can somehow finess RoCo he'd be an addition defensively. If we find a way to add more picks instead of wiseman, he could be 70-80% of Myles Turner or even Gobert defensively so he could guard the post. Draymond was literally a DPOY finalist and made all defensive first team. Curry isn't the best defender but he is still average, and at least tries to guard the perimeter which Harden doesn't do too often. This is all assuming Klay isn't 100% defensively."
"Can‚Äôt Christian Wood or Jarret Allen or Myles Turner do the same while also bringing more offensive skill, and without any of the baggage McGee brings?"
Isn't myles turner sidelined for an entire season? I don't think calling a player that has been sidelined for a long time to play on a different rule is good idea.   Jarett allen is RFA and don't want to injure himself while idk about christian wood but there are rumour about him rejecting the invitation  I thought they will call mason plumlee lmao
"There are alternatives that are not Myles Turner or Javale Mcgee, those are not your only two choices. You're making a binary choice into something that isn't one."
or Myles Turner? hell or even Jarrett Allen? make it make sense
Myles Turner?
Myles Turner if they can get him
Myles Turner. Christian Wood. Thomas Bryant.
They should give Myles Turner a call
Myles turner?
"No he‚Äôs a perimeter defender. He doesn‚Äôt protect the rim, and really is a fairly mediocre rebounder for his size. He‚Äôd get bullied by true fives. Simmons can switch onto fives when needed, but not for a whole game.   He‚Äôd be better as a four, with a stretch five. Someone like Myles Turner would be a good fit around Simmons."
#BRING ME MYLES TURNER!
Myles Turner
Nobody thinks that.  If he was that he would be the best big in the world.  We just think he's average at shooting and pretty elite at rim protecting which is good enough in my books to make him more valuable than people here think.  Some people think Steven Adams is a better center.  That's how insane some Myles Turner hate get.
Myles Turner
Not really. Myles turner is close
Is Myles Turner american?
Myles Turner probably closes but I wouldn't say he is very good at 3pt shooting
Myles Turner could shoot better but he is a great defender
"Zions defense is suspect.  Like .. remember when Harden didn't even try to defend?  Thats what Zion resembles most of the time.  He'd be a great lob threat, tho.     We need a big to park their ass in the paint and block shots.  Jarret Allen would be nice, altho I believe he already turned down an invite... maybe  myles Turner.  Dont know who else is available - heard they're trying to get Christian Wood"
Myles Turner shot a better percentage from three on more attempts per game than Brook the past two season.
Myles Turner
They should get Myles Turner on a plane tomorrow. This team needs defense.
"I would only take Drummond and his brick hands if we could send him down to the G League for practice.   Sign and trade Schroder for anything.   Retain THT and Alex Caruso, ideally Ben Mclemore on a minimum as well.   TJ McConnell would be a nice pickup on the MLE, but I don‚Äôt know if he will come that cheap.   Figure out some sort of way to trade for Myles Turner or Buddy Hield if it‚Äôs possible"
"Is Myles Turner available? I'd love him on the team, cool with those two also, it's gotta be a big though"
"john collins, myles turner or jarrett allen, kinda rough"
Myles Turner would be a much needed fit tbh
"Yes but outside of Myles turner, who I think is hurt / recovering, there aren‚Äôt really that many US bigs to choose from. Although Zion would‚Äôve sick.   But plenty of of all star guards who would make Dame, KD, and Tatums job easier"
"I see a lot of people choosing Team B, but I think it's easily Team A. You are surrounding Draymond Green with 4 shooters and surrounding Jokic with 3 shooters. You are also covering Jokic's only weakness with Draymond Green, one of the top 3 defenders in the league. Also, when the worst passer in your starting 5, is Joe Ingles, your team is solid.   Team B is incredible defensively but when the 2nd best 3 point shooter in their starting 5 is Myles Turner, the team is going to struggle offensively. Also despite their defense, they have no one to stop Jokic"
"I think its stupid to have had four players who do the same thing, Lavine,Booker, Middleton, Holiday and leave playmakers off the team like Ja, Trae,  and even worse Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner and KAT??  Truly moronic."
Bs perimeter defense put me over the edge. You got butler issac and smart? You can't compete with that. Oh and lets not forget Myles Turner can shoot too.
"Myles Turner [should be ready to go](https://www.rotowire.com/basketball/player.php?id=3725), no?"
"brook helps rim protection but is not an enormous upgrade over bam at that and is worse than bam/draymond at post defense and switching.  unfortunately he may have the worst height-to-rebounding-skill ratio in the league, the guy has averaged *five* a game over the past five years, which is literally the same as 6'0 kyle lowry and chris paul have. Myles Turner is slightly better on the glass but is the same archetype, stretch rim protecting big, below aberage on the glass. If they need pure rebounds they need Allen.  Funnily enough, Russell Westbrook averages more offensive rebounds per game than both Lopez and Turner, which is insane. He averages more boards overall than anyone on team USA including Bam and is the nba assists leader, he might literally be able to play point center for this team lmao"
They don‚Äôt rlly Need you lol. They need Myles turner
No plumlee is trash they need like Myles turner or Dwight or brook lopez
Collins doesn‚Äôt help their rim protecting big man problem.  Trae is obvious him or Lamelo or Ja.  They need a great passer on this team.  Maybe Myles Turner of Brook Lopez could help the rim protecting.  But it‚Äôs one possibly two spots to fill if Grant is also out.
gotta be Westbrook imo to help facilitate. too bad they can‚Äôt swap Love for Myles Turner or someone
Myles Turner. LMFAO
"the logical names are injured right now I believe. Time Lord, Myles Turner and Mitchell Robinson are on the shelf unfortunately. Jarrett Allen might be available, but either the Cavs pick up his qualifying offer or he goes into RFA."
Trae Young or Myles Turner or Randle or someone like that
"Both TJ Warren and Myles Turner are worth more than McCollum on their own, why in god's name would the Pacers overpay for CJ?"
Myles Turner? He played in World Cup.
"I agree but not forget they were trained to be physical beasts cause that was the style of play. Today‚Äôs athletes could have been trained similarly and become freaks if necessary. Players like KAT, Ayton, Myles Turner etc focus on being versatile bigs rather than dominant bigs. If they hit the weights since entering the league the result would be the same.   The point is that guys like Lebron, Giannis, Westbrook etc can torch anyone if they are allowed to play 1 vs 1 close to the basket no matter how tough the defenders can be. They would beat them repeatedly either due to strength or due to speed. Hand check can‚Äôt stop this from happening, only modern help defense schemes  can"
"Realistic options: Christian Wood or Myles Turner  Unrealistic: Anthony Edwards, DeAndre Ayton, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"
In terms of a third superstar we're tapped. But we have a lot of mid-money contracts to package together for an undervalued star level guy like Myles Turner or Dinwiddie imo
"Nah, we have options to still be competitive. Title aspirations are out the window this year though.  We have early bird rights on Reggie Jackson and I think there actually is a nonzero chance he signs the early bird offer sheet, or if he walks we could put together a package of one of Kennard/Rondo with Ibaka in a sign and trade close to the figure Dinwiddie is gonna want in free agency this summer. Kennard is a higher number but Brooklyn might want a pure distributor to mix in more than they want another defensively limited jumpshooter.  Aside from that Batum and Cousins probably come back because they're vet min guys in the league at this point and I think they both really enjoyed Lue's locker room this season. So our rotation would tentatively (if things go out way)  Starters: Dinwiddie/Reggie, PG, Morris, Batum, Zubac  Bench: Bev, Mann, whoever we keep between Rondo or Kennard, Boogie, our FRP this year (hoping we grab a guy who immediately contributes), and then into the bargain bin for a taxpayer MLE guy and vet mins to fill in the spaces.  Our bench looks a little wonky, I'd like to see Mann in the starting 5 for one of Batum or Morris so the second unit steadies out a little more, and you could argue we should maybe pursue a more mobile big (Ive seen whispers on twitter about Myles Turner being available) but as long as we get an average year of PG's prime we should be at least a 6-8 seed imo. MVPG would be a bonus and I think we could sneak into the top 4 if that happens"
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"Does Simmons make sense with Fox and Haliburton tho? Why not ship Hield Bagley and picks for someone else maybe a Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, Julius Randle type guy?"
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team‚Äôs best player is Kevin Durant."
Myles turner too
Jeremy Grant channeling that Myles Turner energy
Can Love be kicked off this team since he‚Äôs basically a corpse at this point‚Ä¶ get Randle or Myles Turner

What good bigs did we have tho? I looked through the top bigs in the league and most of them are international. Maybe Myles Turner or Brook Lopez?
You can point our salt out but you're only salty because that guy said Myles Turner
Myles Turner would help. Idk if he declined.
"I mean, there are plenty of energy bigs who can do the ""block shot, get rebound, set screen, get out of the way"" thing. Basically just do a B-/C+ Tyson Chandler impression. Personally I think it would have been funny to send Time Lord to Tokyo, just to see what might happen.  We ought to consider that Colangelo/Krzyzewski/Popovich/whoever else is responsible for these selections communicated some kind of strategic intention or preference when they invited Love. They aren't just picking names out of a hat, there's *some* reason for that decision, however much we all disagree with it. The only plausible basketball reasons I could come up with were shooting, and a history with USA Basketball. That's why I keyed in on Myles Turner, who might be the only player who fits the profile and is eligible to represent the United States.  It really illustrates what a crazy situation this is. More broadly, we're living through this renaissance of skilled big men, you almost can't turn on an NBA game without seeing a seven-footer doing something borderline superhuman, and *NONE* of them are American/eligible to play for Team USA. (Kevin Durant doesn't count, he's 6'13"".) Instead we've got folks in this thread making full-throated endorsements for Jarrett Allen, Mason Plumlee, Brook and Robin(?) Lopez... Jarrett Allen will never in his life be even a tiny fraction of the player that Embiid, Jokic, or Gobert are. Shit, Nic Vucevic would dominate just about every American big.  Maybe it's a good thing though. Up to this point Team USA has really only been capable of doing one of two things: steamrolling everyone, or flaming out in a colossal disappointment. This is one of several major indicators that moving forward, international basketball competition might actually be a fair fight."
"I don't know. Wouldn't you consider guys like Nurkic or Myles Turner as middle class big men ? Aaron Gordon, Steven Adams, Capela, Al Horford ...  These all feel like middle class bigs."
"Myles Turner is recovering from partial plantar plate tear. Probably better that he sits out and lets that heal. I would have liked to see either Jarrett Allen or Brook Lopez in there, JA because he does all the little things (hard screens, boxes out, fights for boards, rim protects) and Lopez for the spacing and rim protection. It's weird to have Bam and Draymond be the primary (and only) real centers."
"I was very surprised USAB didn‚Äôt invite more big rim protectors to the Olympics, seeing there‚Äôs no defensive 3 seconds and goaltending rules aren‚Äôt nearly as restrictive. But then I realised not that many were available in the first place ‚Äî and of those Brook is still playing and Myles Turner has injury problems that might not be resolved yet."
Myles Turner &gt; kevin love? probable... and we'll see!
"I think not getting a shot blocking center who can camp the paint is the most glaring thing, someone like Myles Turner for example."
Can they still work on replacing the lineup? They need to take out at least lavine and k love for Myles turner and Jarrett Allen? Or even get a super hustle guy like pj tucker or Marcus smart.
"No, but he made it over John Collins and Myles Turner, which was a massive mistake."
Julius would have been perfect for this team. Our Bigs besides Bam aren‚Äôt very good. We couldn‚Äôt get Myles Turner at least?
Myles Turner syndrome
"Well one of the picks is the 10th this year. The rest are spread across 3 teams increasing the chance one of them have a bad season or blow up. Yes, 7 and 14 are better than 10. But it also comes with 2-4 more total picks.   The ceiling of NAW and Hayes are not mediocre. Will they make it there who knows? But Hayes alone has the ceiling of a super athletic Myles Turner, that at worst, matches Wiseman's ceiling."
I think myles turner will win dpoy
Myles Turner had the same thing happen to him for like the 1st 4 years of his career.
"Ehhh. I get your point. For Sabonis, how much better than 20/12/6 would he really be on another team? For Turner, he really wouldn‚Äôt. Myles is Myles, not sure what another team would do with him to raise his ceiling. Is it a great combo? No. Would they be individually better on a different team? I really don‚Äôt think so."
"Even if Beal is the best player, Chicago have 3 all star level players while DC have 1. We‚Äôve also improved defensively in the guard position. You didn‚Äôt mention Pat Williams, who‚Äôs a good defender at the 4, and CHI is not done adding. The Bulls are much more talented than the Wizards, there‚Äôs no chance they finish above us.   Randle was not ‚Äúawful‚Äù defensively last season did you even watch him? Rui is not better Randle that‚Äôs ridiculous. The Knicks were a top 3 defense last year, the 4th seed, and got better. They‚Äôre 100% a playoff team.   The Pacers have Myles Turners who‚Äôs 2x the defender Rui is. ? Also  Turner &gt; Bryant  Sabonis &gt; Rui  Warren &gt; Kuzma/Bertans LeVert &lt; Beal Brogdon &gt; Dinwiddie  Pacers also have the better coach in Carlisle.   You‚Äôre overrating Rui way too much lol, he‚Äôs not close to being better than those 3 all-stars. The Wizards have Beal. And some decent guys and thats it. The Raptors don‚Äôt have a star as good as Beal either but I‚Äôm taking Siakam and OG over Rui. They also have Barnes, Precious, Birch, and Boucher at the 4-5 who are all good defensively. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Raptors are better than the Wizards."
"O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs style doesn‚Äôt exist really anymore. Myles Turner as a prospect for sure, but he doesn‚Äôt get down in the post as a pro. No bigs do unless your the engine of your offense. I think Turner is the best answer here, unless I‚Äôm forgetting. A center who primarily scores in the post but can efficiently defend the rim is rare these days. The one guy is Embiid but he‚Äôs beyond Jermaine."
Myles Turner.   then everybody else. he‚Äôs insane honestly
"Myles Turner  Nerlens  Robert Williams  Brook Lopez  AD  &amp;#x200B;  Gobert is the best rim protector in the league, but as a pure shot blocker he's not quite there imo"
definitive answer:   ||PLAYER|TEAM|AGE|GP|BLK| --:|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |1|Myles Turner|IND|25|47|3.4| |2|Rudy Gobert|UTA|29|71|2.7| |3|Nerlens Noel|NYK|27|64|2.2| |4|Clint Capela|ATL|27|63|2| |5|Chris Boucher|TOR|28|60|1.9| |6|Jakob Poeltl|SAS|25|69|1.8| |7|Robert Williams III|BOS|23|52|1.8| |8|Anthony Davis|LAL|28|36|1.6| |9|Jaren Jackson Jr.|MEM|21|11|1.6| |10|Richaun Holmes|SAC|27|61|1.6| |11|Brook Lopez|MIL|33|70|1.5| |12|Mitchell Robinson|NYK|23|31|1.5| |13|Jarrett Allen|CLE|23|63|1.4| |14|Daniel Gafford|WAS|22|54|1.4| |15|Joel Embiid|PHI|27|51|1.4| |16|Kristaps Porzingis|DAL|25|43|1.3| |17|Goga Bitadze|IND|21|45|1.3| |18|Kevin Durant|BKN|32|35|1.3| |19|Hassan Whiteside|SAC|32|36|1.3| |20|Isaiah Stewart|DET|20|68|1.3| |21|Mo Bamba|ORL|23|46|1.3|
"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
"Yikes, 10th in the league in defensive rating, third in defensive plus/minus (and his career average of 3.4 would have been second this year behind Gobert's 3.5), third in block % (again, his career average of 9.2 would have been first this year), third in win shares per 48 and third in blocks per 36.   I would love to know which shot blockers do not also get a lot of fouls? I can assure you Noel gets even more fouls per 36 (Noel: 4.1, Williams: 3.8). Less than Myles Turner too who is regarded as one of the best big man defenders. Gobert is about the only one who manages to keep fouls pretty low (2.7) and he is the DPOY."
I hope trade Myles Turner while his value is highest before it plummets
"I mean we‚Äôve done that once in the last few seasons, this year. You can argue that he won‚Äôt be better than all the players picked behind him, but you really can‚Äôt know that until we actually see them all play and he seems to fit with the FO‚Äôs current timeline pretty well. We have by no means drafted well, but we‚Äôve had 4 top 15 picks in the past 12 years. Those picks were Paul George, a trade for George Hill, Myles Turner, and Chris Duarte. I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs particularly bad."
Myles Turner: getting snubbed from All-Defense teams
lol you just unironically said you would trade KAT for myles turner‚Ä¶.
"Nets fan here -   I'd take any Elite Rim Protector with Rebounding/Box Out ability    OR  A Elite 3 and D wing  &amp;#x200B;  Myles Turner, Capella or my old friend ""The Fro"" Jarrett Allen for option #1  &amp;#x200B;  OR  &amp;#x200B;  An Elite 3 and D wing Dorian Finey Smith for option #2"
&gt; You put someone like Paul George in that position and I‚Äôd say Lebron is a 5x Champion right now  &gt;People forget that 2016-2017 Cavs were actually performing far better than the year previously and Bron was on a war path in those years.   Is this the same Lebron who barely beat the PG/Jeff Teague/Lance Stephenson/Thaddeus Young/Myles Turner pacers in 2017?
I'll take one Myles Turner please
That‚Äôs my #2 for them. I think Myles Turner is the dream player for the Nets
"I mean Myles Turner and.. nr 20 just stop at the 3pt line, if they hustled they could've gotten the rebound. This is as much on them as it's on Lance"
"This is the correct answer imo. Truthfully, the pairing might have been bad for Embiid, because he might‚Äôve not been able to develop into as dominant as a force as he is. Instead, he might‚Äôve been relegated to being a much better version of BroLo or Myles Turner. Which is still a very good player of course, but he may have never reached his potential. But yes, the pairing could work and probably would‚Äôve been devastating despite Embiid not reaching his final form."
I think Wiseman is gonna be great (and better than Myles Turner) but we have a lot of young guys now and I'd definitely be willing to find a three-team trade that works for everyone that gets us Myles for Wiseman.
And Mo Bamba and Myles Turner. Texas is a big man factory
See that's how I know you know nothing. Shooting percentages fluctuate during the season it's called being on a hot streak. Advanced stats mean nothing for defense. Unless you want to call Jakob Poeltl and Gorgui Deng top defenders in the league. Also I don't know how the fuck you think Myles Turner is making 2.38. [That was his salary during his rookie year. He made 18 million last year and is going to make the same this year.](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/indiana-pacers/myles-turner-17839/cash-earnings/)
"&gt;  He got a successful operation, that means absolutely nothing about his recovery.  In fact it means a lot, display your ignorance more proudly.  &gt;  And KD came back from just an achilles and he had the greatest comeback of a town achilles ever.  Yes, because he literally had a different operation than Dominique Wilkins or Kobe Bryant.  Medical advances.  &gt;  Klay tore his all and his achilles back to back. The only comparison that we have of that is Boogie and that didn't end pretty.  And instead of trying to rush back too soon...twice...Klay hasn't played since the playoffs in 2019.  &gt;  Draymond was never a scorer sure. But before KD got to the Warriors he had to score for them to win games and that was with Steph, Klay and that killer bench. He averaged 7 points a game last season that's just not going to cut it. Yes he lead the league in assists last year but most of those were assists to Steph.  No, he didn't.  Draymond's highest scoring season at 14 a game was nice, but he slowed scoring on purpose because we didn't need him to.  He's talked about it in interviews.  We would be just fine with Dray scoring under 10 a game if he could shoot 36-37% from 3.  Also, just by virtue of Steph and Klay being on the court, Draymond will get open layups/dunks.  &gt;  You are out of your mind if you think Wiggins was a top 3 wing defender in the league.  So you didn't watch?  That's not an opinion, it's a fact.  He was top 3 in every advanced defensive metric and passed the eye test with flying colors.  This isn't Minnesota Wiggins.  &gt;  And I don't know what you've been smoking dude but Jordan Poole averaged 12 points a game last season on 43% from the field while shooting 35% from 3.  Seriously, do you have trouble reading?  I said for the last third of the season he averaged almost 18.  Not the whole season, the last third.  It's called development, it happens sometimes with young players where they get better over the course of a season.  He also upped his 3 point shooting percentage to almost 40 by the last third.  &gt;  If you think flipping those 3 young dudes for Turner and Rubio makes you a contender you're crazy.  Maybe I should just stop paying attention to your opinions.  &gt;  I also don't think you know how salaries work because there is no way to make any of those deals work without giving up Wiggins. No one makes enough money to match the salaries.  Oh, so you just...don't know anything?  Aside from the fact that there are ways around the salary matching, Myles Turner is making 2.38m a year right now.  We wouldn't have to salary match for that because it's such a small amount above the vet minimum that the rookie contracts would cover it.  Ricky Rubio trade would require a buyout anyway, so the salary matching is irrelevant, he could sign with us for anywhere we can afford above the vet minimum.  Another thing you don't seem to know is that we still have a mid level exception to hand out.  Besides, Rubio and Turner were just examples.  The point is that we need a rim defender and a facilitator off the bench, and we can move resources to get them."
"Klay‚Äôs achilles surgery was as successful as KD‚Äôs and he‚Äôs been just as careful rehabbing.  It will take some time to shake off rust but he‚Äôll be back to form or close.  Draymond was never a scorer, if you didn‚Äôt notice, but he was top 5 in assists last year while anchoring our defense.  Wiggins was a top 3 wing defender last season while having his most efficient scoring season ever.  Poole averaged almost 18 a game off the bench for the last third of the season.  It seems you need some reading comprehension skills sharpened as well as not actually knowing what‚Äôs going on with our team, because I said I think we have the resources to be a contender.  With Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody and other movable resources we could pick up a real rim defender and a bench facilitator.  If we got, for example, Myles Turner as a starter and Ricky Rubio to run our bench squad, we wouldn‚Äôt just be contenders, we‚Äôd be favorites."
I meant measurably.   And it does change how offenses attack you. But It‚Äôs still not worth moving most of your extra assets and probably a decent player for though when you got a player that‚Äôs just as good or much better in every other facet of the game.  Myles Turner does not get this team over the hump.
There is a reason that Myles Turner has been on the trade block for years.
Myles Turner isn‚Äôt a floor spacer believe it or not. 33% on open threes won‚Äôt cut it.
I‚Äôm not a fan of the JV move personally. He‚Äôs better than Adam‚Äôs for sure. But a PF like Zion either needs a centre that can space the floor or him or one that can protect the rim and anchor a defence. JV isn‚Äôt either of those. I wish you guys went harder for Myles Turner.
"He was #50 in his class and was playing behind first round picks pretty much every year.  Texas has mismanaged a lot of their program, but their development of bigs is not where they struggle.   Past 5 years:  Kai Jones #51 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 19th pick  Jericho Sims #50 prospect in class -&gt; 2nd round, 58th pick  Jaxson Hayes -&gt; #102 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 8th pick  Mo Bamba -&gt; #3 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 6th pick  Jarrett Allen -&gt; #17 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 22nd pick  Myles Turner -&gt; #6 prospect in class -&gt; 1st round, 11th pick"
"I joined this Fantasy Football league where you can play against Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Diamond DeShields, and Victoria Vivians. There are still spots but you have to sign up by the 24th. There is a live virtual draft with all the players on the 26th.  https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
Did he get guarded like Buddy Hield or Duncan Robinson? Definitely not. Did he get guarded like Brook Lopez or Myles Turner? Definitely not. The truth is that teams were definitely defending him at the 3 pt line last season but not making a huge priority of it.  And posting a stat that most of his 3 pt shots were open is pretty pointless because that's true of every player in the league.
I did watch a video that made a good point that there isn‚Äôt exactly floor spacing defensive big men that you can just trade for without it costing an arm and a leg  Trading for Myles Turner is a good idea in theory until you realise it‚Äôs gonna cost you more in value than the Pelicans actually have outside of Zion
Lonzo Ball is the point guard version of Myles Turner. But at least Turner only makes 13 M/year.
"&gt;Andre Drummond  Going to have to respectfully disagree on that one, though it's a common refrain.   If anything, I always thought Andre was super fortunate to be playing in today's NBA, where the paint is emptier than it's ever been and where teams play spread small ball, allowing him some of the most unobstructed rebounding lanes in post-merger history.   Moreover, in the age of the spread pick-and-roll, that dude's been able to average over 16 points per game despite having one of the worst offensive skills sets I've ever seen out of an all-star center... ever. Guy just gets to feast one point blank alley-oops and tip-ins (often from on the aforementioned pick-and-roll).   Andre Drummond in the 1990's or prior is in trouble. Suddenly he's not just warding off Myles Turner for his rebounds, he's dealing with Antonio Davis &amp; Dale Davis, not to mention a rebound-hungry Otis Thorpe and Jerome Williams on his own side, all crammed into the paint at once, vying for that rock.   And without the prevalence of the spread pick-and-roll, I'm not really sure how that dude's scoring in the 90's or prior because no team in their right mind would give that dude more than a couple of post touches per game. And instead of running into a Rudy Gobert or Joel Embiid a few times a year, it's not hard to imagine Andre getting very lost among the shuffle of Shaq, David, Hakeem, Patrick, Rik, Rony, Vlade, and Dikembe."
"The late Eddie Griffin. Amazing rim protector, good 3-point shooter, athletic as hell - if he was around in this era, he would have been making Myles Turner money. Struggled with alcoholism and mental illness, waived, no one bothered to sign him, ended up driving his car to a running train and died at age 25.  Also, Stephon fucking Marbury. Put him in today's NBA wherein we're much more forgiving of ball dominant guards and he'd be more remembered favorably. He will high screen and roll you to death."
The kid has a knack for blocking shots. That's pretty much what Myles turner does. I see turner getting traded if Jackson gets more minutes under Rick Carlisle
Pacers have two: Turner and Sabonis. Myles is the longest tenured player.
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
"So 2021 warriors?  Btw it‚Äôs actually worse spacing. We have Bazemore (40% 3PT), Wiggins (38% 3PT) and Jordan Poole (35% 3PT but can create his own shot), while their second best shooter is‚Ä¶ Myles Turner?"
Doesn‚Äôt he play the 4? In a vacuum he‚Äôs a center but he starts with Myles Turner. I don‚Äôt watch the Pacers though so I‚Äôm not sure exactly what roles they play.
"Which 2 is he replacing out of Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Bam, JV, KAT, Ayton, Wood, and Myles Turner?"
"As a huge Myles Turner fan I don't want to see him go, but if we ever figure out what we are doing at the C position and we trade Myles I would be pretty hype to get Buddy back."
"Could potentially route him to a third team but I think part of the strategy involves keeping him for fit.   Potentially they could try and find a way to also acquire Myles Turner by trading KP to a third team for a package similar to what Washington got for Westbrook, and then reroute some of those players + all their picks and swaps to Philly and send part of the hypoethicsl KP package + Brunson to Pacers."
"""Stretch five"". Myles Turner shot 33% on four threes a game last year, defenses don't give a shit about him at the perimeter."
"You‚Äôre actually proving my point indirectly because everyone agrees that Myles Turner is a plus defender. Not just a plus defender, but a rare plus defending stretch big that contending teams should give up assets for. I am arguing that Dirk is not ‚Äújust about shooting‚Äù specifically because his defense and defensive rebounding were far above average (advanced metrics or basic) in a thread where people are saying he‚Äôs not better than KG because his defense was so bad (it wasn‚Äôt, as I am trying to argue) or because his offense wasn‚Äôt *that* much better than KG‚Äôs (it was, as Dirk‚Äôs gravity + team success + basic and advanced stats show).   I have watched every Mavericks playoff game dating back to their Game 5 victory against the Jazz with Calvin Booth (‚Äúthe fans call him ‚ÄúBoof‚Äù!) including the three between KG and Dirk back in 2004. Dirk cooked everyone equally. KG‚Äôs defense was no match for Dirk‚Äôs offense. It just didn‚Äôt have an impact on the Mavs‚Äô offense, as they made no major adjustments from their regular season flow.   Great offense beats great defense.  Dirk is generational offense.   KG is generational defense.   Dirk had more individual and team success. Again, if you want to use advanced stats, please make the case. Dirk is 8th in win shares, 15 ahead of Garnett who is 9th. Dirk‚Äôs WS/48 are higher (.193 to .182). Garnett‚Äôs offensive and defensive win shares are about even (his offensive is actually higher!) whereas Dirk has an 81-point gap between his offensive and defensive win shares (about 143 to 62).   Dirk is 8th in total win shares right behind Duncan in 7th. Dirk is worse than Duncan. Duncan was surrounded with much more talent, but he was just a better player.   I only use statistics because the eye test would show that Dirk was more unstoppable on offense than Garnett was impactful on defense. I have been watching basketball for a quarter of a century, and I have watched enough of Dirk and KG (albeit much more of Dirk, obviously) to know that the records and the numbers are more or less telling the truth when it comes to Duncan-Dirk-KG. No one in this thread has made any sort of case to KG‚Äôs favor other than ‚Äúyou clearly didn‚Äôt watch him‚Äù or ‚Äúeye test‚Äù, which is enough to compare him to Dirk but not to give him the nod. It‚Äôs not that unreasonable a position lol.   Who‚Äôs on the cover of 2k this year, by the way? Timberwolves KG?"
"I'm not talking about stats dude, you either watched KG play and know what his defensive impact was or you didn't. It's that simple.  Counting stats on defense can be so, so misleading.   Myles Turner had more blocks than Gobert last year. Does that mean Turner is the better defender?   **Fuck no**, is your answer."
myles turner &gt; domantas sabonis
Ok I get it for people initialing random players first and last names (like saying shit like MT for role players like Myles Turner) but RJ is literally the guys first name
"Paul George, Vucevic, Myles Turner, LaMarcus Aldridge, Boogie"
Luka-Danny Green-Mikal Bridges-OG Anunoby-Myles Turner  Bench: Thad Young-Jordan Clarkson-Richaun Holmes-Jalen Brunson-Otto Porter
I‚Äôll go active players and try to incorporate some non-star players.   1. Giannis Body/Explosiveness   2. De‚ÄôAaron Fox Speed   3. Kyrie Handles   4. Steph Shooting   5. Draymond Defensive IQ   6. Myles Turner Shot Blocking   7. Rondo Passing   8. Jokic Post Game/Touch   Would average a steady 40/16/10/2/4 in 24 MPG (never has played in the 4th quarter) on 68/44/92 splits.
"Fox, Miles Bridges, Saddiq Bey, Hunter, Precious, Myles Turner"
Johnathan Isaac and Myles Turner. I expect multiple DPOYs and All-Star games from both of them.
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10.

Ben Simmons  21. Anthony Edwards  22. John Collins  23. Myles Turner  24. Marvin Bagley   25. Lonzo Ball
"At this point probably Simmons, another player who is up there is wiggins due to his contract.  Lavine, SGA and Norman Powell are incredibly efficient scorers (although norm struggled in portland). I have Lavine and SGA in my top 20.  Derozan gets left out quite a lot.  Christian Wood is better than Karl-Anthony Towns  Brogdon is better than Sabonis, as is myles turner."
"Myles turner suffers from the great role player who got overpaid. His skill set and role can be replicated for a lot cheaper. If you can get 70-80% of turners production on a vet min or mle, why would you give up assets and cap space for him?   Buddy hield is the same way. Elite high volume shooter who adds nothing else. You can find great shooters (on smaller volume) for a fraction of the cost. So why pay 20 mil for hield?"
honestly as a bulls fan I‚Äôd be down. how‚Äôs his defense? I know he was supposed to be kind of like Myles Turner coming out the draft
"Probably not the most underrated, but Myles Turner is often overlooked. He does so much more than the box score shows."
"Nah, Green had been no 2 since G-League ended. There are just too many question marks about Mobley. About strength, health (if he bulks up), shooting, rebounding (worse rebounding rates than myles turner for instance). His handling and mobility are really good but if he bulks up does he lose his mobility. How well does his handle translate against nba level defenders as well. When that's really his only plus offensive skill.   He's not like Ayton or Wiseman where they are too big, too athletic at the cup where they are basically guaranteed to be elite finishers (even this year wisemans FG% in the restricted area would have been good for 4th in the league behind Giannis, Wood and LeBron if he qualified on volume, Ayton was 7th)."

At the end of the day there's just very few centers that are sharpshooters - KAT and Vooch are the big ones. We're not at the point yet where we're necessitating that centers can drain 3's with ease.  Myles Turner is a solid floor spacer *for a center* when you compare him to the rest of the crowd. A decent chunk of stretch-5s hover around the 30% range from 3.   I'm always surprised that the league-average 3-point % is like 36.5% - that means a lot of players I thought were actually passable shooters were below average. I still hold the mark in the sand at 33% - if you're making more than a third of your 3-point attempts then you're not a liability in my eyes.
"Not a good sign when your analysis ends with ‚ÄúOnly people who don‚Äôt watch the Pacers would say anything negative about Myles,‚Äù that‚Äôs a pretty good way to invalidate everything you‚Äôve said.   The point you make about comparing him as a shooter to other 5‚Äôs is a very important point though. I‚Äôm more split on this discussion, but those implying he isn‚Äôt an effective shooter or worse, not an effective player are not looking at the evidence right in front of them. He‚Äôs not a movement shooter or an incredibly versatile one, but that‚Äôs not his role. He‚Äôs a 3 AND D guy, and as a 5 it‚Äôs a fair argument that defense is a far more critical skill than shooting. You can cover for a non-shooting center very easily; good luck covering for a non-defending center.   Honestly the more I type the more I understand why Pacers fans feel disrespected here. He‚Äôs a very good basketball player that happens to be fetishized by some of the more mathematical approaches to basketball, which turns off people who are frustrated with the attempted optimization of the sport.  I think another issue is that everyone wants to put him in trade talks and fantasize about his role on another team, which is fun and makes for a good podcast or Reddit post but is so incredibly difficult to truly analyze. Turner has been on the same team since he‚Äôs been drafted, has grown his game significantly since he‚Äôs been in the league, and he‚Äôs a complimentary player who doesn‚Äôt dominate the ball; all factors that make it tough to ‚Äúdo the math‚Äù on what his value is in general across the league. Doesn‚Äôt help to be in Indiana where his games are barely seen even by media or hardcore fans.   Feels like there‚Äôs a lot of theorizing and fantasizing about his ‚Äúpotential‚Äù which in turn has led to an angry mob that is annoyed with hearing about a guy they never see in highlights or on sportcenter. In reality there probably aren‚Äôt a ton of people watching Pacers games, and even then it‚Äôs just so so so hard to evaluate how a player would play on any of the 29 teams he‚Äôs not currently on. Not surprised there are so many frustrated Pacers fans in here, even if I‚Äôm not necessarily in agreement with everyone. This is just a way way more difficult evaluation than anyone is admitting"
Myles Turner. Undersized but great defender who can shoot the 3.
"So being realistic, I‚Äôd put Myles Turner next to Zion. At SF I‚Äôd still keep Ingram. Shooting guard they could probably use someone like Duncan Robinson, Buddy Hield and at point guard a star guard. Off the bench you need a good scorer or someone who can be a ball handler, at least one more shooter, a gritty player, and a relief big.   I think that gets you into the 9th seed."
"New Orleans needs perimeter and wing defenders so they don't give up 38% from 3 on 38 attempts per game.  Also: Shot blocking, athletic big (Myles Turner in New Orleans would be a pretty damn tight fit, I think).  Also also: Kira Lewis taking a big step forward at the point."
Position is irrelevant. The point is that very few teams are asking their big man to step out of the paint to guard Myles Turner on the perimeter.
I never said any of that? All i said was a myles turner 3 isn‚Äôt a great offensive possesion lmao
33% from 3 and can only shoot completely wide open shots. maybe it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwin‚Äù for the defense but idk how you can say myles turner 3s are an ideal possession for Indy. Maybe you should explain your takes instead of getting mad at everyone in this thread.
They absolutely don‚Äôt. At least the Reddit fans idk about Twitter lol. I‚Äôve heard that exact ‚ÄúThe idea of Myles Turner is way better than the actual performance of Myles Turner.‚Äù 5-6 times in the last month on the Warriors subreddit. No one wanted to give up Moody for him once drafted.
No. Any possession that ends with a Myles Turner 3 is a win for the opposing teams defense.
The idea of Myles Turner is way better than the actual performance of Myles Turner. He‚Äôs neither good enough from the perimeter on offense nor stout enough on defense.  Perfectly suitable starter on a playoff team but someone you‚Äôre always looking yo upgrade on
"Lol Jordan‚Äôs not a better rebounder. Offensive boards are easier to get for smaller players cuz you can just sprint in. Defensive boards require boxing out which takes strength and positioning, Jordan didn‚Äôt have the size for this. It‚Äôs just foolish pretending that the dude who‚Äôs losing 3 inches and 30 lbs to LeBron is better on the glass. He barely had more success on the offensive glass and had wayyyy less defensively.  Lmao my guy are you really saying Jordan was at all good as a rim protector??? Myles Turner led the league in blocks, Turner is booty on defense. Thybulle gets tons of blocks, he a rim protector too??? There‚Äôs so much more to rim protection than racking up blocksüôÑ Jordan didn‚Äôt have the size and strength to defend centers, LeBron did. Good defense doesn‚Äôt always equal blocks, opp shooting% is way more telling. You really telling me a guy like Whiteside is good on defense?"
"not underperformed, but constant good stats/bad team guy.  but also the draft class wasn't that great. standouts are KAT, Booker, D'Angelo, and Myles Turner. And maybe KP."
"I think that when a center can neither protect the rim nor switch it puts a hard ceiling on any defense,he's ""protected"" because Myles Turner can be the 5 defensively when needed AND switch over to guard some 4's that are too quick for Domas AND kinda shoot (not as well as some people think tho).   But he puts crazy limitations on a team, and he's not Jokic on offense either, he's good but he can be limited by great defenders who he can't just back down"
"It‚Äôs more valid if he phrases as ‚ÄúDraymond was for two years‚Äù.   Ultimately disagree though. Shooting gravity on offense is always more important than a great defender and good distributor like Draymond. That‚Äôs why teams build around guys like Curry, Dame, Trae, and not around incredible defenders like Gobert, Myles Turner, etc."
"There is a miscommunication here, either in how I communicated it or what you inferred.  I‚Äôm not saying we made no changes.  We lost Oubre, Baze, Paschall, Chriss, Wanamaker, Mannion and got two rookies, Bjelica, Porter, and Klay.  Outside of Klay, I don‚Äôt see any serious improvement.  Even in that case, Klay will miss the start of the season, and spend most if not all the rest of it shaking off nearly 3 years worth of rust.  I wanted us to go after Myles Turner for a starting C and Rubio to come off the bench and run our second unit.  I still think that‚Äôs a contending team.  I don‚Äôt see our current squad doing that."
Myles Turner
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."

"100% hit the nail on the head. You're legit the first person I've seen outside of Nate Duncan and Big Wos to give Turner props lmao. You let Pacers fans tell it you'd think Turner was some overrated, overpaid scrub and Domas is basically Jokic w/o the marketing.   Then again you understand the impact on winning that an elite defensive center has w/Rudy so salute to you. Obviously Myles isn't in that elite center tier w/Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, and AD^when ^he ^feels ^like ^playing ^the ^5 but Turner's 4/$70 million gtd. deal s great value for the impact he has imo.   What's funny is that he made $17.5 million the past 2 years, and at best can bump that up to $19.5 million the next year if he hits his unlikely All-NBA **and** All-Defense incentives which would make his contract highway robbery lol."
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
I still love that how some trade ideas that is ideal to be proposed to the Pacer for myles turner would be bunch of scrubs +  picks
Them trade packages that had up trading Wiseman + Kuminga + Moody for Myles turner made me sick
still sounds like he's going to end up being higher on Myles Turner and Brook Lopez types than I would probably be. But its a start. The Fake Stretch 5 movement is gaining mucho momentum
Why didnt the Pelicans just keep Zo and Jrue last year and trade for Myles Turner rather than getting Bledsoe and Adams?
We shall see.  G league while it might signify nba level skill doesnt mean an absolute steal.  We had joe young and myles turner dominate summer league.  One fell out of the league quickly  the other is a good quality starter.  Against nba vets and a cohesive defensive scheme it will come far harder.  Definitely a good start though.  If he looks more than greg monroe defensively by the end of the season it will be good.  Remember guys like okafur looked good early.
"There‚Äôs been some good 11 picks in the last decade to be fair  Cam Johnson, SGA, Monk, Sabonis, Myles Turner, Klay"
Suns were hoping he‚Äôd be their Myles Turner. He shot 37% from 3 in Maryland and averaged a double double with 2.4 blocks.
"Malcolm Brogdon  Jamal Murray  Jonathan Isaac  Jaren Jackson Jr  Myles Turner   An Isaac, Jackson, Turner lineup is my dream. OG and VanVleet coming off the bench."
"I guess we won't go back to Myles Turner, he was a Barnes recruit after all."
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.

-Giannis wins MVP -Myles Turner wins DPOY -Davion Mitchell wins ROY -Lakers lose in second round -Suns run it back and win Finals -Bucks and Hawks ECF again
"Myles Turner is not worth two FRPs, but sabonis is worth more so it evens out"
"They could both be individual trades, but a 3 teamer could look like  Pacers: Moody, Kuminga, Trade exception  Hornets: Wiggins, Wiseman   Warriors: Myles Turner, Hayward"
"Ben is a shit fit. I‚Äôd advise pursuing a difference making scoring wing, like Gordon Hayward, and a 3 and D big like Myles Turner.  Let‚Äôs say  Steph/ poole   Klay/ Lee   Hayward/ Iggy  Draymond/ Otto   Myles/ Looney"
Maybe Julius Randle or Myles Turner
"For sure. Fit is an issue and there's not many good ways to maximize his playstyle. You also have to wonder if it's worth it. Like you said, other than Towns, there aren't many elite, if any. Maybe Jokic since Jokic works with anyone on offense haha. I think the best fit would be a star guard that can shoot and run PnR and an okay stretch big. So like Dame, Steph, Harden, CP3, Trae, Luka, etc and a guy like Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, KP, Olynyk, Dieng idk.  Agreed on your other two points. And that ties into his mentality and attitude imo. The stuff you listed as fundamental holes can also be resolved with improved mentality. He may always be a bad shooter or a bad free throw shooter but he can control being afraid of getting fouled or taking open shots.  I'm just saying the fit with Embiid isn't ideal but it doesn't really matter. Embiid shouldn't be fitting with Simmons but the other way around. Simmons doesn't seem to want to add anything to his game"
Semi the Giannis stopper  Myles Turner the Giannis stopper  Al Horford the Giannis stopper  Bam the Giannis stopper  Ayton the Giannis stopper
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
"You see enough ""we'll give you two bench players we overpayed and a pick that will end up as a late first rounder, and you give us a starter"" trade suggestions from Lakers fans in your team's sub, and you start to resent the software that made it possible.   I was one more ""Kuzma, THT, and a pick for Myles Turner"" suggestion away from throwing myself off the roof of my house."
Myles Turner got shredded this offseason. Keep an eye out for him this year
Loading myles turner
"If the kids play like Wiseman, they‚Äôll be worth even less. Most rookies are really bad, even if they eventually turn into great players.  Although I do think waiting is the right option. There aren‚Äôt any all-stars available right now that I think are worth it. It‚Äôd also be good to see how Klay recovers. If he‚Äôs an elite player, they‚Äôll want a big (Myles Turner) or a wing (Siakam)? If Klay is clearly hobbled, it‚Äôd make more sense to go after someone like Beal or Dame if they become available"
Nope. Because you don‚Äôt really have a future first. If you did or found a way to get a 3 way deal going maybe Myles Turner at best.

"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.

"If Dame isn‚Äôt a superstar, I‚Äôm taking him along with Klay (tough call over Beal, but I want the best pure catch and shoot sniper in the league), so I spend my all star spots on guards who give my superstar forwards infinite space.

My starting center is only responsible for rebounding and defending the paint while maybe finishing the occasional lob, I‚Äôll go with Myles Turner, assuming Bam qualifies as all star level. Realistically, LeBron is probably putting my bench together, so to appease him I‚Äôm going to mix in some vets/familiar faces in spots where I might prefer some younger players. Looking primarily for guys who can shoot 3s and/or defend at a high level.  Capela, Love, Harris, OG, SGA, Barrett and Ja"

Myles Turner or Domantas Sabonis gets traded  They‚Äôre both better as centers and neither are 6th men so one has to go
"Again by comparing them to other teams of the upcoming season, because with changes in the NBA landscape (especially major changes like this year assuming teams are healthy) it‚Äôs not as simple as assuming a team will play at the same level and then taking into account the changes.  For example, idk where you think the Knicks will finish but I‚Äôll start with the Pacers since they‚Äôre the team people seem to be the lowest on. What‚Äôs the likelihood of New York finishing above them? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs close to 50/50. Indiana for a while now has struggled immensely with health, and last year had plenty of covid related issues, and an awful coach who they canned for Rick Carlisle, a top tier coach. Now they‚Äôll be running a Brogdon and Levert back court, with TJ Warren, Sabonis and Myles Turner in the front court. Their bench is also fairly solid between their quality wings and TJ McConnell and their win-now/ older rooks. That‚Äôs a lot of talent and they should be a fairly solid 2 way team. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unrealistic to say they have a good shot of beating New York in the standings, and from there each team in the eyes of most gets better"
"Perception of ones output being higher than actuality.   A person like Myles Turner for example isn‚Äôt overrated, he just has a lot of skills that on paper would make you think he would be a top player in the league."
The thought of 3&amp;d center is definitely more exciting than what Myles Turner is.
Myles Turner would like a word
"Richardson, Myles Turner, Drummond (before he joined the Cavs)"
Myles Turner is the epitome of this
Myles Turner and Lonzo Ball.
His rim protection wouldn‚Äôt be close to good enough. Best bet is to pair him with a guy like Myles turner.
Myles Turner in his first summer league was hitting turn around mid range faders like LaMarcus Aldridge lol.  Didn't expect him to become what he has but he's very good.
"Myles Turner as a player overall is roughly what I expected to be watching him coming out, but I did not expect him to have his value nearly as tied to the defensive end as it is."
I never said you said Demar was a failure. I said you said there‚Äôs no value in floor raising which is absurd.  And your explanation for why klay was better is because he benefits a contender more than Demar does. The same logic applies to Covington and Russ. I acknowledge the difference between the two on a skill level is larger but Your reasoning still applies to those two. If you want a less extreme example how about Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner ?
"is your goal league average defense though? Myles has barely improved since his rookie year, i feel like every year he posts stuff about working on his body and adding to his game, and he has the same output. at some point they gotta switch it up. maybe make a move for Vuc? Turner would actually fit Chicago really well."
- PG: Steph Curry $10 - SG: Jaylen Brown $4 - SF: Khris Middleton $5 - PF:  Giannis Antetokounmpo $10 - C: Myles Turner $1  I'd sacrifice my left nut to see Giannis and Steph play together.
"Disclaimer, I'm fairly new to basketball:  Luka, Lebron, Giannis, Myles Turner, Anthony Edwards"
"You can have KD warriors plus Myles Turner lol  Alternatively, if Klay isn't back to normal, Jaylen Brown and Ayton instead."
I would take Myles Turner over him every day of the week. Myles Turner has become underrated in this sub now the guy is very good he's literally just not elite. There are probably 15 other forwards I would rather have than AG.
Aaron Gordon is the Myles Turner of forwards....and I say that respectfully. Lol.
"I can‚Äôt think of any trade that makes sense. Maybe Indiana for a package around Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb? Then they slide Brogdon to the 2, Sabonis to the 5‚Ä¶. Idk"
Myles Turner &gt; Kristaps &gt; Doma Sabonis  Anthony Davis &gt; Embiid  Jamal Murray &gt; Donovan Mitchell  LaVine &gt; Booker
"I bet they could get Brogdon, Myles Turner, and a pick or two. Then Turner could either be backup for Embiid (which will be necessary for a whole season) or traded for another shooter or something (Maybe even Buddy Hield)."
"Myles Turner &gt; Sabonis  Myles gets hated on a lot for his lack of offense, but I think his defense brings more value to a team than Sabonis‚Äô all around game."
I tried to convince my league to have blocks be worth 5x as much as points because I had a plan to take Myles Turner super late. We ended up having them be worth the same as assists and rebounds. I ended up not picking Myles Turner
"Neither should be on the list though IMO, Myles Turner isn't a real floor-spacer and Marcus handles the ball too much to count as 3&amp;D"
"Yeah, 100%. I don‚Äôt see any ‚Äúupside‚Äù (however you definite that) in Dragic at all. He‚Äôs had great moments in the playoff and is usually pretty solid, but he‚Äôs the oldest player in this bunch and I can‚Äôt see him out performing what he‚Äôs already done. Ben Simmons‚Äô issues have been gone over ad nauseam plus he clearly wants to force his way to LA. Brogdon is very steady and Warren despite probably missing the first chunk of the year is a 20+ on efficient shooting type guy. That doesn‚Äôt even begin to go into the fact that we lose Myles Turner, defending Block champion and the Pacers‚Äô defensive cornerstone. I agree that we probably need to split up Myles and Sabonis for them to flourish  but IMO a Sabonis/Simmons backcourt has even more glaring problems than the Turner/Sabonis one.   In sum: would be giving up too much for bad fit"
"If Myles Turner is on the list, Marcus Smart has to be too."
Myles turners defensive rtg has been getting worse each of the last 4 years. Despite him now being a better defender. The main reason for that is the increase in minutes him and sabonis share the floor.  Sabonis is a truly awful defender that turner completely covers for and makes look better. Turner in my honest opinion is nearly on par with Gobert as a rim protector but his value is dragged down by a court mate who cannot defend at all.
When including myles turner. Who had like a 108 DRTG. But he played about 45% of the minutes. They legit had a 120drtg when sabonis was centre.
I don't know about Sabonis being that high. I saw lots of pacers fans who would rather keep Myles Turner over Sabonis.
"&gt;Myles Turner/Brook Lopez - 2 of the premier 3&amp;D 5‚Äôs in the league. Both are great interior defenders and 3 point shooters but also poor rebounders &gt;  Turner is only a great interior defender when guards are funneled into him  If he's against a back to the basket, post oriented offensive player, he gets eaten alive"
Myles Turner is so under rated
Patty Mills time in the playoffs.  We can bench Joe's ass if needed.  I think that pressure of having a replacement there to take his shots either breaks him or makes him sharper.  Either way I'm cool trading him for like a Myles Turner.  Joe is dead to me.
It is a negative contract but it‚Äôs definitely not untradable. Especially when you‚Äôre on a list with John Wall and Kevin Love. It can easily be dumped or used as salary filler. Even potential traded with  picks for a good player like Myles Turner or something.
myles turner dpoy this year bubba
Myles Turner. Elite shot blocker and can stretch the floor. I think golden state should have definitely made a move for him.
Yeah. I didn‚Äôt understand this ban either. Myles Turner and Jrue Holiday really rocked them well. There‚Äôs no reasonable except then NBA don‚Äôt like the look.   Either that or they think it‚Äôs a slippery slope to other things players intend to wear.
"Wiggins, Gobert, Simmons (prior to the playoffs), Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, Matisse Thybulle, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal, Butler, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton, Westbrook,"
"Jokic/Collins/Boucher Bam/ Simmons SGA/ J Grant/ Bogdan harden/ mcculllom Trae young/ FVV Doc Rivers vs. Myles Turner/ Porzingis Draymond/ Covington Durant/ Mikail Bridges/ Brooks Klay/ Lavine/ smart Kyrie/ Conley is a great battle, but although I think Myles Turner/ Porzingis Draymond/ Covington Durant/ Mikail Bridges/ Brooks Klay/ Lavine/ smart Kyrie/ Conley have an early advantage with the Finals experience, Jokic/Collins/Boucher Bam/ Simmons SGA/ J Grant/ Bogdan harden/ mcculllom Trae young/ FVV Doc Rivers could at least spring a surprise in the first two games and maybe keep it even through the first four; ultimately the young legs of Jokic/Collins/Boucher Bam/ Simmons SGA/ J Grant/ Bogdan harden/ mcculllom Trae young/ FVV Doc Rivers just don't have what Myles Turner/ Porzingis Draymond/ Covington Durant/ Mikail Bridges/ Brooks Klay/ Lavine/ smart Kyrie/ Conley bring to the table, and though I love Jokic/Collins/Boucher Bam/ Simmons SGA/ J Grant/ Bogdan harden/ mcculllom Trae young/ FVV Doc Rivers, I gotta say Myles Turner/ Porzingis Draymond/ Covington Durant/ Mikail Bridges/ Brooks Klay/ Lavine/ smart Kyrie/ Conley probably have enough to win, so Myles Turner/ Porzingis Draymond/ Covington Durant/ Mikail Bridges/ Brooks Klay/ Lavine/ smart Kyrie/ Conley in six.  EDIT: 6, not six, sorry that must have looked ridiculous"
"&gt; I mean, what exactly could the Nets have done in your opinion to even have this supposed ""top 3"" offseason? Like that's ridiculous lol  Nets really couldn‚Äôt have. Unless they traded Joe Harris for like Myles Turner or something and ended the league. That‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre over the cap and can only offer minimum deals and a MLE.   &gt; I graded them on extending KD, which is enormous on its own right, because he's arguably the best player in the game right now. If not, top 3 no debate. THAT can't just be ignored, idk what you're talking about there.  But again there are 4 other franchise corner stones who got extended. They aren‚Äôt anywhere near mentioned as a top offseason winner. An extension, (unless it‚Äôs like Giannis when people think he was a strong chance at leaving) isn‚Äôt a big win. It‚Äôs a good move but if that‚Äôs your best move you‚Äôre not a top offseason.  &gt; Second, ""Mills was getting the deal no matter where he went"" What? So because that you think that, that automatically makes the Nets getting him a lesser value. And how does Millsap being a late signing matter? It's a signing in the offseason, who tf cares when it happens?  For Mills It means they‚Äôre a top FA destination and didn‚Äôt get huge discounts, unlike the Lakers. It doesn‚Äôt make it a lesser value but it puts the Lakers offseason over theirs, LAARP or not. Millsap is washed and if he was a hot FA commodity he‚Äôd be signed the first week.   &gt; And for as good as Jeff Green was, you're treating him like he would be the sole reason the Nets would win a championship. There's a reason why he's a journeyman.  You‚Äôre right but honestly Jeff Green‚Äôs contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap."
"Yes, because if the Warriors wanted a major trade they could probably get someone who is a better fit for less money. They could probably get Myles Turner for example. They may still have to give up prospects but he fits more with the team, has a lower salary and doesn't come with the personality issues."
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn‚Äôt playing well."
"KAT has the ability to do both at an average level if he has pieces around him.    The idea of Ben‚Äôs defense on the Wolves is his versatility and his ability to take pressure off KAT.    If we are talking ideal fits on defense, it might be Myles Turner or something, but that takes away from the offense."
"For the record I'm not saying ""this is a homerun trade and definitely going to happen"" which is why I phrased it as a question. That said-  &gt;1: Why do they need to offload dragic? He is expiring and will have 2 scenarios at the deadline. The raptors either get some small assets like 2 second rounders or use his 19 million salary to pursue a 20+ million dollar player like Myles Turner or Horford just as an example  All reports and indications are that Dragic is getting bought out. He's even gone on the record that he doesn't expect to or want to play for the Raptors, plummeting his trade value and value to the team (even if afterwards he was like ""my manager said I should say JK so JK"")  &gt;2: A late pick is not that valuable  You're moving the goal posts here. You said it doesn't exist, then I said it does, and now you're saying ""oh well it does but..."" It has more value than nothing, which is why it's included in the trade. Lots of FRPs are included in trades even if they're not going to be early round.  &gt;3: Yeah he looked bad but he hasnt been able to play with a home crowd which he thrived with.  That's such a cop-out lol no offense. ""All players didn't have a crowd to play in front of, and all Raptors didn't get it last season, but Siakam was the one who was REALLY effected.""   &gt;Despite this he still proved to be a 2nd option in the playoffs and balled out in the finals  He's a bad second option in the playoffs, as proved a couple seasons ago along with his inability to get his team to the playoffs last season, and he only ""balled out"" in the Finals when the Warriors were rolling out a crippled roster and he had a top-5 player in the league at his peak drawing double and triple teams.  &gt;4: All reports say they are good  Yeah the Raptors came out and said ""everything's fine now"" - did you really expect them to come out and say ""everything's still uneasy and we're not sure if Siakam is the player we want to bet on moving forward""??  &gt;5: Raptors need offence and not defence and if they traded Siakam they probably want a package of young players  True, but the subject of this thread is the Raptors being a lead contender for Simmons. What trade would you propose instead?"
"1: Why do they need to offload dragic? He is expiring and will have 2 scenarios at the deadline. The raptors either get some small assets like 2 second rounders or use his 19 million salary to pursue a 20+ million dollar player like Myles Turner or Horford just as an example  2: A late pick is not that valuable  3: Yeah he looked bad but he hasnt been able to play with a home crowd which he thrived with. Despite this he still proved to be a 2nd option in the playoffs and balled out in the finals, Simmons was a borderline liability even as a 2nd/3rd option  4: All reports say they are good  5: Raptors need offence and not defence and if they traded Siakam they probably want a package of young players"
"Yup.  The whole issue with Portland is that the league practically has leverage in any deal that include CJ.  They should have tried to nab Kawhi/Jimmy, but he legitimately might end up getting traded for Myles Turner."
Myles Turner robbed of DPOY and All-Defensive multiple times now.
"Why not get someone like Myles Turner that better fixes their defensive issues if they are going to send out young players? Trading for Simmons just adds additional issues to the team and then they don't have young players and or picks to send out to fix things, along with even more cap space problems."
Malcolm Brogdon  Jimmy Butler  Mikal Bridges  LeBron James  Myles Turner  6th man Eric Gordon
76ers also get wolves 2nd   Timberwolves get Myles Turner  Indiana gets Malik Beasely or Jaden McDaniels
"I could see a three team trade that involves brogdon and 2 1st‚Äôs to the sixers, and Myles turner going somewhere else. I don‚Äôt know who that third team would be tho"
"That Malcolm Brodgon, Myles Turner and picks for Simmons offer, if it's still on the table, seems like the best they could realistically hope for now"
"Shout out to the time Marv mistook Myles Turner for Elston, a guy who hadn't played NBA basketball for almost 30 years"
Myles Turner   He still has potential and I think Rick is gonna bring the best out of him.
"Well... I'm a Raptors fan and Pistons fan.   With regard to the Raptors, I'd have to say there haven't really been 'dark days.'  Nothing like what the Kings are going through of the Clippers have gone through, or even the Warriors.   At first, it was exciting just to get a team. We got the ROY our first year. We got some great and entertaining talent early on (McGrady, Camby, and Carter).  Had some playoff runs with Carter, he left in the worst way possible, but we picked up Chris Bosh shortly there after.   Had some more playoff appearances. Lost Bosh, and then started toward building what eventually led to a championship.   The Pistons are likely in their darkest days since the 70s.   We build a contender through the 80s, getting deeper and deeper in the playoffs each year before winning back-to-back.   Had a rebuild that started out well. First got to watch Rodman tear it up with rebounds, lost him in a trade, then drafted Allan Houston. Lost him but got Grant Hill, who was on his way to becoming the best all-around player in the league.   Lost him, but got Big Ben in return.   Got to watch amazing rebounding and defensive performances, and the pieces slowly came together. Tore up the league, beat the Lakers (AGAIN) to win a title back-to-back finals, then eventually traded Billups and everything went down hill.   And since then, it has been almost 15 years since we won a playoff series.   Sure... we've had some entertaining talent along the way. A year of Blake. Some nice rebounding seasons out of Drummond. A sweet old school post player in Monroe. But horrible signings that looked promising (even if questionable) that didn't pan out (Josh Smith) and a bad trade that was the result of mandates from new management (Jennings).   And the draft? We passed up on Klay for Brandon Knight? FUCK!!! I was pissed THAT NIGHT!! And have grown more pissed since, watching what Klay turned into.   We got Greg Monroe, who looked great, but we passed up on Hayward and Paul George in the process.   Then we got KCP over McCollum.   Stanley Johnson? Over Booker, Oubre, and Myles Turner? I mean... it was like shooting fish in a barrel that draft, and we still missed.   Got Luke Kennard ONE PICK before Donavan Mitchell and a few ahead of John Collins.   The team has just drafted SO poorly over the last 15 years."
I‚Äôm not a pacers fan. They had the same record as the wizards while missing warren the whole year. They only had levert for half the year. Myles Turner missed 20 games. Wizards lost a superstar and replaced him with role players
"KAT‚Äôs definitely a below average defender for a starting center. There are 30 starting centers, and there‚Äôs definitely more than 15 that are better defenders than him.   I don‚Äôt know anything about some of the less known starters, but just listing out who‚Äôs better than him on defense:   Marc Gasol/Dwight Howard  Jakob Poetl  Robert Williams  Mason Plumlee  Steven Adams  Ivaca Zubac  Mitchell Robinson  Richaun Holmes  Brook Lopez  Valanciunas  Jarrett Allen   Myles Turner  Nurkic   Capela   Ayton  Bam  Gobert  Embiid   That‚Äôs 18 teams whose starting centers are pretty easily better defenders than KAT, and there are several others that I‚Äôd put above him but are debatable"
They need Myles Turner to elevate their rim protection and pnr defense.
Except they will see Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner sticking to Anthony Davis and actually understand the context of LeBron scoring.
Chris Boucher     Brook Lopez     Myles Turner
To the 3rd team? So the Sixers aren‚Äôt getting too many picks right? Even then who can that package get? A high end role player maybe? I don‚Äôt even believe that can push the needle on a Myles Turner deal but he‚Äôs a Center. What win now piece?
"you're essentially getting a guy who when healthy is a walking top 5 defense   i'd much rather have him over Ben,  i'd say two good players, plus 2 first rounder   like idk TJ Warren and Myles Turner and two picks"
"ehh, I love myles turner but he def just sucks at rebounding"
Myles Turner syndrome
"Only because he spoke about the award the loudest. He wasn't actually the second most impactful defender.       Gobert, Giannis, AD, Bam, Embiid, Capela and Myles Turner are all better."
"His raw numbers are unbelievable but I get the impression from Pacers fans that his defensive limitations really hurt the team.      In 25 games without Myles Turner, the Pacers conceded 120.0 PPG. No team has conceded more in a whole regular season since the 1991 Nuggets. I know it's not all Sabonis' fault but big man defensive ability is super impactful both ways in the NBA."
I hear Myles Turner is available!
Pg  rondo or mike conley  Sg- anthony edwards  Sf- KD  Pf- thadeus young/dray green for modern era  C- myles turner? In todays league
Please keep all these young guys. I‚Äôll have more fun watching this team grow then watching Myles Turner or some shit.
Myles fkn Turner
"And yet, Freddy was our leading rebounder. With 4 offensive rebounds. Against a team with Sabonis and Myles Turner."
Did Myles Turner fuck somebody's wife or something?
Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
"that's pretty good, I'd be very happy with that in a 12T  now if my Myles Turner could decide whether he wants to be a fantasy god or fantasy dog that'd be great"
Myles Turner for Harrison Barnes. Who says no?
I‚Äôve only seen one game this season but he looked good. I wish we could get either him or Myles Turner to Charlotte.
"KP is actually bad though, he'll make your team worse compared to just not having him at all.   especially on 30 mil a year, hard to justify playing him in limited minutes with that kind of salary.  and he gets injured all the time  He'll compromise your defense and wont give you anything offensively to make up for it.   you'd be better off going after myles turner or something"
2 First rounders? It's not enough to land a star. How about Myles Turner?
"**G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **G:** CJ McCollum  **F:** Tobias Harris   **F:** Serge Ibaka  **C:** Myles Turner  **Bench:** Lou Williams, Alec Burks, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic"
"Brogdon, VanVleet, McCollum, Tobias Harris, Myles Turner"
"I'll let Indy Star writer Gregg Doyel go ahead:   &gt; Four games into the season, Carlisle has sent a clear message to Myles Turner. After Bitadze played all 12 minutes of the fourth quarter, the first words of Carlisle‚Äôs opening statement were these: ‚ÄúThe fourth quarter was encouraging,‚Äù he said of the only quarter Turner didn‚Äôt play. Asked about playing Bitadze and Sabonis together for the entire fourth quarter, Carlisle ignored Sabonis. Talked only about Bitadze. ‚ÄúGoga gave us a nice lift,‚Äù Carlisle said and continued for several sentences about Bitadze‚Äôs impact in a 10-point loss to a Milwaukee team missing three starters. Every word he said about Bitadze, every over-the-top compliment, was a message to Turner (‚Ä¶)"
Lonzo  Mikal Bridges  MPJ  Myles Turner  Jokic
"That used to happen a lot back in the day too, if you were watching at the time you just likely didn‚Äôt notice/care or you forgot.  Just a quick look through 01-02 Hawks games for example. In a game against the Cavs, Jason Terry (season avg. 19/4/6) dropped 43/5/10 with two blocks while Shareef Abdur-Rahim dropped 36/12/3. In a game against the Bucks Nazr Mohammed (avg. 10/8) dropped 22/19. Game against the Mavs, Jason Terry put up 46. Clippers game, Nazr Mohammed had 30/11.  In 10+ you‚Äôre not going to have any idea Myles Turner had a 40 point game just like you probably don‚Äôt remember Jason Terry dropping 40+ multiple times while Nazr Mohammed was having 30/10s and near 20/20s. Grayson Allen dropped 40 like two years ago and you‚Äôd struggle to find anybody other than fans of the teams he‚Äôs been on that remembers it."
"I play fantasy basketball so every night I find myself looking at a statline like *""how the fuck did Myles Turner get 40 points?""* Or *""How the fuck did Cole Anthony get 16 rebounds?""* so it'll never not surprise/impress me when random dudes put up huge statlines.   But when the stars do it, I don't even register any emotion. Curry could get 50 tomorrow and I won't care, Harden could get a 40 points triple double and I'll have forgotten 10 seconds later lol."
"Assuming it's Myles Turner you're talking about I 100% agree, he seems like a great fit on the Hornets."
If you replaced Plumlee with Myles Turner then Charlotte is a 4 seed team
Myles turner this is not what I drafted you for in fantasy lmao
If they focused on playing Myles Turner like Brook Lopez instead of sitting him on the block i feel like it would work better
Randle but I'm curious how Sabonis would look like if the Pacers traded Myles Turner for a couple players that meshed better with him.
"Rodney stuckey, monta ellis, rakeem christmas, george hill, al jefferson?, young myles turner. That was a fun series"
Myles Turner is a really really great valuable player   sometimes
"Yes.  100%, he is a classic rim protecting Center that you don‚Äôt want getting involved in switches.  I do think Myles Turner is the archetype for Wiseman to imitate to be successful."
So what should he be tho? A myles turner type maybe? A big 3&amp;D player? Honest question
They were mad at me last year when I pointed out Jrue was the hottest trade target that offseason and Myles Turner‚Äôs value was at its lowest so we coulda got Myles Turner and a ton more for Jrue from Indiana who also had both of Jrue‚Äôs brothers at the time. They said Adams was better than Turner which isn‚Äôt even true and downplayed how well Turner would fit saying he‚Äôs not a real shooter but now they consider JV a stretch big when Turner is so much better üò≠üò≠
The levels of delusion/bias to get to the thought that JV IS A BETTER DEFENDER THAN FREAKIN MYLES TURNER is baffling
Christian Wood was right there at the time and the Pacers were trying to trade Myles Turner for the longest
"&gt;  JV is a better defender than Myles Turner and cheaper too.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  Myles Turner who got DPOY votes?  Myles Turner who was the early season favorite to win DPOY until Rudy did Rudy things?  That Myles Turner?  Turner is a much, much better defender than Jonas Valanciunas.  JV is an okay rim defender but doesn't have the mobility to get by/through one screen, and his closing speed on recovery is measured in epochs.  Myles Turner is so good he hides Sabonis's poor defense.  What in the world made you think JV was a good defender?  The man is a career negative defensive box +/-, and was -.4 for you last season.  He was replaced by the ghost of Marc Gasol and his former team won a chip.  &gt;  Number three. Lonzo didn‚Äôt fit here. You don‚Äôt shell out that kind of money and tie up your last offseason of cap space for a player who unequivocally doesn‚Äôt fit. And don‚Äôt give me the highlights or the percentages. Outside of catch-and-shoot 3s, Lonzo‚Äôs atrocious beyond the arc.  Very few players can shoot well off the dribble.  He shot .378 on 8.3 shots a game.  It genuinely doesn't matter if you don't like what kind of 3's he was taking, he provided excellent spacing and some decent scoring.  He improved every year you had him.  He was an excellent playmaker, defender, and good shooter.  This all despite the awkward and shitty backcourt he was saddled with when Bledsoe got there.  Not that I think Bledsoe was bad, but he was definitely a bad fit.  If a player improves every year you have him, and finds a way to be a positive player on a 43% win rate team, you give him money."
Sabonis decided to turn into Myles Turner on D tonight
Damn myles turner is not playing during cruch time. Free him
Did something happen to Myles Turner this game? Why only 15 mins so far?
Enes kanter offense + Myles turner defense
That‚Äôs true.   Tonight‚Äôs game against Myles Turner and the Pacers should be a better measuring stick in regards to how effective Bam is against a rim-protecting big.

"He was not effective last year, dude. He's nothing more than a foul machine at this point. He's washed.  Lakers do not have a center on this team worth playing. Honestly, they'd benefit from finding a way to snag Myles Turner somehow."
"You talking about trez shoving myles in the back which resulted in myles nudging kuzma? Even your announcers were like yeah, that's not a foul on turner."
"Myles ""Hakeem with Dirk's jumpshot"" Turner"
Myles Turner dropped 40 and not a single post all game from anybody about it  Nobody really does care about Indiana
Pacers just wasted the greatest game Myles Turner will ever have.
Myles ‚Äúdespite the loss‚Äù Turner
Wizards commentator: ‚ÄúMYLES TURNER WITH A PUSHOFF AGAIN MY GOD THAT SHOULD BE A FLAGRANT‚Äù   10 seconds later: ‚Äúoh well I guess harrell pushed him first‚Äù
#MYLES TURNER GOT HOW MANY POINTS?!
Myles Turner needs to teach Ben how to shoot
God Bless Myles Turner.
So.. who pissed off Myles Turner??
Myles turner is having himself a game
"Shaun Livingston was rail thin compared to most NBA players' physiques, and he could still score on post ups. He couldn't in his early Clippers years, but he was damn near automatic by the time he was a Warrior because it was something he worked on.  KP has clearly regressed - this is a guy who just a few years ago, his eyes would light up if he had Tristan Thompson or Al Horford defending him in the post, and would even go right at Myles Turner or Anthony Davis.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRbAdIlNASw"
Pacers are trying hard to make Myles Turner / Domas Sabonis happen
"You too can be involved in terrible Myles Turner trade rumors, how about Ish Smith Biz and a first?"
"He is the best rim protecting 19 year old in a long time, but no one and done has been able to anchor a top 10 defense in a long long time. Maybe Myles Turner? 20 minutes a nught tho."
Myles Turner a year ago
Myles Turner being super available does not mean they are going to take anything for him. Bledsoe is garbage and is being paid 18mil himself. You think the Pacers are trading Myles Turner for Eric Bledsoe? Absolutely not.
"Myles Turner has been super available though. They wanted to put him in the Celtics Hayward deal, but Boston did not want him."
"I mean if they can send Harris to a team for a role player and a FRP, they can probably trade that and Cam Thomas for Myles Turner."
"&gt; Honestly this is probably what he's doing, since the contract is super flippable it's probably just going to be a piece for a potential Myles Turner trade (plus a decent stopgap while Zion's out).  I think that would be giving him way too much credit thinking he's playing 4d chess looking years out when he is absolutely focused on the now and signing zion to the extension.   But this deal for Jonas absolutely has more trade value than what he gave Adams and most likely wouldn't require trading down and future picks to get off of."
"Honestly this is probably what he's doing, since the contract is super flippable it's probably just going to be a piece for a potential Myles Turner trade (plus a decent stopgap while Zion's out)."
"Exactly. So Myles Turner was not an option, perfect fit or not."
Myles Turner is maybe the single most overrated player in the NBA
Myles Turner is being paid 18mil and is probably not even available. They certainly wouldn't have gotten Myles Turner for Steven Adams and Bledsoe.
"IDK, I think Myles Turner is a perfect fit, and there have been trade rumors about him basically this whole time.  I know he doesn't _really_ ""space the floor"" shooting 4.4 threes a game at 34%, but he's the kind of defender you need and can at least credibly stand somewhere not in the way."
"This summer he can trade for and extend Horford, BroLo, Myles Turner or Vucevic before they play a game with Zion. Third time's the charm, and I've said for years that a Myles Turner / Zion pairing makes a lot of sense"
The idea of Brook Lopez and Myles Turner is way better than Brook Lopez and Myles Turner lmao
"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
"Even if you wanna argue they‚Äôre not, the point remains that the worst case scenario for Charlotte is realistically a 12 seed, not a 10 seed.  But I‚Äôd argue they are because they‚Äôre more talented overall offensively, have better coaching and have substantially better defence. Sabonis and Brogdon are a star level duo. Levert on his best days is up there with him, but to be fair him and Rozier are generally fairly close. Might even give Rozier the edge.  Then they have Myles and Warren, to high quality starters in the top 15 or so of their position. Substantial improvements over bridges despite his improvements and Plumlee who should be a bench Center. Pacers also have better depth with notable quality players like lamb, Craig and McConnell  on their bench. Substantially better defence thanks to Myles Turner, and they have a top 5-10 coach in the league now by bringing in Rick Carlisle"
"OKC doesn't, with the dead money from the Kemba buyout and the SGA extension they are nowhere near max space in '22.  So it's really just the Spurs and Pistons.  Which, maybe those teams make the offer but I don't think it's a no-brainer to do that, especially when guys like Myles Turner and Clint Capela will probably be very gettable via trade at much more palatable numbers around then."
"Myles Turner is in that ballpark, too.  Ayton might be a little better than either, but I bet it would be pretty easy to trade for one of them, or get Turner in 2023 UFA."
"He's a solid roleplayer. Also an underrated passer for a big man. He's in the category of great backup but not necessarily a great starter (similar to JaVale McGee).  I wasn't into the NBA when he got overpaid by Denver, but I know he got traded to the Nuggets because the Jokic/Nurkic pairing wasn't working and they had to get off one of them. Was that during the 2016 cap spike?  As far as Charlotte goes, I think even Charlotte fans agree that they need a better center. Apparently they've tried to trade for Myles Turner multiple times and have been shot down. They drafted Kai Jones potentially as their center for the future, but it takes a few years for big men to really find their rhythm in the league. Plumlee was probably one of the best guys available that they could obtain."
Myles Turner
"He is lol.  As long as he doesn't make all-nba or get DPOY its only 25% of the cap.  It's a rookie extension, it's not crippling like westbrooks contract or john walls.    Anyone that doesn't believe Ayton deserves to be making $30M -- which would be his starting salary at a rookie max extension -- next year should think about the fact this is what the other centers make below.  Also, as a fun note, Westbrook and John Walls salaries will be $47M that year.  For actual centers:  * Gobert: $38M * KAT $34M * Embiid $34M (this one will go up a lot after next year) * Vuc would be $28M if they scaled it standard (they did declining) * Adams $18M * Myles Turner $21M (if they scaled normally) * Porzingus $34M * Horford is on $28M per"
"Idk, maybe replace Gasol with Myles Turner?"
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"In that big 4 way deal in 2019 that sent capela to atlanta and roco to houston, I wish Indy would‚Äôve got involved getting roco+picks and sending turner to houston. Covington is the ideal defensive roleplayer to help out Sabonis‚Äô defensive struggles and Myles was the perfect center for houston. Feel like the Turner Sabonis experiment has gone on long enough they needa fully commit to one of them"
Myles Turner and filler is a better deal
Fuck Myles Turner
"I'm with you  This guy was basically just the Suns' Clint Capela for a playoff run and people are talking like he just had a 2018-Jokic-type playoffs.  So why would the Thunder max Ayton when they can just wait a year and make a run at Capela or Myles Turner in UFA? Granted those guys are older but the thing is if you need to trade for this type of guy you can (see: Atlanta trading for Capela when they were ready to push their chips in), so you can always cycle another guy in with your million late firsts as whoever you bring in ages out.  To me it makes to keep drafting, see if you find the second guy you want to max, and, if that guy is not a center, then you start trying to bring via FA or trade a guy on that Jakob Poeltl (low-end) / Capela (mid-tier) / Ayton (high-tier) quality spectrum."
Still a ego hit to get less from a match than a team should of given him. Maybe the operate a trade to get someone else  cheaper on a short deal  like a Sabonis or Myles Turner
"IDK, JJJ and John Collins didn't get the max, and Collins actually got to RFA. Similar-tier mid-career guys like Capela and Myles Turner are nowhere close to the max.  If you're in the market for an offensively-limited rim protector like Ayton, you could try and trade for one of Turner or Capela, or if you're patient make a run at them in '23 UFA (I think it's likely both change teams).  OKC in particular I have to imagine could get either of those guys if they're desperate for competence at the center position."
"The other thing with Rob is that this year we've got a lot more post defence than we had last year.   That's important because like Jarrett Allen and Myles Turner, Rob gets bullied in the post by bigger C's.   Last year Thompson was our only passable post defender with Theis also struggling.   This year Horford's post defence will be a godsend and actually so will Kanter's (it's the one type of defence he's pretty decent at).  So we should be better suited to hiding Rob's weaknesses and highlighting his strengths."
If he gets healthy he can basically be what we always hoped Myles Turner would turn into (no hate to Turner I love that man)
"Jokic was barbequed in the Phoenix series. Teams are going to continue picking on him going forward   &gt;Just naming the big men, Gobert, Giannis, Adebayo, Embiid, Simmons, Draymond, Myles Turner, and Ayton were all more impactful.  Besides the obvious answers, this is a hilarious list"
"bro Jokic doesn‚Äôt just sit down and fall over in the paint lol. He‚Äôs literally a plus defender in every defensive metric. And AD got all those votes off reputation, he wasn‚Äôt the 3rd best defender in the league at all. Just naming the big men, Gobert, Giannis, Adebayo, Embiid, Simmons, Draymond, Myles Turner, and Ayton were all more impactful."
"Lmao who would you trade him for instead?? Russell for Wiggins + Kuminga was an absolute steal, I‚Äôd rather keep Wiggins than trade for Myles Turner or Christian Wood or some shit"
22.5 mil a year is close to what brown got.   It‚Äôs 5 million more than marcus smart.   It‚Äôs around the same as Myles Turner.   That‚Äôs not even close to being a steal. It‚Äôs closer to an overpay than it is to a steal.
Zion and i think nop can trade him and build around Ingram.I love Zion and he's easily a top 3 exciting player to watch.But he's an undersized power forward without outside shooting.And he's too small to defend centers or protecting the rim.He needs a Brook Lopez-Myles Turner type center.
"Hot take - the basketball gods want Indiana to be good at basketball again and are doing their damndest to force them to actually pick in the lottery. Indiana has not had a lottery pick since 2015 and that pick was myles turner. Our draft position is as follows for the last 20 years. We have picked in the top ten once and that was number 10, our last top 5 pick was in 1988. The pacers refuse to be terrible and it shows, unfortunately. Hell if we kept to the picks that we have made and retained them the team would kawhi, paul George, plumlee and lavert. Fill that in with one or two free agents and that team wins multiple rings.  54  18  23  18  20- Chris Lavert  11  57  23  26 - Miles Plumlee  15 - Kawhi (davis bertans for our 2nd pick)  10 - Paul George(Lance Stephonson for our 2nd)   13  11  17  17  17  29  14  27"
"Absolutely not then it wouldn't be somethign that would make sense. Sabonis in my opinion doesnt work for the raptors because he is a negative on defence. Raptors want two way players even if they are not two way players who are super stars. Myles has some offensive game but seems to bring something on the defensive end.  Siakam for Turner wouldn't make sense salary wise and also it would be a lopsided trade in favor.   Picks wise it depends on your front office. Raptors keep picking up guys like OG and pascal in the 20s so picks can be valuable, and can also be used to add to a deal. Dragic because he is a vet and also if you are clearing salary for something he is the one that makes sense if you arent going to reup turner. Really it would be boucher as the asset to play along side Sabonis.   OG is all defensive level year over year over year and frankly is just flat out better. I dont say that as a homer I am not pretending that he is Kawhi like some think.. but yeah. Also Turner is injury prone so that was my thinking.  Hopefully this doesn't come off as contentious."
"See, you absolutely get it. It's kind of hard to explain to people who aren't fans of the team. I *like* rooting for myles turner as a Pacer. It's unlikely he leads us to a title or anything, but it's still awesome to have this guy because of everything else"
"Turner is an absolutely awesome dude raised by awesome parents who helped him see what his talent and now celebrity status as a professional athlete can do to give back and make the world a better place. I'm so glad my son was able to meet him and see this first hand.   He's from the Dallas area and before Covid came back to run a basketball camp at his high school. Some athletes run camps in name only, show up at the end, say a few words and then out the door.   Myles was there the entire time supporting the coaches and athletes, giving words of encouragement and helping as many of the campers as he could throughout the camp. Telling the kids about his journey as a basketball player.   The second year we went, his parents were there and conducted a Q&amp;A session for the camper's parents. We discussed their approach to raising an athlete and the struggles and challenges they went through. It was extremely helpful as a parent to hear the story of their journey with Myles, and what I as a parent of an athlete would need to consider in our own journey.   This is a great story of these guys trying to make the world a better place. I wish we had him on the Mavs üò•"
You‚Äôre comparing Myles turner to giannis? Just stick to reading comments and watching highlights.
"""Pacers Go to Jail: Malcom Brogdon &amp; Myles Turner--""  Me: Holy shit...  ""coach a game between inmates--""  Me: -\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-"
"PUTNAMVILLE, Ind. ‚Äî The Indiana Pacers made a trip to the Putnamville Correctional Facility on Thursday. The entire team held conversations with inmates about life on the inside, and racial disparities in the justice system.  ‚ÄúThey incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, and they incarcerate black people about five times as much as white people in this country,‚Äù says Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon, ‚ÄúTo be able to come in here, and see the humanity in people, people who have made mistakes, people who haven‚Äôt made mistakes, and are in here innocent, it gives you a sense, or a feeling of sadness. You come in here, and you see so many able, smart, brilliant men and women behind bars when they shouldn‚Äôt be. I think God has put us on this earth to help each other any way you can. Right now, it‚Äôs my job to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen, and to make sure the system changes so that it‚Äôs not targeting black men and women.‚Äù  The players also coached a game between inmates. The sides were led by Pacers stars Myles Turner and Brogdon. It became apparent as the game began that one player rose above the rest literally and figuratively. Travion Qualls is a 25-year-old inmate from Elkhart, Indiana. He gets out in two years after completing a six-year sentence for being an accessory to a robbery. Before his arrest, he spent two years playing college basketball at Manchester University.  ‚ÄúI played college ball, high school ball, but this moment right here, this ranks number one,‚Äù says Qualls, who put on a show in front of the Pacers and other residents at the correctional facility, ‚ÄúFor people to show that they care, that there are still people fighting for me, it means the world to me. I just want to learn from my mistakes, and just because you make a mistake, it doesn‚Äôt define who you are because you‚Äôre in prison. Moments like this make me want to be better. It gives me the drive to wake up every day to be a better son, a better husband.‚Äù  Qualls also looked back on his sentence of six years and added that another white inmate received half of the time for doing a similar crime.  ‚ÄúMade me see the inequality in the justice system,‚Äù says Qualls, ‚ÄúThey wanted me to put myself in a position to tell on somebody to go home, but my pride wouldn‚Äôt let me. When I get out that makes me want to fight for people in my spot.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs athletes, we experience [racial bias] on a very small basis. These people experience this every day,‚Äù says Turner, ‚ÄúHearing these stories, hearing what they are going through, it makes you want to advocate for change. There was a brother in here that got charged with possession of cocaine, and he got 50 years. That‚Äôs excessive. He didn‚Äôt do any harm to others.‚Äù  The players also heard about the Last Mile Program. The California-based organization provides tech classes for inmates. The lessons range from web development to software engineering.  ‚ÄúIf I push myself to achieve then I can accomplish what I want to achieve‚Äù,‚Äù says Brandon Patterson, who is in the program and has been in jail for 17 years for robbery, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my personal ambition to get a degree in computer science.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNow we have graduates that are part of the program coming back inside virtual. Now they see someone they were sitting next to have a successful career,‚Äù explains Chris Redlitz, co-founder of The Last Mile, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had people hired by Zoom and DropBox and Square.‚Äù"
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
I give Luka   Pg: Luka  Sg: Jamal Murray   Sf: Joe Ingles   Pf: pascal siakam   C: myles turner   Sixth mans : carmelo/ derrick rose.  Base off your criteria and realistic cap space. These players would fit his skill set.
Myles Turner is worse.
"Easy  PG: Lonzo Ball SG: Jordan Poole SF: MPJ PF: Myles Turner ( if he was an all star, then OG Anoby)  C: Clint Capela"
Raptors trade a horse for Myles Turner
"Capela is much cheaper and provides the same value. Another player that could be on the market in the coming years Myles Turner could replace him well too. Both of them aren‚Äôt max guys, not sure why people think Ayton deserves a max tbh"
i‚Äôm somewhat optimistic about him for some reason. Reminds me of Myles Turner. Weak rebounder but i think he‚Äôll find his place defensively.
&gt; They can roll out a Steph/Melo/Klay/Dray/Whoever center as the death lineup and that team will score a shit ton of points. Sure the defense might not be as good but you're gonna smother teams with offense.  That‚Äôs not how the Warriors with Kerr play. Never have and honestly never will.  &gt; it's about production. If Wiseman did produce last year   If you just want to base it off of basic stats he was a better Myles Turner without as many blocks. It‚Äôs overblown how much he stunk as rookie bigs almost always stink. They can easily package him as GMs know not to declare players busts after one year. They look at potential and Wiseman sure has it.
Myles Turner but it won‚Äôt happen so we move
KP and Myles Turner maybe.
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
"Ja Morant  Lou Dort  Mikal Bridges  OG Anunoby  Myles Turner  Bench - Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes, Lonzo, LaMelo, Ayton.  Starting lineup emphasizes defense.  Dort, Bridges and OG are all elite defender and can guard 1-4.  Turner is an elite rim protector and capable 3 point shooter.   Offense emphasizes a spread 3 point attack, led by Ja attacking the paint/mismatches and either scoring or passing out.  LaMelo is the secondary play maker off the bench while everyone else are catch and shoot or catch and drive players."
"He's definitely not a great defender, but he's not bad either. Pretty ok rebounder (though not as good as his rebounding numbers indicate), gets some blocked shots, can switch a little. His main issues on defense is that he's pretty bad at post defense, especially against bigger centers, who just go right through him, and he loses focus at times.   If yall are looking for a defensive center, Myles Turner would be a lot better option. But if you're looking to go all in on a supercharged offense, Wood would be a lot of fun there."
"Ngl I did not think the Valanciunas trade would be great for y‚Äôall. Better than Adams but if I was griffin I would have gone for Myles Turner 100%. Really nice to see Valanciunas help there tho, I‚Äôd be very happy to eat crow on that one"
"I love my Heat, but we are 1 good player away from really beating the top teams. I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, we should‚Äôve got Myles Turner instead of Oladipo."
All realistic enough with our assets. That's why i dont list beal even myles turner
They aren't that talented and their defense sucks without Myles Turner.
"I‚Äôve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He‚Äôs totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn‚Äôt enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It‚Äôs harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he‚Äôs just not really quick. He‚Äôll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he‚Äôs not automatic like Durant so he‚Äôs inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he‚Äôs on, sometimes he‚Äôs off.  So I think it‚Äôs a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it‚Äôs easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there‚Äôs no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It‚Äôs when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he‚Äôs good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."

I genuinely think id give up my firstborn to have myles turner on this bulls squad
Just trade a second round pick for Myles Turner because that‚Äôs his value according to r/nba
"Jarret Allen &amp; Clint capella  Myles Turner has a different set of strengths in weaknesses, but he‚Äôs the same class of player too."
"Is Myles Turner that big of an upgrade from Nurkic though? He's a better shooter, but it's not like he makes Nurk look like a scrub. I'd rather keep Covington here."
"Gobert is a historic level defensive rim protector which Nurkic has never been  Which center can? A few can, like Davis but you will come in and say he isn't a center, Bam Adebayo can, Draymond can when he plays center and he plays it a lot, Myles Turner, Ayton etc"
"They don‚Äôt play the same position.  Sabonis is a center, Siakam is a PF.   Myles Turner plays as a floor spacing PF on offense next to Sabonis while being the main C on defense."
Look im a pretty realistic fan and I would not mind trading Siakam and I dont expect a massive haul but for fucking Myles Turner???? Siakam is way better than Myles Turner fuck that
"I'm not sure we'll do much in FA.  We really only desperately need a center, and of the FA available I don't think they're our long-term option.  We keep getting linked to Myles Turner in a trade, which I think would be a good move.  Our issue will more be our guys hitting the market.  We have Bird rights on the three that I think we'll consider keeping.  Bridges is obviously the one we have to keep around.  Martin has shown tremendous growth this year and would be worth considering strongly.  McDaniels is a nice player but he's the one I'd let go if it came down to keeping other guys around."
I think this is the year where Myles Turner is moved
My dream is to get Myles turner and Ben Simmons on the blazers. Would be incredible to see them become a defensive juggernaut plus dame.   Cj for Simmons straight up.   Covington plus filler and pick for turner.
I enjoyed Roy Hibbert in my younger years. His spirit lives on in a more hype version with Myles Turner
"Ah ok, that definitely flew right over my head. Seems like Turner has finally become the idea of Myles Turner."
"Sorry, it's a rif on the old r/nba nephew saying ""The idea of Myles Turner is better than Myles Turner""."
"We'll keep Myles Turner, you can have the idea of Myles Turner"
Years of stanning Myles Turner are finally paying off
Myles Turner trade? Or more of a lob man?
maybe if they trade for myles turner
"No cap, Myles Turner + some picks for Siakam seems like a great trade for both teams"
"I am both a Pacers Fan and Hawks fan, the Pacers fans seem to really be down on Myles Turner, the Hawks fans were down on John Collins pre new contract and now it's Dieng who is a poor substitute for Okangwu, and they aren't too hot on Solomon Hill."
"&gt; Another surprising one is a lot of Pacers fans also hate Myles. I don't get that one either  This one I get. Turner is frustratingly slow at making decisions and reading the game on offense, and this makes him a lot worse than he should be on paper. He's still a good player, but out of all of the good players in the league, he's one of the most obnoxious to watch lol."
"&gt; Every team is seriously overrating their pieces at this point in the season.  Ya, it is pretty common.  There's a reason Myles Turner is in trade rumors every year and nothing happens."
"I was in the minority because I liked Nate McMillan a lot and was sad when he left.  Second Nate, I didn't like from the jump though.  Another surprising one is a lot of Pacers fans also hate Myles. I don't get that one either. Turner hate posts pop up from time to time.  Pacers fans make as many questionable choices as our front office."
"As a pacers fan, I feel like the fanbase is so fragmented on who they hate. Some people hate brogdon, some people hate Myles Turner, some people hate Warren for not being available, and I'm beginning to see some LeVert hate"
"I think Siakam can play very well and still get traded just for fit/timeline reasons. Something like Pascal for Myles Turner is a downgrade in talent on paper, but fixes lots of issues with the roster."
"nah that's a stretch, there are a ton of American bigs who aren't afraid to contest at the rim; Jarret Allen, Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Robert Williams III, Jonathan Isaac, etc"
Myles turner‚Ä¶.
"Flip CJ for Simmons. Then try to find a third team to help flip Nurk/Roco/parts for Myles Turner.   Instantly upgrades playmaking, athleticism, defense, and let's Dame play off-ball more."
Vs Pacers in the final 2 mins of the game - sinks a 3pter in front of Myles Turner
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Myles Turner should get some love. Block machine
Problem: Miles Plumlee.  Solution: Myles Turner?
Myles Turner üëâüëà pls
"Without Kawhi: another shot creator / playmaker to take some load off PG. Replace Bledsoe with someone like Brogdan, Herro, Dinwiddie.  With Kawhi: an athletic rim protector, someone like Myles Turner or even JJJ."
"our defense has been a struggle to get going, I'm not necessarily TO concerned about it, we're one of the least experienced teams in the league so having our chemistry take awhile to click isn't too surprising  that being said if we could somehow add myles turner without giving up our core, that would solve every issue we face rn imo"
He didn‚Äôt look like he could fight when he played ring around the Rosie with Myles turner
Myles Turner ESPN Player Bio:  Played 1 season at the University of Texas  Enjoys Yoga and Legos  Father died in 2021
If the warriors can rn get Myles Turner they are winning it all
that hugging match between gobert and myles turner a couple weeks ago  had me in tears
"This OT period is a microcosm of why there's always been a disconnect between how NBA teams view Myles Turner vs how NBA twitter does. Just does nothing to make you feel his presence offensively. Hide bad defenders on him easily and nobody actually respects his 3 point shot or him rolling to the rim defensively despite in theory these being ""offensive strengths"" of his"
I will never understand how Sabonis closes games over Turner.   No way Lakers get this money wide open layups with Myles in the game.
So who is fighting Lebron tonight. My money is on myles turner
There should be an award for players who don't make ASGs but are better than a teammate who does make the ASG  call it the Myles Turner Award
You guys should‚Äôve went after Myles Turner.
"Westbrook is pretty much stuck there and they don‚Äôt have any good firsts they can trade. You‚Äôre swapping old vets for other old vets. That‚Äôs going to be a downgrade with them having to now integrate into the system themselves. Ofc there is hope they can trade THT, an expiring contract, and that 2027 first for maybe a role player like Terrence Ross. If they are lucky they can get a guy like Myles Turner or Harrison Barnes/Hield but let‚Äôs be honest. If the Pacers/Kings call more than 3 teams they are getting a better offer than that."
"At least for this incident, those are on completely different levels. Any other top 10 player who causes someone on the opposing team to fly into that big of a rage would make huge news as well. It wasn't Malice obviously, but any of Giannis/Embiid/Luka/Warriors/Heat/Nets getting in that type of scuffle would get upvoted to the top of the subreddit too. Multiple posts of Gobert getting tangled up with Myles Turner got upvoted pretty high and it was a wacky inflatable tube man fest with some wrestling, ref shoving, and other minor extracurriculars. LeBron drew blood on Stew and then Stew tried pursuing him on at least four separate occasions, knocking down Pistons staff, running through his teammates, and then trying to wrap around the locker room hallways. That was objectively outstanding drama and the sub laps that type of stuff up.  OP and Caruso are referring to the undercurrent of news about individual players who would get very little press on any other team (Caruso, THT, Reaves, Kuz, KCP, Trez, etc.) that's the big difference maker (though Caruso is unironically an amazing role player and I'm glad he's getting some attention for his play). The Suns winning 13 in a row is relatively normal basketball goings-on to the media and the national audience. The average person (not NBA fan, but person) won't really care because that's purely basketball and not drama."
"This is EXACTLY Myles Turner with the Pacers. I love him so much, and potentially disproportionately to his actual value."
"My take aways: Oladipo is quick as fuck, Myles Turner is a massive human being, and PG and KD are unguardable."
"It honestly shouldn‚Äôt be surprising. The Bulls were on the second night of a back-to-back and the Pacers have two really talented bigs. As successful as the super small lineups have been since Vucevic got Covid, Sabonis is too talented on offense for someone ~6‚Äô5‚Äù to handle, and on defense, Myles Turner had the paint locked down.   I think with Vooch in the game and the Bulls more fresh, then this is a hard-fought win for them. But Indiana was the wrong team to face at exactly the wrong time. Credit to them for that beat down, though ‚Äî the Bulls looked lost pretty much from the opening tip."
If the ‚Äú3‚Äù is blocks instead of assists you get Myles turner.
"A few thoughts from the game:  * Bulls looked gassed, especially on the defensive end. Lavine in particular absolutely couldn't stay in front of anyone. Their offense was also stagnant; lots of ISOs and not much ball movement or cutting.  * The Bulls are really thin at the center position, and that showed even more when Vucevic absent. They had to go small for large stretches and Sabonis/Turner were able to operate really effectively in the paint.  * Despite a blowout and his shooting improving, Levert still played the fewest minutes out of the starters and fewer minutes than two bench guys. From watching all the Pacers games so far this year, my best guess is that Carlisle is looking for specific things out of him (probably defense and playmaking) and keeping him on a tight leash, but who knows.  * Daily reminder that Myles Turner is a legit DPOY contender.  * Kelan Martin had a great game offensively (in a tiny role obviously) and defensively. He's been really nice the last couple games."
Myles Turner is better than the idea of Myles Turner.
Myles Turner
Is Jonas a good rim protector? I think Myles Turner is a bit better of a fit for GSW if he can keep his shooting up
"What do raptors fans think of a siakam for Myles turner trade? Idk about the assets needed around that, but just as a general idea, the raptors need a defensive anchor and turner also provides spacing. Idk if the Pacers would take the offer since I'm not sure about siakams fit in Indiana but on the Toronto side, what's the opinion?"
"Don't expect much from Wiseman and there's not much of a need to anyway.  The most he'll become this year is Javale Mcgee. In which case that's perfect. 10-15 mins a game, vertical spacing, etc. Dude doesn't need to be Giannis/Embiid or even Myles Turner."
Hopefully Blazers with Simmons and Myles Turner. They already got Nance in the offseason too.
Happens to myles turner all the time  dude will get hot and then never get the ball again
Gobert vs Myles Turner. I think alot of people are probably traumatized by the horrific scene. A brawl like none other
"I would love a Hayward for Myles Turner trade. I think it could benefit both teams. Gordon considered Indy before signing with us, and they could use a shake up in their starting unit."
Sadly Nets will trade Kyrie for Myles Turner
"I think MK is going to make a move on a big to replace Plumlee, I really hope it‚Äôs Myles Turner tho and not Woods. Although anything is an upgrade on Plumlee atm"
Myles Turner. He can run a team as the first option and be up there with the best centers in the league.
Yes and If I‚Äôm the warriors I‚Äôm trading wiseman and moody and whatever else for Myles turner. Then the title race is done pretty much unless Kyrie comes back.
"someone on the Rockets is bound to have a career game against us lmao, don't count yourselves out yet    If you wondering who went off on us during our losses, it was OG/GTJ against Toronto, Terrence Ross on fire TWICE against Orlando as basically Curry-lite, Myles Turner having a career night from 3 with the Pacers, Rubio scoring a career high 37 points on us on 8/9 shooting from 3 and Mobley scoring a career high 26 points, &amp; Pat Connaughton with a near career high of 23 points  Imma bet either Jalen Green or Sengun (if he gets a lot of minutes) will go off on us especially with KPJ out"
"We will make a move for a C. I'm sure we will try to dump WCS for a 2nd swap or something just to make room for a C and send some picks for a C that fits our TPE. My favorite bets are Favors and Zubac, although Bryant and Dwight are also possibilities.   Doubt we trade KP, considering how he improved and how Kidd likes him, unless there's a home run proposal, like Simmons, which I doubt. But I wouldn't be surprised if we offer DFS and the 2025 1st for some long term help. Doubt Cubes will want to go deep in the tax with a 1st round exit core, and we are definitely signing Brunson to a new deal next year. DFS still has value as a good 3 shooter that can guard the best player of any team and we need a long term answer at the 5.  DFS and a 1st for Myles Turner or Mitchell Robinson would be my dream."
Hornets need to find a way to get Myles Turner
Should trade for Myles Turner
Myles Turner
For a big though 30-33 ain‚Äôt bad. Myles Turner does that and we call him a stretch big lol.
"That's right, Myles Turner"
Myles Turner for a bojangles coupon
Myles Turner gets the ball maybe 10 times a game and he averages 1.8 turnovers
"1. As you said Simmons has a mental health thing. That relates them  2. Simmons‚Äô inability to work with the team is reminiscent of Royce white.  3. Simmons‚Äô shooting, or lack thereof, points to a larger issue. It‚Äôs seemingly mental, as he has the physical ability, he just chooses not to. It‚Äôs obvious that he understands the game well enough that it can‚Äôt be he doesn‚Äôt recognize he‚Äôs open. He pretends to work on it in the off-season and throws out a video but then that never translates to games. I truly think the fans bother him. He gets scared. I don‚Äôt blame him, but he‚Äôs a pro. He needs to own it. Seems anxiety, which is what Royce white had.  4. Royce white could have just disappeared but i remember there was a ton of drama around it. Same thing with Simmons.  I do agree that Simmons needs to shoot to maximize embiid, but, Simmons wouldn‚Äôt wanna play his natural position of modern center either. So you have to play him with a stretch big that can anchor the paint. Porzingis? Myles turner?"
Yeah like Cole Anthony has swag. Mo bamba got a 300 million views+ song about him. Isaac didn't kneel for the anthem so he got some heat.   The pacers are just hey we made headlines for myles turner getting hugged by Rudy gobert
I‚Äôd like to order one Myles turner please
Now send us Myles Turner
"Literally every comment talking down on Turner is this same shit lmao. He's a great defender, who has nice floor stretching abilities and good scorer in the post. If your iDeA of Myles Turner is more than that, then it's on you. Classic r/nba parroting of a sentence they heard that sounds cool."
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
"They've done well, but those were some high picks also. Its a lot easier to draft well when you pick at #2 every year.  * Randle at 7 was a good pick, but not the best pick in that draft or anything. Still, I'd say he'd go higher in a redraft so props to them for the pick. * Rusell went #2 in 2015. People have a wide range of opinions, I tend to think he's overrated. Not a bust or anything, but you figure they'd pick up Booker in a redraft, and probably also take Porzingis and Myles Turner ahead of him. The Lakers got Larry Nance late in this draft, which I do think is actually a really good pick. I'd rather have him than Russell, honestly. * Ingram #2 in 2016. Another good, not great pick. Went before Siakam, Jaylen Brown, Sabonis, Jamal Murray, Brogdon and Dejounte Murray. Not sure how a redraft would go, but probably he isn't the 2nd best player in the draft. * Lonzo went #2 in 2017 right ahead of Tatum. Bam and Donovan Mitchell also went in the lottery that year. I think he goes behind those guys for sure in a redraft, and also maybe Fox, Jarret Allan, OG, and John Collins. Not a bust, but probably not like a great pick either.  Overall I'd say good but not great picks. They didn't get any real busts, so I give them credit, but they also picked super high 3 years in a row. They could have a team with Randle, Booker, Turner, Siakam, and Donovan Mitchell or something and win 70 games."
Teams will line up for the idea of Myles Turner
He didn‚Äôt spin on Myles Turner
I'd do anything to get Myles Turner in Toronto
one myles turner pls
Myles turner is ass
Anyone else first thought that this was a quote from Myles Turner? Lol
Everyone needs Myles Turner
They need Myles Turner.   Every good team needs him
Myles Turner gets snubbed every year. He's the best shot blocker in the game and has been for some time.
"You‚Äôre right and that‚Äôs fair. But I hate this idea that Myles Turner isn‚Äôt a great defender as if his insane block numbers are somehow a detriment to the team. Like Gobert, he‚Äôs forced to cover for a ton of other player‚Äôs defensive deficiencies. I don‚Äôt think people understand how hard it is to design an elite defense with Sabonis guarding the 4 and Brogdon as a point of attack defender."
"Celtics: a week ago I would of said Get a better Big, Myles Turner, Howard, even cousins    Today: Be able to field a team..."
"You absolutely can and should, Myles Turner is currently as good at shot blocking then Steph Curry is at shooting three‚Äôs"
Idk Enes Kanter averaging a double double off the bench and Portland is right in the thick of it all so he my pick for 6MOTY   MIP I gotta say Christian Wood if he keep it up bc I‚Äôve seen that kid make shots so far that i never expected n he putting up good numbers but I do believe Julius Randle is another contender if he too continues his stellar play as of late  MVP is tough but im leaning towards JOKIC . . . he got most triple doubles already and clearly best passing big man in the game...idk i just love big honey so much and he seem to be playing elite ball so i think he got a shot...  DPOY Andre Drummond perhaps? and I hope Myles Turner makes all defense team
Myles Turner disputes this claim.
Myles Turner DPOY. At least an all defense selection if he slows down pls
I'm voting Myles Turner for DPOY because I think it's funny when top 30-40 players are eligible for the super max and their team massively overpays to keep them in a panic move.
"Thanks for the response. Man that is tragic to hear, he was definitely a project when he got drafted but I was hoping he would shape to be a Myles Turner like player."
It means Myles Turner has gotten a lot of blocks!
"Not sure that necessarily means anything. There's 6-7 teams with less blocks than Myles Turner right now including the Blazers, Nuggets, Heat and Mavs."
the whole team has the same amount of Blocks (33) as Myles Turner (33).
Myles Turner has entered the chat
"It's Scott Brooks. His rotations and under-utilization of players like Deni, Bonga, Wagner, and Troy Brown (not coincidentally, our 4 best defensive players) have killed us.  Also, Michael Longabardi, one of our defense-oriented assistant coaches, is notorious... for being a terrible coach.  Honestly we just need to fire Brooks and trade/sign a defensive anchor and we'll be fine. I came up with a potential trade for Myles Turner, and I thought we should sign Rondae Hollis Jefferson.  This wizards team has so much raw talent. I know we can make the playoffs... but in the end it comes down to coaching."
"Times like these are when we could use someone like, say, Myles Turner"
I said that they tweeted his stat line when he had a bad game and you denied that any credible source would‚Äôve done that. I showed you that a Celtics media member was hung up on Myles Turner and tweeting his lines to attack him because Celtics fans were trying to convince themselves that Turner wasn‚Äôt that good. You‚Äôre such a clown it‚Äôs hilarious.
"Victor Oladipo yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Myles Turner gave a look of pleasant surprise. Domantas Sabonis belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Malcolm Brogdon hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different despite appearing the same.‚Äù"
"I'll post this from a local rockets forum, cluthfans. Everyone knows it has to happen and harden has to go, but not sure we should take calvins disappointment as the bible. The eye test:   ""  I decided to look at the last 4 minutes objectively and play by play just watch Harden. I have to disagree with Murph.. Harden didn‚Äôt pout or do anything that suggested he quit  -4 minutes to go Harden passes to a wide open Gordon... brick  -next possession wall has a switch/mismatch and takes advantage on a drive like he had all night  -3 min left Harden shuts down a drive by brogdon  -next possession harden runs a 2 man game with tucker.... turnover due to Myles turners length and having 7 blocks at that point. Harden was kicking to tucker but hesitant to force a floater over turner... leads to a fast break foul  -next play harden layup due to better spacing on the 2 man game up top  -brogdon lucky bounce on a 3  -wall turnover off a sloppy inbounds play/no whistle  -brogdon gets a block foul on PJ/harden was in position to ensure brogdon did not get an and 1... next play ends with Sabonis putback  -Harden steps back with the team down 4 ... miss - he‚Äôs done this his whole career  -shot clock violation on IND/harden boxed out sabonis  -next play good pass to Nwaba, goes up weak and is blocked.. no floater from Harden because he was smart enough to know he did not have his shot going and turner and sabonis were close  -28 seconds.. play ran for Wall... Wall turns it over """
"The leader has 10 and he has 9, you worded it like the difference was like Myles Turner blocks stat lmao"
Adams is good but you can find decent centers for cheap these days. Adams isn't a lot better than Favors. A lot of people are concerned because they gave up draft picks and good players to pair Zion with a guy who can't space the floor when Myles Turner was supposedly available.
but they said myles turner was gonna turn into an all-star anytime soon
"Think you brought up a lot of really solid points here.  I‚Äôve been a big Turner fan ever since we drafted him, but think you hit the nail on the head when you said ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt feel like a consistent dominance.‚Äù  It‚Äôs like Myles has two different mental gears and when he‚Äôs on that top gear he‚Äôs aggressive and can really control a game on the defensive end, but he really struggles to stay in that gear each game.  If he can improve his consistency in bringing it every night he could definitely make an all defense team this year imo."
"I find him really tough to evaluate.  The talent is definitely there but it feels like his impact comes and goes.  There are times when Rudy Gobert getting 3 blocks feels more impactful than Myles Turner getting 6 because Rudy does a better job of altering the shots he doesn't block.   It was a big concept with Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. They could both get 8 blocks a game, but people would walk away from games incredibly impressed by all the shots Bill altered without getting the block (especially early in Wilt's career).  His first game against Boston for the season, Myles had 5 blocks and Boston still shot 50% from the field. It just felt like, ""yeah he had the blocks, but we still pretty much got the shots we wanted"". Whereas Rudy having a big night is like putting up a sign that says ""sorry, this part of the court is closed"".  Myles certainly isn't a pure stat-padder like Whiteside (who can lead the league in blocks as a NET negative defender), he's definitely had periods of dominance, but it doesn't feel like a consistent dominance.   There are games where Myles gets a lot of blocks and he suffocates the offence. Then there are games where he gets a lot of blocks and the offence keeps chugging along as if nothing's happened."
"Turner is switchable more than Rudy. I think Rudy provides a lot of value and has been better defensively than Myles in the past but this season Myles is blowing him away from the games I‚Äôve watched. Blocks shots, plays passing lanes, rotated from weak side, and just alters a ton of looks in the paint consistently. He‚Äôs genuinely looking much improved and very good"
Oh buddy. Don‚Äôt be so naive. There was a lot of anti Turner stuff all over Celtics twitter. Some Celtics press members were tweeting when Myles Turner had a bad preseason game. If that isn‚Äôt anti Turner press then I don‚Äôt know what is
"A stellar performance from Malcolm Brogdon, who is playing like an All Star these last few games. Vic didn't have a great shooting night but he was still aggressive and made the effort on offense. Myles Turner continued his epic defensive run to start the season with 8 blocks, including a clutch collab block with Sabonis in the last minute of the game which helped us seal the win.   The Pacers were able to weather the storm each time the Rockets were able to close the gap after the Pacers had built a lead. John Wall was unstoppable, and he got to the rim with ease all night and was getting basically any layup he wanted. This surely would have been a different game if not for Harden's frankly terrible (by Harden standards) performance. There was no aggression from him and he took very few of those stepback threes you expect to see him take, although he did finish with 12 assists. We had 3 or 4 guys defending him all night, so those different defensive looks may have confused him or disrupted his scoring game, but I think he just didn't have it going for whatever reason last night. The Rockets bench also played very poorly.   The Pacers' biggest issue right now is rebounding. They are not a good rebounding team, and they especially give up way too many offensive boards. That is not sustainable for the season and isn't a playoff-winning formula, so they will have to get that sorted out. The Pacers rebounded better against the Rockets, but they played a team which is also a bad rebounding team, and the Rockets also used a small-ball lineup all night which may have had something to do with the Pacers' better rebounding performance.   All in all, things are going really well for the Pacers at the moment. They're winning games, and they're doing it while still missing some key players in TJ Warren and Jeremy Lamb. Doug McDermott, who has been really productive at times for us, also went out injured on Wednesday. Despite our injuries, our starters are lighting it up with great performances, bolstered by role players stepping up on any given night, like Justin Holiday, who finished with 20 points last night."
Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis are better than the bigs on your favorite team.
It's crazy that they could've had Myles Turner on the team this year
hypnotized by *tHe IdEa* of Myles Turner
"This ""idea of Myles Turner"" thing has greatly reduced my life span."
Yes but this post is saying Myles Turner has had the last three 8+ block games
Myles ‚Äúevery nephew on team subs thinks Indiana wants to dump him for a late pick‚Äù Turner
Myles ‚ÄúMyles ‚ÄúMyles ‚ÄúLuka Doncic‚Äù Turner‚Äù Turner‚Äù Turner
"&gt; Myles ""Myles ""Myles ""Smothered Chicken"" Turner"" Turner"" Turner"
"Our defense plummets when Myles is not on the floor because teams get free rein to attack Sabonis at the rim. Domas is an average man defender, but not a rim protector at all.  Warren is also prone to lapses on defense and foul trouble, so a lineup with Hayward instead of Myles would make us offensive juggernauts, but terrible on defense. The Pacers so far are very balanced on both ends, so it's ultimately a blessing that we kept Turner."
How many 44 point games does Myles Turner have this season?  If you guys had Hayward you'd be a serious contender. We're better off not giving you Hayward.
Myles turner is better than the idea of myles turner
"All game he had brogdon-oladipo- Justin holiday on him.  All amazing perimeter defenders and myles turner defending the paint. The way this team is built and playing defense this year harden isn't going to get plenty of good looks like he normally can. He made the right adjustment though and gave his team plenty of opportunities instead, so respect to him there"
Myles Turner is a better player than Myles Turner. I‚Äôll explain later
But have you heard of Myles Turner
"Myles ""Myles ""Myles Turner"" Turner"" Turner"
He‚Äôs called Myles Turner because whenever you try to score on him the ball takes a detour.
Myles Turner. Had 8 blocks again tonight
Oh maybe the guy who is leading the league in blocks ü§î Myles Turner who just had another 8 block game
ThE iDeA oF MyLeS tUrNeR iS bEtTeR tHaN MyLeS TuRnEr
If you don't like that you don't like Myles Turner basketball
Myles Turner is who Hassan Whiteside thinks he is on defense
"Myles Turner with ANOTHER 8 block game, give him the DPOY already. Our defense is putrid without him."
Myles Turner with his EIGHTH block of the night
Myles Turner could have blocked the rioters in DC today
Goga Bitadze. I expected him to make an immediate impact and give the Pacers enough confidence to trade Myles Turner.  I was wrong. He may still end up being good but it looks like a bit more of a longshot than before.
"You're right, I was moresoe talking about this scenario of just having Ben and Dray on the team, replacing Embiid with a guy like Porzingis, KAT or even Myles Turner should build a rather strong halfcourt offense if the guards are good shooters as well."
"You‚Äôre not a Center if you start beside Myles Turner, cmon"
They have done more different things but one of the fundamental approaches to the scheme is they are transparent about the fact that very few bigs in this league are actual floor spacers with real gravity the way people often claim.   Brook Lopez playing off bigs and being in the paint ‚Äú2.9ing‚Äù plus Giannis being a weak side help defender roaming is still a lot of what this defense is built on. And that comes down to leaving all these Myles Turner type bigs who people claim are floor spacers wide open because they know the vast majority of bigs even if they‚Äôd shoot 35-36% don‚Äôt actually want to take 10 3s in a game and won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where a lot of it traces back to they give up tons of 3s but the premise of the defense is built on the idea they know guys they leave open will still pass up 3s and not pay them pay for it  The personnel is made to switching in many ways and being more creative with perimeter defense. Bud finally seems to have some recognition of that although let‚Äôs see what happens from him in the playoffs

Myles Turner has made up for that
"""Through 7 games, Myles Turner is defending a league-leading 10.3 shots at the rim and holding opponents to a league-best 43.1% on those attempts.  1. Myles Turner - 43.2% on 10.3 DFGA 2. Ivica Zubac - 47.4% on 5.4  3. Rudy Gobert - 48.9% on 7.8 4. Joel Embiid - 49% on 8.2""   - from https://twitter.com/iPacersblog/status/1346537083544940544  Another helpful stat in evaluating Myles is the Pacers being 4th in OPP FG% inside of 5ft. Point is, Myles is currently playing Rudy Gobert level defense while being a legitimate 3pt threat on offense. It is early, so I understand hesitating before putting him top 10 for centers league wide. But if this trend continues, he could end up being one of the best value contracts in the league, especially in light of the albatross contract Gobert just signed."
"He's just rarely gotten the opportunity to close games. The Portland game last year was one of the few times McMillan ever let Turner close a tight game in the 4th. Obviously this situation is a touch different since Myles played out of necessity since Sabonis fouled out, but Sabonis was only playing the bulk of the 4th because Myles got 5 fouls really early in the third.   Myles can be an effective closer. It was nice to see him get the chance."
"Why is it bad for Myles Turner, one of the best shooting centers in the league, to shoot a wide open 3 while we are down 3 with only seconds left. You can't expect a more open shot than that."
Myles Turner also had 5 fouls and Sabonis fouled out.  Right now he just doesn‚Äôt have the skill set to do anything else but relentlessly attack in any event. With expanded skill set we shall see where the IQ is. Right now the decision is pretty clear.
"Same for Zion, he comes in, immediately scores and fouls out myles turner and never gets a touch after that."
"Also shoutout to Myles Turner. He had 7pts and 5 fouls when he went to the bench. Finished with 17pts, 7-11 shooting, the long 3 to send it to OT, and 2 key blocks in OT."
Myles Turner literally didn't foul out
Myles turner playing great with 5 fouls.
yea 1 play counters the 4-year plateau of Myles Turner lmao
someone make a montage of myles turner just denying 5 straight paint possessions for the pelicans
He's Myles Turner without the defense (&gt;inb4 the Turner defense jokes).  I was hoping that he'd be a great fit next to Westbrook for his spacing as you mentioned but the lack of D is bad.
I need Myles Turner on my Wizards
"Lonzo was the obvious choice. Sure, his shot was very weird and had legit concerns, but his passing and IQ was incredibly high ‚Äî too high to pass on. He was great on defense too. Plus, he actually shot it well from deep in college in terms of percentage and volume. Obviously college 3 doesnt directly translate to NBA 3, and there were legit concerns about his form, but many people were expecting him to be a 35% shooter from deep.  In hindsight, yeah, Tatum is better than Zo by a mile. But, Tatum was much more of a ‚Äúproject‚Äù at the time than Zo was. He wasnt actually a very efficient shooter in college and there were questions about his shot selection. People were also unclear about his defensive IQ because even though he racked up steals and blocks, there was doubt that it would translate completely against more athletic NBA opponents. Tatum obviously erased all of those doubts, but at the time, they were legit concerns. In fact, people were actually thinking that the Celts might pick Josh Jackson over Tatum. The Celtics knew they were taking Tatum, but media analysts were saying it was a toss up. No one really expected Tatum and Jackson to have the kind of careers they have had. Same goes for Zo ‚Äî Lonzo did not pan out as we thought he would, but he was the clear #2 pick.   As far as DLo, again, there was really no way of knowing how he would pan out. Looking at the lottery, the only players that actually wouldve been better picks were Porzingis and Booker (everyone else basically busted except for Myles Turner).  Booker was never going to go #2 or top 10 for that matter. As far as Porzingis, DLo was definitely the safer choice at the time because there were concerns about Porzingis and how he would fare in the NBA. Heck, Knicks fans didnt like the Porzingis pick ‚Äî imagine if the Lakers passed on DLo for Porzingis. The optics are better for DLo too. If DLo busts, oh well. If Porzingis busts, they would get flamed. So picking DLo was, again, the best choice at the time.  The Lakers scouted DLo and Zo well ‚Äî they judt didnt pan out. That could be an issue of our player development, but the scouting did no wrong in drafting DLo and Zo."
Myles turner is a big steph fan iirc.
"IIRC, Myles Turner also had to rework how he ran to avoid risking injury to his hips."
"This guy makes these sweeping claims about all sorts of players. He's said that siakam could be argued as top 10, that Myles Turner is a top 40 player, and that Jokic is the 6th best center in the league. Pretty sure it's a troll account."
&gt; physical force of a center.      &gt; Myles Turner      Pick one
Myles Turner sounds nice
Kat/Zion would be atrocious defensively. Someone like Myles Turner makes a lot more sense next to Zion.
"im interested to see what stone does with the 4 FRP he got in trades this offseason. if the season is going well by the trade deadline, i could see a potential trade for a solid big man (tho it also depends on whos available)  maybe if the raps arent doing great, a trade for baynes? or cody zeller? tho i dont think we've got the salary to make a zeller trade, would prob need a 3rd team. or, potentially try and swing big for myles turner  if harrison barnes wasnt on such a big contract that we cant afford, id love to pick him up too. him and wood in the front court kinda make up for each others weaknesses (outside of rebounding)"
Myles Turner is just boneless Mitchell Robinson.
"Thats some revisionist history. Myles turner was very obviously a talented player, right away. He was a big man who could shoot and block shots among the league leaders. Domantas took a bit more time to show off the skills he had and they were harder to see. He wasnt shooting from outside and absolutely was not blocking shots like myles. I dont think youll find anyone who will say domantas was a scrub and now theyre surprised, i think the logic was that the pacers had a quality back up big with a different skill set than their bonafide two way young starter with stretch potential. Nowadays its different because of how they developed but youre buggin if you think people disrespected sabonis"
Do you guys remember when the Pacers and their fans thought Myles Turner was better than Domantas Sabonis? The disrespect after everything this man has done for them
"could be someone from Indiana. Assuming 3 best are:  Sabonis, Brogdon, Oladipo, then 4th best would be Myles Turner maybe?"
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"

Rudy Gobert contract   2021 - $25.7 million  2022 - $34.8 million  2023 - $37.6 million  2024 - $40.4 million   2025 - $43.2 million  2026 - $46.6 million   Myles Turner contract   2021 - $18 million  2022 - $18 million  2023 - $18 million    What the fuck are we even talking about exactly? Rudy Gobert is one of the most overpaid players on the planet. The Utah Jazz signed their NEVER EVER GOING TO WIN A RING warrant when they extended him for that much money. If Rudy Gobert is your 4th or 5th highest paid player you can absolutely win a ring... but if he‚Äôs your 1st or 2nd highest paid player you aren‚Äôt winning shit. He‚Äôs a one dimensional big man who can‚Äôt shoot a lick.   He‚Äôs also a gaping asshole so ya.  I just don‚Äôt get how anyone can act like that dude deserves 40 million dollars per season for the next half decade. Nearly 190 million dollars guaranteed lmao.  The only thing that makes any sense is they resigned him so he‚Äôs easier to trade..? But not many teams are dumb enough to take on that bloated embarrassing contract.   They need to trade him before Mitch decides he wants a trade of his own
Idk who you‚Äôve been talking too about Myles Turner but I assure you this is not a common opinion
"Right lol where was his greatness at In the bubble and playoffs? Myles, TJ, and Brogdon are just as important. Especially turner who covers for his lackluster defense constantly"
"I wish we would‚Äôve gotten Wood, but I don‚Äôt care at all about missing out on Myles Turner. I‚Äôd rather go with the trio of Thompson,Theis and Rob Williams"
The disrespect to Myles Turner.. obligatory ‚ÄúY‚Äôall mothafuckas don‚Äôt watch us play‚Äù
"Even when not at full force, you still have lineups that probably could end up a top 2 seed in either conference. The much maligned world cup team from last time could have a starting lineup of Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Myles Turner with a pretty solid bench. They may not have the upper-end star power to match the elite teams, but that's a damn good lineup if given time to fully gel."
"Myles Turner isn't the ideal stretch big, although Brook Lopez does fit the bill or Ibaka, Chris Boucher, PJ Washington.   Reaches would be John Collins and Wiseman, who surprisingly has range."
"I think after seeing how their entire defense collapsed without Myles Turner in the past few games, Pacers won't even pick up the phone if that is all the Pelicans are offering"
Brook Lopez or Myles Turner
"&gt; myles turner isnt one of the best defenders in the nba, and imo he‚Äôs a liability.  hahahahaha"
"myles turner isnt one of the best defenders in the nba, and imo he‚Äôs a liability. he never made an all defense team ffs."
&gt; Oh so he must have made an All-NBA defense team then huh?  What a shitty argument. Myles Turner has never made All-Defense yet has finished top 5 in DPOY and is straight-up one of the best defenders in the NBA.
I wish we can go back in time and redo the Pelicans off season and have them trade for Myles Turner back when he was clearly available.  Adams is fine but Myles Turner is better at everything but rebounding.
It‚Äôs what happens when we don‚Äôt have Myles Turner
"Myles Turner wouldn't help us against Embiid, look at their H2H numbers."
Bam is also doing very well.  Same with Myles Turner.  Really those 4 should all make the team but realistically it'll only be 2.  That being said the game is cancelled this year so who cares.  Only first time all stars or contract stuff really matters for that.
"Lonzo/Kira Lewis Jr, NAW/Josh Hart, Ingram/,  Zion/Melli, Adams/Hayes.  Once Bledsoe and JJ Reddick are sold to contenders, I want this team to pick up the pace, look at getting more of a floor spacing defensive Center (Myles Turner), and most importantly the point of this season and even next season is to stay healthy and grow together."
"Doesn't matter if he's trash. He should be taking advantage of the freedom he's had for the past 3 years. Dude got the game winner over Myles Turner last season, and has shown ability to dunk/layup off the glass."
"I guess so. But is Whiteside a good defender? Not really.   Now Myles Turner this season has me looking at him differently. I thought he was just a shot blocker, but his defense looks better overall and playing him w/ Sabonis is actually working."
"Lmao you have Myles Turner at 4th in DPOY goes to show how much of a filthy casual you are  And Drummond in Top 2? Come on now bruv, Drummond is not even the best defensive player on his team"
"Prime matchup for him. Went from playing Myles turner, Gasol, and AD to playing a LaMarcus Aldridge with cement feet."
Not one mention for Myles Turner?
I remember Myles Turner (when he was calling the rising all-star game last year) saying that he wears that for a very personal reason.
Myles Turner DPOY chances improves even when he isn't on the court
I've been hoping for Myles Turner to end up on the Mavs for a while now. Texas grown and impactful on both ends of the floor. He's really turned it up a notch on defense this year in addition to being a decent floor spacer. This season he's been having pretty much erases that possibility lol
I don‚Äôt think Lack of Myles Turner added to his explosion. KP was the only big on the floor and was going up as Sabonis.
Did not expect to win this game but I think this shows how good Myles Turner has been defensively this year. DPOY front runner for sure
Myles turner IS the dpoy. Pacers D is god awful without him.
Give Myles Turner the DPOY trophy right now.
"Myles Turner, but it‚Äôs good for him. But there‚Äôs so many examples to this question honestly. The league is filled with great players just needing opportunity."
Myles Turner
"It's like complaining about Myles Turner averaging 1.1 assists per game, it's not his main job"
It‚Äôs literally just Kyrie  If that happened to Myles Turner or Donovan Mitchell the reactions would be different
Myles turner fuming rn
Cough Myles. Turner cough.  Although I doubt Indy trades him now.  Had a chance in the off-season though.
"We can‚Äôt even go 5 games without another injury to one of our main guys. 13 games in and we are already down: Victor Oladip: (traded for Caris Levert), Caris Levert: Out for an indefinite amount of time due to a mass on his kidney. TJ Warren: has been out all but I think 3 or 4 games and won‚Äôt be back for the next 2 months or more. Jeremy Lamb: Out since last year with a torn ACL, he should be returning soon. And now the latest one, Myles Turner(leading shot blocker in the league and a top 2-3 candidate for DPOY): fracture in his hand, out anywhere from a couple weeks-?              We literally can‚Äôt EVER stay healthy long enough to see how great we could be. Our top 8-9 guys can stand up to any teams 8-9 guys but we can‚Äôt ever see it because multiple players are hurt at the same time"
Myles Turner would have made more sense to trade for. Space the floor on offense. Adams is just in Zion‚Äôs way. I agree tho Bledsoe was not a good choice either
Am I wrong to think of Boucher as the new Myles Turner? I've watched much more Boucher than I have Turner and this is sort of what I hear about Turner. Good 3 point shooter and shot blocker but pretty limited otherwise?
"lol enlighten me then. What moves can he make to replace the team's best defender while also doing something about this new log jam at guard? I suppose Myles Turner is available, but that 1st round series illustrates how much of a downgrade that'd be (not to mention he ain't half the playmaker). But I suppose Kyrie giving us playoff Goran with fancy dribbles will make up for it."
"We don‚Äôt have LeVert, TJ Warren, Jeremy Lamb, Myles Turner"
"Lol as you continue to deflect and insult, sorry you can‚Äôt lose an argument and take it lightly, man. Have fun being mediocre with Myles Turner and Sabonis. Maybe this year you can make it to the 2nd round."
Myles Turner and a roleplayer or two ?   Would you Pacers folks be okay with it ?
I think that Myles Turner and Nurkic both fractured their hands/wrist on the same play.
&gt; Thompson is the difference maker in the postseason   Yes because Myles Turner has such an illustrious post season resume.
"Bruh I've had to watch a couple of his games He was blocking everything left right and center. Gave me fucking PTSD. His shot blocking seemed to me on par with that of renowned shot blockers, like Myles turner. All of this is the eye test though, haven't really paid attention at his box score"
we missed out on myles turner this past summer too. they offered us a first pick and myles turner for hayward and dude still refused. at least we received a tpe but i would rather get turner and a first rounder ffs.
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he‚Äôs back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he‚Äôll bounce back soon enough"
"Pacers get worse, Myles Turner is probably DPOY this year"
The. Pacers. Are. Not. Trading. Myles. Turner.  Look at how bad the defense was yesterday vs the Clippers. And the Pacers are already so deep at forward.
Chuck‚Äôs right. Nets lack of size is gonna hurt them in the playoffs. They aren‚Äôt as sound on defense as the Death Lineup Warriors. Kyrie for Myles Turner + stuff - who says no?
"I'm with you homie, I'm knee-deep in Myles Coins and I think he deserves it this year - shout out to Capela too, dude is rocking a +8 on DefensiveRaptor right now, but I'd still give it to Turner, who's been just insane."
"Myles ""Turn up"" Turner is in the spot right now in my opinion. Adios Goburt"
Myles turner may get 1st team. Id take him and davis currently above gobert and embid and giannis
Myles Turner. He leads the league in blocks by a mile
Myles Turner
 Myles Turner  is gonna win DPOY
Myles Turner &amp; Andre Drummond snubs
no myles turner?
Thats basically what the Pacers are. Sabonis is Jokic lite next to Myles Turner for rim protecting and floor spreading
So uh why didn‚Äôt the Celtics want Myles Turner? And why would the Pacers have offered him?
Myles Turner looked invisible out there
Myles Turner helped his DPOY campaign tonight and didn‚Äôt even play.
I say do a Michael Porter for Myles Turner trade.  This just seems like a trade the Pacers make. Porter is a great talent and the Pacers would find a way to make up for his defensive shortcomings.   Turner is an elite rim protector and you would think he plays with a player with a similar Jokic skill set in Sabonis with no problem.   I‚Äôm not a salary cap guru but I figure both are probably similar unless Turner signed some deal.
"Denver is a good candidate IMO to go against the grain and run a two big lineup. Maybe a trade for Myles Turner, and then just play a glacial pace"
"Our defense looks lost af without Turner, they're really used to channeling people down the baseline like Sabonis did on the wing there, except usually they are chanelling them to Myles, not Brogdon lol, so I think that gives it the appearance of them not even trying on some plays"
Oh so that's why we pay Myles Turner...
"Myles Turner, offensively at least. Hoping he stays consistent under some new coaching."
Myles Turner and TJ Warren.  Also Caris LeVert.
I thought a lot of Celtics fans wanted him pretty bad when the trade rumors went around. The entire offseason was just people making trade suggestions on how to get Myles Turner for a bench player and a second round pick
&gt; What about protecting the rim?  Shots being Contested by myles turner in the paint are going on at like the low 40s percentage wise. So yeah it's not just blocks
Myles Turner would lose his shit in a presser lmao  For real tho to all you sports betters out there: Turner is +4000 odds for DPOY which is insane to me. I'd throw some money down that I didn't mind losing on those odds. 20 bucks would payout 820.
De'Aaron Fox or Myles Turner - both really young players who are constantly overlooked.
"Griffin has built around them poorly. He‚Äôs got Lonzo playing 2 guard and asked to be the second best shooter because for some reason he didn‚Äôt try and flip Bledsoe somewhere else this offseason. And I love Adams but everybody knew his lack of spacing would be a huge issue. He coulda went after Myles Turner instead. A Lonzo, JJ, Ingram, Zion, Myles Turner starting lineup or something like it woulda made MUCH more sense around Ingram and Zion"
Trade Kyrie for Caris Levert and Myles Turner
They convinced themselves that Theis is better. One of their beat reporters tweeted his stats halfway through a preseason game this year to shit on him. MYLES TURNER IS OVERRATED in bold type was one of the highest voter comments on their thread when we played. They hate the man when he did absolutely nothing to them lol
"When he's not on the floor, our defense falls apart. He single handedly raises the defensive ratings of players like McDermott and Sabonis, who are not normally plus defenders. That seems pretty impactful to me. He has optimized his role as a rim protector and floor spacer; if the team needs him to be more, he can, but it isn't necessary at this point. As for the team's mediocrity, that's what having a coach who can't make adjustments and a lot of injuries will do to a team. In fact, against Miami in the playoffs last year, Turner was by far our best player. But, I know that no one watches Pacers games, so I have to keep reading comments like ""The idea of Myles Turner is better than Myles Turner"" and ""He's a disappointing player"". But that's all okay, because this year he's been nothing short of spectacular for the Pacers; I can only hope that his and the Pacers' continued success will get people to evaluate the Pacers and their players in a more thorough and balanced way."
They wanted the idea of Myles Turner
"Myles Turner is the best example of why looking at a stat sheet is not enough to judge a player. He had the lowest usage rate of all the starters the last two years; he never got the ball in a scoring position. On defense, he would protect the rim while the other big (Domas, Thad Young) gets the rebounds. Could he be a better rebounder? Absolutely. And he could put up big numbers by demanding the ball, but he didn't/doesn't because that's not his role on the team. Old Nate misused him and with New Nate, there are enough scoring options (Brogdon and Sabonis) that he doesn't need to be that kind of player. He's the defensive anchor that provides spacing on offense and is the backbone of the Pacers.   tl;dr: He could put up 20/10/2, but that's not his role"
"While I'd love it for the nostalgia, that's probably never gonna happen.  Harden already knows what playing with WB and no big men is like.  If anything, I'm hoping they trade Kyrie for a decent center to help them in the postseason.    I bet (if they can get Kyrie to return and play well for a month to drive his stock up) that they have a chance at someone like Myles Turner or Vucevic (and maybe a first or some expirings to match contracts).    Who knows, maybe Utah (read: Mitchell) gets tired of Gobert's shit again and they're willing to trade him.  If that falls through even someone like Clint Capela would help.  As is, DJ isn't gonna help them against any of the elite centers, and definitely not against AD."
&gt; Myles Turner is coming off a 2 year slump  ???? Did I miss something?
I'm talking about him as the defensive guy putting up 16 and 7 for two seasons while being the third option. Even someone like myles turner could be that. Given that he's a high energy guy who would get dimes and open looks.
kyrie for myles turner who says no
Yeah because Capela is overrated. Kyrie for Myles Turner and whichever Holiday brother that‚Äôs better on defense? Yes.
"Adams has been the 2nd best player on the whole roster for the Pelicans this season so agree to disagree. Myles Turner is shooting like 28% from 3 this season too, IDK why y'all act like he's KAT from downtown or anything remotely comparable lol."
"And conversely, Myles Turner is coming off a 2 year slump so it's likely players aren't taking him as seriously.  That said, he's cleaning up right now and I like to see it. I like Myles."
Oh my you're stupid Myles Turner has been incredible this year but then again you're a salty Celtics fan. Not surprised
Myles Turner
Awesome comment.   I definitely drafted Myles Turner in fantasy this year because I figured there‚Äôd be some secret sauce from the new Nate.
"they shouldn't have gotten Adams in the first place, Myles Turner and Al Horford were both available and both fit better next to Zion."
Myles Turner is so good.  Obligatory lebron dunk attempt block: https://youtu.be/UlJBkjTJ6W0
"Prime Shaq got locked down by a 6‚Äô9‚Äù Ben Wallace. Imagine him going against the likes AD, Lebron, Giannis, Embiid, Draymond, Kawhi, Myles Turner. He‚Äôd be lucky to average 25/10 let alone 30/15."
Andrew Wiggins and Dort will be all defense first or second team.  Not dpoy because it‚Äôs hard to beat AD/Gobert/Myles Turner or Drummond.

Routine warm up for Myles Turner
"You‚Äôre right in the sense that the award has basically come down to best defender on the best defense, which IMO is kinda stupid. But our Drating with Rudy on (103.3) is better than Indy‚Äôs with Turner on (106.3). At that point I just don‚Äôt see the argument for Myles."
So I‚Äôll just go with the 3 advanced stats I will list every time since 2000 someone was in the top 3 in all of the advanced stats  2019-2020 Giannis DPOY  2018-2019 Giannis 1st Team  2016-2017 Draymond DPOY  2015-2016 Kawhi DPOY  2013-2014 Joakim Noah DPOY  2010-2011 Kevin Garnett 1st Team  2009-2010 Dwight Howard DPOY  2008-2009 Lebron James 1st Team  2007-2008 Kevin Garnett DPOY  2006-2007 Tim Duncan 1st Team Ben Wallace 2nd Team  2005-2006 Ben Wallace DPOY  2003-2004 Kevin Garnett 1st team  Tim Duncan 1st Team Ben Wallace 2nd Team  2002-2003 Ben Wallace DPOY  2001-2002 Ben Wallace DPOY  This feat has been achieved in the last 14 years 9 of those times that person won DPOY  Every time the person made 1st team unless someone at their position also was top 3 in all of the advanced defensive stats  In summary if the season ended today historically speaking myles turner would at least be on the first team
You have to give it to Myles Turner. He‚Äôs been the cog for that over performing INdy team
"Myles turner is in the top 3 for all defensive advanced stats (DBPM, DWS and DRat) is leading by like double in BPG and is top 20 in SPG so my guess is if the season ended today it would be him"
Myles Turner
"There were a couple reports during the offseason, nothing was eve ""proven"" so I'm not sure if I believe it myself. However, over the last year there have been rumblings of other issues behind the scenes like him not getting along with teammates, his sister (or cousin maybe, i don't remember) took shots at Myles Turner over Twitter this past offseason, and supposedly he was doing his own thing for rehab and the like without telling the Pacers."
"Yeah, but if they were C's fans they also can't tell the difference between Myles Turner and Tristan Thompson."
Is simmons value really that low around the league?   I still dont believe the rumors over the summer that there were no takers for myles turner.   But ben simmons not being tradeable (for adequate assets) is a whole other level of absurdity.  I really think this is just spite by a terrible owner
"Schroder, Duncan Robinson, Smart, RoCo, Myles Turner"
I'm guessing it's this  &gt;No disrespect to Myles Turner because personally I think he‚Äôs underrated and would would be a great contribution to any team but why can‚Äôt the man rebound? Is it just a lack of effort or does Sabonis just take em all from his? Maybe because he tends to goes for blocks that limits his rebounding
"Whoa. They are dominating us right now. Their hand is on every ball. Myles Turner especially, damn."
"&gt; McConnell hasn‚Äôt completely counted out his chances of dunking before retirement, though he doesn‚Äôt seem to think it‚Äôs likely. He prefers being on the other side of an alley-oop pass. ‚ÄúMaybe once before my career‚Äôs over, if I get a fast break, maybe I‚Äôll get Myles [Turner] to lift me up and dunk. You know, when I‚Äôm like 33 or 34,‚Äù McConnell says. ‚ÄúIt would have to be no one crosses half court and no-effort-from-the-other-team-type deal where I could possibly do something.‚Äù  Cute as fuck"
They could have had Myles Turner and Doug McDermott for Hayward instead of losing him for nothing.  They were not interested since they thought Tristan Thompson was a better fit for the price.  Turner is going to be top 5 in defensive player of the year voting / the clear starting 5 and McDermott would be the first guy off the bench for them.  It‚Äôs an egregious mistake.
"I might be reading your comment wrong, but it seems to me you think I'm talking about young star talent? I'm talking youngish like 25-27 that are role players. We had plenty of picks to pull off a trade or two for bench types. There's been multiple reports of how it's hard to trade with Boston. So there were definitely some serious conversations that have gone down the last few seasons that other teams have backed out on because they weren't dumb enough to get fleeced. But the Myles Turner situation is a perfect example of us screwing up. The reports from all sides have said he was ours if we said yes, but we asked for more, allowing Charlotte to swoop in. Stuff like that has been hurting us for multiple years at this point of trying to take the team to that next step. Hell, I would have been happy to seriously target Derrick Rose as 6th man, but he went to Detroit for cheap and played pretty well for them."
"If we ignore talent levels and look at more playing styles, Turner gets compared a lot to Rudy Gobert because of the shot-blocking but really Theis is his best comparison in the league. Turner and Theis have very similar strengths and weaknesses.   They're both undersized defenders who catch lobs and shoot 3s. They both get bullied by bigger bodies.    &gt;Can Myles deal with Bam? I‚Äôve never really paid attention to that.   So there are 4 key matchups to look at.  Turner has done incredibly well on Bam and actually won their matchup in the playoffs, outperforming Bam on both ends.  However, looking at the other key matchups, this is how Turner's performed this season:  Opponent| FG%|Points|  Rebounds | Blocks | Minutes | +/- ---|---|---| ----|----|----|---- MIL| 33.3|3|  2 | 1| 22:51 | -32 PHI| 16.7|9 | 5 | 1 | 29:22 | -5 BRK| 25.0 | 3| 3 | 1 | 25:41 | -18   And this is one of the big issues with the Turner talks. r/nba has spent the season pretending like Turner would solve our issues but really, we already have a guy who plays similar to Turner and against the top 3 seeds in the East, Theis has actually been better.  I liked Turner for Boston because I like Theis for Boston and Turner is younger, has a higher ceiling and Theis is expiring in the offseason. However, it's wrong to think Turner would solve our problems. He would be more of what we already have.  Theis and Turner have too much overlap to be on the same team."
"Danny‚Äôs super up and down. To me he‚Äôs like a half-baked, directionless Morey in terms of his willingness to make moves. You‚Äôd be hard pressed a couple years ago to say Boston wasn‚Äôt one of the top situations in the league and that‚Äôs a direct result of his management post big 3. The Brooklyn trade and the Tatum-Fultz trade were absolute ace moves. Drafting outside of the top 5 and outside the lottery has been terrible and his Morey like ‚Äúasset accumulation ‚Äú strategy and treatment of players as assets has hamstrung their ability to make this team better. They have little that fits outside Tatum-Brown-Smart, he got too cute trying to squeeze a good year out of Kemba then trade him (breaking news to him that everyone else knew Kemba‚Äôs on the small guard hard downslide too), the Myles Turner fuckup, dumping everyone‚Äôs homie IT and pissing off the leagues marquee FAs. He‚Äôs really screwed it the last couple of years.  I‚Äôm not surprised Celtics fans are coming around on Stevens, he got more goodwill than any coach in the league for being a good Xs and Os guy and looking like a good Boston man I guess, but his man management has been pretty sus since the Kyrie time. Boston media wanted to pin any and everything on Kyrie but I never saw how Brad‚Äôs reputation came out of that unscathed. Ok, now we know Brad can‚Äôt handle having dudes like Kyrie, Rozier, Marcus Morris on his team and he‚Äôs got Khemistry Kemba and young agreeable guys and shits not going right."
"&gt;I don't think people actually know who Myles Turner is. He's an undersized 5 who gets doesn't create shots for himself.   Im well aware, Im not a big Myles Turner guy in general. This isnt an argument of ""Danny is a complete moron for not wanting Myles Turner"" it's an argument about why are you turning around and offering $10 mil to Tristan Thompson then if you decide you dont value the C position. None of those issues you listed TT was ever going to fix other than maybe post defense which is at the bottom of the list in terms of what's most important.   &gt;Turner wouldn't fix that problem, he would be part of that problem.  One thing Turner would help with is per CTG the Celtics have gone from 9th in terms of opponent FG% at the rim last yr to 25th this year. What he can help is all relative, Celtics are 9th right now in defense. If you put Turner on the team maybe its like 4th. Does it fix their offensive issues no not really but it gives you a bigger margin for error.   Beyond that I dont largely disagree their issues come down to the offense being average, lacking depth/good players, Kemba and never getting to the rim. A number of those issues you listed existed last year also and didnt prevent the season they had. They just lack enough good players."
"That's a very weird takeaway.   Turner wouldn't fix that problem, he would be part of that problem. Here's what Brad's quote would sound like if we had Turner instead of Thompson.  &gt;""I've said this all year: One of the challenges of our team is that you get past our best perimeter players, and the next probably three best guys as far as production goes so far on our team are, at first blush, 5s,"" Stevens said.  It's the exact same.   I don't think people actually know who Myles Turner is. He's an undersized 5 who gets doesn't create shots for himself. Brad saying we have too many of those guys isn't address by having another one.     Problems we have| Problems Turner isn't fixing ---|--- Shot creation| Shot creation Bench scoring | Bench scoring Paint penetration|Paint penetration Post playmaking|Post playmaking Post defence against bigger bodies|Post defence against bigger bodies Consistent perimeter defence |Consistent perimeter defence  Ball movement|Ball movement No off-ball shooters who can shoot on the move |No off-ball shooters who can shoot on the move  A lack of consistent toughness and effort |A lack of consistent toughness and effort etc.| etc.  I know he's finally havign a good season, but if you were to make a venn diagram of all our problems and all the areas where Turner is weak, it wouldn't even be a venn diagram it would just be a circle."
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
"&gt;""I've said this all year: One of the challenges of our team is that you get past our best perimeter players, and the next probably three best guys as far as production goes so far on our team are, at first blush, 5s,"" Stevens said.  Why saying no to Myles Turner but deciding to then spend your $9-10 mil APY on Tristian Thompson was always weird to me"
They could really use a 4/small ball 5 that can shoot and block shots! A guy like Myles turner!  Oh wait ..
Why Myles turner? There‚Äôs other taller players on his team he‚Äôs outrebounding
"Myles Turner has committed the most shooting fouls in the league, Rudy has committed the 99th most. If that doesn‚Äôt tell you which one camps in the lane and hunts blocks idk what will"
You know who'd be a great fit on the Celtics it's Myles Turner!
Myles turner you could argue is a better shot blocker
Imagine Rozier and Myles Turner on the Celtics right now jeez
"Klay is legitimately one of the very last rotation players that I would expect to get a quadruple double. The guy barely even dribbles a lot of games. He's averaged 2.3 assists over the course of his career playing the entirety of it next to Steph and a few years of it next to KD and Steph. He's averaged 3.5 rebounds and it's not like the Warriors have ever had some Drummond/Capela type who just grabbed all the rebounds. He's never even had a triple double. He's only ever had 4 double doubles in 615 games. And he's a good defender but he's averaged less than 1 steal a game over his career, his best season was 1.1. Dame isn't much better, only one triple double ever and only averages about a steal per game too. Even Steph, KD, etc don't get many triple doubles. Harden could obviously get a triple double with ease; his best chance for a quadruple double if he got lucky + gambled on like every pass for a game to get steals.             I think Draymond is most likely if any current player were to get one. Guys like Sabonis, Jokic would have a ""good"" (relatively) shot as well. After that, I think it would be big men who randomly get lucky and get 10 assists. It's a lot more likely for Mitchell Robinson, Myles Turner to get 10 assists during a 10 block game than it is for a lot of other guys to randomly get 10 blocks or steals when that's just not one of their skills.          Also I do think plenty of players care about stuff like this. We know for sure some guys won't heave at the end of quarters to protect their %s. I've definitely seen stories of guys talking to their home scorers to make sure they get borderline assists. Westbrook definitely cares about triple doubles. Definitely seen a lot of guys get a little antsy to grab the rebound or force a pass when they're at 8 or 9."
"For some stupid reason, the people on the Pels sub wanted nothing to do with him. Kept seeing people write ""the idea of Myles Turner is better than what he actually is"" and they went ahead and trade for then extended Adams lmfao."
Nope not really he‚Äôs perfectly fine as a paint protector. Which is something we desperately need. Guards torch us because guys like Zo and Bledsoe are absolutely terrible dodging the picks or getting through it. Myles Turner isn‚Äôt improving that.
If Myles Turner was as available as people said then Griff really fucked up
"Yes, we definitely needed a Center but we also coulda either just kept Jrue and brought Favors back (The team actually played really well last year once Zion and Favors were both healthy and in the lineup) or they coulda traded Jrue for a package either involving Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen who both would fit the timetable and the team better than what they got"
I think the perfect complement next to Zion would be Myles Turner - elite defense and respectable 3P%. Not sure what it would take to get him though
"The twitter suspect, in 2045, explaining a framed $100 bill to his grandson:  ""and here is the gift Myles Turner insisted I have for inspiring him to play in the NBA"""
This is just flat out lies from a complete Turner stan with an Inferiority complex to Domas.  It is in fact the OPPOSITE in game threads.  This dude actually replied to a post last game saying   ‚ÄúYou here every game thread white knighting Sabonis and shitting on Myles‚Äù   I replied   ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt said not a single damn negative thing towards Myles at all. In fact I‚Äôve been pumping his tires all game. Since you make such a claim go ahead and find one where I shit on Myles and post it. This dude is a flat out liar‚Äù  I even had another huge Turner fan chime in and BACK ME.   Dude stop spewing you‚Äôre absolute garbage over here telling lies. Turner is awesome. This doesn‚Äôt mean you got to be a bitter little bi when Domas gets praise.  Domas at one point had 29/14/5 in the third Q and these clowns are like bench him.   F outta here with those lies.
I'd go  Dame/Jaylen Brown/Mikal Bridges/Bam Adebayo/Myles Turner  Bench: Gary Trent/OG/George Hill/Dwight Howard
It‚Äôs hilarious how often Myles Turner stans find any reason they can to criticize Sabonis. Turner doesn‚Äôt do well? Let‚Äôs criticize Sabonis. Turner does well? Let‚Äôs criticize Sabonis.
"Invest that .01 into Bitcoin   The day Myles Turner retires, cash out"
IIRC when you sign up you put your first and last name and it gives you a suggested user of something like PJ-Washington. He might have just sent the request to Myles-Turner and got lucky that Myles was first to sign up with his name and didn't bother to make a custom user name.
"Myles Turner is a nerd, too. Loves Star Wars and LEGO‚Äôs. I love him."
"- Offer Harris for Myles Turner and pray the Pacers accept it, throw in Shamet to sweeten the deal  - Not an elite rim protector, but Lamarcus Aldridge is at least a big body they can throw in the paint and can be got for Harris + filler  - Bucks fans have been wanting to trade Brook Lopez, it‚Äôs possible they can make a run at him  - Also not elite, but a deal with Steven Adams might benefit both teams  Just to spitball a few names. I may have exaggerated the amount of true elite rim protectors on the market, but they definitely need a big body when their main competition in the east are Embiid and Giannis"
Myles Turner.
Drummond would have to buy in hard in not taking shots.  Also Drummond's defense isn't great. The start of this year has been the only time it's been relatively good. McGee would be a better get for them than Drummond honestly or Dwight as you wouldn't have to give up Harris.  In terms of best non-star for them it's easily Myles Turner.
Forget dimes Myles Turner dropping Pennies on the league
"Great feet, great lateral mobility, high BBIQ, high defensive motor, he's insanely durable, he's also great at recovering when he gets blown by, and he has pretty active hands, plus he *never* fouls. He's 2nd in blocked shots at 2.7/game, but in the 103rd in shooting fouls committed. To put it into perspective, Myles Turner leads the NBA in blocks, blocks 3.5 shots per game and *leads the league in shooting fouls committed*. That's 26 shooting fouls versus 64 over the course of the season. A difference of about 30pts over the season assuming whoever they foul shoots league average from the line."
"&gt; Romeo was absolute trash even when he was healthy, even when he was in the G League.  Nah, he was pretty promising. He's a very underrated defender and outplayed Thybulle in the 1st round.  &gt;And notice how you left out passing on Myles Turner and McDermott, that's the real inexcusable move.  1. Hayward decided to pass.  2. The people who think Turner would solve our problems don't understand our problems."
"Romeo was absolute trash even when he was healthy, even when he was in the G League.  Grant Williams was a decent at best pick, nothing more.  And notice how you left out passing on Myles Turner and McDermott, that's the real inexcusable move. Literally chose a trade exception over an elite rim protector that can shoot 3s and a high level bench shooter/scorer."
"Turner commits 3.6 fouls a game, whilst not good, Simmons commits 3.2 a game. Giannis and Dray 3.1 a game. Lowry 3.2 a game. Brown 3 a game.      They're all bad defenders too I guess. Gobert being an outlier doesn't not make Myles elite of defense."
"Agreed there's no chance.  But if they were to, I could see a solid three team trade involving the Pacers.  Portland out: CJ. Portland receives: TJ Warren, Myles Turner, Indiana Pacers lottery protected 1st round pick"
"Romeo looks like a bust, Grant Williams is a mediocre role player at best, Aaron Nesmith looks terrible right now but hopefully turns it around, passing on Myles Turner and McDermott was absolutely inexcusable."
"Stay patient. They're not winning this year. Look at the sixers and how patience and little tweaks are paying off.  Sure, it might take another off-season or two, but don't make some crazy move pretending like this team is challenging for the title this year.  They fucked up not snagging Myles Turner, maybe, but it's not a disaster.  Still all about the Jay Team and Smart and how far each of those guys can develop."
Myles Turner is already doing exactly what he's best at.  I think he'd be a lot worse without Sabonis there.
Myles Turner Zion Williamson 3&amp;D wing 3&amp;D wing De'Aron Fox maybe?  But just a stretch 5 next to Lonzo Hart Ingram Zion might be enough too.
"Myles Turner is best when locked like this. When he tries to do more than cleaning glass and getting blocks, he starts doing stupid things."
Myles turner is basically a perfect fit as a center for Simmons too
Maybe a little if it unlocks Myles Turner.
"Your ideal roster should probably have at least one all-star on it.  You're going to take away Brandon Ingram, the closest thing to an all-star, and replace him with guys that are the ones that you live with until you can find something better (plus Myles Turner)."
Baguette Biyombo &gt; Myles Turner
Myles Turner? Please explain lol.
"Nope. I don't think he would make it over Embiid, Bam, Myles turner, or Nikola V. of the magic."
"I didn‚Äôt see the game, but how does Myles Turner get 2 Rebounds in 30 minutes?"
myles turner isnt getting dpoy  gobert will win easily
If Myles Turner gets DPOY for committing the most shooting fouls then the award permanently loses all credibility. If you can't play defense without fouling are you really a good defender?
I know this isn't the point but who are these Pacers fans that know so much about our roster? No disrespect but I can barely find the time to watch my team's own damn games.   I know you guys are having a good season and you've got Myles Turner. I'm pretty sure he's a good player. That's all I got.
since when are people worried about myles turner
"Both Bam and Vucecic started at C majority, if not, all of this year. Sabonis started next to Myles Turner, unless you‚Äôre telling me Myles Turner started at PF, and Sabonis is playing Center."
Myles Turner psychically altered the shot juuuuust enough
"Jokic, embiid, towns, gobert, Myles turner, and vucevic I would rate over him"
"Embiid, Jokic, Bam, Vucecic - whose the 5th? Myles Turner? I‚Äôm probably missing someone."
Every team in the league wants to trade for Myles Turner.
They should take a look at trading for Myles Turner if he becomes available. He‚Äôd be a great fit next to Zion
DLo over Booker and Porzingis. And Myles Turner who just may be probably more valuable than DLo.
I still don‚Äôt want Myles Turner. Anyone who thinks Theis has been a problem this season is delusional.
"Wow, what homers, have they even heard of Myles Turner?"
Didnt the pacers offer Myles Turner and a first?
"And DJ Augustin, Myles Turner, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, and Tristan Thompson."
I don‚Äôt really know how you can expect anything else when Ainge‚Äôs strategy for the past two off-seasons is run the idea of trading for Myles Turner through Boston sports personalities and scoff when other teams decline to get fleeced
That quote confirms Ainge could have had Myles Turner if he wanted. Even if you got nothing else how do you *not* do that? Turner is exactly what the Celtics need. This is a fireable offense imo
"Totally fine list. I have Embiid and Jokic on the same tier at the top, but there‚Äôs a good case for either. I think Gobert‚Äôs better than KAT right now, and Bam has a case as well. We also just haven‚Äôt seen much of KAT in a while, so it‚Äôs tougher to judge.  Just struck me how, but Sabonis isn‚Äôt really a defensible guy to leave off. I‚Äôd probably put him at 6 or 7, roughly even with Vooch. I‚Äôd have Ayton fall off my list, and I‚Äôd be between Myles Turner and Nurk for that 10th spot.  Wood probably needs to stay at this level longer to deserve being on this level, but I don‚Äôt have a problem with it, he‚Äôs really good. I just think he hasn‚Äôt been at this level long enough for people to take a super critical look at what his flaws are."
No nurkic. Either Drummond or Myles Turner. Probably Turner
No. He wanted Hayward for an actual asset that would help the Celtics. Not Myles Turner. Oladipo or Warren would have helped the Celtics much more than Turner would have.
"i don't blame him for anything, i was just saying that in no way is Danny Ainge in consideration for executive of the year. You don't win that award by trotting out a less talented team than last year, and Boston is less talented. Just look at their record compared to last year.  The Myles Turner trade or lack thereoff is just a cherry on top of the argument againt him."

"Tell this to the rest of the brethren in /r/bostonceltics who insist that Ainge couldn't have gotten Turner because Hayward was going to Charlotte.   Zach Lowe said it himself when he said ""if the Celtics wanted Myles Turner on their team, they could've had Myles Turner on their team"""
"Celtics fans saying that Ainge was right because Myles Turner is a negative asset. The young, All-Defense-level Center who can shoot 3s is a negative asset for a team that needs a Center üòÇ"
I remember someone telling me that Tristan Thompson was as good as Myles Turner.
They essentially gave up 2 seconds for the right to give up more picks for a player that‚Äôs gonna be worse than Myles Turner.
"You love to see Myles Turner flourishing under Nate B, back to the TOP3 DPOY form."
"And they ended up with nothing. Well there is that TPE that celtics fans think is gonna solve all their problems. Feel like people forget that the TPE itself isn't worth anything, Celtics still have to give out something of value. Whereas they could have gotten Myles Turner and Doug McDermott essentially for free."
"Furthermore, it was reported that the reason the Celtics didn't take Indiana's offer was: ""ESPN's Zach Lowe recently suggested the Celtics weren't very high on Turner,""  Myles Turner has gone on to have an elite defensive season this year."
Sad to lose Drummond in fantasy for a bit...need my Myles Turner to to turn up
"You talking about a guy who had a chance to get Myles turner for free but got greedy and ended up with no one Oof, I feel your pain man"
"The problem for Celtics:  \- Kemba is a ball dominant PG who isn't a great playmaker or passer. He need a ball to be useful on court and he's basically take away a balls from Brown and Tatum. Their offense is 1v1 iso heavy and it's frustrating to watch Celtics offense. They are bottom-10 for offense in the league.  \- We can look at their roster outside of Tatum and Brown. So many of them won't even make a starters or g-leaguers.  \- Their move to improve the team is limited. Kemba's contract is hamstring Celtics progress to properly build a team roster and used all of their assets to drafting players. Their situation on salary cap is fucked up because of Kemba, TT and Teague are taking 40% of salary cap. They could use 3 good quality bench or starters instead of Kemba.  They should have a chance to sign and trade Hayward with Pacers for Myles Turner but they didn't do this."
Myles turner makes sense.   Please.  I'll take one Myles Turner. Maybe even develope the tacko himself.
low effort because late and tired  1. KAT 2. DBook 3. DLo/Oubre/Zinger? not sure really havent kept up on em. Heard Oubre doing good tho. 4. Myles Turner  5. Christian Wood 6. Terrrrryyyy 7. Trez 8. Norm 9. JRich the 2nd 10. whoever the fuck Branden Dawson is
Myles Turner is way better than Christian Wood
Myles turner is no where near the level of either of the jays and this is coming from a Celtics fan who was crossing their fingers to get him for Hayward
"&gt;No it's more that we know our team situation better than you do...   &gt;   &gt;The trade included Smart so take him out of your listYou now have 3 players. One of which is coming back from a serious knee injury and is in wait-and-see mode.You now have 2 players.  You coulda probably gotten away with Brown &amp; Kemba for Harden considering how Harden tanked his value so hard to make it affordable. Include some filler &amp; picks and you likely get Harden and PJ Tucker, which is a veeeerrry good haul  &gt;Yeah Tatum + Harden + ? - picks (so we can't go grab a role player) = definitely a championshop contender.../s  Yes. Considering the Nets then don't get Harden and you do, you're better than Philly and just as good as Brooklyn. Harden is one of the best floor raisers of all time, up there with LeBron, Steve Nash, etc.  &gt;You mean that team that had Capella, Ariza, Tucker and Gordon all playing some of the best basketball of their careers?   &gt;   &gt;Who are Boston's depth pieces to fill out the roster?  They were all playing the best basketball of their career then, and now they're not...... I wonder why.... who is the common denominator for all their success? It couldn't have been the superstar who elevates every role player he plays with as he's been carrying rosters averaging 30 &amp; 10 for years now, could it?  &gt;Yeah... imagine... all those good defensive pieces we have...We're the 15th defense in the league right now and you want to trade 2 of our 4 plus defenders for James Harden.  Harden, Smart, Tatum, Tucker and Theiss/TT is much better than what you have right now. Hell, if you played the S&amp;T properly, you coulda had Myles Turner for fucking pennies. Didn't Turner come with McDermott and a 1st? Or something like that?  And Ainge hesitated likely because he wanted even *more* for a player who was gonna leave anyway? Hayward went to Charlotte because you guys took too long to make an easy decision that woulda elevated your team.  Imagine, I know this is absolute best case scenario but:  PG: Harden  SG: Smart  SF: Tatum  PF: Tucker  C: Turner  Top 3 team.  &gt;That's stupid. Siakam was the #2 on a championship team. Jaylen is more than qualified.You don't Billie King yourself for 2 uncompetitive seasons.  Siakam was the #3 behind Kawhi &amp; Lowry. Just because Siakam averaged a lotta points in the Finals doesn't mean he was the #2 when Lowry was the leader, playmaker, best shooter and heart/soul of that Raps team who was almost as integral as Kawhi. He was even better than Kawhi in some of those games at Oracle... Brown isn't as good as that Lowry.  Also, if KD, Klay, Iggy and Looney are healthy, Siakam is getting clamped tf up. So is Brown. That's an unfair comparison.  Now put Brown on any of the Main 3 Championship Frontrunners right now. Lakers, Clips, Nets. How is he the 2nd best player on any of those teams?"
"lmao imagine what ur team could have been if u had traded for Myles 'Negative Asset' Turner. Instead, the Hornets fleeced y'all :)"
couldve stolen myles turner and dougie mcbuckets and possibly more but Ainge will be Ainge
"We still bagging on the Celtics for not trading for Paul George? It would have required giving up Jaylen Brown who‚Äôs arguably a starter for the ASG this season. AD would have required giving up Tatum and Brown and there‚Äôs no guarantee that he sticks around after last season, especially if Kyrie still bolts for the Nets. Also, if memory serves correctly the Celtics weren‚Äôt allowed to trade for AD until the offseason due to the Rose rule. The Lakers made the move before the Celtics were even allowed to get involved. There are a lot more questions around Myles Turner but the Celtics can‚Äôt trade for him unless Hayward consents to the deal, which he might not have done."
Myles Turner.
"&gt;Brown and Tatum are probably the 4th best duo in the league and they‚Äôre only 22/23.  Doesn't matter. They're nowhere near superstar caliber. They have no chance vs Lebron/AD, or the Nets Big 3 by themselves. You needed to gamble for a big superstar... like Harden. Or even a good allstar caliber player who actually fits unlike Kyrie &amp; Kemba... like Myles Turner  Also, their age doesn't matter here because there's absolutely no guarantee they'll get good enough to win a Chip by themselves. r/nba's biggest misconception is that every young player will grow on a linear track and become a superstar eventually with just more time. There's absolutely no guarantee that'll happen, and a lotta players grow well early on but peak early. They could be 28 and be the same players they are now  Also, Tatum &amp; Brown will wanna leave after a while if they realize they're not going anywhere. Tatum's already been to the ECF 3 times, and he's probably getting the feelin that this Boston team peaked early and now with the Nets, Sixers &amp; Bucks, he has no chance. Same sentiment with Brown"
They should've gotten Myles Turner while they had the chance
"They've been patient for years, and supposedly didn't wanna commit to trades for AD, Paul George, and now Myles Turner. Obviously we don't know all of these were 100% on Ainge not offering enough (like maybe AD wouldn't go to Boston) but there's been so many reports of him not wanting to trade the *treasure chest* I gotta feel there's some validity to it"
I can‚Äôt remember what player but someone from the grizzlies threw himself into Myles Turner while chucking up a half court buzzer beater. They REVIEWED it and upon watching the replays I was like oh it‚Äôs obviously an offensive foul... then they give the Grizzlies 3 shots
"&gt;r/nba  ye lol I only Gobert and Davis, which is arguable, maybe myles turner"
"Not saying they would win a championship with him, but not taking Myles Turner in a S&amp;T with Indiana looks increasingly stupid."
They coulda had myles turner man. They arent serious about winning.
This team really needed a big man and they decided not to go out and get Christian wood or Myles turner
"Brad will get a lot of the blame, and he‚Äôs not totally blameless, but it‚Äôs evident their deficiencies are more personnel than scheme.  Danny needs to cash in those assets for some frontcourt help. go out and overpay for Myles Turner or something. still better than sitting on your balls and waiting to spontaneously nut or one of them to bust."
"I still can't get over how indignant Celts fans were over passing up on a S&amp;T for Myles Turner because.... reasons  That extra draft pick you traded wasn't gonna be worth missing out on a player who perfectly fits your team, the $18 mil Turner cost wasn't much to give up and all these excuses that your young 2nd rookie will eventually turn into a superstar given time and isn't worth trading for Turner is BS  The mental gymnastics some people engaged in to not trade for Harden when he was at his cheapest value was absolutely ridiculous. 'Hurts team chemistry' or 'this 2nd year player who had a nice couple playoff games is too valuable to trade' are absolute BS.   **Harden is a superstar worth more than Tyler Herro and some filler, worth more than Simmons, Thybulle, Maxey and picks and is worth more than Jaylen Brown and filler**"
They need a true defensive anchor at the 5 as opposed to Adams. If I‚Äôm then I‚Äôm doing anything I can to add Myles Turner to the young core.
"Simmons, Draymond, Brad Wannamaker, Gobert, Giannis and Embiid are all better at defense. Some people are saying Myles Turner too, not sure abt that one.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Also Jamal Murray of course."
"They would need a roster on par with like the 2019 Raptors or current Jazz talent wise where 1-8 every dude is solid. Dame, Trent, CJ, Nurkic, Melo, and Covington are all solid. The Derrick Jones Jr role is the weak link, but he would be fine off the bench. Rodney Hood was also playing crunch time minutes for them and I just don't have much faith in him anymore. Even when Zach Collins is healthy he wouldn't be enough. They need defense. The dream replacement would be Draymond but that will never happen. The only hope would be to take a gamble on an Aaron Gordon type player or younger and hope you can turn them into Draymond lite. I don't see Dame and CJ breaking up either. It's not like CJ would fetch much. If you could replace CJ with like Gordon Hayward or Jaylen Brown that might help but again I would doubt that would happen. Maybe Myles Turner? But that may just create more problems."
Completely shut down the pacers the other night in the 4th quarter. Literally was everywhere and that won the game. His defensive iq is on another level. Always at the right place at the right time. Reads plays before they happen. I‚Äôm all for Lebron DPOY!!   Also Lakers are ranked 1st in defense rating and thats without arguably the best defensive player in the game in AD. You could put Draymond and Ben in the convo for DPOY. Not really sure who else. Gobert? Myles turner?
People need to stop pretending Myles Turner is an elite defender just because of blocks
"Nope.  Gobert, Giannis, Simmons, Myles Turner, and Embiid should all be well ahead of him.  He might be around the same tier as Draymond, Bam, Mitchell Robinson, Kawhi --- those guys."
They need to get them a Myles Turner  Lonzo/Hart/BI/Zion/Turner
Myles Turner makes so much more sense for you guys but I think Indiana is looking for another perimeter player to put next to Domas and only seems possible of a 3rd team is involved.
"Ideally, but anyone would be a huge improvement over Kanter on that end  I'd love Myles Turner"
Myles turner has done 50x better on Jokic than Gobert
"LeBrons is a dpoy candidate after ( not going to win it, but should be in 4th place after Myles turner). He's not as phonically dominant, doesn't move as well laterally and doesn't have that rim protection that made him the best rim protecting big of all time. Yet, he's having one of his best defensive seasons. Man knows his shit"
Myles Turner üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"DPOY should be between Baguette and Myles Turner anyways, at least in my opinion"
"3 team trade  Indiana gets: Aaron Gordon, ???  Orlando gets: JJ Reddick, salary filler, two FRPs from NO  New Orleans gets: Myles Turner"
I would give basically anything other than Zion for Myles Turner.
"I didn't really consider the conferences, I was moreso talking about being a All-Star level player. But even then playing for the Lakers and scoring like 16 points on 60%+ TS on 35% 3s with elite defense might be enough narrative to get him Gobert's spot. With Turner there's zero doubt in my mind that LA's league-best defense would become even more stiffling and with an offensive role that revolves around catching lobs and spoon-fed corner 3s by LeBron Myles should be really efficient while scoring 15-20 points on any given night."
Myles Turner
Myles Turner
I like Hayes but you‚Äôd basically be trading Myles Turner for a guy who you hope can become Myles Turner
except myles turner isn‚Äôt rangy on defense
I think you just described Myles Turner
Wow he really good! The Pacers could sure use him better instead of that clown Myles Turner
"Ahh yes it's the time of the year for ""teams being interested in Myles Turner"" and nothing happening"
"Yeah bball index has a gravity index based on shot volume I think primarily worth checking out   But like I said the other day the floor spacing 5 with a few exceptions is all fake and nobody epitomizes that better than Myles Turner. This [has been the Myles Turner story for years](https://twitter.com/c2_cooper/status/1219668114163609600?s=21). He‚Äôs a little better at being patient and willing to take a few more 3s now but doesn‚Äôt change much functionally   People keep talking about him ‚Äúas this unique‚Äù skill set and ‚Äúhard fo find player‚Äù when really he‚Äôs just kind of a traditional big who provides value on end of the court. Great rim protector, 2nd best in the nba arguably, but him only having value on one of the court in reality is why Indiana is always trying to trade him"
The Turner trade rumours are dumb because he‚Äôs been so crucial. Playing just Sabonis at the 5 weakens the rim protection so much. Also it‚Äôs not like they occupy the same space on offence. Myles can shoot fairly well which allows Sabonis to do his thing in the post.
Myles Turner isnt that player. You are arguing he is. Clearly you haven‚Äôt watched him.
"We have two guys in Monk and Hayward who can go off whenever and two guys capable of being a starting PG in Melo and Te. That‚Äôs enough to make center depth a bigger concern than guard depth here imo.  Terry is great and insanely clutch, but we‚Äôd need a lot less clutch on the team if we replaced Biz with Myles Turner."
i would lol so hard if it actually turns out we signed Gordon with the understanding that we'd trade him to his home state for Myles Turner.  That would be a next level asset move.
Hey what about us???  I‚Äôll give you Gordon Hayward for Myles Turner straight up.
Fair. But who would realistically be traded for Myles Turner though?
Myles Turner is a better basketball player than Bismack Biyombo
By basketball hipsters: Myles Turner and OG  By dudes that watch one game a week: Drummond
Myles turner is so good at rebounding
"Myles Turner was balling out on defense and Jokic still put up 32/14/5/4, dude is just ridiculous this year"
"On a similar note, Nerlens Noel is fourth in the league in blocks per game, averaging 2.0 a game despite only playing 22.2 MPG, which puts him at 157th in minutes per game. He is second in the league in block percentage with 8.9% (behind Myles Turner) and third in the league in defensive rating with 102.4 (behind Rudy Gobert and Anthony Davis)."
Hornets and Raptors seem like a solid fit - although I think if it was up to the Celtics they'd dump TT and give Theis another team-friendly deal.  I'll be interested in what Theis gets in the off-season because he's obviously outperforming his contract and salty Celtics fans like to beat that point like a dead horse when comparing him and Myles Turner; if his new bag cuts into that different significantly I'll get a giggle out if it.
"&gt;According to sources, at the beginning of free agency Indiana was the preferred destination for the former All-Star. As the two front offices went about discussing the logistics of executing such a move, it is rumored to be the case that C‚Äôs General Manager, Danny Ainge, got ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù, for he wanted more than just the reported initial offer of¬†Myles Turner¬†&amp; Doug McDermott and, instead, wanted Victor Oladipo to be apart of the trade.  It was Ainge who was the idiot. He asked for Oladipo. Your comment makes it seem like he didnt want oladipo. I'm not going to ho through the timeline because I have better work to do. Also reports come out generally 3-4 days after the trade talk. That's just common sense. They were negotiating 3-4 days before the report came out."
Ainge wanted Oladipo with Myles Turner. He turned down the pacers offer because they didnt give him Oladipo. Yes he is an idiot
"Better make an all-defensive team at the least. Depending on how voting is going to be affected with AD missing some games, the current running for power forwards is Giannis, Bam, Draymond, and AD. Throwing in centers like Myles Turner, Embiid, and Embiid, the competition in front court defensive players is tight. Nobody has as good of rotations and can quarterback a defense like Draymond, though. Assuming we stay top 6 in Drtg, it'd be a travesty to not have him get rewarded for his defensive play."
"That fits him offensively yes, but defensively it‚Äôs a terrible fit. You won‚Äôt have much playoff success with such a lopsided team, and once all 3 of these guys are being paid what they‚Äôre worth they‚Äôll have one of the higher payrolls in the league.  I‚Äôm not saying Wiseman right now is at all comparable. Of course Ingram is better.  But having Zion, Wiseman, and the Minny pick would give the Pels the brightest future in the league. If things go right, that could be built into a genuine contender down the road.  I don‚Äôt think, even if you added Myles Turner to the current Pels that it really moves the needle all that much, they might contend for an 8th seed. But that‚Äôs not the kind of moves they should be making right now, when their stars aren‚Äôt even in their prime, even if they‚Äôre committed to making Ingram-Zion work defensively."
"Guy...committing to building around Zion means keeping the 23 year old all star that fits him offensively and matches his timeline perfectly lol. This trade is heavily in the Warriors favour in every way. Like I said in my previous comment, there are a ton of moves they can make to shore up their defence before selling Ingram for pennies on the dollar. Swing a trade for Myles Turner for instance. Wiseman isn‚Äôt been a good defender ffs and it isn‚Äôt even remotely guaranteed that he becomes a defensive anchor.  Wiseman does not space the floor in any way, shape or form. Shooting a good percentage on very small volume isn‚Äôt spacing the floor. No player in the NBA is leaving Zion Williamson, the most dominant paint scorer in the league, to close out on James Wiseman at the 3 point line."
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Of all those names you listed only Myles Turner was on the table for trade bruh. Tf you on about?
"One of the reasons for this is that Jokic doesn‚Äôt always contest when there are wide open lanes, because it isn‚Äôt worth picking up a foul. There have been situations in the playoffs/big games where Jokic goes for those plays but then gets in foul trouble, which is a way bigger problem for the Nuggets, and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs been asked to adjust there. Someone like Myles Turner can afford to risk picking up fouls and average 3.5 PF/game because he doesn‚Äôt run his team‚Äôs offense, but it‚Äôs not worth sacrificing jokic on plays that are high percentage shots against any defender."
"I really do not understand the Celtics. Honestly. They have all of these assets until the year 3000, but won‚Äôt make any moves. KAT, Myles Turner, Giannis, Beal ect. could be had and maybe could have been traded for earlier than this season and they sat pat. Watch them make a smaller move for Drummond or someone on that level."
I only want to say that Myles Turner deserve an all defensive team.
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
Grant and Myles Turner
"I see. Maybe I was too optimistic in the asking price for Turner since I often heard that he and the Pacers aren't happy in the situation.   The point is: Myles Turner would be a perfect fit for the Bulls. And the Bulls would be perfect for Turner. He wouldn't find himself battling with Rebounds with the other Big and LaVine provides with the drive and kick possibility due to his magnitude on scoring abilities.   But why would the Bulls give their their Stretch 4 away and keep the guy who should be replaced? If for a bench role (of WCJ)... He could do that for the Pacers aswell. But okay. It's not like there are no alternatives.   If the Bulls would send Lauri away, they would need another 4. Get Gallinari then or Barnes from Kings and play smaller?  Or you get a 3rd team involved in the Turner Trade from beginning and try to involve those named.  How about: Bulls send WCJ to the Hawks/ Kings, Hawks/Kings send Gallinari/Barnes or Bagley to the Pacers, Bulls send Hutchinson and the Pick to the Pacers and maybe an additional Roleplayer (like Arcidiacon or Valentine) to the Hawks/Kings?"
is it somehow possible for denver to get myles turner?
"Add Curry to the Lakers and that‚Äôs the greatest trio ever.   I‚Äôd add Jamal Murray and Myles Turner to the Nets. Nets would have an All-Time great trio, and Murray off the bench to easily be the best 6th man in the league. Turner would help with their defence and give them solid rim protection and he‚Äôs a solid shooter as well. With guys like Green, Brown, DJ, and Blake asked to do less they‚Äôre actually very solid role players.   I‚Äôd lean Nets but it‚Äôs still tough to imagine Curry/Lebron/AD losing."
Lakers: Bradley Beal  Nets: Myles Turner and Caris Levert back
"&gt;Bring in a Center who protects the the rim, sets screens and stretches the floor - Myles Turner for WCJ, Chandler Hutchinson and a 2nd Round Pick.  That's an easy no from the Pacers"
"The Bulls arent well rounded enough forvthe Playoffs but too good and competitive for a deeper Lottery Look.    So, work on your weakness and the young core.  Don't touch: LaVine, Williams, Thad Young, Temple.   Bring in a Center who protects the the rim, sets screens and stretches the floor - Myles Turner for WCJ, Chandler Hutchinson and a 2nd Round Pick.  Lonzo Ball should provide pass first and more defense than you get with Coby White. Let him go off the bench as 2 Guard (with Satoransky for example as the PG) . Get Lonzo either for a 2nd rounder plus Denzel Valentine or see if he wants to come in the FA (he is a RFA)   With that you strengthen the bright side: Good tempo, good bench - but work on the efficiency and turnovers in that.  Lauri will have troubles finding his money wish in the contract offers. He's hurt so often and inconsistent. Healthy and ready, he is a cornerstone of the Franchise but more as Tony Kukoc than as Pippen to our Jordan!  Get a SF that gives you 10pts and defense. Get rid off (trade away, or let go): Felicio, Kornet, Hutchinson, WCJ, Arcidiacono, Gafford.   Get a more balanced team with better roleplayers to provide a 2nd Star enough money and Space to go join next to LaVine."
Indiana still got Myles Turner on the market?
Sitting myles turner for the entire 4th q is what did it. That's when the Lakers made their comeback. Just a baffling decision.
Holy shit you still think this is somehow about re-signing Gordon. What do you not understand about the concept of trading a player before they become a free agent and walk away for nothing? You even throw in the fact you wish you kept him while simultaneously saying he was injured yet again for the playoffs. It‚Äôs like you enjoy making yourself look like a complete meme of a fan.   &gt;When exactly was DA supposed to trade him?  How about when fucking Myles Turner and a first was offered?   https://www.google.com/amp/s/us.bolavip.com/amp/nba/boston-celtics-inexplicably-rejected-a-massive-offer-for-gordon-hayward-20201127-0002.html
"&gt; The guy refused to allow them to shoot 3's, despite having a roster that would be well-suited to take a decent amount of them   wat.   Oladipo, Warren (don't let the percentages deceive you), Sabonis are below average 3 point shooters. When Myles Turner is the second best shooter in your starting lineup that says it all"
"It's a testament to Nate for getting so much out of a bunch of good roleplayers in the most topheavy era ever. I do think the Pacers will recover a bit once they get their guys back. With one toptier playmaker/scorer this pacers squad would probably even be good enough to contend in the east for a ECF appearance. But Indiana's problem has always been getting Superstars to sign there. It's one of the more well-nurtured and lead franchises in the NBA which has them overachieving what feels like pretty much every season in the 10s. They'd make some serious noise if they were to get a PG-level player whose playstyle is more catered to playmaking than scoring&amp;defending alone. Myles Turner could be talked about as one of the best big men in the league if he had a Harden/LeBron-type creator on his squad. I'm very high on him as an easily plug-able, elite defensive piece with great floorstretching abilities."
"I didn‚Äôt say no value, but what teams want to give up their assets to pay Myles Turner $18 million a year?"
"Bro ... if they would, they would have. They don‚Äôt want Myles Turner."
"It‚Äôs not high, they did everything they could to move him before. I don‚Äôt think teams are clamouring to get Myles Turner."
Thank god for Myles Turner jacking up wild trash shots
Montrez Myles Turner Harrell.
‚ÄòElite defensive team‚Äô ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&gt; ‚ÄòMyles Turner‚Äô. Excuse me?
"**TEAM PACERS (with a twist)**  Billionaire Bruce Wayne sells his corporation and buys an expansion team, complete with an alternate timeline version of the Indiana Pacers.  Current teammates Paul George and Kawhi Leonard prove that -- while social media may hate them right now -- they can fit like a glove on virtually any roster in the league. They provide some excellent perimeter defense that, coupled with Myles Turner, leads these new Pacers to one of the best defensive ratings in the league (finishing # 2 overall.)  Offensively, the team can get caught up in some ""iso ball"" at times, but they manage to get bailed out by Kawhi Leonard's ability to win in those situations. The Pacers end the league year with the # 1 seed out East. The question from here is: will they step up when it counts? Or will PG+Kawhi fold once again?  Round 1 is easy, with the team sweeping the Knicks. In round 2, Boston doesn't provide much more resistance, with another 4-1 win for the Pacers.  The Eastern Conference Finals appear to be more of a challenge, as KD, James Harden, and Kyrie arrive in town ready to test that top-tier defense. Kawhi and Paul George gamely step up their games, but James Harden manages to create some foul trouble for them that limits their minutes. The Nets go up 2-1. Game 4 is even worse, as Kawhi Leonard runs cold and Paul George goes 3-13.  Now down 3-1, it appears as though these Pacers may be folding. However, they do have some aces in the hole: PG Malcolm Brogdon has emerged behind the scenes as a key leader for them, encouraging them to stiffen up and fight their way back into the series. Brogdon even steps up his share of the offense, bullying smaller Kyrie Irving and going for 19-7-8 in a Game 5 win. Kawhi and PG find their rhythm again in Game 6, leading to another win! The team has officially tied it up, 3-3!  Going into a pivotal game 7, everyone looks tight. The offense is slow -- stagnant at times -- and perhaps relying too much on one-on-one play. T.J. Warren tries to do a little too much of that, coughing up 3 turnovers in a game where he should probably be in a background role. In turn, the Nets get hot beyond the arc with Joe Harris hitting 4-7 threes. The Nets end up pulling away and winning this one 115-107.   Afterwards, the Pacers are disappointed, and wonder how much could have changed if they had the full effect of homecourt advantage. Alas, COVID had other plans in mind this particular season."
Tim Duncan in his last yr vs Myles Turner on his rookie season [https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Pacers-coach-Nate-McMillan-believes-he-has-7742314.php#photo-9570115](https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Pacers-coach-Nate-McMillan-believes-he-has-7742314.php#photo-9570115)
Idk man Myles Turner might look hot in red
"Try and get Myles Turner or go back in time and sign Aron Baynes instead of Steve Adams.  Reward with the extension of his choosing, within reason. He‚Äôs earned it.  Trade Bledsoe and Redick to any contender who will take them for picks.  Target defensive-minded wings who can shoot."
"The issue is that he isn't *just* hacked off-ball without any calls. Incident's like Okogie's ""hot stove contact,"" AD jumping on him during his corner 3 against the Pelicans, Myles Turner giving him a bloody nose earlier this season, etc. all come to mind. It's naive to expect the refs to watch him off-ball at all times, but teams also shouldn't be able to game plan around him by constantly roughing him up off-ball and even with the ball at times."
"KAT, Gobert, Embiid, Adebayo, Jokic, AD (if we count him as a center) and Sabonis in the first tier. And then guys like Jarrett Allen, Nurkic, Myles Turner, Ayton, Christian Wood, Capela... a lot of amazing centers in the league today. Know I missed a few but i remember when it was pretty much just Dwight and Bynum who were elite."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
Myles Turner will never be anything more than a slightly above average starting center
The floor spacing 5 is a myth   All these Myles Turner serge ibaka al horford Nikola Jokic types nobody guards regardless of what % they shoot. Teams let them shoot. Nobody cares they don‚Äôt get guarded   You can count on one hand the number of 5s with legitimate gravity who have actual floor spacing. That‚Äôs not an undercount either
"Beal, Lavine, Jaylen Brown, probably could get some guys from the Rockets(Gordon, Tucker, Oladipo, maybe Wood would be available), Pacers(Brogdon &amp; Myles Turner), Demar Derozan, Aaron Gordon, John Collins, Kevin Love &amp; another piece from Cavs. Lotta help out there."
"Without looking at contracts or assets, LMA for Myles Turner sounds fun. Not sure if LMA wants to go to the Pacers though."
"&gt;So you're saying you do want to see five Myles Turner post ups per game? You think PJ Tucker taking more long twos is preferable to the Utah Jazz shooting pullup 3s in transition 10 times a night?  I already told you that a better balance from a different time period is possible for people to enjoy more; the contrarians on this sub like to make it a choice between two completely different extremes when it really doesn't have to be.   I don't like watching the Harden-less Rockets jack up 60 fucking three pointers and make 10 as much as I don't like watching the worst teams from the early oughts jack up a bunch of bad post shots, but those are obvious extremes. I didn't try to strawman you.  Now, achieving that balance is harder in practice, as you have to be careful about how you approach rule changes, but the sentiment is that this period is not the best period of basketball that perspective.   &gt;Got a source on that still being the case? Some cursory research found that ratings this season were up substantially.  **That's also likely because the season started during the holiday's and got a major boost than recent seasons' starts** (which have also been down years when comparing to ratings over time in the modern NBA), especially because the ratings have been down significantly in the past couple years so that holiday boost was *really* significant compared to last year.  There was a really great article that for some damn reason I can't find that accounted for this unusual season when comparing ratings. While I try to find that, **other articles found that when you compare the primetime Christmas games compared to last (instead of comparing Christmas games to last year's season start in October), you find that ratings were down even more than the year before.**  [https://www.sportico.com/leagues/basketball/2020/nba-bad-christmas-tv-ratings1234619352-1234619352/](https://www.sportico.com/leagues/basketball/2020/nba-bad-christmas-tv-ratings1234619352-1234619352/)  ASG ratings down to historic lows  [https://twitter.com/crupicrupicrupi/status/1369310973811699714?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1369312464609886208%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2\_&amp;ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossingbroad.com%2F2021%2F03%2Fsurprise-nba-all-star-game-ratings-were-way-down.html](https://twitter.com/crupicrupicrupi/status/1369310973811699714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1369312464609886208%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossingbroad.com%2F2021%2F03%2Fsurprise-nba-all-star-game-ratings-were-way-down.html)  Of course, the ratings when you measure them in certain ways are slightly up compared to just last year, but when you account for context, evidence shows it leans the other way. For example, the article you linked used the Warriors ratings being up as their main example but there's an obvious reason why; Steph Curry (2nd biggest basketball star in the world) is back and actually playing this year.   So of course Warriors-Suns (2 teams much better than last year) gets better ratings than the G-League Warriors-Celtics. Not enough evidence to show ratings are doing better, and you can attribute some of it to the on court product."
If the Pacers managed to keep PG and Kawhi (No Sabonis sadly)  &amp;#x200B;  Brogdon  Paul George  TJ Warren  Kawhi  Myles Turner
"&gt;You talk so confidently as if 'no one' wants to see that brand of basketball without literally any proof to back it up. Have you ever considered you live in your own echochamber here in r/nba when it comes to this stuff and that the casuals are detested by the evolution of the game the past couple years more than you think?  So you're saying you *do* want to see five Myles Turner post ups per game? You think PJ Tucker taking more long twos is preferable to the Utah Jazz shooting pullup 3s in transition 10 times a night?   &gt;After all, there's a reason ratings have been noticeably down in the past few years  Got a source on that still being the case? Some cursory research found that ratings this season were [up substantially](https://sportsnaut.com/nba-tv-ratings/)."
"&gt;Because what you're essentially asking for with late 2000s/early 2010s basketball is just more long twos and more post possessions from mediocre post players. That's stupid.  No, it's not. It's a decent mix of midrange game, driving, post up and 3s chucking. Objectively more variety than now, and your feeling on it is simply your opinion.  &gt;Nobody actually wants to watch guys like Danny Green or PJ Tucker take catch and shoot 20 footers instead of corner threes. Nobody wants to see five Myles Turner post ups per game. The only reason they think they want to is because of the stupid romanticization of 1990s/2000s basketball, which might be the cringiest thing in all of sports.  You talk so confidently as if 'no one' wants to see that brand of basketball without literally any proof to back it up. Have you ever considered you live in your own echochamber here in r/nba when it comes to this stuff and that the casuals are detested by the evolution of the game the past couple years more than you think?  After all, there's a reason ratings have been noticeably down in the past few years, even moreso than they ever have at the peak of the 90s basketball, and it isn't likely just because of cord-cutting (because the NFL resurged in 2019 after a couple down years, for example).   The nature of today's game (only 3s chuckin, foulbaiting on the perimeter, softer defensive rules, more ref involvement in games, more ads, games start late, superstar talent more &amp; more concentrated, superstars run the league more than ever, etc) undoubtedly has to be a part of it."
"I don't think there is anybody - Ainge has specifically mentioned he's looking for ""shooting with size"" (insert Myles Turner reference here).  Barnes fits that to a T and they've locked into a semblance of a center rotation with players like TT, Theis and Timelord. I think the asking price for Vooch would be too much for them to bite as well."
"size matters some for sure, but maybe not as much as we would think. players like myles turner and brook lopez def don't get even close to as many rebounds as they should with their size. and then some players like josh hart and westbrook outrebound players their size by an outrageous margin. obviously westbrook may be an outlier with how hard he goes for rebounds, but my point stands. you can be a great or terrible rebounder regardless of your size"
"He's probably gone at the end of the season but it makes absolutely no sense to deal Lowry for anything other than a high-value FRP or a reliable center, which no contender would be willing/able to deal.   Better to make a playoff run and maintain a solid FA destination status for the next couple of seasons, maybe deal Powell for a Myles Turner/John Collins."
"I mean he is. Everyone says he can't guard 5s but he can.   Not that many teams are playing post big men these days.   If you went through every team and named their starting Center, I'd bet Ben could guard half of them.   You dont think Ben could guard Theis, Boucher, Bam,  DJ, Myles Turner, etc?"
"Jrue, BI, Kawhi, Zion, Myles Turner"
I think we should have tried to go for Myles Turner.
"Really though? Here are some people on ~20m contracts. Jerami Grant, THJ, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon, Bojan, Caris LeVert, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Gallanari, etc. Given a choice, would you willingly pay 20M for Wiggins over any of these players?"
If Capela doesnt make All Nba defense team over Myles Turner its a joke. He has been a beast this year averages almost twice the rebounds and has singlehandly turned around the Horrific defense. He destroyed Turner last time they played.
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.

"Any order Dennis Schroeder, Marcus Smart, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Marcus Morris"
Well they‚Äôre not getting Bam lol. They can go for someone like Myles Turner/Al Horford though
How tf are you gonna play KAT and myles turner together lmao
"Tentative Pelicans fan - Dump bledsoe and adams for 2FRPs.  Trade Ingram and 3 FRPs for KAT.  Sign Myles Turner with cap, could try to lure Lowry on a discount. Re sign Ball with bird rights."
"it's not totally absurd. someone like jrue holiday is close to simmons in defensive play, prob a top 10/top 5 defender, but isn't really put in the top 25. Same with myles turner."
When Myles turner was above him in dpoy ladder because of blocks he was underrated
"If I were gonna trade Wiseman, I'd try to package him, the Minny pick, and maybe some extra filler stuff for Myles Turner. Don't know if Pacers would do that though."
Trade for Myles Turner. Good fit with Zion
"Gobert is not far and away the best at what he does though, Embiid, Giannis, Bam, and Myles Turner are all very good at paint defense as well.  If you swap Rudy with embiid or Giannis, the jazz are just as good defensively and are much better overall.  Rudy‚Äôs a good defender, but he‚Äôs not irreplaceable.  And if Rudy is so great at what he does, and this huge impactful player, how come jazz fans weren‚Äôt that excited giving him a max."
"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
Myles Turner has a great voice for it.
"I mean, Myles Turner is a top-3 defensive player in the league who can help them space the floor? Their offense isn't what's having issues right now. I don't know a single playoff team (that doesn't already have a star center) that wouldn't be at the very least significantly stronger with Turner."
"Wiseman and a likely top 5 pick can definitely get you Myles Turner or Jonas Valanciunas or someone of that caliber, who would *absolutely* move the needle for them."
"Levert played a lot of 3 on Brooklyn next to D‚ÄôLo and Dinwiddie. And I‚Äôm sure they can just move on from TJ, he‚Äôs a good backup but definitely replaceable.  There‚Äôs also the option to bring Levert off the bench for firepower. Start Brogdon-CJ-Warren, then bring in Caris to stagger those guys.  I agree it‚Äôs not a *perfect* fit, but Pacers were trying to trade Turner for Hayward last offseason in a sign and trade so I know he‚Äôs expendable. And top-end talent is the most important thing after all, and CJ is definitely better than Myles, so I think it‚Äôs a win for the Pacers in the end."
"I think this season should be marked as a lost season. Even if you guys get a decent seed barring injuries I just don't see a win against the top dogs of the conference (sixers, bucks, nets or even heat)  You guys really would benefit from adding Myles Turner this offseason but even more desperately need a playmaker as Kemba provides little in that department and just provides more scoring which u already have"
"I don‚Äôt see any move they can make that‚Äôll make them contenders just by trading CJ. But they need to get a lot better defensively.   Porzingis is the idea guy that‚Äôll be an upgrade in rim protection and floor spacing over Nurk, but I don‚Äôt think Dallas makes that move. Myles Turner is a nice budget version though. CJ for Myles + a pick/other role player?  Then obviously Nurk will get traded for a wing/other position of need to fill the depth"
"Myles Turner is by no means a viable DPOY candidate. He gets a lot of blocks but is a good, not great defender otherwise. I think Capela‚Äôs better than he is."
"For the 2020 playoffs, he repeatedly tried to isolate Malcolm Brogdon on Bam Adebayo when the Heat were switching. Even though Warren was red-hot, he did not run him off of pin-downs or have him in any off ball action, just isolated at the elbow where Jimmy and Bam could contain him. He also did not try to attack Herro or Duncan Robinson through isolation or PnR, even though we had Oladipo, Brogdon, and Warren (decent isolation players). His lack of offensive sets also ensured that the bench was unplayable, since no one could generate their own offense.  On defense, everyone apart from Myles Turner was out of position. Oladipo esp. kept helping off of Duncan Robinson, and Dragic killed the Pacers when Brogdon went under screens on PnR. He made no schematic changes either, where going to a switching defense would've helped when the guards were chasing Robinson and Herro off of multiple screens. Instead, the guards were left chasing and the team paid the price.  After the playoffs, 4 different players went to management asking for him to be fired (Brogdon the chief among them). I can't say anything about his success in Atlanta, but his firing from Indiana was well-deserved and long overdue."
"Somehow get Myles Turner and Steph Curry, and you‚Äôre a contender ezpz"
Trade Ingram for Myles Turner + 1st rounder
Myles Turner on this team would've been great.
"Marc Gasol ranks 4th in D-Lebron this season behind only Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, and Clint Capela.   You can doubt the metric if you want, but this is clearly not a 2015 Peyton Manning situation where every stat is saying this QB is terrible now."
Myles Turner would be a great fit for them
"It's not like they're getting blown out. They could easily be in the playoffs if they didn't choke in the clutch, which partly is due to being so young.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd run it back, but:  \- Trade Bledsoe + picks for a 3 + D. Duncan Robinson would be nutty but his D is meh. I'd like a tough guy who can be vocal, a better James Johnson (who's been really great, but his place is on the bench).  \- Trade Steven Adams + picks for someone like Myles Turner. I love Adams but the extension he signed is atrocious and Hernangomez can be a lite version of him, which is more than enough in today's NBA. The fact that you have to take off your 20m$/yr guy because he's getting outplayed is unacceptable.  \- I'd resign Lonzo to be honest. He's got the right attitude, he's improving every year, his chemistry with Zion is nuts and he's a layup package away from being an elite role player. His defence is there, his 3 is there, his playmaking is there, his midrange is there, even his fucking Free Throws are there. He needs to get to the rim. That should be his assignment for this offseason. Even though his 3pt% might not show that, he's taken his 3p to a new level from last year. Last year he would be really good from 3 as a catch and shoot. Feet set, wide open, etc This year he's hitting stepbacks, shooting off the dribble, getting plays run for him  \- The bench is getting stacked in hustle guys (Hayes, Hart, James Johnson) but the Pels need someone who can get buckets. Someone like Lou Williams. Kira and NAW are nice, we'll see their development.  \-Maybe trade BI + picks for a superstar that complements Zion (if the opportunity presents itself)."
Myles Turner would've been nice but I bet he's off the table now.  Too bad had your chance I guess but Steven Adams was too enticing.
Trade Lonzo and Steven Adams for Myles turner.
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he‚Äôs too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he‚Äôs probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it‚Äôll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He‚Äôs already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"With a 20M deal, Lonzo would be paid more than Lavine, Saboner, Jerami Grant, Bogdan, Bojan, Myles Turner and Wood. Not only there are 2 Allstars here, Pelicans would probably rather have any of these players over Lonzo."
"That's a good list, but I doubt if some of those guys are *easily* better, especially older Conley and Myles Turner.   Turner is great this year, especially with his blocks, but outside of his rim protection he doesn't provide much and his blocks oversell his impact a bit. Conley is older than his prime and has a really good defense behind him with Gobert to the point where he makes up for all his mistakes; OG is playing with Baynes behind him lol  I can see 10 defenders being better, but I don't think those guys are *easily* better, and some are not better in general."
Is Myles Turner a Free Agent?
"&gt; There‚Äôs only so much a coach can do in the nba when going up against lebron James type players  That's fine but that's still no excuse to never win a single game in the playoffs in three out of four years. The Heat beat the Pacers 3/4 times last year and he didn't make a single adjustment to the lineup or playstyle until the last game of the plaayoffs. There was no Lebron James type player on the Celtics and the Heat and he couldn't even steal a single game at home. When the team scored 8 points in the 3rd Q in game 1 against the Celtics, he didn't adjust whatsoever and got swept. When the Cavs doubled Oladipo on every possession, he didn't make any adjustments. He insisted on starting Monta Ellis in 2017 when both CJ Miles and GR3 were playing great and, no surprise, he was so bad that the Pacers stretched his contract.  He was thoroughly outcoached by Lue, Stevens, and Spoelstra in the playoffs. The Heat sweep was the most egregious example of his ineptitude. The team was playing really well in the bubble despite Sabonis' absence. Myles Turner and TJ Warren were playing great and he couldn't even win one single game.  Even really bad teams like the Magic can win *at least* one game. He never could."
"If the Minny pick converts, honestly I‚Äôd rather take a pick from this deep draft class. If we somehow end up with Jalen green, I will be ecstatic.  Trading for another star might kill the spacing when Klay gets back. It‚Äôs have to be for someone like Christian wood or Myles turner."
yes minor foot sprain about 2 weeks ago. stepped on myles turner foot while driving to the lane.
"&gt; But I'd say there are many centers who can stretch the floor and keep the paint less clogged, opening up the lanes for cutters and drivers  I think to a certain extent this can be true of any player who stands on the perimeter. When people say you ""ignore"" non shooters on the perimeter it's mostly functionally true but its all relative, you always have to have some idea of where a guy is who is on the perimeter and account for him in some sense. Just completely ignoring Ben Simmons in a literal sense is a good way to give up back cut dunks to him. So again it's about what is the relative value of that vs other things a big can do  Posted about [this last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mr54zp/which_center_would_be_a_better_fit_next_to_zion/gukgwss/) part of the issue is Turner passes up shooting opportunities. This also just gets to the other point some of those clips in that link show that NBA help defense in general will commit to helping at the rim on drives. It's just the nature of how NBA defenses are taught to operate even if they are helping off 3 point shooters better than Myles Turner frankly. It's why truly ""opening"" up driving lanes as a spot up threat is hard and not as common as people think."
"&gt; exchange for a 5 who can be an offensive threat  Lmao this continues to be the absolute dumbest shit ever man. Yeah, let's stop focusing on defense even less than we already do and just try to turn a top offense into what, a slightly better one?  I just cannot comprehend where y'all heads are at with this one. What does an offensive center bring us? Steven does literally everything this team needs offensively from a 5. He's turned us into the best offensive rebounding team in the league and sets absolutely perfect screens. Why do y'all want scoring or shooting from a position that everyone in the league has shown time and time again it's not necessary from?  Look at every single one of the top teams in the league. Who's the best offensive 5 on any of those teams that isn't a superstar? Gobert isn't an offensive threat. Ayton puts up 15 a game. Lakers have been cycling through bottom of the barrel centers for two years and just won a championship with that.   Literally every team that is succeeding has a *defensive* focused guy starting at the 5, except for the Nuggets. And are we really talking about picking up a Jokic caliber player here? No. Y'all want Myles fucking Turner or somebody equaling trash offensively just because they shoot a couple of threes per game.   So tired of this take. Y'all want to keep pushing this team further and further away from a championship just because scoring and shooting are the only things you look at."
"He doesn‚Äôt lead the league in blocks though, that would be Myles Turner"
"When we talk about defence, most people pretend like defence can be summed up in one number or score.   *eg. A level 87 defender is better than a level 74 defender.*   When you're talking about defending Embiid, you have to understand what kind of player he is.    He is very big, very crafty and very talented and it's in that order:  1. Big 2. Crafty 3. Talented   He likes to bully and overpower you more than he likes to out-skill you. If he can't bully you, he tries to get the foul on you. If he can't get the foul he goes to his back of tricks to score on you (step backs, dream shakes, skyhooks, etc. he can do it all).  So when you want to defend him, the first thing you need is a guy who is big enough to match Embiid and hold their ground. You have to take away Embiid's 1st scoring option otherwise he'll eat you alive.  This is why a bad defender like Enes Kanter is better at defending Embiid than a good defender like Myles Turner. Turner doesn't have the size to stop Embiid's first scoring option. Kanter can at least hold his ground physically.  Now look at Brook Lopez.   1. He's big enough to hold his ground.   2. He's experienced enough to defend without fouling.   So against Lopez, Embiid can't use his 1st or 2nd option. He has to use his 3rd option, which harder and less reliable to pull off.   He's still a threat, but he's less of a threat.   After that, one of the only offensive weaknesses Embiid has is that he panics a little bit when you blitz him. Help defence can be pretty effective against him.  The Bucks have Giannis, as others have said, he's is one of the best help defenders in the NBA. The Bucks also love to clog the paint.   So they're in a good position to attack Embiid and stop him from going to work."
Myles Turner
I mean Myles Turner has a meh offensive game inside and outside. But still the pairing would work well.
"&gt;I think a defensive/playmaking PG who can shoot is what the modern NBA is looking for in PG. Ball is a decent approximation of that.   But the thing Lonzo's playmaking is limited becausae he is useless in the halfcourt. He doesn't drive and he can't pull up for his own 3 (85% of his 3's are assisted). There is a reason Pelicans offense massively improved once they gave the playmaking  responsibilities to Zion.   &gt;I do agree that they need a defensive anchor, (someone like Myles Turner would be really good for them imo). I'd rather do Adams + picks if I'm the Pels than Ball though  Well half the league wants a Myles Turner haha"

"I wouldn‚Äôt even rule out 9 for the Wizards. They‚Äôre 2 games behind the Pacers, who are about to lose Myles Turner for the season, and play them twice."
You could draw it it out of a hat honestly. It could be anyone. Maybe the Pacers slip out bc of Myles Turner
"Key summary:  &gt; Myles Turner‚Äôs toe injury could end his season, Dr. Jan Szatkowski, an orthopedic foot and ankle trauma doctor at IU health said. Szatkowski, who has not examined Turner, said it's an injury that typically requires surgery and the average recovery time is six months.  &gt; The injury is most commonly referred to as ‚Äúturf toe,‚Äù and it is much more common in sports such as football where hyperextensions like that are more common. Szatkowski said that the Pacers use of the phrase ‚Äúpartial tear‚Äù creates a ‚Äúbig variation of how much is actually torn.‚Äù If it is a smaller tear, Szatkowski said, some athletes have used a graphite insert, a special orthopedic designed to remove pressure from the injured toe, in their shoe. Szatkowski said for a player to return quickly, he would ‚Äútreat (patients) considerably for a very short period‚Äù until they eventually could get the surgery.  &gt; Playing with a smaller tear, though, heightens risk of further injury and a more severe tear, Szatkowski said. After proper rehabilitation, athletes generally recover well, Szatkowski said, but they may experience ‚Äúwaxing and waning‚Äù pain in the ball of their foot. ""These injuries, they tend to be more chronic (with flare-ups that come and go) than we would like,"" Szatkowski said, ""because we put all of our weight on our feet every day.""  Rev up the tanks I guess"
"Hes been like a slightly more limited Myles Turner for us, its been awesome"
"Outside of sabonis and maybe Brogdon and TJ I wouldn‚Äôt really take their players.  Myles Turner for 20 million a year is a really bad contract for a pure rim protector who can‚Äôt switch.   He‚Äôs a big who can‚Äôt ball handle and break down a defense, pass, set picks, or really do anything other than catch and shoot.   People act like he‚Äôs al hortford before he went to the sixers but he‚Äôs probably not in the top 30 big men in the league today."
"I was going to say AD too but I guess he counts as a PF for the sake of this, but if you count him as a centre then he's on the list too.  After that it's... Brook Lopez? Myles Turner? Uhhh Andre Drummond?  And then we're starting to get reaaaaally thin from here lol"
"Pacers, actually. Sabonis is my favorite player in the league and is potentially underrated but he should not be any teams franchise star. He‚Äôs a second option, at best &amp; optimally a third option in a Pau Gasol role. Brogdon is maxed out potential wise, which is a solid but not good enough to win a title as your second best player either. Levert is unproven. Myles Turner is limited with a very specific skillset.    Craziest part is that all of their skill sets fit each other, ideally and it isn‚Äôt working. Myles and Sabonis fit like a glove with one another. If you were looking for a trade partner for either of those guys, you‚Äôd look for a front court mate that is similar to the person they‚Äôre already playing with lol."
He‚Äôs also quietly pretty much stopped talking shit. He definitely still talks about great he is but doesn‚Äôt really talk about other players anymore other than to compliment them.  Other than saying he dominates Myles turner which was pretty benign I can‚Äôt really think of anything he‚Äôs said this year
He's third in overall d-lebron behind Myles Turner and Gobert too. Btw.
Myles Turner might get it but Capela definitely deserves it
"Yes he is lmao. A Myles Turner esque shot blocker, really great lob catcher, and one of best passing big mans. Watch before u say shit like this lmao."
Because it‚Äôs significantly less impactful than playmaking on the individual level. Would you rather have Myles Turner or Dame?
"With LaMelo returning and Myles Turner likely being out for the remainder of the year, I don't see the Pacers catching them or beating them in the play in.  But yeah, they'd get swept by Philly or Brooklyn either way"
(Healthy) Myles turner to the heat. If we had a real thic boy rim protector all of our problems would be fixed
"He‚Äôs a 22 year old player. There isn‚Äôt a shortage of guys who put up 18 a game as 22 year olds.   Most of them do it without half the spacing that porter jr has. MPJ is one of those cases like Myles Turner where he sounds good in theory but not great in practice.    He seems like a siakam level player, and I think that siakam is a good contract to base him on.  And jaylen brown fleeced the Celtics with his deal. He could not dribble, defend, or shoot very well and he got 120/4. His agent deserves a blowjob for that.  Obviously he improved but yeah."
"They've really botched things so far. It looked so good after the AD trade and then they just made bad choice after bad choice. They could have had a good coach, not traded jru, and picked up myles turner(or any stretch 5) and been a really fucking good team. Instead they are here."
I think it's the myles turner effect even though these guys shoot a good percentage their volume is so low they create zero gravity so their shooting is deceiving.
That opening night injury was anything but a pure accident. Can‚Äôt blame that on him.   Hand injury. Pure accident. Ran into a LMA screen.   Ankle injury in the playoffs. Pure accident. Landed on someone foot after grabbing the rebound.   Foot sprain this season. Pure accident. Stepped on Myles Turner foot while driving to the rim.   Bad luck. A lot of it. It‚Äôs not like some nagging ankle problems or something like others injury prone players
"&gt; When your big is forced to switch onto the perimeter yet lacks the skills to defend stars out there, his rim protection is irrelevant. They drag him out to the perimeter and cook him from there. If they play a drop, stars shoot over the drop. In the playoffs, that type of shit gets targeted relentlessly.  There are a ton of defensive schemes that account for this, and once again guys like myles turner and capela can switch.  &gt; Gasol was anchoring a defense that was literally getting fried out of its mind by Klay due to this exact principle. They gave up 106 a game on 38% shooting from deep  what was the warriors, bucks, and sixers efficiency at the the rim? Funny how you're ignoring that."
Zion is special and the Pelicans got him when everyone wanted him.  The team isn't configured correctly.  Bledsoe and Adams are terrible fits next to Zion and Ingram is far from the ideal running mate.  Lonzo who was the only piece that fit well with Zion has been in trade rumors constantly this season.    I honestly thought Griffin would do better than this.  The fact that they wanted a second round draft pick over appeasing a 15 year vet who they KNOW has a popular podcast is ludicrous and insane.  They proved me wrong on some fronts.  I thought Brandon Ingram was a complete dud. He is now a high volume above average starter who they maxed.  They did a good job recruiting that doctor from the Suns to work on Zion's landing mechanics.    But they need to build faster for a serious top 4 playoff push by next season or they are squandering a generational talent.  That treasure trove of picks needs to be turned into Karl Anthony Towns.  They could even get Myles Turner or anyone who isn't Adams. Stretch Bledsoe - they guy is done and all impact metrics have him as a solid negative contributor.
So maybe Myles Turner isn't just a block chaser after all...
"&gt;	Capela and Myles Turner are better defenders than Bam??  There isn‚Äôt much evidence that Bam is a better defender than capela and Turner. Bam can‚Äôt rim protect like those guys can, which is the most important part of center defense. Jimmy has been a better defender than Bam this season too.   &gt;	Collin Sexton is better than Jayson Tatum btw.   If you wanna believe that go ahead. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find any good evidence for that tho."
"Capela and Myles Turner are better defenders than Bam?? Lmao now you're just saying ridiculous things and then when people point out how ridiculous they are you just respond with ""you're a Heat fan so you're biased and it doesn't matter.""  Collin Sexton is better than Jayson Tatum btw. If you disagree it doesn't matter because you're literally just a biased Celtics fan."
"Hmm, maybe a Portis or a Myles Turner? They're both above average shooting Cs."
It‚Äôs crazy how guys like Bam and Draymond impact the game at an incredible high level defensively yet they never garner the same DPOY attention as people like Myles Turner or Rudy Gobert  To be clear this isn‚Äôt a slight at Turner / Gobert rather that ppl see rim protection as the end all be all of defense.
"The new defensive scheme really highlights his defensive weaknesses. There is a clear fit issue with his and Myles, but our defense is really awful with Turner out"
This game will make me feel better when Capela is snubbed all nba defense for Myles Turner
"Myles Turner for sure. Dude is an absolute defensive beast, and really good offensively when he actually gets touches"
"The only stretch 5s who get any respect are KAT and Jokic. They could have Myles Turner out there and they'd have the same spacing issues.  There are also way more ways to create space than just shooting 3s. Screens and being an offensive rebound threat also creates space. There are 1 or 2 drives a game where Zion has an open look at the basket because the opposing center focuses on boxing out Adams rather than stopping Zion.  They've also only spent assets on two players since drafting Zion. That's Favors and Adams. They gave up George Hill, a late 1st and two 2nd round picks for both those players. That's not exactly squandering assets."
Idk. I personally think that a Myles Turner type player would fit better but you know better than me
"Yeah I get you there, maybe pairing him up with Myles Turner type players would be better than him since it would be a different look.   Plus idk personally I didn't see AG and Isaac be defensive first big men. But I could be wrong, would need to dive in some cyber metrics for that"
I think if we are healthy we are still like 1 or two pieces away from really knowing how good this team can be but even a 35 win season would be nice just we have something to build on after being injured for 2 years straight. We have an abundance of guards so trading one or two of them away for a 3/4 or even a Myles Turner type would really help out.
"correct, no one in the $30M+ range is really on the market. i honestly think we don't make any big moves.  other warriors fans keep talking about a Beal trade, but i don't see it. he's on a path to the supermax, and honestly the fit with Steph and Klay only really makes sense if Klay is a shell of himself (in which case we're honestly just fucked and will need to seriously rethink everything). I've also heard people mention Porzingis (doesn't make sense, Mavs aren't blowing it up), KAT, and Pascal (those two are more reasonable, but I still don't see it).  Your last option is to trade them for multiple non-stars, which I like more (unless there's something I'm misunderstanding about the Warriors' cap situation). Wiggins + Wiseman is $40M/yr, so two $20M/yr players looks like Jerami Grant and Myles Turner, both currently on teams who are out of the playoffs (but again, I don't think they're actually on the market right now... just saying the sorts of players you'd look for)"
Myles Turner lmao
Myles Turner is somehow the worst Embiid defender in the NBA it feels like Embiid does better against him than JAG centers
Ah yes Nba star Myles Turner
"There might not be as many injuries total, but it certainly has affected a lot more star players than in the past, which is why people probably think there have been more injuries.  Not even done with the season yet and we have had Steph, LeBron, AD, Mitchell, Embiid, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Murray, Dinwiddie, LaMelo, Hayward, Lavine, Jerami Grant, Wiseman, Oubre, Klay, Eric Gordon, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Drummond, Oladipo, Mitchel Robinson, and SGA miss significant time."
"it‚Äôs not horrible, but it‚Äôs never going to win you a game. Ayton‚Äôs defense can win you a championship   if Ayton can add a consistent three ball at like a Myles Turner rate and then go beast mode in the paint 12 times a game, he‚Äôs gonna be an uber efficient two-way stud. depends on the team, but i‚Äôm still curious to see how well Luka plays when he doesn‚Äôt lead the league in usage   Ayton‚Äôs game might be more conducive to championship winning"
Basically u want Enes Kanter or do u want Myles Turner
"Knicks 3 or 4 1st picks+ Barret.   Hawks 3 or 4 1st picks+ Hunter.  Pelicans Ingram+ 1st pick or Ball+ 3 or 4 1st picks.   Kings Hield or Barnes+ Holmes+ 2 1st picks.   Warriors don't have many picks to offer(maybe 2 first round) and Wiseman is injured now. I think for Wiseman+ pick they can aim for Myles Turner, but not KAT."
Embid was the consensus number 1 pick if it wasn‚Äôt for his injury.   He actually looked like he was a generational talent and worth waiting 3 years for.  Wiseman looks like he‚Äôll be Myles Turner at the absolute best right now. But he‚Äôs not even 10% of the way there.
Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis   I want an amazing defender who can post up and pass the ball. Plus then I don‚Äôt need to choose one for my team
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
Myles Turner and Brook lopez are way too high. Also putting 2 all stars at 15/16 lmao
At first I thought Myles Turner was way too high then i started thinking about all the other centers in the league and how big the drop off is after the first 5 and so now I dont think its that high any more
Myles Turner and Enes Kanter
"I would try to trade Wiseman for Myles Turner, but I wouldn't go crazy with additional picks in this. You can make Wiseman + Looney work."
"Embiid is good on defense and I‚Äôve watched him a lot too, but that just matters so much less than passing. Would you rather have Myles Turner or Dame as your centerpiece?  Advanced metrics seem to do a very good job of picking up the defensive impact of elite rim protectors like Gobert and Poeltl, so why don‚Äôt they for Embiid?   The reason Embiid was the frontrunner before he got injured was his seed, which is largely a product of his conference."
Lakers with Shaq? Offense is more important than defense but the difference between the two isn‚Äôt great enough to make up for how poor a rim protector Jokic is.    Your comparison falls apart because Myles turner isn‚Äôt in the same planet as Dame offensively. A better comparison would be would you rather have Luka or Kawhi in the playoffs. Most people are going to choose Kawhi even though Luka is a better playmaker. If given the option of Jokic Shaq AD or Embiid in the playoffs Jokic is my last choice despite being a great playmaker.
"You‚Äôre really understating the difference between below average passing/ballhandling and top tier playmaking. There‚Äôs a reason almost no championship teams have a #1 option who is as bad at passing and ballhandling as Embiid is.   Offense is also just way more important than defense on the individual level, as long as the defense is playable (Jokic‚Äôs is). Would you rather have Myles Turner or Dame?"
"Myles turner is worse than his stats though? just going on stats youd say he is the best defensive big in the league, he clearly is not. And he does nothing offensively which the stats show"
Better: Myles Turner  Worse: Domantas Sabonis
"I think nine of the roster spots are spoken for if they want it:  PG Steph, Dame  SG Harden, Paul George  SF Kawhi, Durant  PF Lebron, AD  C Bam  who would you have filling the other three spots on the roster? I was thinking something like this:  PG Chris Paul - good to have another floor general on the roster but might have bad blood with Harden  C Jarrett Allen/Myles Turner - backup big that prbly won't see much floor time with Bam and AD on the roster, but can be used against a big center like Jokic or Nurkic. Either of them would be a better fit than Drummond   SG Khris Middleton - thinking of a 3&amp;D guy to fill the last spot but not sure who to pick. It doesn't matter too much since whoever I pick here won't see much floor time unless someone gets hurt. I was also thinking of Tatum but he is still very young and can be picked for the 2024 team along with Zion, Beal, Trae, Fox, Mitchell, etc.  Didn't pick Butler because his offensive skills are redundant with all the ball handlers on the team already and his bad 3 pt shooting"
"&gt; but they won‚Äôt be able to just sit directly under the basket either.  Why not   Pick a Myles Turner game [this year last year year before doesnt matter youll see this all the time](https://twitter.com/C2_Cooper/status/1219668114163609600?s=20). Nobody guards him partly because he lets them get away with it. What driving lanes [is he helping to create](https://go.nba.com/07og), any chance a [defender gets to help off him to take away the drive they will](https://go.nba.com/lrx5) no team is gonna change up [their conservative drop coverage to take away driving lanes because of Myles Turner](https://go.nba.com/iruy).   The bigger point beyond making this about Myles Turner is that the standards to actually be a true floor spacing 5 who will actually cause defenses to change up how they defend in these kind of situations are really high. Can count on one hand the number of true 5s who actually do this. There are just far bigger priorities when looking at a C and this roster composition."
"Sure, and I still think the gap between them offensively is bigger than the gap between them on defense *from an impact perspective*. On the individual level, offense is just way more important than defense, even for a center, as long as the defense is playable like Jokic‚Äôs is. People act like offense and defense are 50/50 for importance, but it‚Äôs really more like 70/30. Otherwise Myles Turner would be as impactful as Harden. The Sixers are only marginally better defensively when Embiid plays- the nuggets have the biggest offensive droppoff in NBA history (121 ORTG vs 101 ORTG) when Jokic is off the court. His passing is just worth more points than 1-2 FG/game from rim protection."
"I meant that Centers would have to rotate off of Myles Turner to contest drivers. Right now they can just sit in the paint for the whole game, so it‚Äôs easy to contest drives.  I don‚Äôt think they will be pressing up on defense against Myles Turner, but they won‚Äôt be able to just sit directly under the basket either."
"&gt;We‚Äôll have a lot more driving lanes open if the Center has to rotate to help  No defense in the NBA is having guys rotate off drivers to account for Myles Turner.  Nobody guards him teams let him shoot they dont care. There's no actual ""stretch"" element to his game. Any argument for Myles Turner in NOP is purely defensive and then it comes down to is it worth it from an asset perspective(meh)"
"What about guys like Myles turner, Jaren Jackson , and brook lopez."
Myles Turner is probably number one.  Brook Lopez.  If KP ever stops sucking again it's him as well.
"&gt;Dude is invisible on offense now, and it‚Äôs not even entirely his fault at this point. No one tries to get him involved on offense, he just stands in the corner like a traffic cone.  The Myles Turner approach"
Myles Turner or Sabonis. Both a couple years younger than me
"From what I've heard recently (from Ian Begley), we seem to be targetting Kendrick Nunn then its Lonzo and Devontae Graham.   All year I've heard that Knicks were super interested in Myles Turner. I'd imagine we'd be swapping the younger and cheaper Mitchell Robinson+something else for Turner.  Lastly, Knicks seem to be just waiting for that 1 disgruntled star (like Harden this season).  Maybe Wizards decide to trade Beal and Westbrook next season b4 they lose them in free agency. Maybe Zach Lavine becomes disgruntled (doubt it). Heck, maybe Clippers move to Seattle and Kawhi asks out this offseason lol.  Honestly, i have only recently started thinking about the Knicks offseason so I'll probably change my mind a lot until August 3rd."
"Eh. He‚Äôs young. He‚Äôs only 25, 7‚Äô3, unique skill set, averaged 20/9 in the regular season and even more in the bubble. He‚Äôll definitely be a positive asset. Maybe a Wiggins+Wiseman trade (warriors were interested in KP and want to move both for another piece to pair with Steph), maybe something for Myles Turner since Indiana wants to move him. Who knows"
"Lopez, Capella, Ayton, Valanciunas, Vucevic, Adebayo, Gobert, Jokic, Embiid, Jarrett Allen, and Myles Turner are all better."
throw in like Simons and picks for Jimmy Butler. idk maybe do the Myles Turner trade everyone said Boston was gonna do.
I think this will be great for the Blazers but the more I think about it the more I think these Blazers could really use Myles Turner
"‚ÄúOver the last six seasons, the average missed time for an isolated high ankle sprain is roughly 10 games. However the variability is high and a quicker return is possible. For example, earlier this season Indiana‚Äôs Myles Turner was able to return to action from a high ankle sprain after just three days and one game lost.‚Äù Also using Michael Thomas as an example is pointless considering receivers depend on route running and football is an actual contact sport. I swear some lebron stans refuse to admit he isn‚Äôt as good at 36 and it‚Äôs funny. He‚Äôs clearly not in his prime anymore"
"I just want to see us do a deal centered around Terry Rozier for Myles Turner, who is apparently being shopped."
"Just wait until the offseason when Lakers fans are saying ""Kuzma for Myles Turner and a 1st who says no?"""
Myles Turner DPOY every year huh
"Is it too late to teach Rob too shoot? Gasol added it to his arsenal late in his career, maybe they could reach Time Lord this off-season. If he gets to Smart's level of League average, he'd already be making so much space. Myles Turner is about there as well, not much better or worse I think. It just needs to be enough to respect it, like a Theis"
I think Portland needs to move on from Nurkic and try to get a more defensive minded center like Myles Turner or Christian Wood. That plus a better coach I think could fix it
I could see CJ for Myles Turner as a starting point
"I think after that Hayward-Myles Turner issue during free agency our front offices might not really be on good terms, feel like a lot of shit-flinging went on during that"
"Oh, so now the Celtics want Myles Turner."
"Myles Turner, basically. A stretch 5 who can anchor their defense. Yeah, a lot of teams need that sort of player, but the Pelicans especially need it in the frontcourt next to Zion."
Maybe Kristaps? Myles Turner? A pack of Newports? A 2021 Knicks Playoffs T-Shirt? I don't give a fuck
"To me, Myles Turner is the new Solomon Hill. On paper, he checks all the boxes but he‚Äôs not good enough to be worth it. Besides, give me a wide open Adams dunk over a wide open Turner 3 any day."
"Myles Turner trade rumors already starting up too, just like every year."
"Turner is an excellent defender. He manages switches on smaller players well and blocks/contests loads of shots. He can get pushed around by a strong center like Embiid, but who doesn't? As long as you don't count rebounds as a defensive stats, Myles contributes all over that side of the floor."
"How the hell was wiseman thrown in to the deep end, he was on a better team than what 95% of lottery picks ever get. If the only way you value a center is points and rebounds you‚Äôre not going to build a great team. Myles turner was in the dpoy conversation before he was injured, and he brings efficient offense and spacing to the center position. A center that‚Äôs both elite at d and brings spacing and efficiency to an offense is immensely valuable."
"Myles turner is worth way more than wiseman, he‚Äôs a proven high level starter that any team would love to have with elite rim protection and a bit of spacing on offense. Wiseman‚Äôs value stems from being a high pick last year, but being horrible his rookie year has put a big dent in his value."
Myles Turner has some really glaring flaws like an inability to rebound and lately stay healthy.
"Pelicans should be in on this, Zion and Ingram need Myles Turner defensive and spacing presence."
Bro the celtics literally passed up Myles Turner + Doug McDermott + 1st round pick for Hayward last off season. Why would they want Myles Turner again lol?
Jaxson Hayes will be better than Myles Turner. No thanks.
"the only way I want Myles Turner is if he comes in a package with Brogdon that includes Kemba going out to Indiana.  If it's something like Kemba+TT+Time-Lord/Langford for Turner &amp; Brogdon then okay, otherwise no thanks to Turner's $60M remaining on his deal.  He's a straight up bad rebounder and kinda soft inside despite the block numbers, which admittedly would make him a great cultural fit for the Celtics but not exactly what I'd be looking to add to the team this offseason.   EDIT: full disclosure I think the Pacers laugh &amp; hang up on any deal like this, I don't think it is realistic I just don't particularly like Turner."
Wait Celtics would rather have a TPE than Myles Turner + McDermott and now they are gonna spend asset to get him? I thought Celtics think he's a bad contract and don't even want him for free?
They need a 5 who can protect the rim and shoot 3s (like a Myles Turner).  They need a PG who can hit a jump shot (almost everyone but Bledsoe).  In general they need some 3 and D wings to space the floor for Zion and help cover up his shortcomings.
Myles Turner is a good pick for this team  He is kind of a floor stretcher while also being a good anchor
To add: I think Myles Turner + someone like Danny Green would make the Pels scary
Myles turner
"the dream get would be myles turner but I thought he might be a little too expensive, youd probably have to give up DFS powell brunson picks and more.    id make that trade if im dallas but indiana might think thats not even enough  unfortunately you need to proceed with the assumption that KP is untradeable without giving up assets to shed his contract, but I think thats fine you can make it work with KP as long as you dont expect him to play center and instead find someone who will"
Trading for someone like Myles Turner would be a great move for the Mavs
"Start Beal, Bench Booker, Cut LaVine  ...  Clint Capela, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton"
"He‚Äôs just a really weird player in general. You need to play him at the five but need a squad of really good switching defenders to have the defense be elite.  If Mavericks can trade him for say- Myles Turner, who is both healthier and better, that would be huge for them."
Myles Turner or John Collins. He needs a reliable big and not some 7'3 shooting guard
KP swap for Myles Turner.
"Someone who can improve the Mavs interior defense and can shot block. Also, catch lobs. So Rudy Gobert but he will never leave Utah for Dallas, as Utah is better rn. Myles Turner is another shout. I doubt any team will be happy to take KP's bad contract."
"Myles Turner would be a HUGE upgrade for this team, but I get your point.  I'm not saying it was an easy thing to do, or else everyone would do it every single time. I'm saying they lost a little bit of talent every year and were not able do replace them, and now they have a very top heavy team, which by itself is not a problem, but doesn't seem to be enough in the current East, with other teams who have both more depth and more talent."
"Why does everyone here think you can just force a sign and trade? It literally does not work if another team with cap space comes along and offers more, which is exactly what happened with Hayward and Horford. In Kyrie‚Äôs case any GM would roll the dice on that team getting it together given their talent.   This is the most tired and ill thought out narrative on r/nba. If there was a sign and trade to be had better than taking on a mediocre Myles Turner salary then please tell me what it was"
Says  [here](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/gordon-hayward-myles-turner-and-the-celtics-failed-sign-and-trade-that-could-end-up-being-a-big-mistake/) that it was possible had he acted quickly.
[this is the article I read](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/gordon-hayward-myles-turner-and-the-celtics-failed-sign-and-trade-that-could-end-up-being-a-big-mistake/). It said Ainge was too slow and missed out.
Myles Turner.
Yup and not getting Myles Turner üòÇ
"They should've done this two years ago.   Keep Covington, Powell, and maybe Simons + DJJ for the right prices. Nurkic could probably stay, but I'm not sure if he's the optimal rim protector you want.   Try and snag Myles Turner, if Indiana is giving up. Get a Jrue Holiday type guy, hell maybe Marcus Smart is available. Do what you gotta do. Stop wasting Dame's fucking time. He's stupidly loyal for some reason."
"There were lots of moves that Ainge *didn't* make despite having the assets for.   Philly, Milwaukee, and Brooklyn are in much better places right now, while Miami and Toronto have gone further than the Celtics in recent years.   They could have traded for a bunch of different players. Kawhi, Jimmy, AD, and hell, even Myles Turner. Even smaller moves like other teams have done for guys like Gasol or Tobias Harris simply were never done by Ainge. He hoarded the cast majority of picks he had, of which the vast majority obviously didn't turn into much.  Ainge was really good at making trades when he felt value was objectively in his favor, but his risk aversion turned him away from tons of ppotential. Don't get me wrong, he was a really good GM, but I just think he was also very flawed."
"Sure thing. I‚Äôll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
The way I've always understood it is that Hayward was interested in the Pacers and the Pacers offered a S/T of Myles Turner and Doug McDermott. Ainge wanted Oladipo and Turner and talks stalled for so long that Charlotte swept in and offered Gordon a max.
"Ah okay, then yes these are different circumstances.  I think perception would be different if it wasn‚Äôt rumored that Indiana offered Myles Turner in a Gordon Hayward S&amp;T."
Still could've turned Hayward into Myles Turner and passed.
Not to mention Pacers literally offered Myles Turner for Gordon Hayward yet Ainge was being too greedy and wanted Aaron Holiday.
Imagine if Portland had like Myles turner and wing defenders
"Even if it was possible for it to have gone through, which it wasn't since hayward chose the hornets not the pacers, i doubt myles turner would have given this roster the ability to beat one of the most overpowered teams ever assembled."
I often think how the Boston Celtics botched the Myles Turner deal
"I think they‚Äôre a bit different though. Rudy is definitely an OG center, but Capela is more of a modern nba center that‚Äôs quick, athletic, can catch lobs, and can switch/defend the perimeter relatively well. You‚Äôll see a lot of the Capela type nowadays. Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, etc.   Maybe the only archaic part of Capela‚Äôs game is his inability to shoot"
"Trade Bryant, Bertans, and whatever draft capital for Myles Turner"
"He has the talent to be more than a system player, but we just don't need it.  And figuring out how to be a system player while adjusting to the NBA and the Warriors complicated motion offense and learning how to properly play defense from Dray and Ron Adams is just too much.  We needed Myles Turner last season when we could have gotten him."
"Or even better if we'd gone after Myles Turner, who was on the trade block.  Instead of the Oubre failure, Wiseman and maybe another asset of some kind we'd have had elite spacing and rim protection with a center who isn't a project."
"Eh, that's a lot of overlap with Dray.  I'd much rather have Myles Turner, fits better on our squad."
"&gt;How many centers can play all-NBA defense and shoot 35% from 3?     Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Al Horford (when he was on a contender)"
"Because Myles Turner,Gobert, Jonathan Isaac etc have a bigger impact on the game overall and the team than Duncan or any other really good shooter."
"I think that would be a great deal for the Mavs.  I also think Poeltl and Derrick White would be cool, or if the Pacers want to change it up I think Myles Turner would be a great fit."
I am. I really like how Fournier fits with this team and helps cover up some of our depth issues and I didn‚Äôt want us paying Myles Turner what he‚Äôs making anyway.
"The Celtics roster is so trash Jesus. Even knowing Kemba and Jaylen are out.   Like C‚Äôs fans, does Ainge need to go? You used your TPE on Fournier for fuck‚Äôs sake. You‚Äôve needed to trade for Myles Turner for like two years."
"2nd best shot blocker in the league, Myles Turner avg 3.4 bpg"
"That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt say it was easier to get blocks back then, it just was a different game. Just like how Eaton couldn‚Äôt get those averages today, a guy like Myles Turner probably wouldn‚Äôt block as many shots back in the 80s and 90s as he does today either. Tons of stuff to factor in."
"Zingus for Myles Turner, who says no?"
"For anyone who hasn't been following the Hawks this regular season, Capela's been so solid. He's been one of the best rim protectors (with Rudy and Myles Turner) but he gets so little recognition for it. He's a big part of why the Hawks are doing as well as they are."
Myles Turner?
"The top individual defenders against Jokic this year in no order were Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton (but mostly just in the 3rd/final PHX matchup), Clint Capela (in the first matchup with ATL, not the second), and ROBIN LOPEZ of all people. That's really been it this year."
Why your GM reject a trade that would have gave you Myles turner and FRP?
"Certainly. Heat got completely killed on the boards today and have been this entire series.   A Myles Turner, Christian Wood trade would be something to really push for this offseason."
I think Myles turner is super underrated as an asset potentially available this summer. Legit top 5 defender in the league with solid starter level offense and a bit of spacing. I dream of the kings making a move for him this year.
How about Myles Turner?
"Philly would never do that in a million years lmao.  Myles Turner for wiseman + lottery pick is more interesting. We need elite rim protection, and Turner has a decent shooting touch."
"I don‚Äôt want to make this a ‚Äúrim protector vs perimeter defender‚Äù argument, but a ‚ÄúWhat can Rudy do defensively vs what can Ben Simmons do Defensively‚Äù argument. Even if you have Gobert as the best rim protector in the league, you can ask Jakob Poeltl, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and some other rim protecting bigs to do what Gobert does and they would be able to do a good enough job doing it (not on the level that Gobert can). My point is that centers that protect the paint, play in drop coverage and contest shots at the rim are more common than guys that can guard all 5 positions like Ben Simmons can. There isn‚Äôt anything that guys like him and Draymond can‚Äôt do defensively and that defensive profile is extremely rare"
I'd go after myles turner or sabonis
"Nah I mean he came in 7th place iirc, it's not that much of a stretch to have him in your personal top.   *Increased his role and minutes and his FG% shot up from 47% to 51%.  *More than doubled his 3s per game to 1.5 made (he shot the 3 miles better than his teammate Siakam)  *Top 5 in blocks per game behind guys like Gobert and Capela  He basically put up Myles Turner starters type numbers off of the bench at an age where people did not expect players to make big leaps (28).  He's not in my top but I can't fault anyone for putting him in there"
"KP is not a bad comparison, maybe a little bit like Myles Turner but he really is like a unicorn because I really don't think there is a super similar player. He has a real funky release but it is very fast and effective and he's not just a spot up shooter. He shows flashes of driving/ball handling but has not been able to polish that yet. He's a skinny/gangly 7'0 (he grew an inch after the bubble), a little bit like young Giannis in that regard. He is an excellent shot blocker and shows flashes of being a defensive anchor, but he gets too jumpy and commits too many fouls. He's a poor rebounder and he struggles with true centers because of his lack of strength.  He really is a player who the sky is the limit for because if he gets stronger, gets better at defensive positioning/not fouling and works on his ball handling, he could look a lot like Giannis tbh but that is obviously a huge if. And this injury/setback has obviously affected his growth this year and he has played some real putrid minutes and gets frustrated because he's still rusty and will do stupid fouls.   This is a good article from the around midseason of 2020 that kinda showcased how versatile/talented he is https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/15/21065775/jaren-jackson-jr-highlights-memphis-grizzlies-stats-video-unicorn"
"Idk this year was anyway just developing year, so in offseason Wiseman can still get better, GSW alway needs center it was by far their weakest position so getting him made a lot of sense Lamelo had big IF efficiency-wise before draft he shot something like mid 30% in Australian league or wherever so everybody was like he canplaymake but can he be good shootingwise with his form, his brother had breakout year this season also so I thought Melo was at really high position taken, so idk with all we knew if it was worth to take him 2nd, the best thing if GSW could have done is to ship 2nd pick and get someone like Jarret Allen or Myles Turner someone whose celling is lower but is nba ready. But picking Wiseman was no brainer"
For sure Biyombo and Zeller should both be backup centers. I hope for your team that you're able to get Myles Turner from the Pacers. I think he would fit in perfectly on your team.
Myles Turner - blocking shots into fastbreaks
"If I was the Warriors, I would really look into trading Wiseman, their pick and the minny and perhaps Wiggins (or some combination of these assets) for someone that can help Steph win now.           They can definitely get Myles Turner or maybe even someone like Pascal Siakam if they are willing to part with some or all of those assets."
Myles turner can stretch the floor. Valuncunias is on his last year
Wiseman for Myles turner
"Sounds like we're getting Myles Turner and Brogdon for Oubre, Wiseman, Paschall, a pick.   That or somehow get Lonzo"
"His value isn't as low as this sub thinks. This sub has been coming up with dumbass trades for Wiseman all season, like swapping him and picks for Myles Turner, when Turner is 5 years older than Wiseman and averages only 1 more point and 1 more rebound than him this season."
I hear that James Wiseman is the next David Robinson....  one Myles Turner plz.
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there‚Äôs also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you‚Äôre never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami‚Äôs, Indy‚Äôs, or Boston‚Äôs (or even Brooklyn‚Äôs or Philly‚Äôs) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That‚Äôs a lot of important guys from the East‚Äôs playoff picture and that‚Äôs not even mentioning what‚Äôs gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that‚Äôs gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don‚Äôt tear it down (which they 100% shouldn‚Äôt they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he‚Äôs earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don‚Äôt wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying ‚Äúhey, we broke in to the 5 seed‚Äù because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it‚Äôs a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the ‚Äúcontending in the East‚Äù tier"
"The most appealing basketball, for me, is people like Myles Turner and Clint Capela. Violent paint defense and aggressive blocks."
They win this game if they have Myles Turner. Oh well
Did you forget that Myles Turner was making a case for DPOY this season up until about April?
The inability of fans to be objective when it comes to their players is maddening   Myles Turner has also been one of the league's best rim protectors over the last few seasons. Is he on Rudy Gobert's level?
Myles Turner isnt worth that LOL
Kleber can be an integral piece to a great FC and Powell DSJ be a solid rotation guy. I think we need Myles Turner
"You guys think the game falls into neat little categories like that lol the offense ran through Horford, high pick and roll, dribble hand offs, smart plays, great positioning, ball handling for a big man, great positioning, leadership, and even though Turner can shoot some, Horford was a better shooter too. The only thing Turner is better at is shot blocking specifically (not even defense as a whole), and athleticism.   Current Myles Turner is really only special at shot blocking"
They would've had the first all-black Team USA if Myles Turner wasn't out with injury.
Ingram can easily be a number 1 on a playoff team. I‚Äôll make one like you did.  PG: Malcolm Bronson  SG: Lonzo Ball  SF: Brandon Ingram  PF: Bobby Portis  C: Myles Turner
Myles Turner is a Myles Turner type imo
"Klay is coming off back-to-back major rehab injuries that will likely leave him slow, Steph's only getting older, same with Dray.  &gt; if you have the wing help he's fine  they won't. they need a myles turner type."
"Magic ranked top 10 defensively each of his last two full seasons, if you have the wing help he's fine and GSW has the wing help.  But ok replace him with someone else, Myles Turner or whoever.  I'd still max out on talent given the timeline"
"Depends on how well they fit. If it came down to Siakam, or Myles Turner and a solid bench player, or Vucevic for Wiggins and Looney (and picks or something, but those don't matter for this year)? Absolutely, I'd do them."
"If not for Love, who would‚Äôve made the team? Myles Turner? Brook Lopez? Drummond? Doesn‚Äôt look that bad now does it."
"Prejudice and racism aren't the same. What Jalen said was prejudice but not quite racism. I think what he is saying is ""true"" but not the best way to say it. If he would have said nepotism then the quote would have sounded better.  He equated someone no longer being qualified for a job but being selected anyway to how he would view himself in that position. Let's face it, both men and women Team USA basketball is a political choice rather than selecting the best players that want to play for that year. K Love has quit on Cleveland more than once, why should he get selected over another younger American big man? Myles Turner, John Collins, or Julius Randle would have been a much better choice."
"Randle, Jarret Allen, and Myles Turner (if healthy) would all be better big man fits for Team USA than washed up KLove and they have all played for Team USA before.   Nerlens Noel and Richaun Holmes were also born in the states, but I couldn‚Äôt find any record of them playing for Team USA before at any level."
"Yeah I think he's more in the 9-22 range with a lot of room to debate.  My top 8 centers this season would be Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Adebayo, KAT, and Valanciunas. I don't think you can really put Ayton above any of them.   He's in that second tier with Kanter, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Porzingis, Ibaka, Zubac, Christian Wood, Robert Williams, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Nurkic, Steven Adams, Theis, and Al Horford.  I think Ayton is probably around the 12th-16th best center in the league, though if he keeps up the form he's had these playoffs next season I could see him making a jump into the top 10."
I think it'll be a big from a team in the East. My bet is Myles Turner if its straight up or Lauri Markkanen plus pick swap with the Bulls if GSW can't get much value for Wiseman.
PG- Derrick Favors  SG- Myles Turner  SF- Clint Capela  PF- Udoka Azubuike   C- Rudy Gobert
We see your small ball and raise you an army of giants lumbering around the court looking to block everything. Any chance we get Myles Turner and Clint Capela to come round out the starting 5 centers.
Myles Turner doesn‚Äôt need Wiggins to be part of the trade
If you can get Myles Turner you do it because he makes more sense with Draymond but idk why Indy would want Wiseman.
"Fair enough, Siakam could be the difference maker we need. This all really relies on how much Klay returns to form. If Klay comes back close to what he was before, I think Wiggins is good enough for us to compete for a title. In that case, we‚Äôd want an upgrade at C (Myles Turner?). Many unknowns on the Warriors side (Klay‚Äôs health, Wiseman‚Äôs potential and time to begin to reach it."
In my *hypothetical* it would be Myles Turner-Ben Simmons-Covington-Powell-Lillard.    Covington shot 37.9% from three this year. He's been very inconsistent but he wasn't a bad shooter last year.
"My hope for Portland is they manage a CJ for Ben Simmons trade, and then try and get Myles Turner at all costs. If you manage to keep Covington/Powell, that's a beautiful starting lineup, plenty of size, great defense, and only 1 bad shooter - Ben."
He's a center who plays PF because he shares the floor with Myles Turner
No offense but why would Dame want to go to Indiana to play with Myles Turner and Caris Levert?
Dame Irving Harden Durant Myles Turner why not
"eh, two bigs who can't guard the perimeter is a killer. also, our best player is KAT, maybe the most skilled inside-outside scoring big man of all time. let's lean into it. he's not great on defense, but let's just outscore everyone. bring in floor spaces, and jjuuuustttt enough defending to get by.   Myles Turner clogs the lane with another non-spacer and occupies the same space on defense. he'd be great as a backup, but obviously is too good to only be a backup"
"If they want to accelerate the timeline like that, they have more work to do, ie pawn off Steven Adams on someone and try to get Myles Turner"
"this is a line up i would love to see. myles turner is a great defender, and can hit the 3."
"I don't think players like Jae Crowder is going to do much to fix the Wolves defense. Rim protectors are so much more impactful than wing defenders, and Myles Turner is one of the best while also being able to knock down the occasional 3. Rim protection takes away by far the best shot in the game, the layup and dunk. With Kat being able to play on the perimeter, I don't see how Myles Turner would be a bad enough fit that we don't try to trade for him. He would impact this team more positively than negatively."
"Give Luka any big man that mastered the pick'n'roll and he'll have 11 assists per game. Kristaps is too soft for Luka. Doncic needs a big man that matches his intensity and will to win and exceed expectations whenever they share the floor.   If the mavs can trade porzingis for Myles Turner that would be a good trade. Myles Turner getting spoon fed looks by a premier playmakers is capable of reasonably spacing the floor. He'd be a plus on defense, he hustles for rebounds and played solid in the p'n'r with Brogdon who's, no offense, not in the same stratosphere as Luka.   Indiana gets a guy who wants to be the leader. With more touches and the offense catered to his game I'm sure Kristaps would have a good season with the pacers. If he pans out they're back into playoff contention and if he doesn't they can start a soft rebuild"
"Pacers would have Dame, Myles Turner, and TJ Warren left over. He'd be in a worse position than in Portland."
1. Bring Leandro Bolmaro over 2. Re-sign Vanderbilt 3. Trade for Myles Turner 4. Trade for Marvin Bagley
"CJ + picks for Simmons  Nurkic + filler or picks for Myles Turner, in a 3 way trade where Nurkic heads to a team that needs a center   Norm re-signs; grab a veteran PG in FA and Noel for the MLE (unlikely but hey - maybe we sign and trade)  Lillard/Norm/Simmons/RoCo/Turner with Simons/DJJ/Melo/Noel + vet PG off the bench"
"Draft moses moody at pick 5, trade 8 + RJ Hampton + another first for myles turner"
"You forgot RFA Malik Monk on the Hornets list. Wanamaker is UFA.  Priority #1 should be getting a solid starter at C, or at least a young player with a good chance at being one. If trading for a good one requires pick #11 and/or Hayward going back the other way, do it. (*coughs Myles Turner's name*)  Priority #2 should be bringing back RFAs Malik Monk and Devonte' Graham. Anything under $15M a year should be an automatic match for either player. None of our other FAs except Zeller will receive more than a minimum offer elsewhere.   My ideal off-season is trading Hayward+#11 for Turner+Lamb, and having ~$15M to go after a SF in FA, or stay above the cap, re-sign Zeller as the backup C, and use the MLE on a solid role player SF.   Turner/Zeller/Carey/Richards    Washington/McDaniels   Bridges/Otto Porter MLE (or Oubre at $15M and no Zeller)   Rozier/Monk   Ball/Graham   and picks 56 and 57 and mins to use as roster filler. I guess one or both Martins can be kept too, but preferably not playing.   That's just about the best case scenario for next season. Aside from the backup C and SF that we use cap space on, the whole team would be 27 or younger, Rozier being the oldest of the bunch, most of them being =&lt;23"
"The problem is that he's a low volume shooter. Bud and the Bucks love funneling looks to guys who aren't likely to take enough of them.    Thats how they shutdown the Celtics in 2019, they dared Al Horford to become a high volume 3pt shooter and he wouldn't do it. The Bucks also defend Myles Turner and the Pacers in a similar fashion"
You need to give team 2 one of Mikal Bridges/Jae Crowder or Myles turner to make this more fair. I think team 1 easily wins with these teams
I have no idea. I would take moody at 5 and then trade 8 and a couple other assets for myles turner. Then tank again next year and hopefully draft patrick baldwin jr.  Fultz/Moody/PBJ/Issac/Turner is my dream scenario
"I mean, most big can shoot nowadays. Myles Turner? Brook Lopez?"
"If your point is rim protector = playoff failures then you‚Äôre completely wrong. You need at the very least a defensive anchor. Trading Kyrie for a defender shores up the Nets‚Äô main weakness, without sacrificing much offence, since yall still got Harden and KD.  Not all rim protectors can‚Äôt shoot. Look at Myles Turner for example"
Dawg we would take Myles Turner 10/10 over Rozier lol
"It‚Äôs Beverly, Danny green, Wiggins, Julius randle and Myles turner"
"In 2020, having a PF who operates inside is not sth wanted. Defensively he is not that good to stay with perimeter players either. Not a good with. Neither Brogdon or Myles Turner seems to be elite talent either. Brogdon-Turner are an average starters for pg and c position. Turner is not going to stop Embiid-Giannis for you but he ll give decent minutes. Brogdon would not give you Kyrie offense.  This team can improve with Carlisle for the regular season. They can have a season like Knicks had. But I dont expect them to advance playoff rounds. Max would ne 2nd round if you ask me."
"I think they just wanted another big body.  Last US team was Plumlee so I guess it's better than that.  I don't even know which American big is more deserving.  I know people are suggesting Myles Turner, but he was ass in 2019.  He was so bad, that they put in Jaylen Brown at the 5 to guard France's centers.  Useless on both ends."
"Doesn't surprise me, whenever I watched the Pacers it was the Brogdon and Sabonis show with Turner just standing in the corner. I'd be so fed up if I was Myles"
"I think we've had good opportunities to even just tank or gather better assets for a single year and not taken it - first one that comes to mind is the year PG broke his leg and then David West put us on his back to take us to the 9 seed. We should have used that year to just recalibrate and get a better pick. That said, that 2015 year was when we took Myles Turner and pretty much everyone who was taken over him has proven to be a bust except for KAT and Dlo- and we still passed on Booker, so maybe it wasn't so bad.  And then this year, when we had half the roster injured a terrible coaching, no crowds for 3/4 of the year   I don't necessarily think we need to do a long term blow it up, because the market and the owner but there's been great opportunities just to chill for a season and get a good pick or make a couple of moves to improve the ceiling and then we could still be on our bullshit the rest of the time."
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
take myles turner off the pacers and sabonis gets eaten alive
"I had Myles Turner on my fantasy squad and boy, it was tough seeing him being left in the corner to dry when Brogdon/Sabonis run their 10 straight PnR action."
im still holding out on myles turner for gordon hayward :(
How is Myles turner or Jarrett Allen snubbed for k love? They are garbage man
"I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad player, but when you already have so much perimeter firepower, why not bring on another big (Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Jarrett Allen)"
"I'm surprised that they didn't at least toss in one more traditional big like KAT or Myles Turner in case matchups dictated it.   I guess Jokic and Embiid won't be playing though, so maybe they just don't think it will be necessary."
"Crack turned Lawrence Taylor into the best defensive player of all time in football, maybe it would boost Myles Turner to that level"
Myles Turner?
So does Myles Turner if he gets traded to Sacramento
Has potential to be Myles Turner on crack also Green could be 2 after 1 there's 3 players that we know will get drafted at that range but we don't know what order they will be drafted in
"I was surprised to find out that KAT plays for the Dominican Republic, really would prefer him to Love for adding size. Other people I think would fit better than Love include, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, and Mitchell Robinson."
"Giannis at 15 brings this draft up a *lot.* Lowkey I think 2015's not looking so hot either, now that Kristaps is kind of meh and DLo hasn't really proven much since that one year with the Nets. Not much depth in that one either, it's Booker and KAT and then DLo and Kristaps and then, like, Kelly Oubre? Terry Rozier? Myles Turner?"
Myles turner or Allen? No idea why k love is there
I personally don't think Myles Turner is the right guy but there aren't a lot of great fits unfortunately. The guy I would love is Maxi Kleber. He gives up size to Turner but he's a better shooter and a more versatile defender.
Keep on hoping lol  Everybody wants Myles Turner for peanuts
"They have plenty of guys that can shoot outside Luka and had another good offense this year and honestly they put up a bunch of points against the Clippers and actually shot better as a team than the Hawks have.  Their main problems are no playmaking outside Luka, no defense especially no rim defense.  They were absolutely torched at the rim by the Clippers and Kawhi which allowed them lots of kick outs for open 3's which the Clippers then shot at a 41% rate.  Simmons providers them defensive help and additional playmaking.  If they could find a way to get Myles Turner they could really have something going with Luka, THJ, DFS, Ben, Turner. 3 guys who still provider great space and then Ben can occupy his dunker spot and doesn't really have to carry and offensive load as the primary ball handler."
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it‚Äôs not the league‚Äôs fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here‚Äôs a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there‚Äôs a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
"Get a serviceable big man like Myles Turner or Christian Wood. Use Wiseman &amp; picks as trade bait. If that roster stays healthy, you have a proper team, especially given the defensive strides 2WayWiggins has made."
Number seven in a package for Myles Turner.
If we're trading Myles Turner do you really think we'd want ANOTHER big man back?
Would you like one Myles Turner for the low cost of PJ Washington and a first round pick instead?
"If the warriors could trade wiseman, and maybe 7 or 14 for Myles turner, I think they should do that in a heartbeat. Pairing him with dray would all but guarantee they‚Äôre a top 3 defense, along with being a solid offensive fit."
"4 Teamer &amp; Works on Trade Machine:  Raptors:   - Porzingis - Malcolm Brogdon  Mavs:   - Myles Turner  - Rodney Hood  Pacers:  - Kemba Walker - OG Anunoby  OKC:   - Kyle Lowry - Draft Picks (Presti, duh)  Roast me if this is stupid. Thought of this in 2 min. Go Cers."
Would love to see a Myles Turner on this team if he‚Äôs recovered from his injury(s).
"If the hornets got #1 and took Cade, they could be loaded. I‚Äôd try and swap Hayward for Myles Turner + a pick. Then I‚Äôd try to swap Rozier and Biyombo for Tobias.   LaMelo/Cade/Miles Bridges/Tobias/Myles Turner would be nuts with Graham, Monk, PJ, Zeller, and the Martins off the bench"
It has to be Myles turner or Jarrett Allen right. Both should make it over k love
I heard rumors Myles Turner is available
Middleton said yes?  That's some good shit.  Dump KLove though and just throw in Myles Turner.
"I'd guess another big man, maybe Myles Turner?"
"I suggested a CJ - Simmons trade on the nbadiscussion subreddit and largely got laughed at because the 76ers were the #1 seed at the time.   I think it makes sense. Simmons can be a secondary playmaker, help the defense, and has the ultimate deep threat (next to Curry) to help alleviate spacing issues.    If they manage to keep Covington/Powell in the CJ/Simmons trade (assuming it happens lol) then they can run Lillard/Powell/Covington/Simmons + any decent rim protector, and they're looking like a good defensive team.    If I was them, I'd throw some firsts + whatever else you can offer and try for Myles Turner. That starting 5 would be amazing, obviously depth would be a problem, especially after completing those 2 hypothetical trades."
"I don't really see it honestly. Maximizing Ben requires a true stretch 5 and the only guy that really comes to mind there is KAT. Myles is a decent shooter for a center but his percentages aren't amazing.   We already have issues with a Turner/Sabonis frontcourt, adding Ben to that would be ridiculous."
"In hindsight the hate on Myles Turner is kind of ridiculous, especially when you consider the transactions made to get Kemba off the team in exchange for Al Horford who fits that stretch 5 role.  The issue with the TPE though is that if Boston wants to use it they'll most likely have to continue attaching some sort of assets in any transaction. As you mentioned, Fournier still cost some second rounders and he's an UFA. I know the chance of not re-signing him is slim, but they also had to attach a first rounder to Kemba to clear up cap space to hopefully re-sign him.   I think they have like 10M of the TPE left and I'm curious to see what they have to fork over to get somebody of note back."
I think New Orleans considers that offer - they desperately need a stretch 5 but those are in rare supply.  Everybody wants Myles Turner but nobody has any packages that are worthwhile for him.
"I know I‚Äôm really late to this discussion, but apparently Ainge was looking for a 3rd team to trade Myles Turner to because they didn‚Äôt want him and his contract for 3 years. McDermott also made $7 million. The Pacers deal wasn‚Äôt really favorable to the Celtics if they didn‚Äôt want Myles Turner. And it seemed like no one else in the league wanted Myles Turner as well. Only reason people made an issue out of it is because the Celtics had an issue with bigs, and people kept saying we would ‚Äúlose Hayward for nothing‚Äù. Overall I think it worked out because the Celtics got Fournier who fit the team‚Äôs needs better, at the cost of some 2nd round picks."
Just stay healthy that‚Äôs litterally it lol. If they come back with the same roster next year they will win the championship if they stay healthy. Bucks got a massive break being able to face the hospital Nets  But I would also try to grab a big. Maybe try for Myles Turner
"Agreed. Thought about Murray and Christian Wood myself  PG Tyrese Haliburton   SG Jrue Holiday   SF Khris Middleton   PF Ben Simmons   C  Myles Turner   The smart play is probably to put Murray at one of the guard spots but I like the kid and think he would flourish with these players. I envision Simmons running the offense and defense ala Draymond while having better coverage on D from Turner and the Junkyard Dog, Jrue Holiday."
"Both Bogdanovic‚Äôs, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner"
Use his lottery pick to get Suggs/Green/Mobley   Cash in his other firsts for Simmons and Myles Turner.
"I don‚Äôt think you can call it a lost art. 21.3% of Booker‚Äôs points these playoffs are from midrange. Of players with at least 4 games and 15 plus mpg, six guys have a higher percentage of their points from midrange than that, nine last year with a higher percentage than Booker‚Äôs now, and eleven the year before.  This year its CP3, KD, Beal, Ish Smith, D‚ÄôAndre Hunter, and Carmelo in that order.  Last postseason, it was Carmelo, Middleton, Seth, CP3, Markell‚Äôs Fultz, Gallinari, Terrence Ross, Trey Burke, and Tyler Johnson.  Luke Kennard, Demar, Monte Morris, Collison, Schroeder, Myles Turner, Ish Smith, Aldridge, KD, Lou, and Klay were the ones in 2019."
"No, I get it. Hypothetically, the best case scenario is a 14 point, 7 rebounding PF (Turners best season) and a Ben Simmons that‚Äôs stat stuffing, but is an offensive liability in the post season.  Worst case scenario is Ben with the yips and an okay-ish Myles Turner that‚Äôs giving you slightly more than what Portland already has.  Is that worth a CJ McCollum is the question. For me, I don‚Äôt think so, but I could understand how the best case scenario would be enticing."
"Great work! My only issue would be Myles Turner below Richaun Holmes. Both great bigs, but Turner's the better and much more versatile player."
Trade for Ben Simmons. Hire mda. Try to try for Myles turner using nurkic. Resign norm.  Dame/norm/roco/simmons/ turner. That is a balanced squad with shooting all round for Ben. Dame is the ultimate leader as well.
"Does anybody think the sixers would go for a Rubio/naz/culver and two 2nds for simmons and shake Milton?  Any wolves fans that want to slander me for trading naz away, I would only do this if we landed a guy like Portis or traded Beasley in a package for Myles turner"
"I really thought this draft was gonna be an all timer. I thought KAT, Winslow, DLo and D Book was gonna be HOF level players who would change the fortunes of their teams while players like Okafor, Cam Payne and Myles Turner would be all star caliber players."
"What if Boston signs and trades Gordon Hayward to Indiana for Myles Turner, Doug McDermott and a 1st round pick from the Pacers? Oh wait, sorry, Boston turned that down last year cause they wouldn't do it without Oladipo thrown in üòÇ"
Myles turner is hands down the best Ben Simmons fit in the league. But why do the Pacers need Nurk and sabonis?
That‚Äôs why we flip Nurk for Myles Turner
"Sure, the trade is more for Myles Turner than Simmons, and Simmons might succeed in a situation where he‚Äôs not the PG, but I think Portland would want more for CJ, which is basically another Lillard in offense production. Any team would shore up their starting PG with CJ. That‚Äôs worth a lot."
"&gt;I‚Äôm unsure of using this past season as a metric just due to the chaos at all levels, but as far as Myles Turner goes I‚Äôm unsure of whether he is doing his own thing or his coaches have played him that way. Either way he isn‚Äôt compatible with Sabonis and having both on the court turns your defense to Swiss cheese as the league gets more skilled at all positions.  He's been the same his whole time I've watched him- under a couple different coaches now. I can see maybe Pop utilizing him, but not many more coaches   &gt;Fuck it, trade Myles Turner and Brogdon for Ben Simmons . I‚Äôm sure Philly would be happy to have him backing up Embiid, and Brogdon provides high level defense with existent offense.   Indy ain't doing that trade lmao. They aren't gonna give up a guy who just scored 20 PPG for then last season for a guy like Simmons who won't even take 3 on 2 transition buckets to the rim. Sabonis is a great passer and needs somebody who will go to the rim alongside him"
"Here is my three team trade idea.  Portland gets: Simmons and Myles Turner  PHI gets: CJ and Covington  Indiana gets: 1st rnd pick from Portland, 1st rnd pick from PHI, Derrick Jones Jr., Henry Giles III, George Hill (expiring deal that makes the money work).  I think that's pretty fair for everyone involved. Portland (assuming Powell stays) and PHI possibly improve (if the chemistry goes well for either) to more contender level, Indiana treads water and stockpiles picks and solid young rotation players i return for their 4th best player."
"Bam's the best IMO, then probably BroLo and/or Myles Turner after him. Definitely is still the weakest positional pool for the US, but even so that's still a solid rotation of guys. Throw in guys that can play small ball minutes at the 5 like KD, Zion, Draymond, etc., and we'll be more than set there."
"CJ and Covington for Simmons and a 1st rnd pick makes the most sense for both teams. Works money wise and player wise.   CJ-Embiid pick n roll would be absolutely nasty. Playmaking wise CJ is better in the half court and pick n roll than Simmons, who's great ability is in transition. It's hard to run both when your ball handler can't shoot. A CJ, Seth, Covington, Harris, Embiid starting lineup is an improvement in my opinion.  Portland needs a dominant perimeter defender and 2nd ball handler (assuming with no CJ). Lillard and Powell give them plenty of perimeter offense. if Portland somehow land Myles Turner. Potentially they can use one of their 1st rnders and the PHI one from the CJ trade idea plus maybe a few decent young guys as well, it might work. A lineup of Lillard, Powell(resign), Simmons, Turner, Nurkic/Kanter(resign) would be a true contender."
"I agree that Sabonis isn‚Äôt a good defender, improving but not close to good, but everyone besides Turner is a average/bad defender and besides Warren there isn‚Äôt anyone on that team that can guard a good offensive wing. Sabonis is part of the defensive problem, but so is everyone else not named Myles Turner. Y‚Äôall always give players a free ride into the paint cuz Holiday bros, Brogdon, levert, and McDermott get beat easily"
"I‚Äôm unsure of using this past season as a metric just due to the chaos at all levels, but as far as Myles Turner goes I‚Äôm unsure of whether he is doing his own thing or his coaches have played him that way. Either way he isn‚Äôt compatible with Sabonis and having both on the court turns your defense to Swiss cheese as the league gets more skilled at all positions.  Fuck it, trade Myles Turner and Brogdon for Ben Simmons . I‚Äôm sure Philly would be happy to have him backing up Embiid, and Brogdon provides high level defense with existent offense.   For Indiana they can run Ben at PF alongside Sabonis at center, and maybe they get lucky with the lottery and can end up drafting a high level point guard who can throw lobs to Ben. At this point I just don‚Äôt want to see Ben waste his career as a point guard when as a big he‚Äôd be unstoppable and hide his limited half court offense through pick and rolls to the rim. Provided he doesn‚Äôt just crowd the paint for everyone else of course"
"&gt;There‚Äôs gonna be at-least 15 teams interested in getting Myles Turner and I can‚Äôt wait to see the bidding war.  I don't know why  His blocks come from good help rotations but he isn't a very good 1 on 1 defender  He CANT guard bigs who have their back to the basket. He gets eaten alive in the low post  While he can hit the 3, he has almost no back to the basket offense either. And he is often a timid shooter, sometimes barely taking 3 shots a game- he generally will stand outside the arc, little offball movrment, and not try to involve himself in the offense"
Place your bets now folks. Here‚Äôs mine.  Dame -&gt; Knicks (but I want the Mavericks to get him)  CJ -&gt; Celtics  Simmons -&gt; Spurs  Lowry -&gt; Sixers  Lonzo -&gt; Bulls  Kevin Love -&gt; Literally anywhere else please  John Wall -&gt; Clippers via buyout  Myles Turner -&gt; Wizards  Derozan -&gt; Sixers
"Well, I also wonder why they want to trade myles so bad. I'd honestly keep turner over sabonis."
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7.

"still can't believe we drafted Frank over Winslow (the guy I wanted), Booker, and Myles Turner smh, and turned down that package of late 1sts... everyone knew this is what his career was going to look like except our FO"
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
" &gt;Durant, Kemba, Brook etc.  One of those people is on the team...  &gt;Love's Olympic experience a decade ago doesn't mean a thing.  You know they only do the Olympics every 4 years right?  &gt;The US Olympic team would be much better off with Myles Turner than they would Love.  I don't think it really matters all the much."
"Probably worse? Bruh it‚Äôs obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
Myles Turner is better than KLove at this point.
"Myles Turner, Brook Lopez or Jarrett Allen. That's the best I can do."
"Brooks Lopez, A.D., Myles Turner. Could argue a.d. is a four, but can play 5."
Should be Myles Turner instead of Love
Yea how is Myles turner and Jarrett Allen not inside the team
Carlisle was promised some GM powers if he signed with them iirc. So any move done by the Pacers concerning the roster will have to be approved by him   I do think Myles Turner is gone and Sabonis finally gets to play C.
Myles Turner is a better defender than Brook Lopez and Kevin Love.
They gotta throw in multiple firsts + Kira and Steven Adams for Myles Turner
Notable snubs from notable snubs being Myles Turner and Aaron Gordon sounds about right. I'd add Wiggins to that group.
I know we not blaming white for that group being ass when we had the whole Celtics starting 5 playing worse than Joe Harris and Myles Turner getting dad dicked by Gobert lol
"They should go full-on youth movement.  Start by dealing Derozan for one of Simmons, Myles Turner, John Collins or Markannen.   They pray for a shot at Chet Holgren, Emoni Bates or Victor Wembanyama."
"If only NO didn't trade for Adams. I don't understand why they haven't gone after Myles Turner. He's not an amazing shooter by any means, but at least provides a little bit of spacing and can anchor the defense. Zion can handle the bigger post players while Myles can protect the rim. The fit just seems so good."
If I guess who the other players we are inquiring about it would be Myles Turner and Larry Nance Jr.
Wait. You mean giving 2 1sts for Myles Turner???
"TJ Warren, TJ McConnell, Myles Turner   Probably wouldn‚Äôt need to include Wiggins for that and pick 14 for that   Wiggins and 14 for Hield"
"yeah, but Tatum turned his ankle and didn't finish out the tourney, also frankly I like this team much better than the 2019 roster.  A good chunk of that roster is significantly below this squad (Plumlee, Harris, Smart, Barnes, Myles Turner for sure and also Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba &amp; Derrick White)"
"You mean Oladipo with Sabonis, Myles Turner, and the Head Coach who brought the Hawks to 6 games against the Bucks this year?"
Myles Turner is a better defender?
"It's really not that bad, he's been on the olympic  team before and who else were they going to choose at his position? If your choice is between him and Myles Turner the gap is not that large and experience wins out"
"As a Knicks fan, Damian Lillard plus Myles Turner."
"I'd see about giving Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, John Collins, or Christian Wood a run"
"probably right. I think one majoorrrr caveat though, that people have a hard time grasping, is tiers for centers. the top tier is the superstar tier (Jokic, Embiid), then you have you're ""really good tier"" (KAT, Bam, Ayton, maybe a few others), then you have a huugggeeee tier of more flawed guys (eg. can rebound and defender but can't shoot, athletic rim runners but can't defend, etc)  what people miss is that you can replace 70% of the production in that ""really good tier"" for pennies on the dollar. it doesn't mean that Ayton, or Capela, or Myles Turner aren't really good, but it means their value over replacement isn't as high as you think, especially compared to other positions (eg. where a top 10 wing player is almost worth a max in terms of value over replacement)"
"Jerami Grant was not shooting the way he is now and is probably going to look for more money, Bobby Portis is playing on a championship team and could easily get paid more, but some players thrive off of bench roles and taking the back seat so idk but Myles Turner is definitely the best non-rookie contract in the NBA. But again, John Collins is 23 and you pay for potential as well when dealing with a player like that. He can very possibly get better at a lot of things considering his age and the current coaching staff"
"Did anyone predict the Suns' roster would be in the finals? The Bucks where a big toe away from going out the second round to KD and friends, and a Trae young injury away from potentially not even making the finals (I know that this goes both ways). Did anyone look at the Hawks roster and think to themselves wow that's an ECF team? Myles Turner was being basically given out for free last season, we could have had a Jrue-Lonzo-Zion-BI-Turner roster out there, is that really a much inferior roster to what the Suns have? I don't care about Zion's age he put up some of the best numbers I've ever seen in the NBA surrounded despite bad coaching, and bad spacing, if we had Jrue out there instead of Bledsoe he would have even been better.   You could be right but I don't see Jrue pulling a Harden and forcing his way out if we actually put in a win now effort."
Isn't Myles Turner pretty good at it?
"You could move Davis to 5 and add guys like Paul George, Tatum, etc.   Plus you‚Äôd be removing Myles Turner (non-star)"
bam/myles turner  anthony davis/zion  durant/lebron  harden/beal  curry/cp3  vs  Jokic/Embiid  Giannis/Sabonis  OG/Bojan  Shai/Bogdan  Luka/Simmons
I wouldn't. Too many teams get scared of making mistake but more often then not it becomes a bad deal. His offensive game worries me. He's a solid guy maybe Myles Turner level where you think he's going to keep improving at a young age but just stagnate and then become frustrated. I don't see a huge jump.
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
That makes me think he will end up like Myles Turner who is nice but not an allstar
"I‚Äôve never understood ‚Äúconsolidation moves‚Äù.  Would you trade KAT for caris, Myles, TJ Warren?  Nobody is trading a star for solid starters. They had the opportunity to consolidate last offseason anyways by trading dipo and Turner for Hayward and they chose not to do it.  They have a poor FO, weak prospects (none of their super young guys are promising), and no top tier talent. That combo isn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúconsolidate‚Äù its way to a star."
"They've got a decent young core that they can lock up to decent non-max contracts  Dejounte and White are locked into 17 million per year until 2024 and 2025.   Lonnie and Vassell are on their rookie contracts until 2022 and 2024.  Keldon, Samanic, Eubanks and Poetl are alsonon their rookie contracts until 2023 as well.   Worst part is being in mediocre purgatory, not competing for championships but also not abysmal enough for a Top 5 chance.   If I was Buford and Pop, I'd trade away Derozan for a young and budding star. Ben Simmons, Wiggins, John Collins, Lauri Markannen, Myles Turner.  Then tank for a shot at Chet Holmgren or Emoni Bates."
S&amp;T lonzo if you can.  try to get Myles Turner.  get some depth at the bench.  need a new point guard
"Probably make a godfather offer for Dame.   If that doesn't work, try to make a move for Myles Turner"
No FA but trade wise Myles Turner
Trade smart for Myles turner
It got leaked pretty hard they clearly wanted Gordon Hayward last year and were willing to get rid of Myles Turner and a 1st for the right to give Hayward $100-105 mil
Myles Turner should have been traded a while ago
"I know the Pacers fans in here won't like this but I really do believe that Turner's being wasted in Indiana at this point. Give this guy a top tier playmaker and he'll look like an All-Star. Had Myles been on the Rockets with Harden and CP3 this team could look like a legit dynasty. He's so quick for his size, you can play a smallball offense without having to give up size on the defensive end - his physique and playing style are a rather unique combination that really only needs the proper on-court direction by a guy like Bron, Harden, Luka, Trae for instance. He doesn't run the p'n'r as frequently as he probably should in Indiana but he's solid in hat scenario, scoring around 1.2ppp in p'n'r actions, all while not having a premier ballhandler on his squad. Once he has a toptier playmaker next to him he'll be one of the better big man floorspacers in the league while providing strong and versatile defense.  I've been thinking about this from time to time for like 2 years at this point, but Turner somehow ending up on the Lakers would be a great situation for him. Plus the thought of Myles and AD playing next to each other in a highly switchable defensive scheme would be a nightmare for any team in the NBA. Turner could really shine on this roster and evolve into a legit 3rd option. But I also understand that Indiana doesn't want to let him go unless they get a really good offer. I think the notion of what Myles _could be_ in the right situation forces other franchises to oversell on their initial offer in order to get him. I still think that the Pacers aren't close to utilizing his full potential. He needs an All-NBA playmaker and some veteran leadership."
"No. Jaylen Brown, contrary to what some people think, has been a great defender in the postseason. Last postseason for example, he had more total defensive win shares (4th in the league behind Tatum, Lebron, AD) than Butler or Bam despite playing 4 less games.   His d-bpm was 1.1. Guys who had lower ones last playoffs include Dort, PG, Gobert, and Embiid. In this playoffs, that includes Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, and PG.  He had a plus 3 d-raptor, tied with Tatum. Guys with lower ones last year included Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This postseason, the following guys have a plus 2.5 at most: Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG."
"Jaylen‚Äôs an underrated defender by this point. He struggled this season (like everyone on the Celtics but advanced stats still mostly had him as neutral or a slight negative defensively) and some cherry picked clips that could be found on almost any player made people focus on his offball defense, often criticizing him for a defensive lapse that I‚Äôd later see an actual analyst fault someone else for.  He‚Äôs still a great on ball defender - while he‚Äôs in the top sixth of the league for shots attempted against him, opponents shoot 2.2% worse than their average when he defends them. That‚Äôs better than Ayton, RJ, OG, PG, Lonzo, Capela, Jrue, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges and a lot of others. There are some defensive advanced stats that put him above Tatum though I think Tatum‚Äôs definitely better.   He‚Äôd consistently raised his defense in the postseason and was fantastic last year while also also averaging 22 ppg on 58.6% ts. He tied Tatum in defensive raptor with +3  above guys like Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This year, guys with at least a .5 lower d-raptor include Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG. He also had a 1.1 dbpm which was better than Dort, PG, Gobert, Embiid, Danny Green and more last year and this year would be more than players like Mikal Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, PG. Most impressively, he had the 4th most total defensive win shares with 1.1 only after Tatum, Lebron, and AD. Part of that is him getting to the ecf but Butler and Bam got to the finals and still have fewer defensive win shares."
"Thats a helpside issue, not a Myles Turner issue. If Turner is making the right rotations and the opposing big is getting easy buckets off it it‚Äôs because someone missed an assignment and it‚Äôs not Myles Turner"
300 people co-signed this?? üòÇü§£ This sub is casual city   Lol @  accommodating a lesser player and getting rid of the best player of the 3‚Ä¶to give more space for a Ben Simmons-Myles Turner duo
Myles Turner and Donovan Mitchell were the color commentators for the 2020 Rising Stars game
"I mean, he was at 62% TS% against the Lakers, and obviously he was solid in our WCF run. He's gotten way better man. He tore y'all up regardless of who was on him. Had rivers praying to God lmao  I'd wanna trade for Myles Turner"
"They wouldn't, they would be sending Sabonis out for other good players who complement Ben and Myles. I've always been intrigued by a Ben + Myles Turner combo. I think that is a duo that could share the floor together on offense and also are both very good defensive players who have different defensive strengths"

"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"
I would rather move Goga for a wing prospect than Turner  Duarte is a try-to-contend-in-2-to-3-years type of draft pick and I don‚Äôt know how we plan on overhauling our defense in that time with one Myles trade since the best return for him was always going to be picks   Maybe they think they can pair him and Warren or Brogdon to get someone but I would much rather play it out with Myles  We‚Äôll see!
"Turner and Sabonis don't work together, Myles has been rumoured in deals for like over a year now, think its inevitable"
"But also, y‚Äôall now have Goga, Myles Turner, Sabonis. That‚Äôs a lot of bigs that need minutes."
Wait he's going to the Pacers? Smells like they're going to maybe try and package Myles Turner or am I being paranoid?
He only a year younger than Sabonis and Myles Turner
Giannis for Myles Turner ?
Not quite Myles Turner.
"This is getting ridiculous.  Giannis plays along side a traditional center in Lopez.  Embiid has another DPOY candidate on the floor with him who can guard the rim, too.  Bam doesn't play in a drop defense.  And Capela and Turner are not regularly asked to rim protect *and* guard a perimeter player simultaneously. [Go ahead and tell me how much better Myles Turner would have been at defending this play.](https://youtu.be/uKdc-iHzsQU?t=92)  Nobody - *nobody* - would have properly both challenged Jackson's penetration inside and guarded Mann in the corner simultaneously here."
At the end of the night Myles Turner is still a Pacer
Yeah from the thread the best one was Wiggins wiseman 7 14 for tj warren and myles turner.
They‚Äôd play together. Myles would protect the rim and KAT would guard on the perimeter; I think evidence is building that KAT is a better defender when he‚Äôs not the big in a drop back scheme. On offense Myles just shoots threes and spaces for KAT/Ant.   Trading for Turner is something a lot of Wolves fans / writers have discussed the last year.
[https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/)
Both picks for Myles Turner
"Okay Pacers fans, is there a hypothetical deal for Wolves to get Myles Turner? Beasley is a flamethrower, I could see him qualifying as a ‚Äúsurge of shot making‚Äù"
That Myles Turner and Bam Adebayo duo ü•µüî•
"Spurs are always reserved with their moves but this draft is so deep it's going to push teams to make trades like a game of hot potato.  I trust our front office and am excited, even if we hold onto 12.  Hell, we have 5 players we drafted after 17th pick on our roster, we seem to get value out of our picks lately.  But even at 20 there will be several bigs that have potential.  Personally, I'd love to do a deal for Myles Turner, and then this Reddish/20 deal.  That's 3 players with major upside to fill our needs."
"I‚Äôm expecting a higher than usual amount of jockeying for draft position, and we may see some minor players like Myles Turner get moved around, too. That‚Äôs good enough for me. I would be surprised if we got any blockbusters tonight, but who knows"
Typical Pacers offseason followed by typical pacers offseason end results where nothing ends up happening. The Brogdon stuff is weird maybe something comes of that but my guess is the same thing happens as usual where nobody else in the league values Myles Turner as much as they do and they have to roll back the Turner/Sabonis pairing once again.
Careful your mentions are gonna say you need to add 3 future unprotected firsts and NAW just to be able to get Myles Turner.
"People forget he averages 20/9/9 when Embiid is out for his career with DPOY level defense. On the right team with a Center like Brook Lopez or Myles Turner, he is super valuable."
"imagine if God turned injuries off for a few weeks so we could've sent the god squad. mine would be steph, jaylen, lebron, AD, and Myles Turner"
"They upgraded the 5 but to a player who does neither of things they need next to Zion which is providing spacing (admittedly this is hard to get, though Myles turner has been plenty avalaible in the past) and protect the rim. JV is a good player but we‚Äôve seen that there‚Äôs a pretty hard ceiling on your playoff defense if he‚Äôs your center"
"&gt;	Now you‚Äôre just being an idiot.   Grant, OG, Brogdon, Myles Turner, FVV, Wood‚Ä¶ all make around 20M and are better players than Wiggins. He is definitely overpaid by a lot.         &gt;	Raptors are the one dangling Siakam to other teams.  Yeah, because we don‚Äôt have a first option to put in front of Pascal. We aren‚Äôt trying to move him because he is a bad player."
"Well remember every offseason Myles Turner will get traded to the Celtics ,for the 4th year in a row"
Holy overpay for Myles Turner
&gt;Doesn‚Äôt match up well with strong bugs  Today I learned Myles Turner is psychic type
Go try and get Myles Turner from The Pacers
"The Myles Turner and TJ Warren trade for the 7th pick, Andrew Wiggins and Wiseman or something similar. I think both teams would benefit without breaking up their core roster."
"Hornets get: Myles Turner, Pick 23  Pacers get: Eric Gordon, Pick 11, Pick 24  Rockets get: Terry Rozier, Pick 13  ???????"
Myles Turner to Hornets would appease the NBA gods. Just look at how LaMelo made Biyombo look the past year. I'm surprised Turner's value is so low tbh.
"HOU: 13th pick (from IND)  IND: Eric Gordon, 11th pick (from CHA)  CHA: Myles Turner"
Is Myles Turner the new hypothetical best fit? I know there's so few bigs that can shoot and defend the rim but his name has been fucking everywhere for 3 months
assuming all the high end assets you mentioned flipping there go to Philly like CJ/Nurk and the a good amount of picks‚Ä¶ you really thinking the Pacers just accept Simons and picks for Myles Turner??
"Myles Turner is not an above average player, idk what everybody‚Äôs obsession with him is."
"Sixers should. Doesn't mean they will. It's hardly impossible, given that it's by far the most commonly floated trade for him out there, especially if we throw in picks  Nurkic would be a 3 team deal. Maybe with the hornets? Something built around a Myles Turner, nurkic, Hayward swap makes sense for everyone. Add picks as appropriate"
It doesn't at all only make sense for us.   CJ + 2 firsts for Simmons absolutely makes sense  Then you have nurkic + 2 firsts being traded for Myles Turner in a 3 way deal.
"Flipping CJ and Nurkic + future firsts into Simmons and Myles Turner does it. Gives us:  Lillard/Powell/Simmons/RoCo/Turner  Is that favored to win a ring? No. But we'd be in that Suns kinda tier where all you need is a little bit of luck and it could happen.   Nothing is going to put us ahead of the Nets obviously, but that lineup could easily be top 10 on both ends of the floor, and that gives you a chance. And that's all we can ask for"
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can‚Äôt take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that‚Äôs better than all those all stars lol"
[hot take]  if the bucks can get myles turner keep middleton jrue and giannis together with a reliable shooter or 2 its curtains for the league imo.   ceiling: 90s bulls.  floor: tim duncan spurs era.
They called KCP a vet when he was 25 lol.  Myles Turner is also 25.
"Pacers always have guys with similar names:  Paul George, George Hill, Solomon Hill, Jordan Hill.   CJ Watson,  CJ Fair, CJ Miles, Myles Turner  Both Hansbrough brothers.  2 Holiday brothers.  TJ McConnell, TJ Warren, TJ Leaf  Thad Young and Joseph Young  Solomon Jones Dhantey Jones  Jeff Foster and Jeff Ayers  Since 09 the Pacers have had at least 2 players with the same first or last name on the roster at the same time.  Edit: spelling"
"That's the thing: I don't actually think there are that many possibilities out there. At least, not in terms of possibilities that A) work within the rules, B) that both teams are willing to say yes to, and C) that meaningfully shift the team's chances of title contention.   The two best that I've come up with are sending Wiggins, 7, and 14 to Indiana for Myles Turner and TJ Warren but I think Indiana says no to that, and sending Wiggins, Wiseman, 7, and 14 to Charlotte for Hayward, Rozier, and 11 which is taking a massive gamble on Hayward to stay healthy."
If you think jonas is the right pairing next to zion then i dont know what to tell you. They couldve had a guy like myles turner...
i‚Äôd rather take cade and regret it later than see him be good somewhere else.  please. i‚Äôve watched us fumble pick after pick. we coulda had giannis one year but he was such a project and from another country im not going to include him.  recently   2013 we took kcp and coulda had CJ Mccollum  2014 no pick  2015 stanley johnson over myles turner and booker  2016 ellenson. coulda had lavert but this is outside the lottery so im not trippin  2017 this is the one that makes me want to blow my brains out. luke fucking kennard over donovan mitchell. (also coulda got bam)  2018 no pick  2019 dekou he‚Äôs a bust but was outside the lottery and no other pick was really worthwhile after besides thybulle and kpj.  please for the love of god just take cade.
"That's fair, it's just that their current centers is Cody Zeller and....that's it.  They should try for someone else -- Myles Turner would be perfect -- but I'm simply saying I think Montrez could have a much better year in Charlotte than he did in LAL -- they just play much faster and looser with a shit ton of lobs.  On offense, he makes some sense.  He will never make much sense as a defender, of course, so as I said, it isn't ideal.  I still stand by that it isn't a laughably bad fit or anything."
"Trade Rozier for Myles Turner, then sign Lonzo in FA"
"Randle is 100% getting a max. This trade is a fucking joke. The celtics are not trading their 2nd (near 25 PPG on almost 50% shooting) best player, their 3rd best player and arguably their 4th best player.  For Julius Randle and Myles Turner.  Pritchard is a very good player off the bench but he is NOT a fucking starting point guard and that would force him to be."
"Yep. Myles Turner, Anthony Davis, etc.   Pretty much any rim protector that can stretch the floor.   His prime is going to have to be absurdly dominant to make up for his length limitations positionally."
Theis is a FA and Myles turner is on the block
"I think you guys overhype Myles Turner more than he deserves...he hasn't proven to be a good rebounder, skilled on offense, or really a smart defender. He is definitely an elite shot blocker, but there is a lot more to defense than that.  He physically can shoot threes, but he isn't really that great at it. I understand the appeal of him as a prospect since he is athletic, can shoot a little and is already elite in one area, but I think the time as pretty much passed on him developing into a better player. I'd much rather a Horford to Turner if you were thinking short term."
Myles Turner maybe? Tough to think of a lot of good fits but IIRC the Pacers were rumored to be talking about trading Turner
Valanciunas has a higher career 3PT% than Myles Turner too
Or Myles turner. Still bummed they didn‚Äôt get him instead of Adam‚Äôs.
I get the point of this trade is to shed salaries and they also got the best player in the deal...but is Jonas a good fit next to Zion? I'd think a stretch 5 (e.g. a Myles Turner type) is needed so Zion can thrive in the paint
You misspelled Myles Turner
How? I don't get it for Pelicans. Another non 3pt shooting center next to Zion? Jonas also isn't a particularly great defender. Pelicans should have overpayed for Myles Turner.
How? I don't get it for Pelicans. Another non 3pt shooting center next to Zion? Jonas also isn't a particularly great defender. Pelicans should have overpayed for Myles Turner.
They need to pursue 2 way wing(s) and Myles Turner. They have underrated assets.
"I'd like to see a backcourt of Luka and Marcus Smart. Then rounding up his starting five, maybe Mikal Bridges, PJ Washington, and Myles Turner."
"Like Siakam, Bogdonovic from Utah, Brogdan, Myles Turner, Harrison Barnes, Gordon Hayward"
"Ayton doesn‚Äôt qualify he‚Äôs international. And I guess Lopez you could add but definitely would rather have Allen instead Myles turner. And I would take Lopez, Allen and Turner over draymond. We have absolutely no size on the USA team and we have no one to match up with they‚Äôre bigs. We‚Äôre doing the draymond thing right now and it‚Äôs  working horribly. Also, keep in mind this is the THIRD team. My point was to emphasize how much more large the volume of talent that the US has vs international opposition."
"Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, not sure he is eligible but Ayton, also if you have AD and Bam on your team i‚Äôm pretty sure you can make do with Draymond too"
"Spitballing here - Myles Turner, Jeremy Lamb (salary match) and our first."
"I hope Lavine, Smart, and Myles Turner watching"
"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can‚Äôt just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team. I think it‚Äôs a good mix of scoring, passing, size, defense and experience.  Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
"People talk about all the most formidable 5s being from other countries, but the US still has the undisputed best depth there, AD, Adebayo, Jarrett Allen, Dwight Howard, Myles turner, jonathan Isaac..just too many injuries and sit outs this year.  This roster is a mix of America‚Äôs B or C team plus Durant. Still medal favorites.  Would love it if stars saw the olympics as an opportunity to flex their pesky defense skills without worrying about getting gassed. Would be fun to see a defensively minded roster. The league‚Äôs 12 best defenders would probably be an offensively decent squad anyway."
Andre Drummond and Myles Turner. Say what you want about Drummond but no one is out rebounding him. Turner's a top tier shot blocker.
"I think they need a 3rd ""star"" to compete for the title.  As constructed (and assuming Klay comes back to 100% which I think he will), I think they're def WCF contenders   Adding Beal would make them deadly, prob the best offense in the league after the Nets.  Obv defensively they'll be issues so it remains to be seen how they would build around those 3.  Having Dray us a start.  If its not Beal, then who else is on the market?  I dont think Siakam is a good fit at all.  Maybe Myles Turner?"
Him or Myles Turner are kinda where I thought they'd be going
Just get shooters and a center like Myles Turner. Zion plays point forward and you make changes along the way. Its not that hard like building around AD.
Do you think trading Gordon Hayward could net you Myles Turner? I kept hearing about that all last summer ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Myles Turner is hurt and Randle probably doesn‚Äôt do anything to solve the team‚Äôs issues and was terrible in the playoffs.
myles turner is literally injured
Ok I haven‚Äôt watched a ton of Cavs games but does he pull his defender from the paint or is he a shooter like how Myles Turner is a shooter? They leave him open and deal with the consequences
"...""too much Fit issues...."". As in Beal fitting on proposed team or as in the assets coming back fitting in Washington????  I see the fit issue of Beal in GSW, they would have a pretty small team and only Draymond as defense guy and maybe Klay comes back a slight positive.  At the same time I get the counter argument as well even if it is predicated basically on getting defensive players to sign for min. contracts and them then being decent enough  offensively to stay as a viable option.  I mean team with 4 players under 6'7 is quite small.  Do you add a 4 or 5 to that.?.?  Niang won't be signing a min contract that's for sure not Myles Turner obviously.   I think the fit in Miami or Philly is much better"
"This team is so poorly constructed it‚Äôs ridiculous. We literally threw out a bunch of iso scorers and said ‚Äúlets play Moreyball‚Äù without any of the chance creations from a Harden or CP. Dame, KD, and Tatum are a great foundation and core to build the squad around. Now you‚Äôd need to invite guys who complement their abilities. Draymond is a good pick up. Jrue is a good pick up. But having Lavine, Book, and KLove for that stint would never fit. None of those guys are positives on the defensive side. None of them are great off ball guys. Hell Book and Lavine need the ball in order to look as good as they do. And as good as they are they aren‚Äôt in the same tier as Dame, KD, or Tatum. Adebayo is undersized yes but his defense and athleticism should translate well. Myles Turner being hurt didn‚Äôt help with the back up big pick. Just thinking outside the box, would Evan Mobley be a plus contributor? His role would be small and all he‚Äôd have to do is play hard for the minutes he‚Äôd get. Although he may not have wanted to play out of fear of ruining his draft stock maybe. Jaren Jackson Jr.? Im spit balling but you get the point. We‚Äôll probably win gold but looking into 2024, we might not be fielding the best team in the world anymore"
Myles Turner maybe
"I'm not American either so why do you say 'beat you', that makes no sense. So you are saying he had a couple of bad games and therefore he will never again be considered? That nonsense.   Myles Turner is overrated and sucks against bigs. He is a bad rebounder as well, the exact kind of big you don't want against Golbert. Lopez would at least box out and not give up offensive rebounds to Golbert."
This is why I'm not super excited for the Pelicans to give up anything much for Turner. The idea of Myles Turner is better than Myles Turner.
Thanks for the info but I am not American so I'm perfectly aware of how international game is played as a follower for long long years.   I was answering your question. The reason why nobody talked about or didn't include Lopez in the roster was because he was horrible in 2019. France beat you there too. Gobert dominated again and that team had a shot blocker like Myles Turner.
"Myles Turner was really solid for USA in the last World Cup on the defensive end. With his ability to pair well with pretty much anyone, he seems really missed right now"
"It truly is amazing how lousy of a job pop and coangelo did building this roster. No PG or center, what the fuck were they thinking. Why no Myles Turner, Trae, D-Rose? Nooo let's roll with 8 wings"
Myles Turner is hurt
"yeah i mean you're comparing laimbeer to 3 of GOAT centers... hakeem olajuwon for example, even beyond his position, can be argued to be a top 5 player of all time. if bill laimbeer can make it as a starter in today's USA national team, then that says a lot about today's NBA. like you said, it especially speaks of the drought of US-big men in the NBA. their best big men are international players.  for sure a shortened offseason should be factored in, but the whole world faced complications against the pandemic. a lot of international players also play in the NBA, so it's an even handicap imo.  i watched the USA vs France game in 2019 (check it out if you haven't), and it seems like the common denominator is your last point.. most of them are ""superstars"" on their team and don't know how to really play team-ball as a consequence. their teams are structured in a way where the team revolves around them as a center piece. now all those players come together thinking they're the justice league, when really they're just confused on how to play together.  so yes, these players are individually athletically talented, more than previous generations. their talents, however, are capped- They lack the talent of being able to play on any team. Guys in previous Olympic teams knew how to play with each other, despite not being on the same team... and that talent is more important in team sports, like basketball. This isn't tennis.. sometimes basketball is like tennis, when you're playing 1-on-1. Too bad there isn't a 1-on-1 professional league watched by millions of viewers on television. These guys would excel at it.  the problem is, everyone wants to be ""jordan,"" yet even jordan wasn't the leading scorer of the dream team. he played his ROLE.. and they let charles barkley do most of the scoring because his body/strength/basketball ability was kryptonite for every other team. they all served their roles and no one tried to be a star, most of them never played with each other, but gel'd immediately. maybe it's just the culture that's in the states right now, everybody wants to be ""That guy,"" but the real ""that guy""s knew how to do it all, and that's what US kids aren't seeing. Even watching the Redeem Team.. man they were ferocious on the court and playing beautiful team ball. Kobe wasn't even the leading scorer, but again, like Jordan, he played his role.  &amp;#x200B;  i'm sure if the team consisted of Lebron/Steph/Klay/Durant/Draymond/Myles Turner/Dwight Howard/Brook Lopez/Jrue Holiday/Kawhi Leonard.. they'd be beating everybody. First, 4 of them have played together on the same team. Second, LeBron can fit on any team because his game is like Magic Johnson's, he just fits on any team. Dwight Howard is old but he's tough now, plays bully bull on his limited minutes, and he played on the Redeem Team like LeBron. Myles Turner and Brook Lopez are the only American-born Centers who are better than all the other American Centers who have been in it for 5+ years. Myles Turner is a liability because he would've gotten destroyed by Gobert (see footage of Pacers vs Jazz games). It's sad that team USA would have to have him as a Center because he's young/has more stamina than Brook and Dwight, but doesn't have an aggressive rebounding nature against REAL centers. Rotate minutes. Jrue Holiday knows how to play proper defence and is a team player. Klay is one of the NBA's elite defenders. Kawhi, elite defender. If you had Jrue, Klay, Kawhi, Draymond, and Dwight Howard all on the floor at the same time.. It's gonna be a loooooong day for all the opposing teams.  &amp;#x200B;  finally, no disrespect to popovich, but these lineups have been questionable (even the plays ran in the 2019 game). i don't know if he's the right coach for this team"
"&gt;These other countries have been training together for years  These other countries have been training together for 2 weeks before any major events. The US can do the same, no one's stopping them from calling up Kemba Walker and Myles Turner to carry on from that 2019 roster, if chemistry is all they lack."
"Myles Turner, Dwight. You‚Äôre right the it‚Äôs very weak. Until Chet Holmgren and Evan Mobley get older."
Myles Turner would be nice ngl
Myles Turner?
"That‚Äôs just not true. They gave first dibs to older players while ignoring young guys that would‚Äôve helped the roster construction like Trae, Zion, and Ja. The team needs an actual playmaking point guard to run an offense. Zion would be an absolute wrecking ball that doesn‚Äôt need a whistle to help him. Our bigs other than Bam are also just not cutting it. Someone like Myles Turner would‚Äôve been perfect. Just cause we don‚Äôt have Lebron, AD, Kawhi, or Steph playing is not an excuse for this shit"
Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen
"Bam, Ayton, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Dwight, Drummond."
The answer probably should‚Äôve been someone like Myles Turner. Not sure if he declined or just wasn‚Äôt chosen.
"I hate Tatum on this roster he‚Äôs been absolutely useless every game for them. Lavine needs to be more of a slasher than he‚Äôs been. Having Javale on the roster is a complete embarrassment.   I‚Äôll never understand why Trae Young, Ja Morant, Zion Williamson, and Myles Turner are not on this roster."
"Yep, a jarret allen or Myles turner as well"
Josh Okogie is the modern superstar of headband forehead coverage. Even Myles Turner is impressed with his fivehead.
Myles Turner? What? Turner is a shot blocker and rebounder that can stretch the floor. Plays nothing like JJJ.
The best options I've seen for the warriors so far are Myles Turner and Pascal. I'm not sure they need anymore guards
"Knicks: SGA, Myles Turner"
"While I prefer to keep Wise, Wise + a FRP for Myles Turner is intriguing.  We can use the other lottery pick to get a good scorer/wing player for depth. That‚Äôs a solid roster right there"
"Myles Turner and TJ Warren. But, i'm pretty sure Rick Carlisle has plans for both, and didn't become their head coach to trade current assets for future ones."
"Gotta remember the NBA has some big man prospects like Evan Mobley (rookie this year) and Chet Holmgren (top 3 prospect next year). Myles Turner if he comes back from injury is still young and would be in his prime for 2024.   It's is still the U.S's weakest position, but they pretty much blow everyone else out 1-4 and in terms of top end talent and depth.  Plus again, many of USA's players were tired and had zero practice together."
"In 2024 we'll have choices like Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, Kai Jones (just drafted), Myles Turner, etc.  sorry i think you might be able to find my bias lmao"
"From another thread. Try again:  Myles Turner might be the most overrated player on every R/NBA sub. Literally every year Pacers fans and his stans flood the site after he has a 2-3 game decent stretch in the first month of the season proclaiming how he is the uncrowned DPOY, about to break out and become an all-star, the most disrespected player in the league... and like clockwork no one is ever talking about him once the season's finally done and over with. And like clockwork his team is always trying   rid of him and shopping him around the league in the ensuing offseason.  Dude is good at blocking shots... that's IT. He can't score at a high level, can't post-up, can't rebound, sets the softest screens ever, can't/won't pass the ball, has averaged basically the same statline verbatim for 6 years straight with no improvements to any facet of his game whatsoever... literally all he is good at is blocking shots. The reason why he is able to be effective in Indiana is because he has one of the most offensively skilled, best passing, best rebounding big men in the league in Sabonis next to him covering for every other facet of basketball he has been lacking in since he came into the league besides getting lots of weakside blocks.  And NO, he is not a ""stretch 5/floor spacer/etc.; outside of one season 3 years ago where he shot a little bit above league average he is a 33~% 3 pt shooter on pathetically low volume, no sane defender in the league is going to stop packing the paint vs. the league's leading inside scorer in Zion to guard him out on the perimeter. The idea of giving up our starting center and 2/3 of the amount of picks ANTHONY DAVIS went for is insanity. No."
Myles turner
"An upset in 2024 has a major chance of happening to us if our super stars don‚Äôt come out, and we saw also this Olympics the team needs a real duo of big‚Äôs, Myles Turner or Jarret Allen would be great to pair along with Bam"
"Jarrett Allen, mason plumlee, Myles turner???None of these guys were available???"
"Probably, him or Myles Turner would‚Äôve been great to have but Bam is good enough for the team"
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
I don‚Äôt get the hate for Allen‚Äôs contract. He does a lot of good things and has shown a bit of a 3 pointer. He could be what people wanted Myles Turner to be
"Oh I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with someone who spent 2 whole minutes on a player bref page after hearing about him for the first time. That kinda dedication to analysis just can't be matched. I salute your analytical prowess.   Every advanced stat backs him up:   1.6 Lebron (compares to: Derozan, Ja Morant, Robert Covington, Myles Turner)   1.7 EPM (compares to: Lowry, Middleton, Sabonis)   2.0 Raptor (compares to: Ayton, Vuc, Royce O'Neale, Joe Harris, Jaylen Brown)     He started in the closeout game for a championship team. He's a fantastic guard defender, hustles for loose balls, and has great IQ.   But I can see how all of that is easy to miss when the entirety of your bball knowledge is listening to Microsoft Narrator read you bref pages since your blindness prevents you from actually watching games."
"Fr, the Myles Turner for Kuzma and a second rounder takes are exhausting"
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Myles Turner would be an awesome team"
is Myles Turner that much better than Nurk?
Myles turner was available to anyone for very little last off season and nobody wanted him.
"It bothers me when people act like you can just trade for a guy because you want to. ""Go and trade for Myles Turner!"" Okay but does Indiana have any say in that?"
Griffin is able to really get great returns on trades but I don‚Äòt see any ability to construct a team or have long term vision.  They either should have gotten Myles Turner if they wanted to play traditional pnr defense while stretching the floor on offense for Zion or they should become a team that switches everything  Of course they now have traded twice for centers who aren‚Äòt able to do either thing and traded their plus defender at pg for a midget sg despite being one of the worst defenses  I would hate to see it but just seems like the AD Situation all over again
um fuck off? Myles Turner don‚Äôt need saving we love him dearly over here
"&gt; Simmons: ""How about keep Jrue Holiday and grab Myles turner a year ago and call it a day. That would've been nice.""  You're posting an idiot take and then asking people to take it seriously? LMAO yourself."
"&gt; Woz: ""I think the first one is, the Jrue thing... there's context here. The contract is coming up, they didn't want to pay him all the money the bucks would pay him when they thought the time line with zion was one thing, right?"" [...] That's how you see the whole, 'Alright, we're willing to pay 90 million for Kyle Lowry,' which was the market rate for the guy, but not give Jrue Holiday his 130 million dollar contract to be better and younger.  .  &gt; Simmons: ""How about keep Jrue Holiday and grab Myles turner a year ago and call it a day. That would've been nice.""  They're certainly not talking like people who understand that Jrue requested a trade."
"Simmons just straight up hates NOLA, nothing more to it, he would happily wipe the city out if he could, that being said, he‚Äôs completely ignoring the fact that Jrue wanted a trade, and it was absolutely the correct move in trading him, like this shit is undeniable.  Good thing Woz isn‚Äôt going to get tired of suggesting Myles Turner to the Pelicans, because I fuckin am, holy shit can Griff just trade for that guy so we don‚Äôt have to hear about the only single player NBA social media would be happy for us to trade for over and over again on every platform? actually dislike Turner now, he‚Äôs a fine player, but just the sight of his name being linked to the Pelicans by every fuckwit casual that hasn‚Äôt watched a single minute of Pelicans hoops is going to give me a stone cold aneurysm."
"I want Simmons. And then for us to take a look at trading Nurkic too, with the hopes of getting Myles Turner in a 3 team deal  Dame/Powell/Simmons/RoCo/Turner is a really damn good linuep.   We go from awful defensively to elite at 3/5 positions and Norm isn't bad either. You can be a great defensive team with one negative defender in Dame"
Like Myles Turner  Which r/Pacers always downvotes me for
"Myles Turner could be that Center, or Bam Adebayo  I guess if the Bulls get(have?) a good defensive coach, they can get Vuc, Lavine and Demar all up a notch, and they already have Lonzo."
I‚Äôm extremely high on the Pacers this year.   Brog off a career year  Caris breakout end of year  Warren back from injury   Sabo unleashed  Myles Turner who everyone wants  One hell of a starting 5 with one of the best coaches in the league. Just worried about them losing some of their huge bench players like Aaron and Doug
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
"Tbh if we can get Ben, and then good value for Sabonis that Myles Turner Ben Simmons front court would be sexyyyyyyy"
"Soft schedule to end the season last year, but GSW did go 16-6 by going small and just playing around Steph. Ownership isn't going to trade all the young guys unless it's for someone like Beal. Lacob is trying to pump up the value of the Warriors young players by waxing poetically. He's a hedge fund guy setting the market. If there's an offer for Beal or another star that team turns down, then I'd agree with you. But the kind of player the Warriors would want to add isn't available. Dumping young assets for a guy like Myles Turner doesn't push the needle."
"True but everything looks fine and rosey in the regular season but how you perform in the playoffs can really torpedo any of that because thats whats fresh on everyone's mind when free agency starts.   Schroder and Harrell (for the clippers in 2020) both looked incredible in the regular season. Harrell was on track on getting myles turner money before doc left him out there on an island in the playoffs to get cooked by Jokic.  Schroder shouldn't have played with his bread. you see 84 mil on the table, you take that lmao"
"There was a ridiculous ""rumor"" by some guy on Nets Twitter that said Marks was trying to somehow get Clint Capela or Myles Turner as part of this. Like it wasn't from any sort of reporter or even blogger, just some fan.   Certain people let themselves believe it and get overhyped for some reason."
"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
If the Hornets trade Terry for Myles Turner I could maybe see them tossing the mid level at Dennis to play beside LaMelo for a year while Bouknight figures the NBA out a bit. But I don't think it's a likely scenario.
"Portland getting Simmons for CJ still seems highly unlikely but if they manage to make that trade getting Nance to play the C could make for a really good lineup. Dame, Powell, Covington, Simmons and Nance. Though rim protection would be iffy.  Myles Turner would be the best option there with Simmons but i don't see Portland being able to get both Simmons and Turner.  Nance could also work well for Minnesota as the PF next to KAT."
"Don't need either of them. They need size, not more shooting. I'd do everything I can to get Myles Turner if I'm the Nets."
I hope Bob and co don‚Äôt trade these young guys for fuckin Myles Turner....  Jerry ain‚Äôt here to say no anymore
"Myles turner to Nets , DJ goes."
Myles Turner going to Nets
I am crossing fingers that Myles Turner comes to us for Precious and whatever Dallas sends.
There goes Myles Turner
The saddest part of those years is when we missed the playoffs that first year and got the 11th pick I was hoping so bad the Pacers would take Devin Booker. Myles Turner is a nice player but I think most people would agree Booker is the better piece overall
I'm manifesting Myles Turner in Minnesota üôèüôè
Gotta be trying to swing a trade for Myles Turner or something like that right? Don‚Äôt see what the plan is here.
"Ah yes, the Myles Turner to unclog your offense solution when teams guard him exactly the same way they guard Rudy Gobert."
"This feels like the fairest Myles Turner trade package I‚Äôve heard to date, and it feels like folks have been floating Turner trade packages for like 2+ seasons now."
"Lebron had just come off a gruelling 7 game series 36 hours earlier where he barely squeaked by a team led by Victor Oladipo and Myles Turner and the Raptors could‚Äôve/should‚Äôve won that game by 20. That game should‚Äôve never been close to begin with. Lebron was running on pure fumes.  And if you want to dissect games in that manner, all 4 of the Cavs wins in the Pacers series were by 4 points or less. They came extremely close to losing. Again, to a team led by Oladipo and Turner. A weaker team than the Raptors were supposed to be.  A sweep to a lower seed can and should never be rationalized away. It is an embarrassing and completely unacceptable outcome no matter the circumstance."
Trade Coby and Markkanen (sign and trade) to Pacers for Myles Turner?   Pacers to get a talented young prospect out of it (Coby) and an intriguing if underwhelming player (Lauri) and Bulls get a shot-blocker.   Not sure if Indiana would go for it though.
FRP and Lauri for Myles Turner.
I think it looks worse because of the rumors Indiana wanted to do a S&amp;T for Myles Turner
"I agree.   Myles Turner would be an amazing fit if we could get the $$$ to work. It‚Äôll be tough with Luka‚Äôs extension (I assume he will sign after olympics are finished) kicking in next year, but he would be a huge win for us."
"Exactly, I feel Mavs best move is to work with the pieces they have.  Maybe go after Myles Turner next offseason?"
"I think some of the people will be Mitchell, LaMelo, Tatum, Booker, Zion, Lavine, Trae, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, AD and Fox"
So who is the best American center? Is it Jarett Allen? Myles Turner? Feels like one of those guys would be pretty useful about now.
They need to pull of a trade for Myles Turner or they are fucked
No one would respect Myles Turner over packing the paint on Zion.
"Literally so fuckin annoyed seeing all this fuckin Pels shouldve traded for Myles Turner shit, this entire sub dumps on every pels move yet the one move they think they shouldve done is trade for a big that cant rebound, kinda stretches the floor and hunts for blocks. Fuck off."
Myles turner isn't much of a stretch big either
Wasn't Indiana trying to trade Myles Turner last year? Could have easily got him instead of Adams if true.
Definitely not enough for KP or Myles Turner. Which is a shame cause I was hoping they'd get one of them
"10m for a decent boardman is pretty darn good. compared to a myles turner that pulls double that, it's a lot of value. What i do wonder is whether mitch is on his way out. do you really want to have both of them on the team, probably not. And his deal is crazy small."
They found their Myles Turner ig
"&gt;Plays great defense, is a great rebounder, and he can knock down 3s at a decent clip. He just won't create any offense for you  So he's basically Myles Turner"
Myles Turner is ass though. The idea of Myles Turner is better than Myles Turner.
"Capela ‚Äî 27  Sabonis ‚Äî 25  Myles Turner ‚Äî 25  Wood ‚Äî 26  Allen ‚Äî 23   especially for a defensive anchor like Allen, those two years of reps and experience is going to grow his game so much. he‚Äôs barely been a full time starter"
"Meanwhile the Celtics will keep kickin the can down the road until Tatum is tired of not winning a championship and Brown is gone in a trade to make a move because they're on the opposite end of the spectrum (too risk averse to make moves, like trade Brown, filler and picks for James Harden, or trade a guy already leaving for Myles Turner)."
It‚Äôs been called a Myles Turner-type deal by many
Can we have Myles Turner instead?
hes not myles turner tho
By god that's Myles Turner money
What do y‚Äôall think about Marcus smart for Myles Turner
"It‚Äôs okay, but I don‚Äôt know how tradable it‚Äôll be if Allen doesn‚Äôt improve.  This isn‚Äôt like the Myles Turner contract, because even though his numbers are down Turner still provides valuable shooting from the big position as well as defense. Allen can only do one of those."
Myles Turner
Myles turner to GS. Can only dream
"Fournier is a significantly better fit.  Randle and Barrett took big leaps as shooters, but I think we can all agree that 3pt shooting isn't (or shouldn't be) the primary thing they do, Thibs is always going to play a rim protecting big at the 5 so unless we trade for Myles Turner that's another guy who isn't really adding spacing as their primary skill, and then you have DeRozan, who is much as non-shooter as anyone."
"Gallo is not a good fit, KAT needs a front court partner who can rim protect when he‚Äôs pulled out the paint. Myles turner should be the goal"
"Hahaha yeah  What do you think, do the kings have anything that‚Äôs worth Myles Turner? Does adding Bagley do it for ya?"
Buddy Hield for Myles Turner?
Didnt the Celtics decline Myles Turner in a Hayward S/T?
"If we trade Turner we'd need either a defensive-minded stretch 4 or another wing to keep up with the modern NBA offense. We tried that with the failed Gordon Hayward trade.  I don't particularly agree with trading Myles Turner regardless because our defense would plummet. But, if that's the direction that the FO wants to move with then you need to find pieces that fit the void left behind.   Barnes is a pretty underrated wing that is actually a 2-way player - I'd rather have him over Evan Fournier or whatever."
unless you were also moving myles turner...
Dwight Powell for Myles Turner straight up  You would like that Carlisle right? Lol
Cuz they want an even worse myles Turner replacement
Bring Myles Turner home
"I think Boston fans would only want to sign ""the IDEA of Myles Turner"" to a one day contract."
I'd give my first born son for Myles Turner on the wolves
Myles turner has been available for 10 years
You can have Buddy for Myles Turner.
One Myles Turner please.
No way Detroit trades him unless we give them multiple picks. At that point I'd rather go for Jonathan Isaac or Myles Turner if we are offering a package like that.
Myles Turner
"idk tbh but Masai always wants to win, keep that winning culture the Raptors are known to have in the last decade or so.  I would love to get Myles Turner though if possible, fits the timeline of the team being 25 years old, perfect fit"
Yo Milwaukee I heard you need shooting.  You can have it all for the low low price of Myles Turner
"Yeah I don't know what our plan is there. I also don't know how much validity there is with this Myles Turner trade rumor, but it does feel like we have more pressing concerns than the Center position."
"Quickley, and a 1st rounder            pg - Rose        sg - Barrett        Sf - Randle          Pf - Mitch Rob         C- Myles Turner"
Multiple Boston sources reported this along with Ainge not wanting Myles Turner.  Gary Washburn of the Globe and Zach Lowe to name two.
Because Myles Turner is a better player
"I think I've seen Myles Turner linked to every team by now over the last few years. He's kind of a weird player because he's a perfect fit on any team, but not good enough to be a legit needle mover so no team has been willing to give up enough to get him."
"Because the idea of Myles Turner is a perfect big man who protects the rim and shoots 3s, so he hypothetically solves problems or unlocks greatness for nearly any team.   Whether that reputation is warranted is a separate discussion, but I get why so many teams are interested."
I swear Myles Turner has to be the player that's in most trade talks. Every off season there's people proposing trade involving him. Whys that the case?
"Lol I‚Äôve spent too much time on the trade machine and hoping for a Myles Turner trade involving Moody, a future pick or 2 and the ‚Äúbad news bears‚Äù as salary filler. Would also be willing to do a similar trade for Christian Wood."
"It‚Äôs possible to cobble together salary for a Myles Turner trade without including Kuminga, Wiseman, Wiggins. The deal would be centred around Moody, future picks and a bunch of salary filler."
I feel like Christian Wood and Myles Turner could probably be had for the right price and represent clear upgrades over Wiseman in the short term  Their salaries are also low enough the Warriors don't have to Wiggins
"Myles just put up 3.4 blocks/game and didn't make All-Defense. People are getting wiser to defensive impact beyond splash stats like steals and blocks.   With guys like Gobert, Embiid, Adebayo, Capela, Turner, and Davis all in the midst of their primes, it's a very competitive list. Not to mention under the radar guys like Jakob Poeltl, and promising upcoming guys like Ayton and Mobley.  I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it would be pretty surprising to see him break in."
I traded Siakam and FVV for KD and Kyrie straight up. Lost in the second round the first year then the first round in the second year.  Decided to go young and let KD and Kyrie walk then signed Myles Turner and RJ. GTJ become a superstar instead but still got bounced in the second round.
"That‚Äôs not necessarily what it means.   Mitchell Robinson played 61 games and 23 mpg in the 2019-2020 and the Knicks had the 23rd best defense in the league. Was he at best the 23rd best defender that year and now he‚Äôs better than everyone (or even all centers) on every team below you guys? Was Myles Turner at best the 11th best defender last year since that‚Äôs where his team ranked by the time he got injured? I doubt it.  There‚Äôs more context to things like what you‚Äôre saying - teammates, playing through injuries, coaching, roster fluctuation and I could go on. I could be like well you know Rob had a 3.1 dbpm while Robinson had a 1.1 dbpm and has never had a higher dbpm than Rob since both were rookies so obviously this one thing makes Rob a better defender. But that also lacks context and wouldn‚Äôt be fair to Mitchell Robinson if I acted like that one thing was the end all be all."
D-Lo  Myles Turner  Vucevic
The Myles Turner/Lonzo Ball special.
Myles Turner
"Who would that be though? The real win now guys are locked down and you don't move high upside, cost controlled players like Kuminga or Wiseman for someone like... Myles Turner for example.   I truly don't think the Warriors will be making any trades this season."
Which stretch defensive center that‚Äôs realistically available should we get then? People act like getting these types of guys are just easy to obtain. Please don‚Äôt say Myles Turner either
The last time the Pacers had a pick greater than #10 was in **1989**  Two of the highest picks we've had **this century** have been Paul George (#10) and Myles Turner (#11).
"He's a Ring another ring a FMVP and MVP away from Top 10 but I would get murdered for saying that, not gonna happen anyways cause Curry has Maybe Two More Years of 34 Minutes of playing Catch up before his Ankles Give out.   and it would take a KD Recovery From Klay a Big Jump From Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins being a God Level Third Option if we want any chance to come out the West.   But in All Honesty I wish we had more Cap Space because we really are a Star-Superstar Level Player Away from being Well Suited for the Playoffs Particularly a Big with Rim Protection, like Bam or Myles Turner or Even a Clint could help us but I think they are all under Contract"
 Kyrie for Myles Turner who says no
We can offer some picks and young guys too.    Plus Nurkic and Turner have a different skillet   Who knows if indy wants that straight up either. Not sure who values who more Myles or Hayward.
"I still think there's a 3 way trade to be made with the pacers and the Hornets involving Nurkic, Hayward, and Turner.   Pacers have always wanted Hayward and the Hornets need a center   Give us Myles and we send picks and guys like Little out."
People have loved shitting on Mo but love sucking off Myles Turner on Twitter.  Bamba has been just as good as Myles Turner PER wise. He always has been by the advanced metrics. Hopefully this is the year where people finally see it with their own eyes.
This is the best package they are gonna get lol.  Pacers could play Ben at the 4/5 next to Myles Turner. Yes I know they have Sabonis but I honestly think Simmons  can thrive in a from court role and Myles is a great fit next to him
1) Reggie Miller  2) Jeff Foster  3) Rick Smitts  4) Myles Turner  5) Jermaine O'Neal
"Maybe I'm reaching for pebbles here, but like, I think Brook Lopez is clearly better than Myles Turner. And why is Capela not on the list?"
"Caris Levert,Malcolm Brogdon,Myles Turner,Domantis Sabonis,Paul George,Reggie Miller, The Indianapolis colts and 8 first round picks  Is that enough for Morey?"
Rick loves Myles. I like them both but Sabonis is such a net negative defensively and Turner would fit better with Ben. Don't want the trade though if we're being honest.
Pacers please pick up we want Myles turner
"Myles Turner is the only player on that list that is both better than Caruso and less talked about. John Collins, Roco, Eric Bledsoe all have gotten plenty of attention. Cam Payne has been plenty hyped by this sub ever since he turned his shit around and became a good player, and people were all over reggie jackson in the playoffs - both backup point guards in the same tier as Caruso imo"
Myles Turner
Myles Turner is not even close to true. He is very underrated now. And gets labeled as a blcok chaser. When in terms of defence he's only below Gobert and On par with Bam.
Eric bledsoe Myles Turner Jamychal Green Mikal Bridges Robert Covington John Collins Thaddeus Green Dorian Finney-Smith Royce Oneil Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne
&gt; Myles turner  How to say you don't watch basketball without saying you don't watch basketball
Pacers draft well? Let's take a look....  2020 - Cassius Stanley  2019 - Goga Bitadze  2018 - Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson  2017 - TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu  2016 - Georges Niang  2015 - Myles Turner and Joe Young  2014 - Nobody  2013 - Solomon Hill  2012 - Miles Plumlee  2011 - Nobody  10 years worth of draft picks and Myles Turner is the only one who has made any significant noise for the Pacers.
"World B. Free, Mark Eaton, Myles Turner, Dick Barnett = Beatin' my dick"
"3 team trade.  Indiana: Simmons  76ers: Brogdon, Hield, 1st rnd pick from Indy  Sacramento: Myles Turner"
"Yeah I used to go to Bros every Friday and Saturday night and I would see Gary Harris, Trey Lyles, and Myles Turner there all the time in the off-season. Indy barely has a night scene and they closed a lot of the bars on Georgia Street"
lol you saw Myles turner at Brothers?
"I love indy, it‚Äôs plenty enough for me. But when i see Myles Turner, who makes $20 million a year, in the brothers it just makes me sad. Ive always hates the mediocrity of our sports but truly understand why no super star would want to play here."
Luka KPJ Brandon Ingram  Jonathan Isaacs  Myles Turner   That team makes the WCF
"Kyle Lowry-Devin Booker-Robert Covington-Ben Simmons-Porzingis  3 high level defenders, 4 willing and able shooters around Simmons, rim protection with KP and Covington, and 2 playoff tested shot creators to make up for Simmons lack of skill in that area. Also 2 elite level passers and a very good one in Booker   It really depends a lot on if you think KP can get to a better defensive level than he‚Äôs show in Dallas though, you could swap him for Myles Turner but you‚Äôre losing some of the shooting upside"
"So? It‚Äôs a subjective selection process, just as fallible as DPOY.  If this season say Myles Turner and bam Adebayo both snubbed out gobert for all defence 1st team, it wouldn‚Äôt make Gobert any less deserving of DPOY. It doesn‚Äôt change how immensely impactful he is"
Probably Myles Turner if I had to guess
"In just two (completely changes his game) steps, this max player is worth a max! is a take.  But he's nowhere near the rim defender that Draymond was/is, and Draymond could at least pretend to space the floor (and was downright lethal in some high pressure moments, including game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals).  He'd probably thrive as a small ball 5 (although you'd probably want/need a Myles Turner type next to him since he provides neither spacing nor real rim protection), but I don't think that he could realistically do that for more than 15 mins/game."
Myles Turner boutta lead the league in 3PA if this goes down
Anyone that watched the playoffs knows he's our 2nd best player though  I think Nurkic plus picks for Myles Turner in a 3 way deal with the Hornets could make some sense.
"1) Eligible but not in the league- Isaiah Thomas  2) Short contracts(two-ways, ten-day contracts)- Karim Man√©  3) Non-rotation bench players- Justin Robinson  4) Rotational bench player- Brad Wanamaker   5) Elite bench player(6 MOTY candidates)- Jordan Clarkson  6) Basic starter- Harrison Barnes   7) Niche Starter- Myles Turner   8) Elite starter- Jerami Grant   9) Border line All-Star- CJ McCollum   10) All-Star- Donovan Mitchell   11) All-NBA- Luka Doncic   11) MVP Level- Kevin Durant"
"Myles Turner, AD, KAT, Embiid, Porzingis, Jokic, Brook Lopez, Capela. Just off the top of my head those guys would all be better fits if we‚Äôre talking 5s in the whole league"
"Myles Turner is the stretch big on offense without a doubt. Sabonis plays out of the post, really utilizing his vision and passing. Myles camps out on the 3 pt line to prevent the paint from being clogged (also the rest of his offensive game is so-so)."
Myles Turner is 14 months older than current Pacers Draft pick Chris Duarte
We will give you one Thad Young for one Myles Turner.
Myles Turner is also the same age as Donovan Mitchell (25)
"Pacers first rounder this year Chris Duarte is only 9 months younger than Myles Turner, who is starting his 7th NBA season."
"point guard that can run the offense himself but can play offball and hit 3s off the catch, shooters, and a center that can protect the rim without killing spacing. maybe something like  steph/dame/brogdon (if you want ben as focus)  danny green  mikal bridges  ben  myles turner  seems really solid"
"Malcolm Brogdon, Caris Levert, Tj Warren, Myles Turner"
"This often gets repeated (by myself in the past as well) but last year he showed the foot speed to play PF in lineups when he was with Naz Reid.  Thats why a lot of wolves fans wanted Myles Turner , that is until Simmons became a viable option.  If we miss out on Simmons I'd hope we could swing for Turner eventually though"
yes. they are. awards are based off bs  narratives. this gobert bs started after he cried like a child cus he was snubbed for all star that one year. at this point its a ‚Äúgood story‚Äù  he‚Äôs nothing special. and is a liability on defense and got exposed in that clipper series. if you start a team and you choose gobert over myles turner or draymond or AD or Clint you‚Äôre a fool.
myles turner &gt; gobert.
"I think the problem is the Center of whatever team he goes to. I agree CJ for Ben (plus whatever pieces) makes sense in a vacuum, but Nurk is one of the worst centers for Ben, but Nurk &amp; Dame have am incredible relationship.   The centers I think could work with Simmons are all spacers:  KAT (fits with everyone)   Myles Turner  Brook Lopez (the giannis fit works incredibly well for a reason)   Vucevic   Porzingis (assuming health)   Jokic   Collins (if you play him at center)   And that's about it..."
PG: Lebron SG: Lonzo SF: Mikal PF: KD C: Myles Turner
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Myles Turner, Mikal Bridges, Lonzo Ball"
Ja  Gary Trent  Tatum  Giannis  Myles Turner  I wanted Giannis and a (future) star PG and rounded it out with shooting to free things up for them. I didn‚Äôt even expect to get Tatum but I had $4 left ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"$5 - Luka - The player we build around. He's the  youngest out of everyone in the superstar tier and will only be hitting his prime in the next 2-3 years. Potentially has a higher ceiling than Giannis/Jokic while  the KD, LBJ and Steph should be on the downswing in the next couple years.  $5 - Giannis - The other player we build around. Amazing 2 way player. The 2-man game with Luka will basically be unstoppable.   $2 - Myles Turner - Good defensive center that can stretch the floor on offense.  $2 - Buddy Hield - Great 3pt shooter to space the floor.  $1 - Lonzo Ball - 3 and D guy that can also be a secondary playmaker."
"Lonzo Ball $1  Jayson Tatum $4  Giannis $5  Myles Turner $2  DeAndre Ayton $3  Everyone is a competent defender especially in the frontcourt. All of them are in their prime or entering it, 3pt shooting might be iffy but the spacing should be alright. Giannis would be running point and Lonzo would be a spot up shooter and making plays on the break like Mavs Jason Kidd."
"Over the next *five* years? **Luka, Lonzo, Mikal, Giannis, Turner.** The Luka-Giannis pairing is obvious if we're looking to the future, and then you're just surrounding those guy with shooters and defenders who are young enough that they're unlikely to decline in that five-year window. I'm lower on Myles Turner than I feel like a lot of folks are, like I don't think teams really respect his outside shot like that, but his defensive impact absolutely is there, and I think he'd be great in the Brook Lopez role next to Giannis‚Äî this is only a starting lineup, hopefully you'd also have a solid 3/4 sixth man who can let Giannis slide down to center against smaller teams."
"Giannis, Tatum, Ja, Myles Turner, Gary Trent JR"
"Lonzo Ball, Luka Doncic, Mikal Bridges, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Myles Turner"
"I would add to this a proviso that the 4 and 5 need to be stretch and be able to run. I'd like someone similar to Myles Turner. Actually, drop him onto the Pacers right now and that would be an interesting team."
yeah I saw he was in the range OP said after (I didn‚Äôt look at the 6-25 list originally)   you could probably slip KAT in there but I do like the defensive upside from myles turner
"PG. Terry Rozier SG. Jaylen Brown SF. OG Anunoby PF. Ben Simmons C. Myles Turner  PG. Rozier really excelled with the Hornets as a secondary ball handler. Really strong 3pt shooter and while he has a tendency to gamble on defense, should serve as a strong point of attack defender on opposing PGs.  SG. Jaylen is the secondary scorer here. Has shown to be a really strong 3pt shooter and has really developed his ability to handle the ball, but isn‚Äôt necessarily the kind of guy who needs to have the ball in his hands to be successful. Sus off-ball defense but certainly in the upper echelon of on-ball defenders.  SF. Love OG, he can slot into any team and be an asset. Really developing his 3pt shot and like Jaylen, in the upper echelon of wing defenders. Jaylen and OG on the wings is going to lock up opposing scorers.  PF. Simmons is really really the primary ball handler and facilitators but I‚Äôm slotting him at PF to make spacing work. In certain matchups he‚Äôs going to struggle to defend (thinking of teams with a legit PF like Randle or Domantas) but for the most part, teams are running a big wing at the 4. In those cases, Simmons defensive value will still be realized, and again, this is about putting a team of shooters around him.  C. Was thinking KAT but that would be a sus defense. Myles isn‚Äôt QUITE the 3pt shooter as KAT but I think he can anchor the defense better. He may struggle against true centers like Embiid, but again those are rarer occurrences. I‚Äôm trading off KAT‚Äôs better shooting for Myles‚Äô more balanced game and ability to anchor a team defense."
PG - Simmons  SG - Smart SF -  Klay  PF - MPJ C - Myles Turner   The 4 position was hard for me.
Terry Rozier  Duncan Robinson  Joe Harris  Ben Simmons  Myles Turner
Fred van fleet  Jrue holiday   Mikal Bridges  Ben Simmons  Myles Turner
"Using Simmons as the best, no other stars:   * PG: Mike Conley  * SG: Seth Curry  * SF: Marcus Morris * PF: Ben Simmons  * C: Myles Turner"
Myles Turner maybe. I think Porzingis might work as well.
I agree as well but I also don't believe the Warriors need to make a trade for a superstar to contend. A few Myles Turner-level players would have done the trick imo.
"Indeed, it's a big swing though. Theoretically you can retain all three of those players for the next 6-7 years, or trade them away for 2 seasons of Myles Turner. I think it comes down to Klay. If Klay returns looking great and before the trade deadline, the Warriors will probably be a little more risky than they might otherwise be. If Klay happens to look like Boogie Cousins did post Achilles and ACL, then I think our window is closed sadly."
"I've thought that as well for a few years.  It could work well but right now the problem is cap space. Myles is an 18 million dollar hit, you'd have to give Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody, and then some to just match salaries. Indiana would have to give up more than Turner for that haul."
"I think they should honestly go for Myles turner. His defense is great, and while he struggles against elite bigs who are strong in the post (Embiid) he can shoot the 3 and switch."
I'll just say it. Embiid is correct. BUT I believe Ben would go scorched earth if Myles Turner was his center.
"I‚Äôd swap Isaac for Suggs, to add some defense and size to the southeast team. For the central team, I‚Äôd swap Garland for Allen and possibly put in Myles Turner for Sabonis to fit better next to Giannis."
More like a better Myles Turner or better Bucks Brook Lopez. KP had/has a lot more perimeter game that no-one ever really expected Bamba to develop.
"P.J Tucker, Alex Caruso, Mikal Bridges, Patrick Beverley, Myles Turner"
"I mean, I don't think ""it didn't work with a washed-up Dwight"" is argument for ""Simmons can't play with a rim-runner."" There are other kinds of non-shooting centers, though for starters Myles Turner and Christian Wood would both be perfect fits with Simmons. Also a lot of PFs who can play small-ball 5 would be good too - Jeff Green, Millsap and Tucker, at least back before they were this old, Thad Young, Dario Saric."
But also KAT is an amazing post player so he‚Äôs still have to sacrifice in order to accommodate Ben  The player you need is someone like Myles turner who kind of just does jump shots and put backs
&gt; just trade for something like Myles Turner and some other decent guards would be worth it imo   what the fuck
He said Myles turner cmon now at least say Ben Simmons
Lol imagine how dumb you‚Äôd have to be to trade Kyrie for Myles Turner
"In terms of more role player options, I think Myles Turner or Brook Lopez would be good fits around Simmons."
&gt; trade for someone like Myles Turner and some other decent guards  Zero chance they would ever do that.
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, KAT, Myles Turner."
Myles Turner or Brook Lopez could be interesting

This post would age like fine wine until they find out Myles Turner is also unvaccinated.
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
Then why is Myles Turner always on the trade block
Everyone saying shooting bigs that can defend needs to explain to me why Myles Turner isn‚Äôt a game changer.
Ben‚Äôs screen setting is going to make Myles Turner look like KG
"If ever there was a team that should have traded for Myles Turner, it was the Pelicans before they let go of the core in this picture."
"Unless it's something like Cleveland dumping Love's contract, I just don't get why any team would seriously want Simmons.   If you aren't dumping a bad contract yourself, what's the point?  If you are Portland and are going to tank by trading Dame, why would you want Simmons in return?   Read a comment that a team should do for Ben what Milwaukee did for Giannis: Surround a non-shooter with players who can shoot. Which, OK, sounds good. But, that's like saying the Pacers should make the Finals if they just played Myles Turner like Shaq. There's sort of the miles-wide gap of talent. Or like if I had told my son during his second-grade son that he should just dunk like Vince Carter.   Also read that Golden State would be a good option for Simmons. OK, that would be the best possible option I've read, but it also wouldn't work unless Golden State made Draymond part of the trade. Could you imagine Ben and Draymond being on the floor together? Steph and Klay would have no room to operate. As great of a shooter as Steph is, it's often overlooked just how great of a driver/finisher he is. He'd have zero floor space if the opposing team was playing 20 feet of both Green and Simmons. And could you imagine the amount of hate Simmons would get if Green was included in the deal? And, if you think Ben felt stress playing in the playoffs for Philly - which, even as the #1 seed, I find it hard to believe anyone outside of Philly actually thought the team was going to the Finals - imagine him both having to overcome the Green hate and playing for a team where it's Finals or bust."
I haven't really seen this sentiment anywhere but I do think Charlotte's in the same tier as Chicago and are being underrated. Getting into the playoffs in the East this year will be a bloodbath.  They've built a fun roster around LaMelo and if him and Hayward hadn't gone down to injury last year they would not have been fighting for a play-in spot. Center is still a position of concern for them though (apparently they've tried multiple times to trade for Myles Turner).
Myles Turner would be nice on the Hornets
"Id say its still not perfect in this situation as increased playing time almost always means worse per36 stats. But ofc its still a fair thing to point out. I think a better point is that the best offensive center he faced so far was Myles Turner, who had 40..."
Myles Turner
Myles Turner
myles turner used up all their mojo hitting like 8 of them against the knicks
Raptors should trade for a better C like Myles Turner
Yea this year defending the 3 has been an issue. We almost lost the celtics game because we didnt guard Grant Williams at all. Then we lost the Pacers game because we let Myles Turner do whatever he wanted from 3. I think its because Fournier and Kemba arent as good of defenders as Reggie Bullock and Payton were last year  We have 2 rookies who are  good defenders in Grimes and Deuce but  they get no time to play
"We were amazing last year, but this year we‚Äôre letting people like Myles Turner drop 8 three pointers on us."
It‚Äôs not my team. I‚Äôd have kept Caruso and traded THT plus picks for Myles Turner when Indy was trying to unload him.
The Grizz supporting cast also doesn‚Äôt suck. Trading for Adams instead of Myles Turner may end up being one of the more underrated ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù moves of this decade because the Pels supporting cast won‚Äôt make sense unless they get a rim protecting center that can space the floor.
"We‚Äôre talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
I want Sabonis or Myles Turner
Myles Turner had two games in foil trouble that are bringing down those averages
"Myles Turner I can jive with to an extent. Though you have to wonder why he's been floating in trade rumors for years at this point... either the Pacers want too much for him or us nephews have a different view on him than front offices in the league do.  McGee is a bench player and Wood is shit on defense. Like, worse than JV.   &gt; If Zion get doubled every time he‚Äôs in the paint it‚Äôs gonna be very hard going for him  You do realize Steven Adams was the Pelicans center last year, right? Not exactly an ""athletic rim runner with the threat of an outside shot"" (or an inside shot even) ... and Zion put up a highly efficient 27 PPG. Sure, having a center that can space the floor could help give Zion space when he's attacking in the paint. Or you could have a center that absolutely eats up space and does a good job of sealing his man. Adams did that very effectively last season for the Pels and even though it's yet to be seen, I have no doubt JV will be able to do the same. Plus JV actually has the ability to score both inside and outside of the paint to an extent.  Point is, finding an athletic rim running center who can defend, rebound, and shoot the ball well is not exactly easy. We're talking about a handful of guys who fit that criteria to any extent, and *maybe* one or two who would be able to be acquired realistically."
"Terry's had a career resurgence in Charlotte. Fun fact, he never shot above 40% in the regular season during his time in Boston.  Last season with Charlotte - 20.4 / 4.4 / 4.2 on .450 / .389 / .817. He might be an undersized shooting guard, but he fits perfectly as a secondary ballhandler next to LaMelo.  So yeah, I like the fit a lot and at the end of the day there's not a lot of teams that can pair Terry with a bigger playmaker.  Apparently Charlotte tried to offer PJ Washington, Cody Zeller and a 1st for Myles Turner. That's not a bad offer in my opinion, but we didn't take it. Nowadays if we were interested they'd have to include Oubre instead of Zeller for salary match.   We'll have to wait and see, but yeah I don't see Plumlee being the long-term solution. The idea of Kai Jones blossoming is neat, but centers take a long time to develop unfortunately."
"Lol I‚Äôm not a GM bro, just a nephew. I‚Äôd say Myles turner, javale McGee, Christian wood would all be good fits next to him. Athletic rim runners that don‚Äôt need the ball or with the threat of an outside shot. If Zion get doubled every time he‚Äôs in the paint it‚Äôs gonna be very hard going for him"
We literally gave them rings lmao Myles Turner hasn‚Äôt won a playoff series with Indy. He could help so many teams.
We‚Äôve been linked to Myles Turner for forever now wish we could just pull the trigger or they will decide to trade him. Seems like he‚Äôs always available but nothing ever comes from it.
"They should try to trade for Myles Turner. Traditional C on defense, also shoots 3s."
"Mark Jones had an awful night. He also got myles turner and malcom brogdon mixed up, then later steph and poole mixed up, then after that said the wrong score like 4 possessions in a row"
No one can figure out Myles minutes. Or touches.  It has always been odd and always will be. There is something that is missing from fans that coaches see or something.   Plus Sabo was in foul trouble all game. Turner did have to go the lockerroom for a bit so maybe it was that.   or maybe dude just gasses because he actually plays defense lol

Myles Turner
Myles Turner
Myles turner had stepped the hell up for that team
Just returned from a 20 year trip in Space. Is Myles Turner still #1 on Michael Jordan‚Äôs goat list?
If we had Myles Turner we could conquer Oceania
Free Myles Turner please
"The Myles Turner experience: 35 points, 10 rebounds, 6 blocks -&gt; 4 points, 5 rebounds, 19 minutes -&gt; 22 points, 12 rebounds, 4 blocks -&gt; 6 points, 3 rebounds, 21 minutes"
Apparently it's always Myles Turner lol
"Just got out of Thailand prison, is Myles Turner the best player in the NBA?"
Myles Turner is a underrated beast.
"Myles Turner is just a bigger, better Steph Curry."
Myles turner 7/10 from 3.  Apparently he hates the Knicks as much as I do.  Good game by a guy who is only good in theory
Myles turner finally breaking out this season?
I just woke up from a coma‚Ä¶how long has Myles Turner been considered the greatest shooter of all time?
Myles Turner 7/10 from the three.  He apparently hates the Knicks as much as I do
Sometimes Myles Turner just goes 7-10 from 3 on you
myles turner ate today
Jerami Grant for Myles Turner + first
"I feel like Myles Turner would be a nice addition to the Pels  Maybe a deal centered around hart, tenple and light protected picks?"
joe harris+ for myles turner
Kyrie for Myles Turner
The Bonus -&gt; Sabonis  Styles Turner -&gt; Myles is a stylish guy for his size  Brogdon -&gt; The President  Duarte -&gt; I've dubbed him El Vice Presidente since he's been money while Brogdon was out and he's Dominican.
"He's not seen as a stretch big, stretch big's are Brook lopez, KAT (the elites), and then you have guys like myles turner, etc. AD isn't seen as a stretch big, but more s as a big who CAN shoot (unlike the bigs who can only layup and dunk), but not a particularly efficient/great shooter"
50% from 3 on 1.5 attempts per game - move over Myles Turner
"&gt;  ""Could have,"" or could have helped us to a second-round exit. There are no guarantees.  This doesn't have anything to do with anything.  Steph could tear his achilles stepping off a plane and never play another meaningful minute of NBA basketball.  Of course there are no guarantees.  I said this was a better move.  &gt;  Not to mention Turner makes twice as much as Wiseman, handicapping our ability to put other pieces around Steph.  Turner is the piece around Steph.  Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Turner is a championship lineup.  Turner helps offset Dray's lack of shooting and can help defend the rim, he's perfect for our offense.  &gt;  Not to mention, did Indiana actually offer that trade, or is this another one of those Tom Nook scenarios where we can just unilaterally trade what we don't want for what we do?  We have no idea what specifics they were discussing, but we do know that at the time Indiana was trying to blow it up.  They shopped Myles Turner to Miami, Boston and us.  Beyond that I can't say because those details are not public.  But they were looking for young assets from Miami and a Gordon Hayward sign and trade from Boston, if GMs public statements can be believed.  &gt;  Besides, I think Wiseman will be a big help a lot sooner than a lot of people expect.  I mean, we all have to hope that now, because we're stuck with him.  His rookie year tanked his trade value, which isn't his fault, but it puts us in a rough spot.  He got a serious injury at 19 years old, and that's not a good sign.  Don't get me wrong, I hope Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman develop quickly and contribute to a serious run.  I'm not hoping that they suck so that I'm proven right.  It's just usually a lot longer than we have to get meaningful contributions from teenagers."
"Need someone like Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen to be a sure shot play-off team, might as well go to 2nd round as well with a good center.  If not I think we will be again in the play in spots and may go out from there."
"Kings are okay. we've had a tough schedule and are 3-3 despite that so we'll take it. our defense is better this year, but it's mostly effort-based. in reality we're an average to mediocre team which is honestly delightful given that Fox doesn't seem like himself at all. if he can get himself straight and start being an honest threat again, we might have a shot at making the playoffs.   I really wish we could get a big that could guard the rim - Holmes is great and all but he doesn't have the physical tools of a defensive big, and it kills us. people always want to put Simmons on our team but I'd be more excited to make a move for a guy like Jarrett Allen or Myles Turner or whoever."
"On draft kings he‚Äôs +1400 behind Gobert, AD, Giannis, and Myles Turner"
"This sub would legit never let us hear the end of it once a report came out that they kept injured IT instead of trading him for kyrie. People hear still bring up Myles turner, ainge keeping rozier, and the attempted justice winslow trade  I have a major soft spot for IT and I wish things didn‚Äôt end that way but if someone is offering that trade you take it"
"Turner salary was $18m including likely incentives.  Oubre was an unrestricted free agent. You can't trade him for Turner straight up, and S&amp;T is unlikely as it would have required additional salaries and both Oubre and Pacers to agree AND it would have increased GSW luxury tax beyond current amount (as opposed to letting Oubre walk whch is what they did). Not impossible, but unlikely   The trade mentioned was Wiggins/Wiseman for [Turner](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/what-warriors-potential-myles-turner-trade-package-could-look) and pieces. Which again would likely have been closer to tax neutral   If you are paying supermax to steph , max to klay, wiggins, max extensions to dray, it tends to be less likely to ask for another  $18m to Turner. But in any case, that's neither your call nor mine - it is ownership / GM call...."
What would the trade be now for Myles Turner - Oubre and PJ?
&gt;  Someone else mentioned that the trade for myles turner would have seen some high salary folks leave the team.  We paid Oubre 12 million.  Myles Turner's salary was 17.5.  We'd have been able to pay him.
"Except they couldn‚Äôt sign and trade him to the Pacers. The Hornets offered Hayward more and he chose them.  And is it malpractice if no other team trades for Myles Turner either? Rumor is they‚Äôve been trying to shop him for like two years and no takers.  I‚Äôm not saying the Celtics have been great in this/have no mistakes, but with the Hayward situation it played out how it could"
"You can't match salaries with a mid level exception. A mid level exception allows you to sign a free agent when over the cap.ie. taje on more salary, via free agency. And for a taxpaying team, the mle is smaller ($5m or so iirc). But will more than triple that in tax    Someone else mentioned that the trade for myles turner would have seen some high salary folks leave the team."
So we bet the future of the organization on a 19 year old with an already impressive injury history who played 3 games of college basketball instead of trading the pick for a Myles Turner who could have helped us win a chip this year.
"We paid Oubre, we can pay Myles Turner who fits our roster perfectly.  We had a mid level exception available as well to help match salaries."
"&gt;  The thing these ""trade all the prospects"" people forget is that developing prospects into great players helps if you want to trade for stars.  Yes, but that's when your timetable is 4-5 years.  Steph isn't going to get better and be able to play more minutes as he approaches his mid and late 30's, we don't have that kind of time.  If we're lucky, he'll have minimal injuries and decline slowly.  Either way, waiting multiple years to jettison projects when we could have flipped them for a Myles Turner who'd have moved the needle and possibly opened up the door for ring chasing vets was a much better championship move.  &gt;  It's a lot easier to entice other GMs with actual good players than with draft picks.  Sure, but not every project pans out.  So we're waiting 3-4 years each on the gamble that they might be good enough to trade once Steph's prime is solidly over?"
"Publicly*.  And the only trades he's talked about publicly were for Siakam, Dame and Bradley Beal.  And those trades were max trades, which by necessity would have included either of or both of Dray and Wiggins.  They're both a much better fit on our squad than any max deal we could have made.  None of these trades necessarily included our picks, which were very easily flippable to the Pacers, who 2 years ago were trying to blow it up and get rid of Myles Turner.  He'd have been a perfect fit."
"&gt;  As I said back then, who exactly could we have traded for who would have 1) been worth our young players +Wiggins/Draymond,  We didn't need a max type player, and no deal even for a max would have needed Dray.  I wanted Myles Turner.  With Dray's limited shooting, a stretch 5 who can really protect the rim would have been ideal for us.  &gt;  2) would actually have moved us into championship favorite status  Favorites with Myles Turner?  Hard to say.  Top 3 for sure.  Enough to get some ring chasing vets on favorable contracts.  &gt;  3) was actually realistically available?  Yes, Pacers were shopping him around to Miami, Boston and us.  &gt;  Dame and Beal both wanted to stay where they were and their teams weren‚Äôt jumping to trade them. Simmons or Siakam would‚Äôve put two bullets in the back of our spacing.  Again, I wasn't looking for some max trade.  I like Wiggins where he is.  He had his most efficient scoring season while playing top 3 wing defense.  Seriously, go look at the tape and advanced stats.  His defense all season was amazing, and he fits well next to Steph and Klay."
I‚Äôm hoping we can make a run at Myles Turner
Are we gonna recycle these old articles again like the time we should've traded for Myles Turner lol?
"Myles Turner maybe? Definitely can protect the rim, and can stretch the floor a bit too."
We‚Äôre not going to get anything for him but his salary can be useful as filler for a trade. If we want a guy like Myles Turner for example we can match salaries without having to trade one of our main guys.
"Because Joe Lacob said he wanted to plan for the future after Curry.  Because our starting center is not Myles Turner who the Pacers were desperately trying to unload when we drafted Wiseman and who fits our roster perfectly.  Because when Klay went down and it was obvious we didn‚Äôt have a championship roster, Lacob said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not tanking, go out and get me wings‚Äù and Bob Myers signed the only two decent wings available, Baze and Oubre, and then we drafted Wiseman.  He didn‚Äôt want to go another year without playoff money or be embarrassed by a tanking team more than he wanted to set us up for a chip.  Basically he did everything but come out and say ‚ÄúI want playoff money every year and don‚Äôt care if that fucks us out of a chip.‚Äù"
"Nah, Myles Turner and a first rounder. We like Indiana so we‚Äôre happy to give them the discount."
&gt; So does ~~Myles Turner~~ Pacers just fluctuate between superstar and shit?
So does Myles Turner just fluctuate between superstar and shit?
May you be interested in 1 Myles Turner for 1 KAT?
Myles Turner is the most confusing player
When we trade GP2 for Myles Turner he can take his time.
"Timelord also continues to struggle with conditioning issues and honestly I think the mentorship of Horford will help a long way.   On the bright side, the pairing of Timelord/Horford is a lot stronger on paper than Theis/TT. Timelord's athletic enough to defend the perimeter and Horford's one of the better volume 3-point shooting centers in the league (better than Myles Turner actually - last season Horford shot 37% on 5.5 attempts per game).   That all being said, I do think you're right that having both Jays in the frontcourt is probably the best route to go. Ainge should not have traded away Desmond Bane for peanuts."
"I‚Äôd rather just roll with what we have than trade PJ *and* Kai. Kai obviously isn‚Äôt ready to contribute now, but he‚Äôs got crazy potential. We‚Äôre playing really well this season, but we‚Äôre not a Myles Turner away from being a championship contender. Next years the point where I‚Äôd feel comfortable trading future assets for win now pieces.   I could maybe be convinced to do a deal around just PJ, but Oubre would basically have to be included to match salaries. I feel like PJ + Oubre + the Pelicans Pick for Turner is a pretty decent offer, especially since Turner has some injury concerns and has been on the trade block for years.  I‚Äôd probably prefer to find a smaller trade for a decent enough center though. Ideally we‚Äôd want to keep PJ as the backup center. My dream trade was gonna be Oubre + Plumlee for Steven Adams, so that the Grizzlies could clear cap space, but he‚Äôs been killing it with them. Another target might be Nerlens Noel, since Mitchell Robinsons has improved a ton this season. Naz Reid would also be a big upgrade over Plumlee. Maybe the Timberwolves would want both McDaniels brothers (and other stuff)?"
"Myles Turner is still gonna be a trade option especially if Indiana continues to struggle, I don't think our FO will stop making calls for him. Oubre is making himself a useful trade piece and even though we don't really have a 2022 pick to trade we could still throw in Kai Jones and PJ (I would really try to keep him at all costs though)."
they should package him and whatever for Myles Turner or Sabonis if the pacers stay this bad
Even if Wise is good we need another C. So whatever that takes. The Myles Turner sweepstakes at the deadline should be fun!
Myles Turner wouldn't be able to do what Brook Lopez does
sounds like a certain Midwest team should trade with another Midwest team and get Myles Turner.
Feeling bad for Carlisle. Indiana management is very stubborn as they have been trying to compete for all years after Paul George trade. Lavert-TJ Warren etc would only make this team a 7th seed. They lack no 1 and no 2 guy to build around. Sabonis would be 3rd and Myles Turner can be 4th guy in a winning team.
"God the pacers blow lmao, please give us Myles turner"
Pacers defence without Myles Turner is nonexistent
Lowkey unbelievable that a NBA team let Myles Turner score 40 points
I‚Äôve always liked Bamba. Could turn into Myles Turner lite
It was Myles Turner who didn‚Äôt realize his teammate was passing. It was against at the Nets last night
"its cause dwight powell is not a starting center, nobody on your team can jump higher than jokic so he just destroyed the glass and they dominated defensively  mavs got no size, they got no good defenders.  even when KP is healthy he's not a good rebounder or defender, they need to get a myles turner or valanciunas type center"
"agreed, and if they just had a real center they would look so different  I don't think you need a lot of roster changes at all, but you need something  valanciunas or myles turner would have an incredible impact on your team, everybody else could just click into their natural positions and your rebounding and interior defense would skyrocket"
"mavs need to make a move badly, trade for valanciunas or myles turner  its just untenably porous defense and no rebounding, luka is their best rebounder wtf"
"yup, and I would say that he's also very consistent with his focus &amp; effort.  His 3-point shot is still a bit streaky but you at least know what you are getting from him every night as far as his mentality.  Myles Turner has always drifted in &amp; out and been pretty inconsistent throughout his career."
Donte has no significant trade value right now.  Certainly not enough for the Pacers to trade Myles Turner for him.
"Why would the Pacers do this?  Theres no picks, Donte is a decent young prospect but I don't really see him blossoming into all that. Just Myles Turner for an older worse stretch big?"
Myles Turner theoretically works in a trade to every team lol
After watching Carlisle work the last 13 years I f*ckin knew he would hate Myles Turner lol
&gt; Would swap Nurk in a heart beat   The idea of Myles Turner is better than the reality of Myles Turner.  Nurk is better.
The idea of Myles Turner is better than the real Myles Turner I've been told
The idea if Myles Turner is sooo much better than Myles Turner himself. Not surprised he is getting his minutes reduced.
They need to trade him. Free Myles Turner. I would rather have him on my team if Im trying to win than Lithuanian Kanter.
carlisle is indicating that turner is not part of their long term plans yeah.   pick up the phone now if you want a shiny new myles turner on your team
Myles Turner would be a good fit
"Myles Turner is the only one I can think of who fits that mold, but it‚Äôd be tough as hell to pry him away from Indiana"
Ah yes cus myles Turner is a winning player lmao
"Sort of.   1. He's been injury-prone so far. The current toe injury isn't a concern long-term but he's had a hip injury for the past 2 seasons which has really limited him. We're hoping he's nearing the end of it but we definitely need insurance.  2. Similar to Myles Turner and Jarrett Allen, you want to pair him with a big who can help out against post threats because they generally play him off the floor.    This offseason, one of our big areas of improvement will be the frontcourt. Thompson and Kornet have looked decent in their roles but we either need to add another big or swap one of those two out for another.   I'd say we're like a Dwight Howard away from having our C problem solved. Alternatively, if we could get Baynes playing well again."
"Apart from passing, what does prime Horford really do better than current Myles Turner?"
"Nah that‚Äôs Myles Turner, every time someone mentions him you would think he‚Äôs prime Wallace and shoots like KAT"
"Nikola Jokic   Joel Embiid   Rudy Gobert   KAT   Clint Capela   Nikola Vucevic   Bam Adebayo   Myles Turner    I think he‚Äôs around top 10, I guess depending on how you classify some guys like AD, Wood, etc.  Are there any obvious centers I‚Äôm missing who you rate over Nurk?"
Myles Turner can do that and stretch the floor to some degree.
"dude is better than myles turner, too bad he is never healthy"
Remember when people shit on the Celtics for not trading for Myles turner? This guy as almost if not just as good and doesn‚Äôt cost 18 million
Not trading for Myles Turner was the right decision. Also he has to be the starter next year
Real glad we didnt get Myles Turner
We should have gotten Myles Turner.
Because younger people on social media are almost exclusively using it to mean getting more likes than OP. And that‚Äôs what Myles Turner is asking about.
"you know you're old when you see myles turner referring to the ""younger generation."""
Myles Turner is 25 acting out here like hes a boomer
Myles turner is a pretty popular candidate right? That‚Äôs assuming Indiana becomes sellers
Wiseman should be gone if the GM has a brain. Trade him for myles turner
Draymond 27% 3pt is one reason the season wasnt a success. Warriors need to get a stretch 5 to make draymond playable.. trade wiseman and their pick for myles turner and keep the minny pick
Myles Turner
Warriors should trade wiseman and their lottery pick for myles turner..
"Generally speaking Redditors love certain categories of players.  1. Volume shooter with good TS - Curry, Dame, Beal, Lavine   2. 3 point specialist with high consistency - Ingles, Joe Harris, Clarkson, Seth Curry   3. Lots of blocks and steal - Myles Turner, Thybulle   4. 3 &amp; D specialists - Covington, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  Sometimes they go out of fashion but based on what I have seen here, it is generally true.  Players with 'clutch' reputation also have a lot of goodwill.   On the other hand, Triple double gang has polarized reputation."
Wiseman for Myles turner
Id trade wiseman and oubre for Myles turner.
"You are right, I wasn‚Äôt thinking role players, but like low level stars - high end role players. Like a Myles Turner, TJ Warren type. Players that aren‚Äôt role players but aren‚Äôt really stars. I‚Äôm also just not very high on Wiseman lol"
"Hopefully gonna use it to trade for Myles Turner, we‚Äôre in win now mode dont have time to wait for rookies to develop"
"Yeah but Wiseman can still be a great player, Myles Turner not so much"
Myles Turner or Christian wood
Myles Turner.  Dude is pretty underrated
Maybe myles turner
Sign and trade this mf for myles turner
The nets would straight up be better trading Kyrie for Clint Capela or Myles Turner. I‚Äôd be very skeptical of that ever happening though.
"He plays the power forward role because we typically have myles turner play the ""center"" (forgive me for not being from freedom land)"
I'm not sure that's true.  Sabonis is the focal point and is very comfortably suited towards a fast pace.  Brogdon and Levert can push the ball and are perfectly fine in an uptempo style.  Myles Turner is the 5 and he's certianly not plodding either.  I don't think I agree  And I'm not saying they should hoist a bunch of 3s but midrange jumpers are not a particularly efficient shot and plenty of teams are phasing them out entirely.  Leading the league in them seems backwards for a team trying to win in 2021
"Myles is kinda overstating to be honest. Dude is a 7 footer playing 30 minutes a game who averaged 6 rebounds. Ed Davis who‚Äôs 6‚Äô9 matches his rebounding production in like a 1/3 of the minutes. Turner is a lot like JJJ, in that for someone of his size, he really doesn‚Äôt use it properly and tends to rely on his skill to make up for lack of physicality."
Y‚Äôall trade Myles and decide to roll with Sabonis at the five and it‚Äôll be one of the worst decisions in the last decade. In basically every statistical category and metric we have Turner is more important than Sabonis to your team.   Do not let him go.
"Being without Myles Turner makes things a lot harder (although Russ had 35/14/21 when Turner did play). The Pacers don't really have a good defensive big man to replace Turner, usually that's when Russ will pick a team apart.   The Pacers lineup today was Brogdon / Holiday / McDermott / Brisset / Sabonis. Brogdon is probably the only solid defender in that group of players."
Myles Turner no love either. Only thing I would give them was that he was hurt the past 1.5 months. Probably get overlooked for either all defensive team too.
Yes. He is just lucky that he has Turner. Turner is the only reason he can play the way he plays. He‚Äôs not good enough to be a center on defense and not a good enough shooter to play the 4. So Myles checks both those boxes for him. He‚Äôs incredibly lucky that he‚Äôs playing with Turner
"I told you it‚Äôs not just about the eye poke, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs on his way up and also falls hard because of the hit to his face. Look at my edit though because I added one on Myles Turner that clearly isn‚Äôt intentional and only contact to the head but that‚Äôs called flagrant and they‚Äôre both on the ground. The point is the shit is just inconsistent and it could‚Äôve easily been flagrant"
What was Myles Turner saying about the casuals?
Idk but jeez Myles Turner is more valuable than I thought. This team is abhorrent defensively without him.
He‚Äôs used to playing next to Myles turner. He doesn‚Äôt usually have to help at the rim.
The Pacers have missed on literally every draft pick for the last 10 years except for Myles Turner in 2015. It's no wonder they aren't very good.
Myles Turner usually helps that problem some
"I‚Äôm curious to see what we do with our draft picks this year. We could package them for a vet with scoring abilities like jerami grant, maybe a better rim protector like Myles turner.   We could also double up on shooters/playmakers in the draft. Davion Mitchell at 7 and Jalen Johnson/Zaire Williams at 17 would be a sweet first round."
Wish I could upvote this twice.  /r/NBA has a surprisingly old understanding of basketball considering how young most of the sub is.   It‚Äôs why 9/10 members of this sub will tell you that Domantas Sabonis is more impactful/better than Myles Turner.
"Plan A longshots: Harden, Giannis, Embiid, etc.   Plan B stars: Beal, Paul George, etc  Plan C pseudo-stars: Hayward, Lonzo, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, etc."
"Y‚Äôall keep saying trade him, but for who? The only person who remotely makes sense is Myles turner. I can‚Äôt think of anyone else"
In retrospect they should have traded the 2nd pick along with a future 1st to Minnesota for their 1st and picked Edwards or just picked Ball and that would make us dangerous this year and build for the future but I understand the front office‚Äôs thinking. They just didn‚Äôt anticipate how raw he would be. I still have faith and he realistically has half a season to show growth before I think anything should be considered. You do not trade the potential of Wiseman for Myles Turner.
"he‚Äôs 100% a traditional center, a lot closer to Myles Turner than Giannis/Ayton/Bam"
Oh definitely getting Mobley would do wonders for KAT. Honestly a lot of the defensive woes is that he doesn‚Äôt have a front court partner that can rim protect when he‚Äôs pulled out to the perimeter. Even getting Myles turner would do a lot for him.   It does suck though that we have to say we actually watch players when saying something about them lol. It‚Äôs just a lot of people on this sub talk out of their ass about small markers and small market players and come to the conclusion based off of what they read from basketball reference
"The Drummond contract was clowned at the time, because he‚Äôs a limited center, so the same should be done to this very similar contract. Allen would be *grossly* overpaid. If I were the Cavs I‚Äôd just sign+trade him and find someone with his skillset for cheaper (Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, etc). They can‚Äôt be giving 25% of their cap to a center that isn‚Äôt even that good."
With Myles Turner *in* Sabonis should be the easy choice
"He's increased his PPG and rebounds each of the past three years. He's 9th in TS% at 66.1% this year, he's 3rd in blocks per foul behind Gobert and Myles Turner. And he's barely 23 years old.  I think he's shown improvement over the last years, and theoretically it could accelerate with a bigger role on a team like the Cavs. If you're going to take a chance on a young guy developing in his mid and late 20s, he seems like a good candidate."
"Myles Turner is currently perceived as better at least by this sub and the media. He has a similar contract to whats being floated for Allen and no one has been willing to send positive assets for him from the moment he signed his contract. I'm not sure Allen will ever be much better than he is now, most improvements will be becoming more intelligent, experienced and reading the game better on both ends which is not worth much more than the MLE. I don't think his skillset (playmaking, touch, post moves, footwork etc) will ever improve much outside an occasional midrange jumper no one will ever fear him taking.  I look forward to seeing this linked back when he makes his first All star game lol."
"I'm a Jazz fan &amp; Rudy Gobert is my favorite player.   This is an awesome rule &amp; if they gave it to Gobert, I'd be pissed for Myles Turner."
"For some reason the European players ignored, do not get covered in any of those mainstream media outlets. When Myles Turner out, Sabonis should've been the easy choice."
Or TJ Warren. Or Myles Turner.
"A package involving Oubre (sign and trade) Wiseman and pick(s) for Pacers‚Äô Myles and TJ  Curry/Warren/Wiggins/Green/Turner until Klay is back and playing comfortably, then TJ becomes the 6th man. He‚Äôs on an expiring contract, and with the Warriors being in 4th tier repeater tax territory, ownership probably happier paying tax on TJ‚Äôs one year $14M than Oubre‚Äôs a multi-year $15M per year deal."
Why did they a) choose to pass on Myles Turner b) Get rid of Theiss like he's garbage
"Hornets blown out by Pacers in win or go home game without Levert, Myles Turner and TJ Warren actually embarassing  Great showing from Pacers, 8 players with double digit scoring  Tough night for Lamelo also, Playing a high stake game as a Rookie maybe got to him mentally"
Maybe Hornets should offer Hayward for Myles Turner this season
Myles Turner who?
"well the pacers are missing tj warren, myles turner, jeremy lamb, and caris levert. Theres no sugarcoating it we just suck and we choked hard."
We have been great when Robert Williams has been on the floor and we literally had a hard working defensive big that spaced the floor till the trade deadline ? What would Myles Turner bring to the Celtics that would be greater  than spending that cap impact on a decent bench ?
Or Myles Turner
"LeVert, Myles Turner, TJ Warren"
how long is myles turner out for?
"Any time anything about Myles Turner is posted, a salty spoiled Celtics fan leaps off his seat and offers up a dumbass opinion."
&gt;Charlotte's interest in Myles Turner and Montrezl Harrell also became widely known around the league  Interesting about Trezz; I thought they'd go after him in FA last year due to them having cap space.  Wonder if they could've beaten LAL's offer.
Myles Turner basically underbusted the blocks leader title.
without Myles Turner and Caris LeVert though? definitely a shot at winning
Indiana is also missing Myles Turner
"Indiana may be without Brogdon, Sumner, and Aaron Holiday--three strong guards with different skillsets. If they do play, they may be rusty with the time off. Charlotte will be without a Martin, but Jaden McDaniels is a solid defensive wing who won't be asked to do much more than contest shots and rebound.   Without Myles Turner, the Indiana defense is absolute dog doo-doo. This game will be close. Sabonis is too much for PJ Washington, and if PJ isn't making Sabonis work on the defensive end, Sabonis could be in for a big game. The Hornets enter this game on a losing slide, but they've been playing teams better than the Pacers. I expect the Hornets to win this game. If they don't, Caris LeVert or Sabonis shoot over 60% and Charlotte turns the ball over too much."
"BI and Lonzo where much better defenders on the Lakers because they had a shot blocking big that they could funnel players into. I am not a Hayes believer by any stretch of the imagination but I do hope that pans out, but I've been saying this team needs to get myles turner because he'll completely change BI and Lonzo while providing some semblance of spacing."
"Me too. That‚Äôs why I think they should move him while his value is high. He‚Äôs definitely in the way in NO.   NO needs a pass first point guard who can defend and space the floor (Lonzo). They need to run their offense around Zion who deserves even more usage than he‚Äôs getting. Surround him with Danny Green and Mikal Bridges like defenders with a low usage rim protector who can preferably space the floor like Myles Turner so the paint is wide open for Zion.   Alexander-Walker can come off the bench and score and still play thirty minutes. Kid has the talent. And then a decent scoring big who plays better defense than Willy.   That‚Äôs a lot of work, but it would fix them. Trading Ingram is the easiest way for them to get some of those pieces.   Like imagine if they had Boucher instead of Steven Adams clogging the paint. Would you trade OG and Boucher for Ingram?"
"That's close, but Myles Turner vs Dame isn't. More often than not you take the PG"
"BBQ Chicken for the most part. Players like Myles Turner, Gobert, and Ayton are more valuable than trying to shut down a one-on-one matchup between some of the best bigs in the game. You have to look at the impact they have around the rim and in the paint for the opposing team as a whole."
Myles Turner was available
You‚Äôre more forgiving of BI‚Äôs one sided game than I am. Unlikely that changes haha.   But I do think rim protection is going to be a problem next to Zion forever. You almost need a Nerlens Noel type player on a Nerlens Noel type contract.   Or a Myles Turner who may be the most undervalued player in the league.
"NOLA needs spacing more than anything, followed closely by defense. Once they move Adams/Bledsoe's money to Zion's extension, they need a 3&amp;D SG and a 3&amp;D C. Lonzo is their 3&amp;D PG. They'd be going backwards by letting him go.   Something like Lonzo/Joe Harris/Ingram/Zion/Myles Turner would be filthy, and plays perfectly to Zion and Ingram's strengths. If the Nets blow it up in a few years, it might even happen"
Nerlens needs to be considered as one of the premier defensive guys in this league imo. Better than Myles Turner don‚Äôt @me  Watching him play is just scary. If the Knicks keep him for 10M a year that would be an absurd pickup.
"He's supposed to be a stretch big, right? Myles Turner isn't a great rebounder either, but he stretches the floor and blocks a lot of shots. Is that how JJJ's being developed?"

"Did you really just ask how much better Sabonis &amp; Myles Turner are than Oshae Bisette &amp; Goga? How much better Brogdon &amp; TJ Warren are over Justin Holiday &amp; Doug McDermott? lol I know r/NBA doesn‚Äôt actually watch basketball or understand it but cmon now, you can at least pretend to understand that starters are better than backups for a reason"
Myles turner is overrated. His shooting is overrated and so is his defense. Time lord better
"Imagine Myles Turner on the roster. Oh wait, why not have Evan Fournier instead"
"Our owner wanted to keep/use the pick.  The Pacers were shopping Myles Turner to a number of teams, most publicly the Celts.  But apparently they brought him up in talks to us and a few others, not sure how serious they were."
"We have a ton of picks and we could have gotten Myles Turner.  Our front office is amazing and has worked wonders for years, but our owner is interfering to a point now.  When Klay went down instead of letting the front office manage his team he called everyone in for a meeting and said ""we're not tanking again, go get me players"".  While I appreciate we have an owner who cares and is willing to foot the bill, paying for a 1 year rental of Kelly Oubre was not the solution.  We had an opportunity to flip the Wiseman pick for Myles Turner.  With Oubre's salary and assets thrown in, it would have worked.  We'd be a contending team in 2021-22.  Now we're only a contending team if Wiseman's development jumps forward."
"Drummond played too many minutes for my liking today. If Myles Turner was playing today, Pacers would have won by like 15. What happened to benching Drummond in key moments? I miss that. Only lasted 1 game. Sad."
I would still have rather we flipped the Wiseman pick for Myles Turner.  But we have a real chance.
"Dallas guys always go off against us. Myles Turner, Randle, marcus smart, this dude, LMA and Bosh when they played."
"Yeah I‚Äôm not expecting him to be able to maintain such a high level of volume and efficiency consistently going forward but I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic about a long term improvement in his  finishing to some extent going forwards.   Despite the ups and downs, he‚Äôs brought his overall efficiency up to 68.2 for the year. He‚Äôs right about where Doncic is (.4 less) on about 15% lower volume and is higher in both measures than Butler, KAT, Tobias Harris, Steph, CP3, and Trae among others.  And the small number of games is somewhat less worrisome to me given the sample size of his shots. He made as many shots post all star break as Harden did all year and more than all of  Mitchell, Paul George, Ingram, Trae, Middleton, and Myles Turner. He‚Äôs actually made four times the number of field goals since the break as CP3 has made all season and on better efficiency whether you‚Äôre considering his percentage for the second half of or the whole season.  We‚Äôll see though. Hot streaks are still a thing and I‚Äôm not making any conclusions yet besides the fact that he had a good season from there and an excellent second half."
"Been saying it for a year, but getting multiple assets (think TJ Warren and Myles Turner for both their first rounders) make a lot of sense.  That way, they don‚Äôt have to sign Oubre to a huge deal.  Not sure if they want to move Warren though."
They should trade for Myles Turner
Myles Turner is only 25
Indiana could make a solid offer based around Caris Levert and Myles Turner. They are proven young players that will fit positions of need. Washington may not be able to go into full tank mode while they still have Westbrook and I'm not sure they'll be able to move his contract so fielding a young team he might be able to carry to the playoffs is a viable option.
Wiggins should stay IMO his wing defense is too important helps us slow down superstar wings like Lebron Kawhi etc. He just needs to get better at finishing in paint and rebounding. I think it's  better if we trade Wiseman and 14th(if lucky) or 7th pick for Myles Turner snd fill up bench with vets. Curry Klay Wiggins Draymond Turner is the best defensive lineup in the league+ we have a 5 who can actually stretch the floor which we've never had
You need Myles Turner in crunch time. Whether you agree or not Myles Turner is objectively one of the best defenders in the NBA and undoubtedly the single greatest rim protector in the league. His 3 point numbers won‚Äôt blow you away and his inside game is nothing special but he‚Äôs a good rebounder and has a good jumper. You can‚Äôt leave him open from anywhere on the floor.
Go get Myles Turner.
Myles Turner is way better on paper than in reality
Myles Turner is the same age as well.
"Same thing with turner for us, we went from hovering around middle of the pack defensively to near bottom of the league last season after Myles went down"
"Somehow get him Jimmy Butler and he's 100% staying. Jimmy compliments him perfectly. But realistically, one or more of Simmons, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, Noel (continues listing 2 way wings and elite defensive bigs)"
"Please leave my pineapple alone, I fucking love Myles Turner"
Is Myles Turner the most *potentially* traded player in the league?  Feels like every offseason he is in trade rumors.
"They can trade Looney + Wiseman instead of Wiggins + Wiseman for Wood, while Looney + Wiseman for Myles Turner or Pascal Siakam doesn't work"
That doesn‚Äôt change the fact he‚Äôs 20 years old. You think if Myles Turner as is was on the board we wouldn‚Äôt have drafted him?
"Lmao ikr, I‚Äôd be fckin livid if they sold wiseman at his lowest value for Myles fckin turner, and I‚Äôd chop my cock and throw it in the river if we gave the 7 and 14 with it. I‚Äôm for trading the picks but Jesus god what an overpay"
Of course they would. Nobody is paying that for Myles Turner.
myles turner isn't an all star
Myles Turner on the GSW would be a major win for them. He's entering his prime and is the best or second best rim protector in the league with the ability to shoot from 3.
Myles Turner!
Pelicans could have had Myles Turner and George Hill on cheaper deals around Zion and consciously chose Steven Adam‚Äôs and Eric Bledsoe on worse contracts and shooting
Who would you consider better than Myles Turner that we could get for that trade package?
how many players better than Myles Turner are even really available for trade AND actually compliment what the Warriors are trying to do though...?
Myles Turner is ass. Don‚Äôt do it dubs
I think his point is you can get a better player for that package than Myles Turner
Warriors arent gonna do this deal. Instead they'll end up trading for myles turner.. the deals that warriors make are the silent ones nobody hears anything about..
"There‚Äôs a wide gap between not good and fucking max contract lol. THT is fine, but Jesus dude 4/83 puts him with Jalen Brown, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Issac, Malcom Brogdon, Myles Turner, Fred Vanvleet, Jerami Grant, etc.  *could* he be as good as those guys someday? Sure, why not? Should he be getting paid like those guys with his contract? Hell nah."
They should make a run for someone like Myles Turner on the Pacers. A shot-blocking 4/5 who is a credible threat from 3 on offense.
"he averaged 3.4 blocks per game this season, Myles Turner is very reliable on defense"
"&gt;15 - Devin Booker, Karl Anthony Towns, Kristaps Porzingis, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Myles Turner  So KP is a SF here?"
"Fun fact, Myles Turner had a better True Shooting percentage than Christian Wood this year. So get out of here with that efficiency argument. Additionally, they are not comparable at all on defense and Turner is the type of player that would fit on the Warriors much better."
The idea of Myles Turner is better than actually having him
"Frankly, if your best option on the trade market is Myles Turner, I'd rather just keep Wiseman."
"I‚Äôm skeptical, but if we can trade for Myles Turner and shed enough salary to throw a max at Collins or another quality RFA then maybe it could be a decent move?"
I feel like 7 and Wiseman is a better return than what Myles Turner should get. I'm interested in what the rest of the package could be.
Why do I hear Myles Turner music
"They should be all over Dame, hell maybe even Simmons. Myles Turner would be interesting too"
Myles Turner gets traded and puts up all defense 2nd team numbers.
"Simmons really would be a solid fit, outside of ideal but unrealistic options like kawhi, PG, etc. Ideally we then flip nurkic and picks for Myles Turner in a 3 way deal  Lillard/Norm/Simmons/RoCo/Turner has the potential to be top 5-10 on both ends.   It's a massive upgrade on defense, and Dame alone is a guaranteed top 10 offense. Give him 3 shooters + Simmons as a trap buster out of the PnR and it would work"
13th pick and Myles Turner for 10th(Pelicans)?
"Paul George, Jimmy, Kawhi, AD, Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Justice Winslow to name a few."
"I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs going to be that difficult. His playstyle is comparable to lebron or Giannis, a freight train that gets inside and can dish out. You just need a capable shooter like a Myles Turner, Ibaka, or even Wagner"
Myles turner gets no love
The final piece is trading their recent picks for Myles turner. Then the rest of us can get ready for next season.
"I think there are legitimate concerns about KAT's fit (he's never been a great defender and would have to learn the Warriors system with Draymond yelling at him), but impact metrics say he's way better than Wiggins, so you probably take the deal and figure the rest out later.  However, I think Myles Turner gives them nearly the same impact for far less... they could match salaries with only Wiseman+Looney and run out a dominant starting lineup of Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, and Turner with plenty of bench depth. Would hate to see Looney go but I think it's the right all-in move."
"I watch every Warriors game and doubt Wiggins will make the ASG... he is not a top 12 player in the West.  Very premature Western Conference All-Star predictions: Curry, Jokic, George, Draymond, Gobert, Morant, Doncic, Mitchell, Davis, LeBron, Booker  That's 11 who should make it over Wiggins fairly easily barring injury, and after that you've still got Lillard, CP3, SGA, KAT, Conley, Barnes, etc. to contend with.  I could see Wiggins making it if the Warriors continue on this rampage and are the clear top seed in the West... then they might get 3 All-Stars. I'd give him an outside shot, maybe 20%.  Not sure I'd trade him for KAT since I think his wing defense might be more valuable to the Warriors than KAT's offense. Not so high on Wiseman though - I think Kuminga has shown more flashes - but you'd have to ship out Wiggins to make salaries match. I think Myles Turner would be a better fit than KAT."
"Gobert is in a weird player rung where he completely dad dicks most of the league, usually has the upper hand on the myles turner/bam rung of players, but typically gets his clock cleaned by jokic and embiid.   It‚Äôs just clear there‚Äôs just those two centers, gobert, bam and then everybody else"
it was the exact same thing against myles turner lmao he got like 6 blocks
*Stares at Myles Turner*....So you're saying there's a chance
They have the second best shooter coming back and if they can turn their young dudes into Myles turner god help us all
"[Dispelling Myths Around Gobert‚Äôs Defense](https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/)  &gt; Myth #1: Gobert can‚Äôt guard on the perimeter  &gt; Let‚Äôs start with isolation defense. This year, there were 87 players that guarded at least 50 isolations. **If mainstream highlight reels are your source of information here, you‚Äôd expect to see Rudy at the bottom of the pack. Actually, the opposite is true**. Gobert allows the seventh fewest points per possession (PPP). Opponents score an average of 0.71 points per isolation when Gobert is defending. **That‚Äôs less than Simmons (0.73), Anunoby (0.76), Bam Adebayo (0.78), Mikal Bridges (0.97), Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.06), Clint Capela (1.07), and Myles Turner (1.08)**. Gobert also allows the third lowest scoring frequency (30.6%), the eighth lowest FG% (32%), and the fourth lowest FT throw frequency (4.7%) when guarding opponents in isolation.  Wait, so you don't think having 4 other meh to poor defenders on your team would contribute to a DPOY centre getting dunked on? How do you think an offensive player gets a chance to dunk on Gobert? They have to first get downhill into the paint, which would mean they blow by their defender in isolation (which happens a lot for the Jazz) or through handoffs/screens. If you have bad defenders, do you think it makes it easier or harder for a player to get into the paint with enough freedom to go up and dunk on a 7'1 DPOY centre? And do you think having bad defenders would hold up an offensive player long enough for a big man to get into help position and ready up for a good contest vs being late on the contest? Defense is a team game, not even Rudy Gobert can single handedly cover up all the issues with the Jazz's defense, issues that aren't on him but his teammates and the coaching staff having a defensive system that is ""let Rudy Gobert just clean up your fuck ups""."
Myles Turner if the cap magically worked and he was willing to come off the bench. But idk if we have enough to offer. Maybe Mo Bamba
"""He's rich, he can afford not to work""  Ummm yeah, that's kind of my point lol  Also his name was not dragged through the mud at all. He played poorly and was criticized but he was never thrown under the bus. Doc genuinely answered a question about Ben as a championship PG as opposed to sugarcoating the reality and lying and Embiid simply pointed out where he thought the momentum in the game turned and didn't even say Ben's name while also holding himself accountable for his own poor performance in that series  The mudslinging only started after Ben refused to show up and basically challenged the Sixers to do something about it. Also literally every player in the NBA outside of the top 5 or 10 players is involved in trade rumors and discussions. As someone else pointed out on this thread, it's amazing that Myles Turner can even pick up a basketball with how many trade discussions he's been in"
How do you feel about the presence of Myles Turner on Pacers?
"If a player can sit out and collect paychecks just because they were involved in a lot of trade rumors, a quarter of the NBA can claim this disability and not bother to play.  I mean if what you say is true then it's a miracle that Myles Turner can still pick up a basketball right now"
"All of the northeast teams boo their players. Myles turner has been in trade rumors the past 3 years and he‚Äôs still playing crazy this year.   Also, the mental health stuff happened after he tried to go out w a back injury."
Myles Turner bout to drop 7 3s again
"I don't think there is a player out there that helps as much.  The only one I'd consider is Myles Turner.  Remember, the dollars have to match, so we can only get a 20 million dollar player tops.  How Kuminga played last night that would be a hard sell if he keeps improving.  I'd go as far to say if we did that for Turner I'd want picks as well."
"Players basketball reference lists as centers who take more than that per game: 17 (KAT, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Horford, Jokic, Bamba, Olynyk, Vucevic, Wendell Carter, Jr., Muscala, Sabonis, Theis, Mo Wagner, Bjelica, Jeff Green, Anthony Davis, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl)  And that's just on a per-game basis - if we did per 36 I'm sure that number would be significantly higher.  I'm not trying to disrespect Valanciunas - he's a good player - it just never made sense that people were claiming that he's a floor-spacing 5"
We would very much like a Myles Turner please. Brogdon seems like a great fit on the Cs.
Myles Turner only do blocks and it‚Äôs not a good defender because rebounds.
Since he's got no love for it so far... Myles Turner DPOY
Myles Turner&gt;Gobert
JJJ is having a bad game today but he's not having a bad season by any stretch.  He's a very good young player with a similar skillset to Myles Turner.
They said to get Myles Turner?!? lol
"Ahhhh. That's what I knew him as pre injury. Solid rebounded with good shot block tendencies.   Similar to the path Myles turner was on, just defensively"
"r/nba still doesn't get it. We tanked on purpose, and we tanked to maximize Curry's prime. You simply cannot maintain a dynasty in the modern NBA because of how the cap is structured and the nature of wear and tear. The team needed a break, their version of MJ taking 2 years off. Get assets, rebuild, and contend again. Had we gone ""Win now"" last year and traded everything for MYLES TURNER or whatever this sub said, we'd be in a way worse position."
"The thing is, potentially overperforming rookie contracts will be a great way to still contend while Curry is on the roster, I‚Äôd rather have that than Myles Turner or whatever ‚Äúwin-now‚Äù player people think we should overpay for"
Should be Myles Turner
"It‚Äôs more likely we trade Wiggins for a big piece at this point, and Kuminga may have to be thrown in because Wiggins isn‚Äôt worth his contract. As for who? My eye is on Myles Turner. Dude can defend and space the floor. If the Pacers continue to flounder they may blow it up. KAT would also work too, but we‚Äôd need a third team because I doubt Minny wants Wiggins back."
"I don‚Äôt think you thought this through. Who to trade for? What star is available?   No, Ben Simmons is not a superstar. Dame or Beal would be the dream but they don‚Äôt want out.  Neither is KAT nor does Minny want to move on from him yet.   Another thing is salary matching, Wiggins is the only contract that they use as salary match so the guy netting in return has to be of that value.  Also fit, does that guy they trade for even fit with what they try to do?   Let‚Äôs say Brandon Ingram, ok he‚Äôs a better scorer and passer than Wiggins but they actually need Wiggins better defense and actually reliable availability over Ingram who‚Äôs a poor defender and often miss games due to injuries.  Even the lesser guys like Myles Turner and Christian Wood as names get thrown around don‚Äôt make sense.. because salary matching, and value in return doesn‚Äôt move the needle to be a significantly better team. Wood can‚Äôt defend a PnR, Myles is inconsistent and a weak rebounder. Wiggins are far more important than Myles Turner plus Jeremy lamb in return"
"Turner is a borderline all star big with elite defense coming into his basketball prime at 25.  In the long run, yeah he might not be worth 2 lottery picks.  But in order to maximize ""win now"", you gotta give up some eventual value.  The question isn't whether Myles Turner is worth it or not because if winning now is the goal, then a big that is reliable on offense (he also shoots 3's well) and has elite defense is basically all the Warriors need to become heavy favorites.   The true question is whether we need him.  We're fighting other teams that only have sticks with swords. Yeah we have a weapon advantage but they could still get a lucky whack in and maybe we lose.  Getting someone like Myles Turner would make it so we're fighting with pistols. It's basically a sure win.  Although if the 4 young guys we have become what they can be in the next 2 years. We'll be fighting with bazookas because it'll probably be the deepest team in NBA history. If anyone upgrades to pistols, we'll still blow them out of the water.  So what do you value? A pretty good chance of winning now and being a juggernaut later, or cashing in now and securing the championship but losing out on becoming a historic team again later."
"&gt; I never compared him to an all star. Please work on your reading comprehension skills. I used him as an example of a valuable player being traded for literally free. My point being if you actually want to pull off trades and pay the price for the trade, it can actually happen. Your FO didn‚Äôt even attempt that which they said themselves.  Your logic skills are lacking if you believe that using a bench player as an example that bonafide all stars are available even makes sense. There were none available because most all-stars are either trying to make the playoffs or ask out in the offseason.   &gt; No trade is ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù until it happens hence the constant meming that goes around them once a trade happens. There are multiple players available if you actually want to make a trade happen, for example Pacers and Grizzlies just to name some teams have log jams at certain positions and are in stuck in a 8-9 seed range.  Are any of those available players all-stars? That‚Äôs speaking pretty highly of Dillon Brooks and Myles Turner. Neither of those players would have been traded at the middle of last season and neither would you take at the #2 ovr pick so why the heck would you trade a #2 ovr pick for them? That‚Äôs just bad business and you‚Äôll regret the deal for the rest of your GM career.   No he actually had a stronger first half of the season offensively lol. **The issue was his defence and decision making was terrible**  Which got better before he was hurt. Started realizing his role and fouling less.   &gt; It‚Äôs wild how the Warriors were clearly so much better with him off the court by literally all metrics even including basic win loss yet you can‚Äôt accept the fact they would‚Äôve been better with an all star or high end role player instead.  I won‚Äôt accept the fact that they‚Äôd be better with an All-star player because there weren‚Äôt any available. You‚Äôd most likely be happier with a billion dollars but as of right now it‚Äôs not feasible you‚Äôll get it. As for a high end role player maybe. But here‚Äôs the point. Does that role player win us a play-in game? That is unknown because the team choked both those games. Do they win against the Jazz with that role player? Definitely not. Does that role player make them win 3-4 more games? I don‚Äôt believe so because we still have Oubre(who was a fairly high end role player in his own right before he came), Bazemore, and Wanamaker. Does that role player win us a playoff series? I say no. So if that role player doesn‚Äôt win you a series last year. For CERTAIN doesn‚Äôt get you to the WCF, and they really don‚Äôt increase your odds all that much the next season, and by year 3-4 Wiseman could be passing them already, why would you do that deal? If the player you acquire isn‚Äôt worth taking #2 ovr in the draft then don‚Äôt trade the #2 ovr draft pick for him. It‚Äôs that simple going win-now doesn‚Äôt all of a sudden make you do brain dead moves that you‚Äôll answer for down the line."
They wasted his 2021 season because his co-star tore his Achilles and FAs wanted to join lol. What is that take?   The Lakers won one ring that‚Äôs nice. What if they could win more? Would you prefer slightly better chances at 1 rn or a great chance at 1 and 2-3 more or so down the line? Because the Lakers are done when Lebron retires or becomes washed. AD won‚Äôt save them because he has no help at all. The Warriors are looking to carry Steph when he declines and continue without him when he retires. And Myles Turner doesn‚Äôt win anyone a playoff series btw other than maybe a bad defensive team like the Nets much less a title.
"Myles Turner would be my choice if GS ever traded the young ones.  That being said having a bonafide center that plays major minutes has never been GS' thing.  Even when Wiseman comes back we'll be running small ball a lot more and Wise would only play big minutes against a team with a Jokic/Embiid/AD.  I do think Wiseman can turn into Javale Mcgee at least for now. Rim protector + lob threat. That's all he needs to do and GS won with Javale on the team.  The question is whether the FO is content trying to fight swords vs sticks or trade and fight guns vs sticks. If the first approach works, it sets up GS to eventually fight with bazookas."
"The problem is NBA trades and money in and money out, so we either get rid of a big salary player, or bundles our rooks and get someone for around 20 million.  In that range your getting Myles Turner or Buddy Hield tops.   I'm honestly not sure if that's worht the price giving up our 3 young players.  If Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman are say 75 ranked players, why give them up for an 85?  Getting a big name we have to dump Wiggins, Klay, or Dray."
"AD? The same AD who gets a booboo report on a nightly basis?  There are only a few players that would make GS better, after all, there is only one ball.  Myles Turner is one such player.  The only player worth overhauling the offense for is Giannis and he ain't leaving nor will the Bucks take any trade for him"
"Towns. Simmons. NO THANK YOU.  Best trade I could think of is Myles Turner and ideally it's for Wiseman/Kuminga (one of the two only) + Moody and future picks. Pacers would likely ask for all 3 + picks though.  But IMO it is better to keep them. If you are 15 players deep, you have the luxury of plugging any of these rooks in with 4 other experienced players just like what happened with Kuminga tonight.  GS is a very fluid yet systematic offense. Anyone who can buy into the offense and hustles can thrive.  Kuminga and Moody play G league games then come to Chase and are still available to play. It's a good mix of them getting a lot of minutes and being in the actual GS games.  I wouldn't trade any of them. I like what Steve Kerr is doing integrating them slowly along with their SCW minutes."
"Well I mentioned another defensive minded option that you conveniently ignored lol  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to watch your young guys develop. There‚Äôs also nothing wrong with thinking maximizing Steph‚Äôs championship odds should be a priority. Both options are fine. That said, you‚Äôre underselling Myles Turner by calling him ‚Äúsome random dude‚Äù. He‚Äôs one of the best rim protectors in the league and has developed into a solid offensive player as well. Wiseman, Kuminga and Moody are the ‚Äúrandom dudes‚Äù in this scenario, not the established talent. Enjoy your team bruv."
"Imo your biggest area of need is the 5. If you‚Äôre looking for more offensive firepower I‚Äôd suggest Christian Wood. If you‚Äôre looking for a more supercharged defence you can target Myles Turner.  To be clear, you‚Äôre obviously contenders regardless. I just think certain moves can shift you from contenders to bonafide favourites (assuming Kyrie actually doesn‚Äôt play this season)."
the hornets need to trade for myles turner
Fuck that. I don't want KAT on the team.  If anything I would rather have Myles Turner.  Draymond would be yelling at KAT every night and by the end of the season KAT will be at home playing fortnite missing games because he doesn't like Dray.
"This guy is a nonce. He initiated the entire altercation by grabbing Turner as he fell, then when Turner gave him a bump Gobert just goes and aggressively embraces him. Then to namedrop his boxing coach as if he's the French Tyson Fury and Myles Turner was lucky he only got a cuddle. Dingus.  This coupled with his microphone touching last year give me the impression he is a grade A moron."
"Tbh I think it's more that we could use a good big man in general as opposed to UD being the difference. We're pretty undersized and guys like AD, Embiid and most 7 footers give Bam a lot of problems. I've been pushing a Myles Turner for Duncan Robinson trade for a while lol.   We have Omer Yurtseven as a prospect who should be getting more mins in that situation (and he did well in the mins he did play) although he's still pretty raw. But once we ease him in I can definitely see him getting more minutes at the expense of UD. It was largely just foul trouble that meant we had to spread the big man load a bit"
I hope his primary role will be part of a trade package for Myles Turner. I want to keep Kuminga though
"No it‚Äôs not Unless the Warriors trade klay, draymond or Wiggins  And the Timberwolves will not trade for Wiggins And the Warriors will not trade draymond or klay   The only Trade possible without including any of those players is Wiseman, Kuminga, looney, moody, Poole, lee, Tuscano-Anderson $29.1 mil Kat 31.6 mil  I think the most reasonable one would be if the pacers decided to blow it up they could prob get  some combo of kuminga/moody/wiseman for like Myles Turner or sabonis"
"Use him, unless we can get Myles Turner."
"&gt;Can you imagine how uncomfortable it is to have a full sized Myles Turner living rent-free in your head?  Lol, Turner has been talking about Rudy for like 3 years."
It is.  I have a feeling Myles Turner would turn Ruby Gobert into a Quiche
"Myles Turner has a 7'4"" wingspan so not that big of a deal."
So why is Rudy even going on about this?  Can you imagine how uncomfortable it is to have a full sized Myles Turner living rent-free in your head?
His username is indicative of a parody Myles Turner burner account while yours might literally be Rudy‚Äôs Reddit burner
"finally another team gets burned by myles turner at the 3 point line  this would low key be a nightmare playoff matchup for the jazz, good thing they are in the other conference"
Sure but not Brogdon is THE most underrated.. I mean theres still guys like Myles Turner who hasn't been getting playing time cause of his trade value..   I wouldn't say brogdon is THE MOST underrated though.. sure y'all lost him but still got a championship out of it

"Worst has been injuries. Which seem Like it‚Äôs just part of us smh  Best is Myles. This version is an all star, he changes every game. Easily best rim protector in the league and shooting the 3 ball at an elite clip.   There‚Äôs very few people in the league I‚Äôd trade this guy for. I‚Äôm a major Domas Stan but if this is the Turner we‚Äôre going to get, it‚Äôs an easy decision who to move and it pains me to say it."
Myles Turner getting 3 people ejected is dpoy in my book
Good takedown defense from Myles Turner
"MYLES TURNER IS A BETTER PLAYER THAN GOBERT  Turner way better offensive player   Turner is no slouch on defense, there is not a big enought gap between gobert and tuner on d   &amp;#x200B;  thats why baby gobert was mad that turner was schooling him"
"Lol I didn‚Äôt even realize how sad this was before but Turner was only 13/9 lmao. with 3 wide open threes (against a zone in that third). Rudy was 19/11 and put it on Myles‚Äô head. Got him back with a single block on Rudy and that‚Äôs dad dicking in Indy. Such lottery vibes, I feel bad for clowning in your rare celebration opportunity"
This dude is SALTY in multiple threads.   One last time. Myles Turner absolutely dad dicked your boy all over tonight. To the point it drove him into an ejection.  Eat that L boy.
"I mean, he shoves the ref out of the way and was quickly reaching for Myles Turner before getting pushed, not entirely sure he had the best of intentions. History has shown he will come to the aid of his teammates quick with aggression, just look at the Suns scuffle a few years back."
"I mean you do you my guy, just watch your head when you‚Äôre raising the banner  Yeah dude, Rudy is very scared of Myles Turner you‚Äôre right. He definitely didn‚Äôt pack it on him multiple times tonight, good take or add you call it, *emotion*"
"What? the problem was were were NOT physical.  I give credit to Indy they played hard all night, that's why they were beating us so definitively, the game wasn't as close as the score. Jazz were soft all night, even the jazz fighting was soft lol. Don was just as soft waiting for the pacers to go to the bench before acting tough haha. Rudy and Myles were chirping back and forth all night long, and Turner absolutely was throwing harder and harder swipes at Rudy when he could.  You want to turn this into my team can beat up your team have at it chief, I got no interest."
"yeah, when Myles gets pulled down by Gobert a foul should be called.  When Gobert is trying to instigate shit all night with Turner he should get a tech.  Youre right, they should have called your guy on that."
"Both of you are exaggerating. Myles fouls Gobert, but doesn‚Äôt clobber him. Gobert then pulls Turner to the ground, a foul and probably a tech. Then Turner retaliates and we get this video."
If you accepted that gobert is an all time great defender and is miles better than myles I might consider conceding that turner is the best shot blocker currently.
"Myles clobbers Rudy's head, should have been a foul on Turner.   Rudy tries to slow Turner down so as to not allow a 5 on 4, should have been a foul on Rudy.   Turner gives Rudy a cheap shot, should have been a tech on Turner.   Rudy retaliates, refs finally get it right and call a tech on Rudy."
Disgusting behavior. Myles Turner should be traded to the Timberwolves for Malik Beasley Naz Reid and a 2nd round pick immediately as a punishment for this egregious act.
The idea of trading Myles Turner is better than trading Myles Turner
"He pulled Myles Turner down. Of course it‚Äôs his fault. They both had blocked each other and other players multiple times tonight without any escalation previously. Missed foul calls happen almost every play, yet this stuff rarely happens.   So yeah, it‚Äôs Rudy‚Äôs fault for yanking the opposing player down to the ground. That‚Äôs what escalated the situation."
You can't tell me Myles Turner isn't the defensive player of the year. Took 3 guys out in one play that's DPOY type shit.
Gobert seems super threatened by the presence of Myles Turner
He thought he was gonna truck Myles Turner like Jokic was doing. LOL
‚ÄúFRENCH TOAST ISN‚ÄôT EVEN TOAST! ITS GRILLED!!‚Äù  -Myles Turner probably
Gobert pulls down Myles after Myles gets a clean block.  Jazz fans: What a dirty player Turner is.  Lol.
Imagine Myles Turner getting a nonstop paid vacation bc Indiana has been trying to trade him ü§£
"I'm saying you're wrong. Even Myles Turner took only 54% of his attempts from 10+ feet out, same as Embiid. Offensively, Embiid spaced the floor exactly as you're picture perfect big is supposed to. I'm not sure what part of this you do not understand."
There‚Äôs about 7 or 8 starting caliber centers out of 30 teams (25%) that are able to shoot 3s at a consistent rate. They don‚Äôt grow on trees. Factor in which teams would be able/willing to trade for Simmons and have one for him to play with and that list is pretty much Myles Turner. Joel is easily the best among them not named Jokic so I struggle to see how it‚Äôs a poor fit.
If they really want to play KP at the 4 then I think they have to trade for Myles Turner and maybe trade Bullock for T Ross.
"No I think you‚Äôre misunderstanding him. It would have to be someone who plays center on defense and is almost strictly a perimeter player on offense. Basically only Myles Turner fits this mold. Embiid doesn‚Äôt play behind the 3 point line enough to be able to fit well next to Ben. And it would be absolutely stupid to camp the best post player in the league behind the 3 pt line, even if he has a pretty good shot."
"Would Indiana consider a package built around DLo for Myles Turner? Could look something like:  **Minnesota trades:** D'Angelo Russell, Jaden McDaniels and 2024 FRP.  **Indiana trades:** Myles Turner, TJ McConnell and Jeremy Lamb.  It gives Minnesota their stretch 5 and a point guard who will simply *facilitate*, while allowing Indiana to move Brogdon to the 2 and have a pure PG in DLo. Also gives them a solid option at the 4 next to Sabonis in McDaniels.  **Minnesota:** McConnell/Beverley, Beasley, Edwards, KAT, Turner with Beverley/McConnell, Lamb, Okogie, Vando and Reid off the bench.  **Indiana:** DLo, Brogdon, LeVert, Warren, Sabonis with Duarte, Holiday, Craig, McDaniels and Goga off the bench."
I think a Siakam for Myles Turner trade would be great for both teams
"Oh yeah no doubt, that‚Äôs why you guys are so successful because it really is a pick your poison and on most nights I‚Äôd be okay with this outcome for that very reason. Coming off the heels of guys like Ricky Rubio and Myles Turner shooting over 70% against you from behind the arc though and I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm throwing my hands up and saying that eventually the law of averages has to come into affect here."
"Sure but..   Myles Turner, Rubio, and Connaughton don't just go off like that out of nowhere. These anomalies are wild."
"Plenty of trade opportunities before the deadline, they have 3 young guys that aren't helping much at all and Wiggins to match salaries..KAT, Wood, Ingram, Siakam, Simmons, Myles Turner...."
Myles turner is a dope dude saw him at a Nike store one time and made a joke with him lol
"You guys wait till this year is done to make a judgment call on him. McMillan sat him in a corner since Sabonis fit McMillan's playstyle and Myles didn't say anything, just did his job. Bjorkgren wanted the Pacers to be the Raptors 2.0 despite not having teh same team.  Carlisle will show you guys some stuff. Look for Turner to have a breakout season and possibly get MIP this year. No joke.  Remind me at the end of the season..."
"Myles Turner is the type of player that will never find an equal return if the package is based on players, because he is good enough to be worth more than role players but not good enough to net a bonafide starter.   My idea for him was always DFS and two unprotected FRPs and count that Rick still loves DFS."
"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd do it for Sabonis, but we‚Äôd definitely consider it for Myles. We constantly talk about Myles in our sub. Consensus seems to be PJ+picks and filler (which almost certainly means Hayward, or Rozier down the line) for Turner and Lamb.  Sabonis is great, but it‚Äôs not what we need. I straight up pass on Sabonis unless we can absolutely fleece the fuck out of you for him.  He doesn‚Äôt fit stylistically, and he doesn‚Äôt defend the rim. If Sabonis is all we could get, we honestly might be better off just holding on to the assets."
"Not sure what you think I'm making him out to be, but I certainly don't think he's 22 and can double his numbers. I've been a constant critic of his rebounding and his aggressiveness on offense. He's isn't a star and he's not the value level of another star. I think that's a level take on him.  And most Pacers fans agree with that, but what you're probably seeing is the most stout fans of his defending him. He gets lots of criticism in the fanbase though, so I don't think what you're saying is actually indicative of our fan base.   Basically what I'm saying is if the Pacers are planning on staying steady and not blowing up the roster then I don't want to see them get rid of Turner for the sake of getting rid of him. That doesn't mean I think he's some star who's just being hidden behind Sabonis and I'm demanding a treasure trove for him, but it **does** mean it'd have to be a pretty darn compelling offer for me to be interested.  TLDR; it has less to do with how I value Myles trade value and more how I value Myles as a Pacer."

"His own NBA execs drafted TJ Leaf over OG and John Collins so idk if they're the best measuring stick lol. Clint is a great player, but I think he's comparable to Turner. Turner scores more and gets more blocks if we're just looking at stats. I know Clint is a better roll-man, but Myles give you the option to run pick and rolls or pick and pops."
So would you like a detailed analysis of why I don't want Joe Harris for Myles Turner? Lmao. All I'm saying.
Brook Lopez is a comparable player who gets paid half as much.   No GM in the league wants to be handing Myles Turner the bag. Pacers are always trying to trade him because he just isn‚Äôt that good.
"You got a deal, Myles Turner is a much better shooter."
if you got the award for being tall and blocking shots myles turner would have a few. gobert can singlehandedly create a good defense
Myles Turner is a perfect example of a role player that's a starter
Myles Turner is very intelligent. I remember hearing him commentate one game and he sounded almost professional. The guy speaks very eloquently
"I just want to say that, to anyone offering trades for Myles Turner, no thank you. We're good. He's our pineapple and you can't have him."
Myles Turner could help so many teams but he‚Äôs withering away in Indiana for the last 6 years with nothing to show for it
"It's 5:30 am in Indiana right now and you're arguing with a guy on the other side of the world. The other Indiana fan was complaining about it being 7 am.  Also, a 30 sec look at your comment history shows 90% of your commentas are about Myles Turner trades.  LOL.  You don't care so much you're up at 5am to argue and defend Myles Turner's trade value.  I don't think you realise who's being strung along right now."
"Don‚Äôt waste your time then. Every fanbase has some people who say stupid shit so I was keeping an open mind at first. But at this point you‚Äôve given me no reason to believe you. In fact you keep changing the details. Did one of our ‚Äúnut job fans‚Äù make a comment that got upvotes around the 30 to 40 range? Or were there multiple comments made by multiple users which all had upvotes around that range?  And like I said, there is a big difference in thinking Moses Brown specifically is a better player right now than Myles Turner and any of the other things you brought up. I don‚Äôt see any argument for Moses &gt; Turner. There are arguments, even if you disagree with them, that Robert Williams &gt; Turner or Turner isn‚Äôt *that* good a player, or that the Celtics are better off not tying themselves to Turner salary wise for a number of reasons."
"Lol it doesn‚Äôt take long to look up ‚ÄúMoses‚Äù in our sub and take a quick scroll, especially if, as you suggest, they were highly upvoted.   Also not sure if this was made clear enough but I was responding only to your reply to the original comment (about Cs fans being excited for Moses) where you said we had highly upvoted comments on our sub claiming Moses was already a better player than Myles.   That was as far as my response went - the supposed comparison of Moses and Myles. Nothing about how Celtics fans have compared Turner to other players or how much value they think he has overall. Thinking Turner is mediocre is not at all the same thing or mutually exclusive to thinking he‚Äôs clearly better than Moses Brown."
"Bro stop u kno damn well I'm not gonna comb the C's sub looking for some comments I saw from like a month or so ago and ur ass didn't either. As a C's fan urself I'm sure u also know how nuts some in ur fan base are it's not like the pacers don't have any either every team does, in my experience y'all r on another level but, every team has em. I mean to be honest the way ur trying to act like I'm making all this up is starting to give off those vibes, like really bro, anytime y'all aquire a new c or the name Myles Turner gets metioned on ur sub dudes have to hold Ted talks bout how Myles is just mediocre, there's literally a post on y'all's sub now about how Fournier and Richardson is better than the Myles+ Doug package from the Hayward shit, and that thing u said about how only a few C's think Rob is better than turner is a huge understatement if any thing from wat I've seen it's a pretty common belief of most C's fans"
According to some people on our sub Myles Turner would be better to have
"Minnesota should be on the list for John Collins (S+T), but I bet he re-signs with Atlanta too.    My prediction is Minnesota will sign or trade for a F/C that no one thinks they‚Äôll get.  Could sign JaMychal Green to the MLE, could trade for Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Jonathan Isaac, etc.     Something is definitely in the works."
Yea I saw a few Celtic's fans that out of no where were saying he was already better than Myles Turner and sum how they're comments got a lot of upvotes
"I like JV a lot more than Myles Turner. I don't know why everyone thinks an inefficient scoring threat at center will open up the lane for Zion. We put an offensively limited, defensive centric center next to him this past year and got blasted for it."
What‚Äôs the current ‚Äúbetter in theory‚Äù team?   PG - ???  SG - Josh Richardson  SF - ???  PF - Robert Covington   C - Myles Turner
"need to get someone who can play defense in the frontcourt though. Valancunias is a monster on the boards and offensively, but unless youre going against a guy who's just gonna bang in the post, he's not a good defender at all which is not what you want next to Zion.   I'd be doing everything I can to get Myles Turner for spacing and defense and hoping everyone else can hang rebound their way into the playoffs. unfortunately you can't have both without them being unhappy so it's not in the cards for NO this year."
Some people really think trading for players like Myles Turner are what we need to do to maximize Curry‚Äôs prime lol.   They also seem to think Curry is gonna fall off a cliff after next season
Nah trading wiseman and filler for Myles Turner is what gets us over the hump /s
Myles Turner
That's Myles Turner and Danny Green.
As I watch Team USA I just wish Myles Turner wasn't gimpy. He wanted badly to be on this team and was the perfect fit!
Meanwhile Myles Turner allegedly had negative value last off season somehow
"Fr people are blown away that plug and play guy was plug and play. He's 25, Rui and De'Andre Hunter are 23, and everyone else from that lottery is 21 or 22. For context, the last four 11th picks before Cam were Myles Turner, Shai, Malik Monk, and Sabonis. They're all younger than Cam."
You could have had Myles Turner and Doug McDermott though
"Dlo Devin Booker Cam Payne KAT and Myles Turner, I dig it"
"The price was way too high, people wanted a Harden return for guys that were half as good as Harden.  So now if we are dealing, it's for the positions Kuminga, Wiseman, or Moody have and from a value perspective both financially and on the court there just aren't there.  I was high on getting someone like Marcus Smart or Myles Turner but those aren't getting us over the hump and getting a big name means we have to give up Wiggins which leaves a gap.  Quite frankly, with Kuminga doing well in the G League bubble (which I rate higher than college) I'd probably value him more than what teams would want to give for him."
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler‚Ä¶ are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
ah yes forgot about that MAXIMUM CALIBER USA basketball team in 2019 which lost b2b games vs france and serbia. legendary 7th place team featuring:  mason plumlee  myles turner  harrison barnes  derrick white  joe harris  some real talent there. and yet they're all still better than kevin love lmfao.  BTW kevin love withdrew from that team.
Myles Turner?
"I never thought it made sense for the jazz to have favors and Gobert.  The only other situation the was as weird to me was the Pacers  having Myles turner and sabonis, just pick one and make a balanced roster."
Oh I think if you max JC there's a fair chance you get him. It's much more about Ill believe their ownership being willing to pay the luxury tax when I see it. Hawks have also given indications they arent huge on making that kind of investment in him long term.  Beyond that can also use the cap space to trade for guys who arent on great contracts but still pretty good players. I dont think for ex if you made a call on Tobias Harris the Sixers would refuse to take your call(might not accept your offer but guys like that will be available). Other guys like Myles Turner have been floated around for multiple yrs now. Or other options use the cap space to take on bad contracts for assets.
"Myles Turner as a center would be a cheaper fit, but I totally agree with Simmons being a much bigger addition."
I seen alot of Indiana watchers says Myles Turner is seriously overrated
"Lowry, derozan, no clue what the contract fit is like but as a clippers fan I want Myles turner so bad"
myles turner music
myles turner is the best player on either team
"Well not a lot for Norm, it's more just his salary + a pick might fetch you someone who's actually playable in the playoffs. Drummond is so-so defensively and pretty awful offensively. That's just not a good combination. On top of that, he thinks he's a hell of a lot better than he is.   He doesn't really read the game very well either so I think he'd really struggle in a lot of the zone defensive schemes nurse likes.  If you're making a playoff push, then guys like Nance or PJ Tucker. I'm also a huge Myles Turner fan but he'd be more expensive, and his trade value has definitely gone up since the offseason when he was looking very gettable.   But yeah if I'm giving up a pick, I want more than just half a year of Drummond. Something Like Powell and a first for Tucker and House considering the direction Houston seems to be going in."
Exactly. We‚Äôre just waiting to get a Garnett on this team to complete the trip. And it‚Äôs not Myles Turner to those who were clamoring for him this summer.
Fair enough but if pacers gave up dipo for harden and harden leaves plus Myles turner wants out they might end up being bad regardless but I guess they probably wouldn't have gotten as much picks as nets gave up
One small thing I noticed you put Myles Turner had 5 blocks in caps when AD also had 5 blocks in 28 minutes
"PJ Tucker, not Myles Turner"
"&gt; Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I mean, most of those players shoot well below league average on 3's, a few &lt; 30%. I would argue there's only a few true stretch 5's   &gt;  Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP  On that list, 40% play the 4 more than the 5. That's my point, we are seeing more an evolution of the 4 than we are of the 5. Your center is still most likely the bruiser inside rim protector they have always been."
The answer you are looking for is Myles Turner.
Myles Turner and Boucher both got a ton against the Warriors.
Lol Myles Turner with video game numbers
He saw what Myles Turner was doing last night and was like that looks cool let me try it
"His defense this year has been crazy, Draymond was right when he said he'll try to make him one of the best defenders in the league  also Myles Turner with 46 is craaaazy"
Damn Myles Turner lol
"You are right that most are there for their defense/rebounding like Gobert, WCS, Biyombo, Drummond, Jarrett Allen/Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Capela, Adams, etc.  But there are also many that can spread the floor (some much better than others) like Horford/Muscala, Lopez/Portis, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Aldridge, Ibaka, Theis, Cousins, Bryant, Gasol, Wendell Carter Jr, Valanciunas/Dieng, etc.  I think it depends on the team's playstyle because sometimes the 4 is more defensively oriented and/or the 5 is more for spacing. Many of the best centers can shoot pretty well like Jokic, KAT, Embiid. AD and KP, if they're playing the 5. Also, Vucevic? I know the drop off is steep from the top 3/5 but I think he's pretty comfortably like 6 or 7th."
Better to play slow than get hurt imo.  I remember Myles turner in college didn't even run remotely normal but now he moves great for his size. Roy Hibbert had to learn how to run properly in college at the same age and he turned into an all star in Indiana. There is room for Zion to work with trainers on his body and form as long as he can stay healthy
"Oh they come to our sub with trade suggestions, but it's usually like ""For Myles Turner and TJ McConnell we'll give you a second round pick and a donut"""
Don't sleep on Chris Boucher. He's tied for 2nd in the league in BPG with Gobert and only behind Myles Turner.  14.3 ppg 6.2 rpg 2.6 bpg
And yes I posted this exact comment twice. I'm drunk and years of defending Myles Turner is paying off so IDGAF.
Myles Turner played like prime Hakeem. That dude killed us.
"Yeah, there all amazing. I think the issue is that people don‚Äôt watch Myles turner enough to put him in the discussion. I need to start myself."
"Myles fucking Turner   I love this team, amazing play down the stretch for a much needed win. Pavers gonna pave"
Myles Turner kinda looked like the idea of Myles Turner out there tonight
Please talk some more shit about Myles Turner
Draymond Green winning the tip off against Myles Turner at the end of the game sums up how clutch Wardell Stephen Curry II has been his entire career. Aaron Holiday just stole that ball away from him. Wardell Stephen Curry II was not born with the clutch gene.  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league. They were born with the clutch gene.
Please talk some more shit about Myles Turner
Myles motherfucking Turner
Myles Turner the best 3&amp;D player
Myles Turner has been the Pacers best player tonight
Damn Myles Turner got crazy leap and timing.
"&gt;Him and Myles Turner are having a block party  Fr, Turner has 19 in the last 5 games."
So I heard Myles turner been balling out  I'm concerned üò®üò®üò®
"FVV, Jrue, Bojan Bogdanovic, Michael Porter Jr., Myles Turner"
"Kemba, Oladipo/Brogdon, Tobias Harris, Myles Turner, Nurkic/Ayton"
The guy has had 3 or more blocks in 8/10 games so far with two 8 block games and at least 1 block in every game. Shot blocking is my favorite part of basketball and Myles Turner has been an absolute treat to watch on that side.
Wait Myles Turner is actually averaging 4 blocks???
"They‚Äôre fun and dangerous. Especially if Warren can come back healthy. That being said, I never thought I‚Äôd hear Myles Turner and ‚ÄúHakeem-like‚Äù in the same sentence"
Thinking about how Nurk was in my fantasy draft cue to be my 6th draft pick before I settled with Myles Turner üò≠  Thank god for that
Skinny Myles Turner lowkey
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
Myles turner to the clippers
Myles turner to the clippera
Myles Turner for PJ Washington who says no?
"3 team trade:  Sixers get: Gordon Hayward, TJ Warren  Pacers get: Ben Simmons, Sixers 2RP  Hornets get: Myles Turner  Thoughts?"
There‚Äôs gonna be at-least 15 teams interested in getting Myles Turner and I can‚Äôt wait to see the bidding war.
So wait.   Indiana - the team already struggling because they're trying to play 2 PF/Cs - is going to trade for Ben Simmons?  Remember how bad Simmons + Horford + Embiid was?  Simmons + Turner + Sabonis would be even worse. Then you're adding in another non-shooting guard in LeVert.  Indiana would keep their 'not getting out of the 1st round' streak alive. As well as their streak of dysfunction and Myles Turner trade attempts.
"domas for simmons, who says no?  Simmons surrounded by Brogdon, Caris, TJW, Myles Turner"
you'd have to put him at the 4 with a center who can spread the floor but isn't someone who needs to be on the block like embiid. Embiid is too good down tere to be a floor spreader.    So like... Myles Turner or Brook Lopez or something.   But is that really worth doing for Ben Simmons?
Cool so you don‚Äôt address the other two guys I pointed out though lmao. TIL Dipo and Myles Turner were a dead eye shooters. I watched the Pacers and according to you I know more about the team than you do. Maybe I don‚Äôt though cuz I missed when TJ Warren became so great that you expected to take the Heat to 7 games. Your arguments were ignorant and spoke of someone who doesn‚Äôt watch their own team please stop
"Take Myles Turner and holiday, i live in Indianapolis."
"The mistake is thinking that nate was the only problem. The pacers roster just isn't good. Sure, there's a hundred things you can say to defend that like myles turner, sabonis or Warren got hurt, but they have a bunch of guys who are really smart and can execute an offense but don't have the ability to improvise when the defense clamps down."
I would. Then we‚Äôd have to trade Nurk for possibly Myles Turner because having Simmons and Nurk would not work out
TJ Warren? Myles Turner? Aaron Holiday? Goga Bitazde?   Who are you even referring to? Oladipo who was hurt?
"I understand being disappointed in players. Ultimately I want to see them succeed and I‚Äôm sure you do too. Wiseman has some excuses and extenuating circumstances that were out of his control. If you are a believer in Poole go look at some Wiseman highlights and you can see a star in the making.  If by the second half of the season he‚Äôs progressing slower than anticipated, which I highly doubt as it takes young players time to get acclimated. Then shit, I‚Äôll be disappointed too. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs untouchable but if we package him and our picks and assets it better only be for a star player type of upgrade and not freaking Myles Turner. I think of it as Wiseman and Poole can really grow on the second unit together and one or both will be in the closing unit sooner rather than later. It sucks to lose but you know what sucks even more? To be in a hopeless franchise, basically pre-Lacob. We got a lot to be happy about and look forward to."
So trade Nurkic. He has value.   Dame/Simmons/Myles Turner would kill for example
"If Myles Turner skimming Harden's beard is a flagrant, then this is a flagrant"
"It's probably suggested because Ben could play to his most efficient role, as a Draymond-type roll player with elite vision along Lillard while providing the much needed defensive boost. Portland has been Top8 in offensive rating for many years now and given Portland makes some more tweaks to their roster (add more spacing and a smallball 5 with some corner 3 prowess for instance. Flipping Nurkic + pick or other compensation for Myles Turner would unleash a really strong starting 5 for example) after the Simmons trade the team could be more balanced while not losing much offensive firepower as Lillard alone makes for a sturdy playoff offense. The Blazers backcourt has been incredibly prone to other Superstar guards because both CJ and Lillard are undersized defenders and Ben's DPOY level Defense would hinder the Luka's, Curry's, Mitchell's and Murray's of the West to just destroy them on crazy efficiency night in night out in a playoff series."
Myles Turner works well with every team. Really nice player
I‚Äôll give you 50 that I think are at least arguable. These aren‚Äôt ranked and I don‚Äôt necessarily think every one of these guys is better but I can see how others might. Let me know if you see repeated names.  1. Steph 2. Beal 3. Dame 4. Embiid 5. Giannis 6. Luka 7. Lavine 8. Zion 9. Kd 10. Kyrie 11. Tatum 12. Mitchell 13. Jokic 14. Booker 15. Trae 16. Fox 17. Lebron 18. Kawhi 19. Kat 20. Jaylen 21. Harden 22. Ingram 23. Shai 24. Vucevic 25. Pg 26. Davis 27. Westbrook 28. DeMar 29. Butler 30. Siakam 31. Jamal Murray 32. Brogdon 33. Middleton 34. Sabonis 35. Hayward 36. Tobias harris 37. Ja 38. Mpj 39. Bam 40. Jrue 41. Collins 42. Lowry 43. CP3 44. Bogdan 45. Conley 46. Lamelo 47. Capela 48. Ayton 49. Sexton 50. Myles Turner
&gt; Myles Turner  Is there better center for USA team even? Myles is probably still the best option
"Karl Anthony-Towns, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, and Myles Turner were also picked ahead of Booker. However, I think Booker has proven the last 2 years that he is the best player from that draft class."
"KAT, D'Angelo Russell, Porzingis &amp; Myles Turner.  Booker's been better than all of them, but most of the other guys are out of the league or on the dead-ass end of someone's bench"
"Oubre &amp; Payne were selected just after Booker.  I omitted Myles Turner, Porzingis, D'Lo and KAT because they've at least all made an impact in the NBA, though I'd say Booker is definitely the best player in this draft class comfortably."
"I pay attention to international basketball and international competitions. That's why I know that this USA roster is already much better than that year's American roster. Americans that led in minutes in that game: Kemba, Harrison Barnes, Donovan Mitchell, Myles Turner, Khris Middleton."
Serbia beat USA by five points with Myles Turner and Harrison Barnes starting. There was never a chance this year
Myles Turner might be an interesting fit. Or Richaun Holmes
Sean Marks should do everything in his power this season to trade for Myles Turner. Fixes everything we need.
he needs to be faster with his feet and not be a liability anywhere outside the paint. if people say Myles Turner just hunts blocks and nothing else then what is Gobert doing if he literally cannot leave the paint? Draymond should be DPOY this year and Quin Snyder shouldn‚Äôt have play Gobert as much as he did this series.
Pure speculation but I would guess he also pissed a lot of other teams off by trying to scam them. The Myles Turner trade was close to being finalized when he asked for another first on top
Myles Turner ?
"I don‚Äôt believe that you watch the wolves. KAT played 50 games this season. Watch the first 2 games of the season for starters if you want defensive intensity.        And obviously they‚Äôve got rim protection issues, it‚Äôs been clear they‚Äôve been trying to acquire a rim protector for quite some time now. Most recent rumors suggest Myles turner."
"I trade for him every single time I start a new MyLeague in 2K and he‚Äôs unstoppable in the pick &amp; pop and he‚Äôs a great rim protector.   It‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm the coach who unlocks Myles Turner."
"Funny you mention Myles Turner. A Jazz fan was on /r/Pacers this season making fun of Pacers fans saying they would rather have Myles than Rudy.   This is why. Myles is a better shot blocker, not completely worthless on guards on the perimeter, and CAN provide offensive support.   Plus, he‚Äôs making half as much as Rudy.   You swap out Myles for Rudy in this series and I think we have a very different outcome."
"What plays can you run for someone that has no post moves &amp; can‚Äôt shoot? Shaq had a post game plus he was super athletic, Gobert not athletic like that, he has no post moves &amp; he can‚Äôt shoot. In the playoffs he‚Äôs gonna be detrimental to your team, Jazz need to be trying to trade him to Indiana for Myles Turner."
One of the worst contracts in the league he isn't bad but you shouldn't get that type of money for being only a Rim protector rather have Myles Turner a elite rim protector who can do something on offense and use the rest of the money for more pieces
"I mean, yeah, he‚Äôs easily the best paint defender in the league during the regular season, but even then I believe the DPOY should be rated on defensive versatility instead of solely one facet of defense.   Like, Rudy had been exposed in the playoffs 3 times now, this year ending his postseason as a **literal defensive liability ** for the last two games. Put Draymond, Myles Turner, Bam in his position and this series is probably over in 5, especially without Kawhi.   Again, Gobert was definitely one of the 3-4 deserving players to get the award in the regular season, but that‚Äôs about it."
"Fuck man ):   Trade gobert, put ingles far into the bench, bring in a co star for Mitchell. Get like Myles turner or something idk. Offer 300 million to cp3 on a 2 year contract I don‚Äôt care but this complete team, passing playing basketball the right way bullshit doesn‚Äôt work, it never has.   Go up to ty lue in the off-season and offer him a billion dollars to come coach the jazz too he‚Äôs the coach I most trust to always make adjustments to win a series"
Myles Turner wouldn‚Äôt let this happen
That‚Äôs the only way. Basically the only center that works with him is Myles Turner. He needs 4 shooters and the center to be a rim protector
How are the Lakers trading for Myles Turner ?
Bam and draymond? Bring one of Jarrett Allen or Myles turner
"Nikola Jokic, literally that‚Äôs it. A bunch of 4s when they play the 5 too like Kristaps, JJJ, or small ball guys like Gallo or Portis, etc.  And Jokic has to be contested because you have to try to limit the passing angles, not just the shot.  other centers who take 3s don‚Äôt get really get contested, so the defense isn‚Äôt being stretched.  Myles Turner makes between 1-2 3s per game. That‚Äôs 1-2 extra points vs a more efficient 2 per game. Whoopdie do"
Probably Bam. Myles Turner or Jaren Jackson Jr seem  good for the international game too.
The idea that Myles Turner is a stretch 5 is the biggest myth propagated on r/nba   https://thef5.substack.com/p/stretch-lie
"Brad Stevens music.  Get the gang back together.  But seriously, Myles Turner for Hayward trade is back on."
that is why myles Turner is so perfect
"Myles Turner probably. Best American center is Adebayo, Embiid, Jokic and KAT are not American."
"Hopefully not Myles Turner again  (Before I get attacked, I‚Äôm saying this because dude pissed off gobert, not because of his talent level)"
"a rim protector, Myles Turner would be nice. something realistic too"
Myles Turner
people are going to say Myles Turner but he's not worth the price it would in their situation
Myles Turner if he's healthy
"Sure as hell not as much as they would've if they'd traded him earlier. He still has some value, he's the #2 pick. Myles Turner, Vucevic, Lonzo. Package him with picks and see what offers there are.   If you keep him maybe you get lucky and he pans out, or maybe his trade value actually becomes zero. Steph's getting older in the meantime."
"Tbh they should trade for Myles Turner. Idk if the pacers want anything they have tho. Having a defensive presence in the paint would help em out a lot, especially since they got exposed in the paint in the playoffs. Oh yeah before they can do that, they need to hire a gm."
"Yeah good job beating monte Ellis, Solomon hill, and rookie Myles turner in 7 games as a 2 seed lol, really good performance by you guys. What did demar and Kyle shoot in that series again? Funny you speak of great players leaving, kawhi literally left after one year even with a championship. Did you guys even have any players as good as PG besides kawhi in your franchise history?"
"The thing is, if you're trading for Simmons, you have to flip Nurkic for Myles Turner or Porzingis or someone like that  Because Simmons sharing the court with Nurkic will not work in the playoffs"
"Myles Turner has gotten so overrated on this sub.  And Zion just put up one of the most efficient scoring seasons in recent memory with Adams/Hayes/Hernangomez as centers. We don‚Äôt necessarily need a floor spacing center. A bigger issue last season was lack of defensive effort, and consistently blowing double digit/4th quarter leads."
"Yes they needed superstars around him.  I didn‚Äôt say build a super team.  Is Memphis a super team, is Dallas a super team ?  Just get better fitting players.  Myles Turner was largely rumored to be on the block.  Package picks and whomever for him.  Your telling me Indy wouldn‚Äôt take 2 firsts for Turner.  How bout a shooting guard that isn‚Äôt a point guard who can‚Äôt shoot.  Not rocket science. We see how important spacing is yet teams still double down on these guys who can‚Äôt make shots.  If your a superstar that‚Äôs one thing but if your not then that‚Äôs another."
It‚Äôs so weird that GM‚Äôs forget we are in the pace and space era. Having a bunch of paint cloggers (and a coach that promotes it) is extremely stupid. Instead of trading for Adams perhaps they should of gone after Myles Turner.
And to think they could have gotten Myles Turner but Ainge was too greedy
Why is nobody talking about Myles Turner in this thread?
"Bjorkgren is willing to go with a hot lineup if the situation allows it. That lineup didn‚Äôt have Sabonis in it tonight, it was McConnell and Aaron Holiday.  He did the same thing against the Pelicans a week or two back, the bench got hot and we finished a very tight game with basically bench players and Myles Turner (only because a bench player fouled out)"
"Myles Turner defensively - sure. Offensively, he's been relatively average"
"Our team is not young-ish. Our best player is 35 and he‚Äôll either be traded, sign elsewhere in free agency, or begin to decline within the next few years. Our core of FVV/Norm/Siakam are all more or less in their primes. They might improve marginally but they aren‚Äôt making any more major leaps. You‚Äôre pretty much banking on OG at this point (who I would want to keep even through a rebuild).  I also think it‚Äôs very easy to say we‚Äôre 1-2 pieces away from being a top seed without specifying who those pieces are or how we‚Äôre going to get them. Like, a ‚Äúpiece‚Äù could be anything between a Myles Turner and a Bradley Beal.    I also think you‚Äôre ignoring that acquiring those pieces would be difficult to do through a weak free agency class, and would likely require us to give up some of our current pieces which might result in a lateral move or just a marginal improvement. That Kawhi trade was lightning in a bottle. Nothing like that is ever going to happen again."
Myles Turner is also cute
"After giving google a quick spin around the league, centers like that are in few supply and high demand. I was going to say what about Myles Turner but at this point I'd think Horford may be more serviceable for your needs"
"gobert is definitely the front-runner but to add on to your list, myles turner deserves recognition."
"Totally agreed! I was responding to the guy who used this stat to justify why Myles Turner should for sure be top 2 in the DPOY running, I think advanced stats in general (especially on the defensive end) should be taken with a grain of salt"
I like Porzingis but I think he‚Äôs going to turn out to be the next Ralph Sampson   The need to pair Luka with someone like a young Dwight. I‚Äôd go with Myles Turner
The Myles Turner block creation machine that is the pacers defense
Zach Collins with a below-average # of nagging injuries becomes Myles Turner.
"They at least rank 10th in defensive TOV%, which leads me to theorize they are probably aggressive on the perimeter defense knowing they have Myles Turner on the inside to help clean things up when they get beat on a drive."
Myles Turner for Harrison Barnes?
lol hes still a good shooter tbf. id say hes myles turner
Probably Myles Turner
Myles Turner! He is a swatting machine this year.
"So he didn't have 2 all-stars with him.   The Warriors and maybe the Rockets bounce the Cavs sure. But it would take a 60 win type top West team. Indiana was good that year they are basically the Jazz West. Oladipo, Myles Turner, Sabonis, Bogdanovic etc good team all around shooting and defense.  Toronto was a 59 win team they had a better record than the Warriors that year they were excellent. They were the favorites to win the series. They had Valunchunis and Ibaka and Fred Vanvleet.  Boston was better without Kyrie. They had a better record without him playing and they were a better defensive team without him. Boston was led by the all-star/all-defense Al Horford. Tatum balled out his age doesn't mean anything. The Cavs were led by a 34 year old Lebron James.  That Boston team wouldn't get swept by anyone. '19 year old Tatum' beat Giannis and Embid before running into Lebron. Boston had the #2 ranked defense in the entire league."
538 literally just posted an article about why Turner has been phenomenal _without_ the box score...  https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/myles-turners-game-has-evolved-the-box-score-doesnt-know-it-yet/amp/  DraftKings has him the second favorite to win DPOY.   But go off my sir.
"He's arguably one of the quickest guard in the league.  His jumper has been great.  And his athleticism has been a crazy good surprise.  He's also not afraid of contact and can finish duty both hands.  He straight up challenged Embiid, Gobert and Myles Turner.  Even Conley couldn't stay in front of him, and Jrue Holiday struggled against him.  I think all signs are pointing to him being a star."
"this post isn't about myles turner  what are you, 12?"
Would you rather have embiid for 64 games (about what he's averaged last 3 years) or myles turner for 78 games
"Porzingis + Dorian Smith to Indiana Pacers, Myles Turner + Lecque to Mavs"
I know Pacers fans are annoyed at the contestant Turner trade rumors but would they be interested in Harris for Turner? If that‚Äôs at all a possibility BKN should jump all over it. I think Indy says no though with how Myles has been playing this year though.
He allows a higher percentage at the rim then Jarret Allen and Myles Turner and an almost identical % to Embiid and Capela
He allows a higher percentage at the rim then Jarret Allen and Myles Turner and an almost identical % to Embiid and Capela
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."
Myles Turner has been playing on a DPOY level this year.
Neither of them are Myles Turner.
he has been better at both ends of the floor in the system(and i didn't get a chance to watch this game) but him only getting four shots up is classic myles turner bullshit
Turner have to turn up d 'Myles'...
They're missing 2 starters who provide the bulk of their offence in Levert and Warren. Also the fact that despite his block numbers Myles Turner isn't as impactful as others would try to have you believe.
Every time I see a Myles turner article I just think of what the Celtics could have had in Turner and Mcdermont but instead we have a Traded Player Exception and no Hayward
Tell me what team both had 20m+ cap space and would have been willing to give up draft assets for an expiring oladipo/Myles turner
Like... I don't know... Myles Turner?
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"One thing to note with the DRAPTOR data- nba tracking data has inexplicably been missing a game from Rudy Gobert for awhile now, and RAPTOR heavily relies on that. But RAPTOR still has Rudy playing the correct number of minutes which means it thinks Rudy played a whole game doing nothing. If that were fixed Turner would almost certainly also be behind Rudy in DRAPTOR. Still been a really great season from Myles though"
"I can't believe the Celtics didn't want this guy...  Like, ok, you don't want to pay 18m to Myles Turner, but then you turn around and give 9.5m to fucking *Tristan Thompson*?"
"The apparent trade was Turner, McDermott and a 1st for Gordon Hayward in a sign and trade.  Ainge wanted Dipo.  [https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/#:\~:text=The%20Indiana%20Pacers%20offered%20the,plan%20with%20its%20big%20offer](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/#:~:text=The%20Indiana%20Pacers%20offered%20the,plan%20with%20its%20big%20offer)."
"I remember watching a rookie Myles Turner play the Raptors in the playoffs, and just being a blocking machine with a nice jump shot (didn‚Äôt really shoot 3‚Äôs but drained mid range shots).   I thought he was going to be a star after seeing him then, and ever since I have been on a rollercoaster of being amazed with how good he is to disappointed with him not playing to his potential.   Hoping he can keep this high level of play up, because the guy has an amazing skill set for today‚Äôs NBA."
"I get moving on from Lonzo. I don‚Äôt think that deal gets it done or is very appealing for chicago. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad value wise for the pelicans, but don‚Äôt understand pairing Lavine with Zion and Ingram. Sure they could score, but that‚Äôs no defense out of the 3. I‚Äôd value good 2 way wings or a center like Myles turner way more for the Pelicans."
Man imagine having Myles Turner next to Boucher
"I feel like I need to explain this better 'cause that is a really bold claim, I know. Hear me out, Brogdon is not a good defender. I could see how Boston fans think he is because he did player really good defense on Jayson Tatum that one game, but he is not a good defender. His size is good, but it comes at a cost, his feet are slow. He gets blown by a lot. Like constantly, his first step might be the slowest in the league for a PG. Myles Turner plugs that gap a lot, but it leads to tons of kickouts to open shooters.    He's not unselfish. His biggest issue as a PG is his inability to create for teammates, because when he drives he almost always does it with his head down. I've never seen so few passes out of drives, it's wild. I say McConnell has been more effective than Brogdon, not better, and this is why. McConnell is a natural creator out of the drive, and it's palpable how much more he collapses defenses, and how many more open looks we get with him on the floor.   Which brings us to he can shoot. He **has** to shoot. And teams have kinda figured it out. Our last three opponents have all started to go under screens cause his shot is a little low and a little slow, and they can recover to him if the go under and cut off the drive which is what has killed us the last 3 games.   People are going to believe the guy below you cause he has a Pacers flair and he's saying the easy narrative to believe because his stats look nice, but please please please really watch a Pacers game, I promise you'll see everything I'm talking about.    Also to back up the McConnell point, McConnell has been a net +11 and Brogdon has been a net -58 in our last three games. I know BPM isn't the best stat, but that isn't nothing."
"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
"Nah, Boucher just the definition of boom or bust. He's a momentum guy but his body is so skinny so his minutes are often matchup based. He's absolutely electric though and he should be getting 25-30 mins a game easily. The problem is, he's not a true center. He's really a skinny PF who can block shots. He's an elite shot blocker and he can shoot 3s, so he's a great commodity. Think lanky flashy hot and cold PF version of Myles Turner."
"It lifts the odds but they wouldn‚Äôt win in those two years. I agree Nuggets need to make a big move if they want a chance but Harden is not that guy next to Jokic, a guy that doesn‚Äôt play a ton off ball is a terrible pairing for the best passing big man of all time even though they‚Äôre top 5 offensive players.   This is assuming Harden would even go to Denver when it‚Äôs clear he wanted to go to Brooklyn. Beal, Jrue before his trade, and even Myles turner would be much better pieces next to Jokic that wouldn‚Äôt cost nearly as much and wouldn‚Äôt hamper the team if they don‚Äôt win a chip (not exactly true for Beal)"
"Best to compare Danny against Masai.   Masai had the chance to tank or keep competing. He had a solid team which he blew up for an injured Kawhi, which in hindsight was a great decision. His risk tolerance is much higher than Danny.  Danny had made lots of great moves. But he's also missed out on a lot of good moves for fear of losing on a trade. Lots of great players were available which you passed on or are passing on - PG, Myles Turner, Lowry rn!, Harden (!). They're very risky moves but could put you over the top   Luckily you guys have a long window. But don't take it for granted."
Trust me I don‚Äôt get Giannis. He can bully Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner but will struggle against the worse defenders for some reason.
Insert Myles Turner trade rumors that will never happen
"Definitely. Only averaged 2.8 TOV per game, meaning his offensive fouls are in check, while also absolutely sonninf Myles Turner"
Are they thirsting for Myles Turner?
"&gt; I'd bet on it just given his mindset and noticeably different approach this year.  That's a fair assesment, he made it clear that he cared more about his defense this year.  &gt;Not saying he's DPOY or Myles Turner, but he is no longer a defensive liability and definitely isn't awful anymore.  But you can't say this after 4 games. That's not how this works. Yes he looked good in his 4 games, but the simple size is nowhere near close enough to come to this conclusion"
"I'd bet on it just given his mindset and noticeably different approach this year.  Not saying he's DPOY or Myles Turner, but he is no longer a defensive liability and definitely isn't awful anymore."
Could have had Myles Turner and McDermott for nothing lmao
Hayward trade exception for Myles Turner
Big man? Like Myles Turner for free?
*Insert Myles Turner
"He has modernized the offense, and he has done well utilizing Sabonis as an offensive hub while empowering Myles Turner more as well on the offensive end. He has leaned perhaps too heavily on starters, but it's also forgivable because IND is missing their leading scorer and Bubble God from last season, TJ Warren, and is without who would be the team's, arguably, third best player in Caris LeVert.   Basically, for the Pacers to win most games, they need a consistent outing from Brogdon and Sabonis, a good defensive performance from Turner, and either Justin Holiday or Doug McDoug to go 4-6 from three. IND is missing a lot of offense and a wing defender, so it's been even harder since the Oladipo trade.   LeVert might be back in a month, and Warren might be back in two. The only player to be worse since Nate's takeover has been Aaron Holiday. He has been crazy inconsistent, and I'm not sure how much blame to ascribe to Nate, but the fact Aaron has continually had more playing time than Edmond Sumner is slowly becoming a problem."
"Myles Turner 20000% because he can just stand on the 3pt line on offense, then rim protect on defense"
Myles Turner doesn't provide spacing. Teams don't give much of a shit about him shooting threes
"Gut reaction is Myles turner. Zion needs all the spacing he can get and I think turner can get it done defensively with who the pelicans already have  I have not watched a single pelicans game all season aside from when they play the sixers, so I could 100% be in the wrong"
Yeah I think so. Myles turner is prob the best comp for him in terms of value.
Zubac gonna get that myles turner money in his next contract.
"That‚Äôs an interesting one. Because Trae Young for example is a 25/10 player on solid efficiency. His offensive impact is massive, like those numbers indicate. However, in general he probably wouldn‚Äôt be as valuable as a player because of his defense. But nothing about his stats would originally indicate that.  So, I will look at players who have great defensive stats but aren‚Äôt as valuable as those stats would indicate:  Myles Turner is a great blocker but he is not a DPOY caliber type defender even though he gets a ton of blocks.  Donte DiVincenzo gets a good amount of steals but he isn‚Äôt really a great defender.  It‚Äôs a lot harder to be considered much worse than stats indicate on the offensive end. If you are just looking at points? Then sure, but even a basic stat like FG%, 3P% and the attempts for each all will indicate ""chuckers"""
"Myles Turner, offensively he already plays more like a wing. Defensive his length would translate very well to the SG/SF position."
"I know I‚Äôm late to this, and I do agree with you that Myles is still a ways off of Rudy Gobert, but man you‚Äôre selling Myles extremely short trying to put him as just a shot blocker, but your post seems to be based on eye test alone.  There are nights when I myself get frustrated watching Myles and how he gets bullied by stronger bigs.  But every time you look at the stats Myles is damn near top 3 in every major defensive metric.  I‚Äôm not just talking RAPTOR/advanced analytics, but things like opponent fg% at the rim, on/off team defensive rating, etc. There was even a post in this sub just the other day showing that Myles is statistically the best pick n roll defending big in the league.  He is absolutely a defender on the same level as Simmons, Capela and Holiday, and is statistically a top 3 defender in the league this year.  Saying he makes no sense for DPOY and then saying guys like Jrue, Capela and Simmons do is just crazy talk.  My vote still goes to Rudy, but I think you‚Äôre underselling what Turner brings to the table here."
Myles Turner much?
"Cp3 (16), Ben Simmons (14.8), LeBron James (25.5), Draymond Green (6.6), Myles Turner (12.7)  Enjoy trying to score."
DPOY 2021 = Myles Turner.
"James Harden (25.2), Jokic (26.2), Thybulle (3.9),  Luke Kennard (7.9),  Myles turner, (12.7). Total of 75.9."
CP3 - 15.8  Lebron - 25.4  Mikal - 12.9  Myles Turner - 12.7  Draymond - 6.6
Myles Turner doesnt exist?
But Myles Turner can guard people AND protect the interior. I don‚Äôt know why this isn‚Äôt discussed more.
Bobby marks is wrong about the literal definition of ‚Äúon court incident‚Äù per your encyclopedic knowledge of nba bylaw. He‚Äôs not wrong about using that phrase in the way me and everyone else interpreted it. And your Myles turner shit is blatantly wrong and shows the type of faith you‚Äôre arguing in
Why would you use Myles turner as an example in this and another now-deleted comment when you‚Äôre clearly talking out of your ass and didn‚Äôt even watch the ejection in question
"Right, an NBA suspension wouldn‚Äôt use an NBA definition, how silly!  And Jokic has had violent ejections in the past. He‚Äôs hit Cam Payne and Myles Turner."
"On court incident does not refer to fights with per NBA law, so that‚Äôs wrong, it‚Äôs to do with unsportsmanlike conduct. Regardless, he‚Äôs had fights with players; he‚Äôs been ejected for physical altercations with Cam Payne, Myles Turner, and another vs the Lakers"
"if that trade package got traded for Thaddeus Young or Brandon Clarke the Bulls wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye, let alone friggin Myles Turner LMAO"
"I send you a reply saying we're getting nowhere and you continue to push the issue. Celtic fans are the most obnoxious crowd in the NBA.  For one last time, I really don't care about Ainge. You fumbled the bag. Cope.  If you can't read between the lines and see that ""Celtics say Turner's value isn't high enough"" is from the Celtics FO there is nothing else to be discussed. Ainge liked to leak stuff, he did it to multiple teams, people made jokes about him always trying to fleece others.  The fact that jokes about the ""idea of Myles Turner"" set you off this bad just screams you need to let this go.  If you'll actually decide to end the cycle of two people hitting the opposite sides of a brick wall, have a good day."
"Here's what Lowe said:  &gt;‚ÄúI did hear from some teams around the league that the Celtics have done some preliminary research on what Myles Turner‚Äôs trade value would have been to them had they acquired him either in this deal or in a separate deal, and obviously didn‚Äôt like what they saw.‚Äù  When you actually look at the quote it's clear his source **wasn't** Ainge. Plus Lowe is hardly someone with inside sources in Boston, hell recently he was begging Kemba for dirt in his podcast because he doesn't seem to know what's going on with our team.  And J. Michael didn't just have that one report on the trade. He was the main source of intel throughout the talks and he happens to be a mouthpiece for your team, he's how the Pacers announce all their dealings and expectations.  He leaks on the team's behalf as part of his career. The team gives him scoops and he presents them in a favourable light.   He was reporting on Pritchard's behalf during the Bjorkgren saga:  &gt;Pacers president Kevin Pritchard confirms this detail about Bjorkgren that I've reported about since March: ""I've got a young coach with super talent and X and Os but needs some (improvement) in human management.""  &gt;https://twitter.com/ThisIsJMichael/status/1396885654764756996  And he was reporting on Pritchard's behalf when Pritchard got to keep his job:  &gt; Kevin Pritchard is staying put as president of the Indiana Pacers after meetings with owner Herb Simon this week, a league source familiar with the situation tells IndyStar.  &gt; That clears the way for the next decision on tap: Nate Bjorkgren.  &gt;https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/pacers/2021/05/27/indiana-pacers-kevin-pritchard-remain-president-after-meeting-herb-simon/7472175002/  And he even leaked trade talks with Charlotte to try and help the Pacers drum up support for a Myles Turner trade:  &gt;I mentioned Myles Turner in trade talks in today's piece on #Pacers (overlooked for obvious reasons). Charlotte sent out feelers a couple months ago to gauge his interest in playing there. Also mentioned Boston. Was told recently that Turner sat down w/hid team for a chat ... 1/2  &gt;https://twitter.com/ThisIsJMichael/status/1327004507713232903?s=20   &gt;Can't say with any confidence yet that he's definitely staying or going anywhere. But understand A LOT of teams want Turner b/c of 3s, rim protection and he's on a great contract. If he stays, Bjorkgren will have him taking 5-6 3s a game. They wanna play faster  &gt;https://twitter.com/ThisIsJMichael/status/1327004508560510986?s=20   ***  So when you say the Celtics were leaking everything, what you mean is the Pacers were leaking the trade talks and Zach Lowe had to ask around because he couldn't get anything out of Boston's FO."
"&gt; Making fun of a common quote on r/nba  Ah yes, the epitome of not being over someone. The phrase ""idea of Myles Turner"" is so overused and repetitive. Whether it came from Ainge or not I don't particularly care, it has no bearing on Myles kicking ass this season and getting more involved on offense.  Ainge leaked to lower Myles' value. You lost out. Deal with it. I would get rid of anyone else on the team except Myles, so it works in my favour."
"When did Pacer fans ever think we were getting anything more than Hayward for Turner straight up at most? We didn't have the space for massive deals.  Every thread Celtic fans are digging out Myles for no reason. It's getting old now. Cope.  Myles Turner has a very high value because of how much of a crutch he is to us. Last year, we went from 15th in DRTG to the bottom of the pile when he wasn't in. We can't replace that very easily. If you think KP not getting rid of our anchor is being duped then there's no hope for you.  Trade didn't go through, we got better by keeping Myles, we got LeVert to help with offense, got an amazing coach, we're going pretty well right now."
Keep in mind the salary tho but you could probably get someone better with that. But I just like Myles Turner a lot lol
"He's not devaluing.   Indiana fans went from thinking they could get Jaylen Brown, to thinking they could get Hayward + 3 firsts, to thinking they could get a 1-for-1 deal with Boston also taking on bad salaries in addition to Turner.   Hayward just happened to be more valuable and Turner happened to be less valuable than you guys realised.   And we didn't get nothing, we got a 27m TPE. Which got us Fournier and Richardson for cheap (Fournier then got us another TPE).   The only team that got nothing was the team trying to use Myles Turner to offload bad contracts and transition away from a bad 2-big lineup.   &gt;I thought it was pretty obvious that Ainge wanted more, stopping the deal.  Your team said no to trading Aaron Holiday before giving him away practically for free because you had no use for him.  &gt;Stop crying about Ainge being Ainge.  Stay mad about getting duped year in and year out. I'm sure next time J.Michael of the Indianapolis Star gets the scoop it will definitely have come from the big boogie man Danny Ainge."
"Dude, three lottery picks for myles Turner?"
Fuck no do not trade young talent for fucking myles Turner. Are you crazy? AND Wiggins???
I do not want to trade any of our fucking young talent AND Wiggins for fucking Myles Turner. What a terrible idea
I said it elsewhere in this thread but Moody Kuminga and Wiseman is enough salary to match Myles Turner. It‚Äôs the only all in move that make sense imo but I‚Äôd rather keep the youngsters. Also who knows if Indiana is even interested in that package.
"No but they would leak ""the greedy Danny Ainge has refused the very reasonable and fair offer from Indiana's handsome and intelligent GM"". Your team has always used the media to try and leverage better returns.  Outside of our Indiana trade talks, our FO is dead silent on just about every trade we make. We had no heads up on:  * The Isaiah/Kyrie trade with Cleveland  * The Tatum/Fultz trade with Philadelphia  * The Bradley/Morris trade with Detroit  * The Walker/Horford trade with Oklahoma  * etc etc.  Our FO makes so many big trades that aren't reported on until they're already agreed to. The one exception being when we deal with Indiana.  &gt;**Report: Pacers offered Celtics Myles Turner and first-rounder in Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade**  &gt; Which was actually how those leaks generally read.  &gt;  &gt; Gordon Hayward reportedly wanted to join the Pacers. &gt;  &gt; Why isn‚Äôt he heading to Indiana? &gt;  &gt; Maybe because the Hornets offered a four-year, $120 million contract. &gt;  &gt; Or maybe because the Celtics didn‚Äôt agree to a sign-and-trade, which was necessary for the capped-out Pacers to add Hayward. &gt;  &gt; &gt;J. Michael of the Indianapolis Star: &gt;  &gt; &gt;The Indiana Pacers offered the Boston Celtics Myles Turner, a first-round pick and a rotation player for Gordon Hayward last week, a source with knowledge of the negotiations told IndyStar. &gt;  &gt; Rejecting this offer looks like a mistake by the Celtics. A center who defends well (especially in the paint) and shoots 3-pointers, Turner is good. The 24-year-old is under contract at a reasonable $18 million the next three years. A first-round pick hold obvious value.  &gt;https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/26/report-pacers-offered-celtics-myles-turner-and-first-rounder-in-gordon-hayward-sign-and-trade/  Same as the Paul George trade fiasco.  J. Michael leaks the trade offer from Indiana, the national media says ""why won't Danny Ainge accept their fair offer"" and then Indiana fans say ""I can't believe Danny Aine would leak this to try and discredit us"".  Then after the fact Indiana's GM Kevin Pritchard, who never talks to the media btw,  does an interview with J.Michael and makes some snide remarks about Danny Ainge.   Pacer fans eat it up every time."
Moody Kuminga and Wiseman is enough Salary to match Myles Turner. Not saying Indiana wants to do that deal just that the salaries match.
They don‚Äôt need to since they‚Äôre winning. They can develop their young players and still have a chance to win it all. If they did decide to trade I would go for like Myles Turner. Stretch big who can clamp Paint
"Yeah, the Pacers would totally leak that Myles isn't worth as much around the league  Ainge literally had his mouth piece reporting on it, stop crying about not getting Myles Turner."
The thing that seperates very talented players from Superstars... Consistency  Myles Turner and consistency... a ven diagram where the circles don't touch.
"Hmmm.   I had Mobley being what Myles turner is.   He's outperforming that  So maybe the middle between turner and KG. I don't see the natural Shooting resonance that KG had, in Mobley, yet."
in the last week I saw myles turner go 7/10 and then ricky rubio go 8/9 from deep
"Not re-signing Horford for that price tag was a good decision. Kyrie is Kyrie, I don‚Äôt know what Ainge could have done about that. He certainly would sign him to a max contract.   Hayward is more open to the debate. If the trade for Myles Turner was really on the table then I think Ainge made mistake when he didn‚Äôt do it.   As for re-signing him: Hayward played ~60% of the games last season. He would have been injured for the playoffs. He‚Äôll be 32 this season, on a huge contract, and with a terrible injury history. That‚Äôs fine for Charlotte. But I don‚Äôt think we can say the Celtics would have been better off with him and his contract when their goal is to go far in the Playoffs."

"No dude. The Lakers were going to trade THT for Lowry, then also move THT for Myles Turner, then unload some salary packaged with THT for Hield to roll out  Lowry   Hield  Lebron  AD   Turner"
...Myles Turner....
most of our problems are solved by launching Mason Plumlee into the sun and convincing Indiana to trade us Myles Turner for nothing
