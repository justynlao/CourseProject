"This is from last season, but Wes Iwundu."
"Trading Seth Curry is the reason we were losing. It doesn't matter that we were starting Wes Iwundu, Josh Green, and Willie Cauley-Stein."
"i don't think he's ever shared the court with wes iwundu, iwundu usually filling in when he was out   and yes please do the maths on how many shots bobi and him get when they share time"
"that isn't true, he scores [less than 1 putback a game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/putbacks/?sort=POSS&amp;dir=1) and they account for about 16% of his total points. considering he makes nearly 2 3's a game at 37%, i don't agree that he's ""always the last guy on the floor"" that they'd want taking a shot, considering at times he's probably shared the court with offensive juggernauts like boban, dwight powell, willie cauley-stein and wes iwundu"
Wes Iwundu
"&gt;Dallas: Wes Iwundu  To be fair, he wouldn't have 100 minutes if it weren't for half the rotation missing time for COVID.  I think Iwundu had 154 minutes during a 9 game stretch, and 48 minutes total in the other 28 games."
"What a difference having Porziņģis, and 5 rotation players back does for you.   Folks that were bashing Luka for not winning more games with Wes Iwundu, Josh Green and Willie Caulie-Stein were pathetic."
Did Wes Iwundu pass them in the standings that game?
"Wes Iwundu scored like 20 on them last season, they recovered okay from that, i’m sure they’ll be fine here as well"
"We went 3-9 between Jan 13th and Feb 1st. 5 of our guys got sat for covid or contact tracing on Jan 12th, they came back on the 27th, and spent the next week trying to play themselves back into shape.  Luka carried us so fucking hard, but you just can't do it when you're starting next to Willie Cauley-Stein, Wes Iwundu, and Josh Green. Coincided with the media pile-on about his whining, and 3pt shooting woes. I'm glad it's not January anymore."
"I honestly gave up trying to explain this to my friends lol. I think this may be partially the media's fault, there was so much buzz how we were 7-12 and the worst 3 pt shooting team in the league while we missed 5 key players for like 3 weeks. The reality is that you won't win many games in the West when starting Wes Iwundu, Josh Green and Cauley-Stein"
How dare Luka take precious shots away from Wes Iwundu and and Josh Richardson. Lock him up
far more crippled? I guess you missed the part where 5 of our top 10 guys were put for 2 weeks and we started Caulie-Stein and Wes Iwundu.
"There have been 8 games Luka has played in which the Mavs lost by double digits - 7 of those games are games that Luka played under 34 minutes, which is below his season average of minutes played.   He gets taken out during garbage time and we play our rookies and Wes Iwundu"
"Dallas: Hard to gauge the rookies, but it's probably Wes Iwundu. Dude is only taking wide open spot up 3s and is shooting them at 13%. He's shooting 23/13/80 and his defense has been average.  In 17 games Wes Iwundu is shooting 16% on non layups.   Wish we had kept JJ Barea instead."
Oh I remember. But for reference Miami is 3-17 from 3 tonight (17%).... that’s like a whole lineup of Wes iwundu
"Nah KP is still working his way back, though he also does some dumb stuff on offense. But he does seem slower than when he was in the bubble so I'll give him time.   Losing Seth wasn't that big of a deal, we were better when he was on the bench. What hurts is covid + most of our guys regressed hard from 3. Luka, J rich, and KP are shooting career lows at the three. I know Luka isn't a good 3 point shooter but he's better than 29%.   We also had to play a guy like Wes Iwundu to cover for the guys that we missed from covid. He's shooting 14%. Past two seasons he was shooting 34-36% from three."
"Damn, is this what it’s like to be hated on by rNBA? I know not everyone can keep up with every team but context matters.   We’ve had some combination of our 2nd-6th best players, including our 3 best defenders, out for the past 10ish games, which happened to be what everyone pegged as the hardest stretch of the season even before Covid hit us. We are maybe the hardest hit team by Covid to not get any (sans 1 I think) games postponed. Several of our guys were legitimately sick and are just now starting to look like their legs are back under them. It would have been nice to have the last two weeks off to recover instead slogging our way through a meat grinder of a month but it didn’t work out that way. Our best 3 point shooter and defender only just came back tonight. I mean we’ve been starting Wes Iwundu, Willie Cauley-Stein, and Josh Green most of these games. Yeah Kristaps has started slow like usual and we still could have performed better in January but I’m not gonna throw in the towel after losing to a good Suns team on the first night all season all of our starters actually played together. This isn’t a “fall from grace”. They’ll figure it out."
"Rookie, Wes Iwundu, and WCS have been starting for them."
I wouldn't say we're healthy yet. Half our rotation was out for 2wks+ and were all sick with covid. That's different from missing a few games due to contact tracing. Our guys that were out are still playing back into game shape.  Of course I'd much rather have them like this than rookies and Wes Iwundu. But still.
"For the thousandth time.  We. Have. Been. Ravaged. By. Covid. And. Injuries.   Until these past 2 games he was playing alongside Josh Green, Wes Iwundu, Caulie-Stein, and KP who is just a shell of himself right now.  I don’t think he should be an MVP candidate right now but he’s still been playing great, especially considering the circumstances he’s in."
"Can we just have a stickied post on /r/nba that says the Mavs have missed 6 of their best players for 10+ games (COVID and Porziņģis surgery)? Like I'm so tired of just typing out the same response over and over to folks that just look at record with no context.   We've been starting WCS, Wes Iwundu and Josh Green ffs. Of course we are 8-10."
they've had a stretch where they had to start garbage time players like wes iwundu and josh green and had james johnson run the 2nd unit  don't think it's reasonable to judge them right now
It's a real shame Wes Iwundu and Willie Caulie Stein aren't leading us to the #1 seed. smh
"Definitely not definitive, but it's debatable IMO. Kyrie is the more efficient 3PT shooter and FT shooter (which I admit is huge, especially because Luka is taking 8 threes a game at a bad clip), but in regards to having Luka above Kyrie for scoring, here's what I got:   * Higher points per game (also higher p36 and p100)    * This is Kyrie's best scoring season (only a 12 game sample size and he's averaging 27.9 PPG, prior to that he averaged 27.4 PPG last year on a 20 game sample size, outside of those tiny sample sizes, he's averaged over 25 PPG once in his career)    * Luka averaged 28.8 PPG last year on good efficiency, and is averaging 27.4 PPG this year in 34 MPG (less than Kyrie is playing).     * Kyrie for most of his career has been an efficient low 20 PPG scorer. Luka the past two seasons has been an above average efficiency high 20 PPG scorer.  * Better finisher inside (Kyrie's best seasons in the paint are comparable to Luka's worst season %wise) 0-10 feet. Luka is elite from 0-3 and 3-10, especially for a guard.  * Better at drawing fouls     * Luka has a higher FTr, more FTA. In all honesty he should have more considering he leads the league in drives per game, but is like 17th in the league in FTA.  * Better at Midrange game (16-3PT line)     * Kyrie is 46.5% over his last 3 years, Luka is at 48.5%, this year Kyrie is at 50% and Luka is at 61.5%. (Keep in mind Kyrie has all time level spacing with Durant and Harden, Luka has WCS, rusty Porziņģis and Wes Iwundu  Like I said earlier in my post it's not definitive by any means, Kyrie is a great scorer in his own right. I'm not sold on the sample size, and we've never seen his efficiency without 2+ all star teammates other than a 20 game sample size last year."
&gt; Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of: &gt;  &gt; C: Willie Caulie Stein &gt;  &gt; PF: Wes Iwundu &gt;  &gt; SF: Tim Hardaway Jr. &gt;  &gt; SG: Josh Green &gt;  &gt; PG: Luka Dončić  The Mavs haven't started that lineup at all this season.
"We are have been missing our 2nd-6th best players for almost half the season, as a result we've had to start 3rd stringers, rookies and G-league players, who are shooting at a historically low % from 3. Defenders do not respect our 3PT shooters so they clog the paint and leave guys like Wes Iwundu wide open for 3. (He's shooting 14% on the year). This means Luka isn't able to drive into the paint, and has to take mid range shots and 3s. His 3s are not good, but a lot of it stems from defenders not having to guard 3 of our starters (WCS, Iwundu and Green) and instead double or triple teaming Luka at all times.   The below players are our primary rotation guys from the past few weeks. Just absolutely awful.   WCS was let go from the Sacramento Kings, he's garbage. He is like 9/14 on dunks this season and a washed DeMarcus Cousins lit him up for 28/17/5. WCS is a -30 in his last 7 games.  Wes Iwundu is shooting 14.3% from 3 and 31.7% from the field. He is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever.  Josh Green is shooting 9% from 3. Green and Iwundu are posting 89 and 90 ORTG and 112 and 113 DRTG.  Boban is 7'4 and has not recorded a single block in 100 minutes of play. He is a nonexistent rim protector, cannot space the floor, cannot guard the perimeter and is slow. He's efficient in the low post and has good hands, that's about it.  THJ has been solid but wildly inconsistent. He's averaging 17.5 PPG on 38% from 3. His defense is below average, and he will have a 30 point game then proceed to shoot 0-12 and have 0 points like he did in Toronto. THJ has had 8 games shooting 38% or lower from the field (4 games of 0-30%), and then 4 games shooting 60-78% from the field.  Jalen Brunson has been great for us but he missed a lot of games. He's probably been our 2nd or 3rd best player as of late, despite only averaging 12 ppg and 3.5 apg.  Porziņģis missed 10 games so far, and is shaking off rust. He's averaging 19 ppg 47/29.5/82 shooting. His defense has been very poor and he's been a negative on court through 7 games.  James Johnson is nothing more than a back up big, he's shooting 3s at 31%, his defense is average and he makes some bad decisions.  That's our current rotation.  Luka, 1-3 average level starters (Porziņģis is a fringe all star usually, but has not been thus far in the season), and then a bunch of end of bench guys and rookies."
"Wes Iwundu, duh.   Not everyone can shoot 14.3% on 3PT shots, and he is shooting 16.7% on wide open (nearest defender is 6+ feet away) 3 pointers. He's had one of the worst 3pt shooting seasons ever."
"lmao these guys are acting like LeBron would turn Wes Iwundu and Josh Green from 14% and 9% 3PT shooters into 40% 3PT shooters.   LeBron is obviously incredible, but if he's on the current Mavs they are maybe 10-8, instead of 8-10. Luka is creating great looks, our role players and 3rd stringers (who are having to play 20-30 MPG due to COVID) are just not hitting wide open shots.   Iwundu and Green are in the bottom percentile of players for 3PT% on wide open (defender is 6+ feet away)  shots. LeBron isn't going to do much to change that."
"Wes Iwundu. On a serious note, we've been missing half the starting 5 and half of the rotation guys."
"Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of:   &amp;#x200B;  C: Willie Caulie Stein  PF: Wes Iwundu  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Green  PG: Luka Dončić  with a bench of Boban, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry, James Johnson  &amp;#x200B;  Porziņģis came back a few games ago but is still rusty and until last night we had been missing 3-4 starters. We were 6-4 before COVID hit, keep in mind that was also without Porziņģis. We have not played a single game with our projected starting lineup.   If you watch our games you will see that Luka is the only reason we are near 0.500. We've been garbage without him on the court. This is also coming from a huge Luka critic. I can't deny the impact he's had on our team. His 3PT shooting has been bad, but he's also had no spacing, and defenders are not respecting our shooters, so the lanes are clogged and teams are able to triple team Luka and leave Iwundu, Green and WCS wide open. Iwundu and Green are shooting 14.3 and 9.1% respectively from 3 and they've been two of our starters the past month.   If Dallas is still treading water when the COVID guys are back and get their conditioning back, and Porziņģis is in his groove, then sure, there are some valid concerns, but as it stands now, Luka has kept us in the playoff race despite being down our 2nd-6th best players for over half the season."
"Luka had a slow start and when he started getting going, we lost what I think are four of our essential players in Maxi Kleber, JRich, Dorian Finney Smith, and Dwight Powell for 2 weeks and counting now due to health protocols. The first three are starters and provide excellent 3pt shooting and defensive versatility. Without them, our defense has suffered heavily and with no reliable 3pt shooting for Luka to pass to, teams can effectively swarm him on drives since Wes Iwundu isn’t gonna be swishing anything. Powell can catch lobs, which is something that our replacement WCS can’t do, and Boban, as much as we love him, is an absolute non factor and is a negative on defense.  Our schedule as also been absolutely brutal along with missing a lot of our guys. Obviously there are some games we should’ve won that we lost, but the reason for this rough stretch has been due to us losing our starters."
"If I have one complaint about how my Mavs are playing it’s that there are several players who are just bricking wide open threes. Teams are openly using double team coverage on Luka to dare our other shooters to shoot it and we are just no converting them enough. I’m convinced Wes iwundu has never shot a three in his life with the way he shoots it. We signed him for defense only. Josh green bricked a couple, but I’m gonna give him a pass. He doesn’t get many opportunities on that end and he’s still a rook with development potential and playing great on defense and transition offense. Glad we are getting our other starters back. If the Mavs can hit threes at the league average, they’re gonna be a scary team on the west."
Then again I would have been fine with him taking a stepback three if the alternative is a Wes Iwundu post-up.
Wes iwundu CLUTCH
We sucked.  Then we were really good.   Then we got COVID.   Who knows how we are.    The only things I know are:  Wes Iwundu sucks on offense  James Johnson tries to do too much.  Half the time it is awesome and half the time it is terrible.  Timmy should be recovering right now not playing but too short handed.
"Yup, because TS truly encapsulates a player's worth. Why do we even need scouts anymore when we have bball reference? Luka has had all the spacing in the world to help increase his TS the past 5 games, with superstar talents in the starting lineup like Rookie Josh Green, end of bench piece Wes Iwundu, vet min Willie Cauley Stein, and injured Tim Hardaway with the recent addition of rehabbed Kristaps Porzingis!"
"Normally I’m not one for excuses, but nah man. There’s nothing we can do at this point.   The entire core of our team is out, it’s not like we’re just missing a few guys. Everyone who can shoot the 3 on our team is out except KP, and he’s rusty still. All of our core wing defenders are out, Josh Green and Wes Iwundu are now our 2 main defenders.   Missing your entire 3 and D core is a death sentence in today’s NBA"
"We were missing THJ, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney Smith, Jalen Brunson and Kristaps Porziņģis is in his 3rd game back. That's 50+ FGA we were missing. Someone had to make up for them being gone. I'd rather have Luka shoot 30 FGA than Wes Iwundu or Tyrell Terry taking 15 FGA apiece."
That's Wes Iwundu the Magic legend
Wes Iwundu is shooting corner threes
Wes Iwundu is uh... not great
wes iwundu three let's go
they are completely ignoring wes iwundu lmao
"Starting lineup for our last game was - Doncic - Tim Hardaway Jr - Wes Iwundu - Willie Caulie Stein - Porzingis  we played a 9 man rotation featuring those 5 plus Josh Green, Trey Burke, James Johnson, and Boban  should look similar tonight"
"Wes iwundu is the worst offensive player in the league.  Convince me otherwise!  Every time the ball is in his hands, something bad happens."
"I never want to see Wes iwundu play again, give all his minutes to josh green"
Fuck Wes iwundu
"Nah, I agree with the guy that commented above. We can replace JRich, DFS, and Maxi with Josh Green, Wes Iwundu, and James Johnson and still have a passable defense. The problem is that those guys are a huge step back in shooting and scoring"
Beating Vuc AG Ross and our C team isn't impressive.  What was impressive was AG and his defense on Luka.  What wasn't was Cliff's defensive scheme of not helping off of Wes Iwundu and Green but helping off of Tim Hardaway.  That said Trey Burke always cooka us for some reason.  I just want Fournier and MCW back so we have an actual fighting chance in games.
"Definitely not trash, just below expectations. Wes iwundu on the other hand... That guy has no business touching the ball on offense"
Hey! Wes Iwundu tried very hard today
"Wes Iwundu too, hopefully not."
Wes Iwundu
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
Wes Iwundu
"Just curious, where did you get the TS% stat. If you are referencing the MavsMoneyBall article, that thing is 2 months old and was written right when Porziņģis was coming back from his injury. Prior to that being published, Porziņģis was averaging 20.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg on 47/35/86 shooting. He was also on a minutes restriction, he was a -3.6 and was also playing alongside G-Leaguers and rookies since the COVID protocols had DFS, JRICH, Maxi, Powell and Brunson all sitting. Since that has been published, KP has averaged 21 PPG and 10.3 RPG on 49/39/83 shooting and is a +6.1.   So naturally KP is going to have worse numbers when Luka sits and he was playing alongside James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nate Hinton and Josh Green.   In regards to winning games without Luka, naturally we aren't going to be as good without Luka, same with any team missing their best player. Last year we beat the #1 seed Milwaukee with just Porziņģis. Dončić missed a stretch of games and Dallas went 3-3 including close losses to Miami in OT (eventual EC champions), Boston and Toronto (#2 and #3 seeds). We beat the Spurs, Milwaukee and Philly.   I think you are expecting Dallas to play at the same level when Luka misses games and that's just not realisitc, there's natrually going to be a drop off. Even Porziņģis playing at his best isn't going to drag a team starting Maxi, Brunson, DFS and Richardson to wins over contenders consistently. That's not possible for any team. Look at the Lakers when LeBron sits and just Davis plays. They are naturally not as good as when LeBron and Davis both play.   I guess I just don't get your point. You say that ""whenever Doncić sits, Porzingis is not convincing at being the first guy the opponents guard.""  However stats show Porziņģis is doing fine when he's the primary option, he's scoring well and rebounding well. Then the argument shifts to well we are 1-4 without Dončić. Well obviously that's going to be the case, he's our best player. Those are also games that Porzingis hasn't played either, so it seems completely irrelevant. You go from arguing Porziņģis isn't a good primary option, to he's good at scoring but he can't lead the team.   The sample size is super small for games with Porziņģis playing without Luka, but he's been able to step up when Luka has bad games. Just look at the last game against Milwaukee where Porziņģis stepped up in the 4th quarter and brought us to the finish line."
Lol.. half (or more) of our team got COVID at the start of the year. When we actually play our starters we are a top team (record-wise) in the NBA. Luka was ballin with g-league players and Wes Iwundu. I am *shocked* that a Knicks fan has a dumbass take on the Mavs.
"They gave Pels James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, and a 2nd round pick on the deadline."
"They also traded Wes Iwundu for Melli &amp; JJ, not that it matters all that much"
Our start of the season was unbearable with those fans. We were starting Wes Iwundu at one point this season.
"The season averages are not indicative of the Mavs playoff team.  We were playing Wes Iwundu, James Johnson, Josh green earlier this season and just bricking wide open 3s"
Remember when we started with Wes Iwundu? My liver still hurts when I think of those days.
"Mavs were missing half their team for a huge stretch at the beginning of the season, thats why they were 9-14 and 14th. They were starting wes iwundu lmao"
"Lemme know about those Wes Iwundu moments, I think I missed them."
"The funniest part was if you tried defending the Mavs by saying shit like ""dude covid has fucked us over,"" people would be like ""eVeRyOnE iS sTrUgGlInG wItH iNjuRieS.""  /r/nba was shitting on Luka non stop when we were playing Wes Iwundu regular minutes."
"It honestly just wasn’t even worth it. All we got was James Johnson (who is now in Brooklyn ironically..) Wes Iwundu, and I believe a 2nd round pick? Having that vs having the possibility of JJ ,who is cool with Zion, tarnishing us instead of saying things like “They did right by me” just isn’t worth the risk whether that actually plays any factor in Zion or not"
Making room for Wes Iwundu who came over in the Graham S&amp;T today
The addition of Wes Iwundu into the trade allows New Orleans to create a $17M trade exception (Adams outgoing salary)
"&gt;Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations &amp; General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today that the team has acquired Wes Iwundu, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick and cash considerations from the New Orleans Pelicans and the draft rights to Tyler Harvey from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for sending guard Devonte’ Graham to New Orleans as a part of a three-team trade. In the deal, New Orleans also acquired Jonas Valuncianas as well as the draft rights to Trey Murphy and Brandon Boston. Memphis received Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, the draft rights to Ziaire Williams, the draft rights to Jared Butler and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick from New Orleans (via the Los Angeles Lakers). "
&gt;OFFICIAL: We have acquired Wes Iwundu and a protected 2022 first-round pick in a three-team sign-and-trade.
"IMO Colangelo did a worse job than Billy King during his mutilation of the Nets.  At least King's moves had a somewhat sound logical basis. Colangelo was a total moron selling 2nd round draft picks (he sold the rights to Sterling Brown in 2017), and using 2 first rounders to draft Fultz, one of the biggest busts of the decade. There are reports that Colangelo overrode his staff's concerns when Fultz had terrible workouts.   Also, here are a few players drafted after Pasečņiks (25):  * Kuzma (27) * Derrick White (29) * Josh Hart (30) * Wes Iwundu (33) * Dillon Brooks (45)  In summary, fuck the Colangelos."
"Josh Hart, Wes Iwundu and a pick"
"The Great:   -The Davis trade after a really ugly second half to the 18-19 season and basically dealing with NOLA vs the world   -Helping shape a development staff with Gentry to help BI and Zo blossom.   -Naji Marshall UDFA —&gt; contract extension  -The Jrue trade; did right by Jrue and secured a bag of future picks and swaps. To all those people saying they won’t mean shit in five years: LMA and Bosh were all stars five years ago.   -Maxing BI    The good:   -Offloading Solomon Hill’s contract and signing JJ Redick   -Trading second round picks for Derrick Favors at the time   -With Trajan and Swin as well, seems to hit the draft pretty well. Jax, despite recent news (let’s also not mail in the rest of his life for this shit either), Nickeil, Kira, and Naji have all shown signs of a whole bunch of promise and legit talent. Jax was fantastic the second half of last season. Pels probably make the play in if Nickeil starts over Bledsoe. Naji was a fuckin Diamond in the rough.   -Willing to not let open wounds fester and immediately identifies and fixes own mistakes; something a deadbeat VP would not do.   -trading Redick and Melli for James Johnson, Wes Iwundu and a second rounder. Redick and Melli became unplayable and we saved some money for this offseason by offing Melli.       The bad:  -Choosing Melli and Jah over C Wood. Granted there was definitely some behind the scenes stuff with Wood’s attitude, but man Wood would have killed it with Zion.   -SVG  -Way too many guards on the 2019-2020 roster.   -Not enough shooters and defense on this last seasons team.  -Not extending Josh Hart BEFORE last year (this is more TBD/me nitpicking)    The Ugly:   Being the VP of a team who’s best player’s step father is already wanting his son off the team."
"I don't hate the guy or anything and I think he might even put up decent points and rebounds if he got to start at the 4 somewhere, but 538 had him between Solomon Hill, Wes Iwundu, Taurean Prince, Thad Young and Torrey Craig last year. That's what, an 8-10M guy in Thad, a 5-6M guy in Prince, a 3-4M guy in Craig and a couple minimum guys. Kuzma is younger than those guys except Iwundu, but I think you're still talking 20M over 3 kind of deal, though as I said I think if he moved to a non-playoff team where he could be a full-time 4 he would probably put up decent numbers.  As a Raptors fan, if Lowry signs with you guys and we have 19M in cap space, I wouldn't be stoked if we spent 13M of that on Kuzma. The Lakers have apparently been offering him and KCP all over town for a reason, and it's not because LeBron think he's a solid rotation guy. He's shot 40 percent in the playoffs and 28% on 3s in the 5 playoff series he's been in at age 25 and 26.  Though ironically, I think he'd be a good fit for us at forward next to whichever of OG or Siakam is sitting. Kuzma is a tantalizing player, but there's no real evidence he's more than a 9th man. My guess is he goes somewhere, puts up slightly better numbers but doesn't help his team win. But today? I think he's a 7M guy on potential and 5M on actuality. I wouldn't trust him over a guy like JaMychal Green and that seems like a guy who would be overpaid at 10M a year, never mind 13. He's not Marcus Morris, he's a guy who in theory could be."
unless your name is JJ Redick and you happen to live in Brooklyn NY normally and you've expressed interest in a buyout but James Johnson and Wes Iwundu are too tempting
"No? If you look at the context of our season, you would tell we were the team with the 2nd most covid protocol and injury problems, Luka had to play with James Johnson and Wes iwundu as his starters, we had a stretch where we lost 6 in a row, 3 of our starters and 2 of our bench players were out , it wasn't due to Luka, in a covidless world, the Mavs this season are atlest the 4th seed, which is plenty of good in a stacked west"
\*and Wes Iwundu  \*and James Johnson
"Luka still doesn’t turn bad shooters into good ones though. Just look at what Josh Richardson and Wes Iwundu were like in Dallas.  Frank is young though, is improvement is still possible, just not a guarantee"
Honestly getting wes iwundu vibes from Frank and that scares me
I find it to believe anyone can be worse on offense than Wes Iwundu was on the Mavs last season.
"among our rotation players, Ish Smith. Dude is going to be thrown into a role too big for him. I just don't see how we replace the scoring we lost by letting Monk and Graham walk in FA, unless Bouknight is a legitimately terrific rookie.  On the whole roster? Wes Iwundu. Has always been garbage, I don't see why that would change now."
"I don’t see Simmons being a good fit without KP. The issue with Simmons is that he clogs the paint with his lack of spacing, so he needs a 5 that plays best on the perimeter. The Mavs tried enough lineups with 2 bad shooters (Powell, Michael Kidd Ghilchrist, Wes Iwundu, Josh Richardson, etc…) and it never worked out well.   Luka himself can shoot but he’s best handling the ball so you really want him playing with 4 shooters or 3 shooters + 1 role man.   I’m also not sure whether the Mavs can even get Simmons. They can only trade their 2027 FRP since 2023 is going to NYK and is protected they 2025, and the Sixers should get more than a bunch of rope players and a single FRP. Even if KP is on the table, I don’t think KP would work very well next to Embiid at all."
"JJ cut his counting stats in half for 3 consecutive seasons. Wanted out of Nola at the deadline. Expected a buyout to go to Brooklyn despite having the worst shooting streak of his career and production. Griff traded him to Dallas for James Johnson who played good mins for us(Pels)  and Wes Iwundu. JJ said on his pod (the only thing he still puts time into) he felt betrayed by the fo and couldn't imagine anyone wanting to go there. Jj got trolled by a Pels fan on twitter until he lashed out and referred to him as 1 of 12 Pels fans. We (Pels fans owned it) now 1 of 12, the 12 vs the World, Birdy Dozen etc has started gaining traction as our rallying cry.  Thanks JJ!"
"The mavs had 3-4 starters/rotation players out for several weeks this season. Jabari, Bembry, and Jones are better than Josh Green and Wes Iwundu."
he’s really bad. You would think he’s a good defender looking at him but he got COOKED by Jeremiah Martin. Fuck Wes Iwundu always
"Take that and add those minor moves that DO have a huge impact to our roster.  We are a seriously deeper team now with a lot more defense.  We basically replaced Nico Melli, Wes Iwundu, and the corpse of Jason Richardson, for Reggie Bullock - a solid 3 &amp; D starter for a playoff team, Sterling Brown who plays above average D and hit 42% from deep last year, and a flyer on Frank Ntilikina who hopefully can be a matchup based defender on some more elite wings when needed.  Even if KP doesn't improve, our regular season record should be much better simply because we are deeper.  KP is going to be the ceiling raiser in the playoffs."
Wes Iwundu might be the worst NBA player in the league
Wes Iwundu is so awful man
"I'm mildly worried about Vernon Carey not making the roster, he's hardly played in the preseason while bum ass Nick Richards plays.  I think I'd rather have an empty roster spot over Nick Richards or Wes Iwundu... maybe Cody Martin too, but I'm indifferent on him.   As long as our roster includes:   Ball/Smith   Rozier/Bouk   Hayward/Oubre/McDaniels     Miles/PJ/Thor   Plumlee/Kai Jones  I don't really care who the end of the bench guys are."
