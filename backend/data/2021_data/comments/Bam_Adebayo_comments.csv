Counterpoint:  Bam Adebayo is a lot better than Randle at the game of basketball and the Heat will  have a better record than the Knicks by midseason.

"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"All those guys are clearly better defensively. I forgot to add Bam Adebayo, who is also clearly better. If you wanna add centres who are debatable with Drummond, you can add: Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Serge Ibaka and Nerlens Noel. Some ppl may say Jokic and KAT are also similar defensively compared to Drummond. I think you're overrating his defensive impact based on the counting stats."
"I‚Äôd have to agree they would‚Äôve . Rondo was too scrappy on defensive and his iq is off the charts , that whole team would‚Äôve been a problem . They would‚Äôve 4 peated and because of blood clots bosh would‚Äôve been out . Wades knees would‚Äôve possibly been saved due to less pressure on the shot creation side he can just play off the ball . He def would‚Äôve avoided that second injury . Leaving a slightly aged duo in bron and Wade .. with the addition of perhaps butler or bam adebayo in the coming years I wonder how everything would‚Äôve played out . Rondo, Wade, jimmy , lebron, ___?"
"Our defense was horrific with Theis and TT in the two big lineup. It's the worst transition defense I've ever seen from the Celtics in the Brad Stevens era. The defense (and offense) seemed to work much whenever Brad has rolled out Theis+Rob Williams and yesterday was the most they've played together and it looked good to me. It's not just Theis' shooting but Williams also creates space without being able to shoot like a poor man's Bam Adebayo with how active he is on screens, cuts and as a lob threat. I don't fully trust it as a long term option but I think we should roll with it for a little longer.       TT though is just terrible even when he's the only 5 out there. He can't stay in front of anybody, he can't protect the rim, he's somehow forgot how to read a defensive rebound from a shot further than 3 feet out. He's only good for a couple impossible OREBs against 3 guys. I'm not enjoying the TT experience."

"That's fair.

"Edrice ""Bam"" Adebayo got his nickname from Bamm-Bamm (The Flintstones) because while still a toddler, he was able to flip a table or something. Bam lived in a trailer with his mom for much of his childhood.      As a fan of a team, it just sucks that they tell the same story during national broadcasts for many players. Can't they be more creative and at least find new ways to humanize these players?"

Stretch 5 Bam Adebayo
matchup of 2 of the best shooters in the nba   Bam Adebayo and DeAndre Jordan
"I disagree, this is close to peak Giannis skills' wise. He merely has to utilize his (immense) skills better. Guy can take a step and score, his finishing ability is close to prime Lebron, only he is bigger and longer. It's stupid to play him in the perimeter, he is a big and any system worth its salt would have stopped playing him in the perimeter ages ago.   Think Bam Adebayo, add even more athleticism, quickness, bigger, lengthier add finishing ability. Bam plays a 5 always, despite him actually being smaller, despite actually being a great distributor. Yes Giannis can put the ball in the floor more, maybe he plays point center in some possessions, it's 2021 already, nothing can stop your Big to also be your playmaker from time to time (Jokic is that *all* the time).   The Bucks have to modernise, Giannis will continue underperforming as a perimeter player, he will *never* learn to shoot in a manner that matters, he will *never* learn to throw pinpoint passes. He is in his prime, anything short of spamming his best abilities is underutilizing him. He will win nothing if he tries to be much better, he doesn't need to, not in any manner that matters too much, he merely has to spam the fact that he has some superhuman attributes, the end.  Wilt dominated because he was bigger stronger, faster. Shaq did so too. Giannis should too, he is not special, he is a C."

Would love to see Jokic play next to a rim protector that could make up for his lacking on the defensive end. Jokic next to someone like prime Ibaka or Bam Adebayo would be amazing.
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
"I‚Äôd hope Kyrie averaged more points, considering scoring is the main thing he brings to the table. He played well and it would‚Äôve been wholly irrelevant if not for Lebron arguably having the best series a professional athlete has ever had. There‚Äôs a reason nobody talks about 2016 Kyrie as one of the GOAT postseason performances, and it‚Äôs because he was wholly an accessory to Lebron. Lebron busted that Warriors team wide open.  AD is not second fiddle, and your take on AD‚Äôs strength of opponent is kinda meaningless when Bam Adebayo was healthy and played on him the whole series. Kyrie averaged 2 more points when all he had to do was score, AD is the defensive anchor of that team and he was in the Finals as well."
"AD put up 25/11/3/1.3/2 on 56/42/93 splits while having to deal with Bam Adebayo guarding him. Kyrie played very well and very clutch against the Warriors, he‚Äôs not a better player than AD, he never has been, and to say he was objectively better than AD against the Heat is disingenuous."
"&gt;even without Hayward the C‚Äôs were a really good   Kemba was playing with an injured knee the entire playoffs. So no Hayward and Kemba producing well below his average is not the same as beating a ""healthy"" Celtics.   &gt;and the Bucks only didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like themselves‚Äù   I mean you can look at them play during the bubble and the 8 games before the playoffs started and compare that to how they were playing before the NBA stopped playing. Tell me its the same team.  &gt;And acting like falling short of beating the Lakers when you‚Äôre forced to give Kendrick fucking Nunn and Meyers Leonard minutes instead of Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo.  I really doubt they would have advanced against the Clippers or Nuggets either.   I'm not saying the Heat are a bad team but they overachieved and got the most benefit from the bubble situation."
"What the fuck is a ‚Äúreal‚Äù opponent? Get the fuck out with this trash, even without Hayward the C‚Äôs were a really good team, and the Bucks only didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlook like themselves‚Äù because the Heat outplayed them so badly without any major injuries for all of the games that mattered. And acting like falling short of beating the Lakers when you‚Äôre forced to give Kendrick fucking Nunn and Meyers Leonard minutes instead of Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo."
"Dawg. Giannis lost to a team with a best player who is worse than him and a bunch of dudes acquired via trade or developed by the Heat. What are you saying? The reason the Bucks lost to the Heat isn't because the Heat are in a desirable situation -- the Bucks are MORE TALENTED than Miami. They lost because they got outcoached severely and because Giannis woefully underperformed. This woe is me attitude has to stop from small market teams. They secure superstars and then fail to materialize competent enough teams around those stars.   Miami secured their star and he was surrounded by Bam Adebayo (developed all star), Tyler Herro (rookie), Dragic (traded for YEARS ago), Jae Crowder (traded for), and Iguodala (traded for). Jimmy Butler was signed in free agency, but he's a worse player than a lot of the stars on small market teams... Maybe teams should draft their own Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro, trade for their own Jae Crowder and Iguodala, develop their own quality coaching staff that's up to snuff and surround their home grown superstar with that instead of bullshitting around keeping coaches like Budenholzer as the head of their program.  I mean, OKC had Paul George AND Westbrook and couldn't make it out of the first round... Is that because they're a small market? Kawhi and Paul George JUST LOST TO DENVER."
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal

"Easy solution: Play Ben Simmons at center. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô10, he‚Äôs taller than Bam Adebayo lol"
better than Bam? Like Adebayo?
"Bam Adebayo? Lmao, 20 win team if he's your number one option. Simmons and shooters can easily make playoffs."
brook lopez and embiid are the main worries. also bam adebayo. giannis is somewhat of a big.
"&gt; He can't do that in this Sixers team because Embiid is a better inside scorer than Simmons and a better FT shooter.   It's not like we haven't seen Ben Simmons on the floor without Embiid. He still doesn't look like someone who can lead an offense.             &gt; In his own team with an actual playmaker, Simmons becomes a Giannis lite guy. He should not be the primary playmaker in any team, just like Giannis.     So, Ben is a much worse scorer than Giannis, and also has the same playmaking issue that Giannis has, AND also is a much worse shooter. Given that even Giannis himself struggles in the postseason, how much faith do you have in Ben Simmons not having that problem?           Ben is best suited for a Pascal Siakam/Bam Adebayo role, in which he is not the primary scorer or primary playmaker."
When they started calling bam Adebayo Bam ‚Äòouttathebayou‚Äô I was like... thats... inappropriate. But everyone else is laughing. Still can‚Äôt get my head around that one
Okay how about Jokic being 2nd in the NBA in Defensive BPM (Bam Adebayo is 1st). That good enough?

"Which is why I think they're not trying to tank, they seem to be to have a solid core of starters that just need more time to develop. If you look at some of the top young players like Donovan Mitchel,  Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro they've been mostly mid first round draft picks. I feel OKC loaded up on draft picks so they can trade picks that work for their teams chemistry rather than getting  the best possible pick."
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
"I wouldn't say your ""odds go up"" if you're in a large market specifically. Which players on large market teams have made it who haven't deserved it?  Like last year's large market all stars were LeBron (and elite, household name on the first seed), AD (elite and in the first seed), kawhi (elite and on the 2nd seed), Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo (both very, very good/elite and on a high seed), Kemba and Tatum +Boston was the 3fd seed) and depending on if you count Houston and Philly as big markets, Harden, Westbrook, Embiid and Simmons, all of whom are also pretty elite.   Though you aren't wrong about everything else. It's why the raptors had 2 stars last year, it's why sabonis was an all star."

Bam Adebayo: steps foot on court  Refs: thats a foul
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
I almost want to fouls to shake out so that we see a lineup of   Waters-Edwards-PP-Teague-Smart.  Bam Adebayo going for a minimum of 20 boards against us.
" Ginobili largely developed overseas. He was a draft and stash player. It took him a few years to actually come over to the NBA after he was drafted, so by the time he did he was already well-established internationally and really polished for a rookie. He made the all-rookie team his first year, and it was clear from the get go he was going to be very good. He wasn‚Äôt really under the radar anymore by the time he started playing in the nba. The spurs shouldn‚Äôt get all that much credit for developing him really.   Tony Parker is a totally different story. He was super raw and young. I think he still holds the record for youngest player to start for the Spurs at 19. But he had flashes, was super fast, lightning quick, and could stop on a dime unlike anyone else. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that he was unique enough that Pop and co. knew that had someone special.    In my opinion, one reason tony was developed so well is because he played alongside Tim Duncan and a group of veterans. The role players on the 2000s spurs were known for being kinda old, cerebral, and experienced players. Guys like Michael Finley, Brent Barry, Robert Horry, etc. who had been in the league for a while already. The veterans plus Tim Duncan (who in my totally-not-biased-as-a-spurs-fan opinion is perfection incarnate) were able to help cover for a lot of mistakes Tony made, which gave him some room to develop and take a bit more risks. And then Pop would aggressively point out every single one of those mistakes to him. Luckily, Tony responded well to that, and soaked up those lessons.    You also have to consider that the Spurs overall front office strategy is different from a team like the Lakers. The spurs aren‚Äôt going to get a lot of talent in free agency, so they have a larger focus on in house development and have never really been one for making big trades or taking really any risks. They‚Äôre very patient and conservative. Popovich also really values continuity which helps a lot with development as well.    &gt;	it's just crazy that the Spurs stuck with them and developed them for YEARS without everything splitting apart.    This is the luxury of having maybe the best coach of all time alongside a top 5-10 player of all time. In Duncan‚Äôs prime, its really easy to put a group of players around him thats a perennial playoff team. There‚Äôs no panic to get better quick, and there‚Äôs no reason to take big gambles that might not pay off. That kind of continuity is really valuable to a developing player.   &gt;	What is a modern player you could compare young Tony Parker or Ginobli to?  In terms of play style, I have no idea. I genuinely don‚Äôt think there will ever be a player like ginobili again. His mix of high-IQ play and total chaos is really really unique, and I don‚Äôt think any player will replicate that again.   I can‚Äôt think of a good comparison to Tony Parker either. He was also a very unique player. Someone said de‚Äôaaron fox because of his speed and quickness, but other than that they‚Äôre really different. You could maybe say Kyrie Irving without the jumper? In that Tony got to the rim easily and had really creative ways to finish. He didn‚Äôt break defenders down the way kyrie does though, he just blew by them with a quick crossover. Also, rather than contorting his body in weird ways to get a shot over a shot blocker, he relied more on unconventional timing and quick releases to get his layups/floaters out of his hand before the shot blocker had a chance to contest.    In terms of development, I think Tony Parker may be like like Bam Adebayo? You can see what makes him special right away, but for a while it just wasn‚Äôt quite there. But each year he gets better and better, and his organization has really bought into his talents and backed him up. I don‚Äôt watch the Heat a lot, but that‚Äôs kinda the vibe I get from him. Someone who watches him more often feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.    This might be the homer in me, but I think Tony Parker is the best non big man finisher at the rim in the history of the NBA. He‚Äôs almost certainly the best under 6‚Äô4‚Äù. I can‚Äôt think of anyone who can create space in the restricted area the way he did."
"The midrange shot and footwork + finishing at the rim all feed on each other. Since he's good at finishing at the rim, he can slam on the brakes and get a clean look at a midrange jump shot. Since he has a good midrange jump shot, he can use his footwork to counter attempts to contest it with something like the pump-fake and up-and-under he did on Bam Adebayo earlier this week.  Like, the name of the game on defense is to try to give up the worst look you can get away with. The midrange jump shot ain't great, but if you can take advantage of it when the defense gives it up, it puts them in an *extremely* awkward position."
Simmons could end up playing a F/C role a bit like Bam Adebayo does. Just with maybe better ball handling. A lot of Miami‚Äôs offense starts with or runs through Bam at times.   Trouble is they have Embiid taking up all that space on the court. As he should.   Maybe a trade is the answer after all.

Bam Adebayo has all the skills
"It would hurt him but not probably much more than a guy like Bam Adebayo. I think he could fulfill a similar role, albeit more perimeter-oriented in general.   AK47 would be a great swiss-army knife to have on any team, and his defensive versatility would be a big boost to switch-heavy schemes, which are more common now than when he played."
"Miami Heat. We are underdogs and we thrive under the pressure when it comes to counting us out. We have the best development staff in the league. If you want a prime example, we made it to the playoffs while playing mostly rookies and one of our rookies broke 2 records. Bam Adebayo is energetic, Tyler Herro is a clutch god, and Duncan Robinson is a 3 point specialist."

"He was like that last year too. When game gets tight teams can easily lock Trae and he stays afloat with refs help on FT. The way he got foul calls is absurd. Defenders try to not even make a wind bc it would be FTs. So Trae enjoys easy layups, open shots because of this massive FT threat. Harden-Doncic are actually great offensive players that can finish inside with their craft and strength. Both of them are good low post players too. Watch Doncic‚Äôs highlight play against Bam Adebayo. You‚Äôd never see sth similar from Trae"

Bam Adebayo!!
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"Many players of the past wouldn‚Äôt be very good if you just teleported them to today‚Äôs game. At the same time there are plenty of players in today‚Äôs game that would get destroyed if you teleported them to the previous era‚Äôs.   The rules change and what‚Äôs effective changes over time. You can say a guy like Duncan wouldn‚Äôt be as good in 2021 if he played the exact same as he did in 2003, but at the same time it isn‚Äôt like a guy like Bam Adebayo would have a chance having to guard the giants in the 90‚Äôs"
"And yet the Lakers still dropped two to a team whose best defensive player was an undersized Bam Adebayo playing through an injury. Meanwhile, the hypothetical 2020 Raptors would have had 2 DPOYs, Siakam who's always elite on defense even when his shot doesn't go, plus a top 5 3&amp;D player in a healthy OG Anunoby, and that's just on the defense. If you still think that's comparable to a team that had to play Kelly Olynyk for 30+ minutes I don't know what to tell you."
Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo might be a fair offer
This is obviously just a rest game. Many stars are gonna be ruled out last minute for some BS reason. Bam Adebayo just got scratched out of nowhere. Coincidentally Jimmy Butler is back in the lineup now.
"I'm with you. Haha, imagine getting a heap of downvotes for saying this bench dude is not an actual shot-blocker. He has 14 blocks in his NBA career of 547 minutes.  Like, that is not bad at all, and he has had a nice little impact in his minutes so far, but this *small forward* who plays a few minutes a night is not a shot-blocker, and it's completely ridiculous to compare him to Bam Adebayo."
"Yuta Watanbe: 1.6 blocks/36 minutes  Bam Adebayo: 1.0 blocks/36 minutes  Obviously it's harder to do that over more minutes, not saying Yuta is as good as Bam.  But saying Yuta isn't ""an actual shot blocker"" is ignorant"
I can see Bam Adebayo doing it
"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
I'm using the official height chart from the NBA site:  G: CP3 (6'0)  G: Stephen Curry (6'3)  F: James Harden (6'5)  F: Zion Williamson (6'7)  C: Bam Adebayo (6'9)
"I'm doing active players only, here we go:  G: Damian Lillard (6'2"")  G: Steph Curry (6'3"")  F: Dort (6'3"")  F: Zion Williamson (6'7"")  C: Bam Adebayo (6'9"")   That is exactly 32 feet worth of player"
Bam Adebayo only got 2 rebounds in 33 minutes. Capela 17 rebounds in 30 minutes.
Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo  Think about it they are basically the same player but Simmons is a better passer
Kristaps and Bam Adebayo
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Anyone else see that conversation between Adebayo and Mitchell with about 16 seconds to go? Mitchell seemed annoyed that Bam was trying to talk to him
"He stated that as a reason Sabonis is superior, implying that Bam can't run the offense. Sabonis averages 0.2 assists more than Adebayo (because he plays more minutes) and has a lower AST%. Does that sound like one guy can run an offense and one can't?"
I ask everyone in this thread. You are trying to win an NBA Basketball game. Would you rather have Domantas Sabonis or Bam Adebayo? I'd much rather have Bam
But not over Bam Adebayo
Sabonis: 21.5 11.7 5.7  Adebayo: 19.6 9.6 5.5  That's two more points and two more rebounds a game. I'd also argue that if Screen assists were tracked Sabonis would almost definitely lead the league in them. Pacers run everything through Sabonis. Bam definitely does have the superior defense but both teams have had serious injury troubles and the Pacers record is better than the Heat by a hair. I think Sabonis has the edge.   Granted we are both biased so probably won't be much ground for agreement.

"Star - A **good** player / Key piece on a contender. Think Lou Williams or Kyle Kuzma  All-Star - An all-star.. pretty self explanatory. Randle, Jaylen Brown, Bam Adebayo  Superstar - Good enough to be the best player on a championship level team. LeBron, Kawhi, AD, KD, Jokic, Steph, etc."
"Your lineup is pretty much spot on. Maybe can swap Nurkic in for Bam, but Nurk is basically worse Adebayo."
"He'd be average as hell. Seriously, nothing about his game was special enough to be a weapon in today's league. AD and Giannis would embarrass him both ways and dudes like Rudy Gobert and Jokic would bully him off the court. I think the closest comparison I can come up with is an Injured Bam Adebayo"

"Honestly Vucevic, Randle, Sabonis and Adebayo all had compelling cases and were more or less just as deserving as one another.   If I had to pick two out of the four I would have gone with Vooch and Bam, but wouldn't have been mad if the other two got picked. There were not enough spots I guess, it is what it is."

"I felt stupid replying to that guy. He basically commented else where in this thread claiming Covington is a top 20 player and better than Bam Adebayo, Lowry and Middleton"
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"Rudy is the better player as of now due to his defense but Bam Adebayo has the higher ceiling. Also, Bam is a lot harder to game plan against compared to Rudy Gobert."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I‚Äôd have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
How many casuals do you think know Jimmy Butler before the finals? Bam Adebayo? The finals was already lopsided for the Lakers before Heat players started dropping like flies  It doesn‚Äôt matter if people like the Lakers or not. What matters is if they know about them. People know about Bron. People know about Steph. People know about KD. The ideal scenario is a close series that isn‚Äôt derailed by injuries with big names.
Assuming full health:  John Wall  Victor Oladipo   Kawhi Leonard  Bam Adebayo   Anthony Davis
Bam Adebayo
"Irving is already a starter  So already locked was Embiid, Giannis, KD, Kyrie and Beal  Yet to be called out but very likely would be Tatum and Brown, Simmons or Tobias Harris, Bam Adebayo, Gordon Hayward, Trae Young, Vucevic, Middleton, Sabonis, Randle, Vanvleet/Lowry/Siakam, oh and of course James Harden has gotta be a lock.   Of that full list the guys that probably won't make it would be Randle, maybe Vuc or Bam so there is a ton of competition still and I didn't even throw LaVine into the list.   But basically of that list the following teams will have to have an all star just because of their standings and success and those would be Boston, Indiana, Charlotte, Toronto. So that's 4 spots completely locked up with Boston likely being 2 all stars so really 5 spots. Then Harden will very likely get a spot. That leaves 1 spot left now which will be fought for between Middleton, LaVine, Bam, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Vucevic, Julius Randle. I can see LaVine making it over all those guys just cause of the season he is having but then again the way Beal didn't make the roster last year and Beal was clearly a better player than Trae Young but still Trae got the spotlight at the time. But still LaVine is on a better team and is having a more efficient season from a numbers perspective than Beal was at the time."

Known Celtics player Bam Adebayo
Nah Ad as forward. Somehow get Bam Adebayo into the 1st team because all the other big men make it in at other positions.
I'd go  Dame/Jaylen Brown/Mikal Bridges/Bam Adebayo/Myles Turner  Bench: Gary Trent/OG/George Hill/Dwight Howard
"I would want big, athletic wings that can shoot and a switchy, rim-protecting big that can play defense, be an outlet in the pick n roll and do everything possible to cover up for Dame's lack of size on defense.  Here's who I would want (not just picking the very best NBA players to stack alongside him):  Jaylen Brown  Gordon Hayward  Bojan Bogdanovic  Bam Adebayo   This team has size, play-making, shooting and would play defense well enough around Dame to cover up for his lack of size.  Jaylen Brown &amp; Bam are perfect compliments to Dame, giving him another creator with size who can defend tough options in the back-court/on the wing and a switchy big that would be great in the PnR and can do everything on defense.  Combine with some great shooting and a bit more scoring juice in Bojan &amp; Hayward and you've got a damn good squad."
Bam Adebayo   Larry Nance   Mikal Bridges   Joe Ingles  It's defense floor spacing and maybe the biggest one is getting a big who can really playmake and destroy defenses for blitzing Dame off the short roll.
"Bam Adebayo, easily."
"He can and does quite regularly. Here‚Äôs a good article from last season  &gt; Anunoby's isolation stats are eye-popping. He ranks in the 94th percentile in isolation defense, according to NBA Advanced Stats, surrendering 0.61 pointer per possession in isolation. Of players who have played at least 48 games this year, Anunoby ranked 14th in isolation defense, immediately behind Kawhi Leonard. While being in the 94th percentile is impressive, it's Anunoby's versatility that makes him truly special in isolation. Of players with a minimum of 2000 possessions, Anunoby led the NBA this season in Versatility, a stat created by Krishna Narsu that attempts to measure how often a player defends different positions. He played 24% of his time defending small forwards, another 24% of his time on shooting guards, 22% of his time on power forwards, and 16 and 13 percent of his time defending point guards and centers, respectively.  [source](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/is-og-anunoby-the-best-isolation-defender-in-the-nba)  I‚Äôve seen Nurse assign him as a primary defender on both Damian Lillard and Bam Adebayo and made them both struggle. Dude is as versatile a defender as they come, one of the few players who can truly guard 1-5."
"Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo would be the notable omissions from your list."
"No, I think he has a better case than Sabonis, arguable with vucevic, but Vucevic is producing on a team that has been blasted by injuries and is just generally worse than the Knicks (they might have the worst point guard situation in the NBA).  Aside from that, I would have him behind Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum, Khris Middleton, and Giannis. That would have him at like 7th or 8th in the eastern conference frontcourt, so no, I don't think he deserves to be an all-star."
"I think it has to be Bam Adebayo. Bam is by far the better defender but he‚Äôs scoring less, rebounding less and assisting less (by a small margin). The Heat were defending Eastern Champs but are 6 games below .500 right now. Some of that has to do with Jimmy not playing but that would‚Äôve meant a larger role for Bam without Jimmy. The Heat are in 11th place in the East and if they aren‚Äôt top 8 by the all-star break I really don‚Äôt think they deserve to have two all-stars. If I‚Äôm picking one from Miami it‚Äôs Jimmy."
"It is soo soo soooo soooo much deeper then the 80-90s tho. Players like Domantis Sabonis, Bam Adebayo and others are struggling to get into the All-Star game now.  Not to mention the top stars are still absolutely incredible."

"Bam Adebayo is offically overrated to me. Don't let he numbers fool you, he was clamped by Eric Paschall down the stretch in the 4th quarter during the Warriors run. Man played a team with no centers and Draymond and couldn't post up dudes 6 inches shorter than him. SOFT."

"You lost me at ""great GM"" with Olshey.  He's incredibly high variance, his moves are either great or utter trash fires.  He's out of consideration given how badly the 2016 FA class went for the Blazers, I'm sorry but there's just no way that a guy who gave $200M to Moe Harkless, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard and Evan Turner is in the conversation given the competition out there.  Also, his draft record is spotty at best, trading 3 picks to move up &amp; take Zach Collins ahead of Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, OG Anunoby and more disqualifies him."
"We can‚Äôt just ignore the number of covid absences and injuries the Heat have had and say they‚Äôre underachieving, especially that Bam is somehow responsible for it.   If anything I could argue that the Knicks are winning/overachieving on the back of their defense and probably slightly lucky opponent shooting which Randle isn‚Äôt as involved with.   In any case I still believe Adebayo is more deserving this year."

"the easiest answer is that if Leon Rose called &amp; tried to trade Randle for any of these guys they'd hang up on him.  But here are the numbers:  Randle: 21/11/5.5 on .575 TS% and 112/106 ORtg/DRtg  Bam: 19.5/9.3/5.2 on .633 TS% and 119/108 ORtg/DRtg  Beal: 33/3.6/5 on .589 TS% and 114/115 ORtg/Drtg  Trae: 26/4/9.4 on .592 TS% and 119/118 ORtg/DRtg  Lavine: 28/5.4/5.3 on .650 TS% and 117/114 ORtg/DRtg   Beal, Lavine and Trae are all carrying heavier offensive loads than Randle does and doing it more efficiently, their teams records are worse but it's not like the Knicks are blowing the doors off the East (the Bulls &amp; Hawks are within 2 games of the Knicks and Beal is scoring 33 a game).     Bam is closer to Randle and isn't carrying as much of a load, which explains some of his efficiency, but the raw numbers are really close (on a per 36 basis they're almost even to Randle) and the advanced numbers favor him a little.  As I've replied to others on this thread, because the Knicks have a better record and because Randle has played in 4 more games, I would be fine choosing him over Bam even though Adebayo is the better player in a vacuum.  The whole point of the list is that it's not as easy as ""just put Randle in,"" you have to take someone else off, and there are a ton of deserving candidates this year."
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."

I always tell suns fans if played with the tenacity and motor of bam adebayo he could be great. He‚Äôs still young tho
"it's hard to be Steph Curry off the ball (he's a 1 of 1 in that regard), and as you say doubly so without other + playmakers around him, particularly at a forward/big spot who can be the release valve on a PnR action.  You nailed it, it's tough to find complimentary pieces for their core with its inherent limitations.  They need a more mobile 5 that can do more on offense than Nurkic does and/or a complete wing creator rather than the frankenstein rotation they've had for the last 5-6 years of guys who can all do different things but nobody who does everything.  Like sure, Nurk can play drop and protect the rim a little and he can do some things in the high post as a passer to find cutters, but he's not a legit scoring threat and frankly pretty below average as a PnR finisher.  If you had one/both of Bam Adebayo (could've drafted him instead of Zach Collins) and a TJ Warren/Gordon Hayward then Dame would be able to do much more off the ball and the Blazers would have an easier time finding success (duh, good players make it easier)."
"I'm a Heat fan but Butler is not better than Beal imo. In fact you could place a few players ahead of Butler....Trae Young, John Wall, Middleton, Klay Thompson, I think Bam Adebayo is a better asset than Jimmy...Butler can't shoot 3s, but wins when it counts though. It was the team of the Heat that brought them to the finals. Not just Butler."
[Bam Adebayo enters the chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm9jXof-BKQ)
Bam Adebayo.  Taco Fall.  Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje (I'm pulling him out of retirement for this one).  Bol Bol.  Jonas Valanciunas.    Luguentz Dort.  I am open to more names of mainly active players if I'm missing other great names.
"Knicks have suckkkked at drafting since Porzingis.   Obi Toppin over Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin Knox over Shae Gilgious Alexander, Michael Porter Jr and Mikal Bridges  Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo"
"I‚Äôm putting him below Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Jokic, Bam Adebayo, KAT, Gobert"
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"The assists were what really stood out - they weren't cheapies.  He seems to already have a high BBIQ and feel for the game, and he was genuinely 'passing guys open.'    Mixture of Bam Adebayo &amp; Gordon Hayward, in OG Anunoby's body."
"&gt; Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo  I would just like to point out that Bam has a really cool sounding name. ""Edrice Femi""... damn. Sounds classy af for some reason."
It's not like Randle was making anything. Bam Adebayo kept him out of the paint.
Bam Adebayo had as many free throw attempts as our entire team combined.  Then add Butler who had 1 free throw less than our entire combined.   What a fucking joke.
"Just making a quick list (not very accurate) I‚Äôd put him in the 20-30 range. Your 16-22 range seems a little too optimistic.  Embiid, Giannis, Middleton, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Capela, Bam Adebayo, Gobert, LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, Chris Paul, DeRozan, Damian Lillard, Jokic, Steph, Christian Wood, Zion, Luka  That‚Äôs 24 players. All of these players besides Bam are on a team with a better record then the Knicks. You could probably put him over a few of them though.  Ben Simmons, Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, Lavine, Beal, Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Fox  There‚Äôs 9 players kind of in that same range. Maybe below, maybe above Randle depending on your argument."
Should he be in it? Sure. Should he be in it OVER Donovan and Booker? Fuck no. He's All Star voting is a popularity contest anyway. If it was actually based on stats/performance Julius Randle would likely be over Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo in regards to votes.
Bam ‚ÄúChavano Hield‚Äù Adebayo
"It‚Äôs so crazy looking back at what could have been with DSJ. Even after tearing his ACL as a senior he was a top 10 recruit in high school, up with De‚ÄôAaron Fox, London Ball, Josh Jackson, Bam Adebayo, Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Jayson Tatum. He then goes to NC State and had a good season, ends up getting drafted 9th overall up there with basically the same stars from his HS class.  People learn how to play defense or shoot 3s later in their career so maybe he could do it. I see the best case for DSJ is to become Lou Williams. The first scoring option off the bench for the 2nd unit, a slasher who also shoots ~35% from 3. Worst case is he ends up being a perpetual 3rd point guard on a team making the minimum."
Heat passed on John Collins for Bam Adebayo and Collins was raised here.
"The best way to judge how good players are defensively is to look at their ability to stay in front of their man and regain ground on a shot if they are beaten. The leagues best defenders get beaten, but the best way to judge a defensive possession is individually watching the matchups, the ability to contest without contact, foul at the right time and create turnovers are all accurate measures of a great defender. Some of my favourite defenders to watch are Jrue Holiday, Jae Crowder, Bam Adebayo &amp; Kawhi Leonard, they all defend differently, but they are the best defenders in the league if you ask me."
"his mobility is overstated, he‚Äôs mobile like Amare Stoudemire not close to like how Bam Adebayo or Deandre Ayton are"
"To be fair, it's an organization that helped build a legacy on great drafting.  It's not the most profitable franchise and it's not a guarantee that the fanbase will maintain any sort of interest in a tanking team.  Most fans aren't championship-or-bust minded.  There's something to be said for staying competitive and trying to pull a Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Kawhi, Devin Booker or Michael Porter Jr. around the middle of the first round."
"If the Blazers could build a 2011 Mavs style team around Dame it could be possible.  If you surrounded Dame with Jaylen Brown (or Jrue Holiday), Mikal Bridges, Bojan Bogdanovic and Bam Adebayo with Ingles, Norman Powell, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder and Ivica Zubac that'd be a true championship contending roster.  That squad has the size, defense &amp; versatility to cover up for Dame on defense, a playmaking big to help beat the trap on a PnR, enough secondary scoring to make teams pay for loading up on Dame and enough shooting to keep the lane open for him.   It's much harder to build a team around a small guard but not impossible."
I think you're underrating it. I remember when Dearon Fox and Bam Adebayo were inconsolable after losing to UNC in the tourney. These guys were both about to bounce to the NBA and make $$$$$ but it still mattered to them.
"&gt;  I can‚Äôt think of any center that can lockdown a good PG play after play  Bam Adebayo and...   Yeah, just Bam. Only big man i've ever seen snuff out Curry 1-on-1"
people said the same thing about Bam Adebayo
Lebron Steph KD AD Giannis Harden  Dame Jokic Kawhi Embiid Gobert Luka Simmons Bradley Beal Jimmy Butler Bam Adebayo Klay Booker Tatum Ingram Randle CP3 Zion? Mitchell? Westbrook? PG? Jrue?  There's hella dudes you're going to have to convince me he's better than. And that's just off the top of my head

What? He was a big part of us going to the final last year and was a key contributor all season for Miami.  They just also have Bam Adebayo so Kelly obviously got less minutes
Literally Bam Adebayo with a little less juice

"exactly. casual fans LOVE Wilt, just like I used to but he was objectively not a more valuable player than Russell. maybe if you raised both of them being born in 95, Wilt would probably be a better player today, but Russell would be like a better defending Bam Adebayo because he was also an insane athletic freak. in their own eras, the players in the league all agreed Russell was a better player than Wilt and I think that matters."

Im going  Pg ben Sg jimmy buckets Sf giannis alphabet bro Pf draymond day day green  C bam bam adebayo While this team may suck at guarding lil mfs under 6'3 we gon have jrue the best guard defender come off the bench to fix that.
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"No way Miami let‚Äôs him walk. He has a small cap hold, so even if they want to mix it up in free agency they can sign a big name and then go over the cap to bring Duncan back.   He‚Äôs a perfect fit next to Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo on offense. It wouldn‚Äôt be smart to let him go."
Minnesota has the 3rd most BPG yet 4th worst defense. Indiana has the 2nd most BPG yet only 11th on defense  Edit: how do you feel about Bam Adebayo then?
"My point is that the NBA added this rule purely to make it easier to get to the rim. This is part of the reason why no one shoots midrange J's anymore in the NBA...the paint is open half the time, they don't call travels, so why pull up if I can just barrel into the paint and either draw a foul or get a 60%+ shot? If teams were allowed more freedom to position themselves on defense, teams would have to take tougher shots on offense, which would reward more skilled players. This means some less skilled NBA players can get by with bad fundamentals but elite athleticism. This gets exposed when these players play outside of the NBA rule environment. As a fan of basketball, I think it's silly to put a restriction on where the defense is allowed to stand, purely to make it easier for the offense to get layups.  ""Build a wall"" With Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler (two of the best tough defenders in the world) can hold Giannis to 24ppg in an NBA series. There's a big difference between that result and what would happen under FIBA rules. Way less talented, smaller, and less athletic players used the same strategy in FIBA and Giannis barely outscored Nick Calathes.  Fair point on your last paragraph, but I still maintain that the guy who scores the most at the rim AND shoots the highest % is probably the best slasher under the current rules. The guys you listed are all guys who have the skill and fundamentals to be great under any set of rules. Young LeBron would have had trouble with FIBA rules (See: 2011 Mavs who did a real good job of working around the 3-second rule, but basically played a zone for much of the series)."
"Bam Adebayo, DeAndre Ayton, and Valanciunas can't either"
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"
"Robert Williams is the next great American big on the way, Bam Adebayo is already very good.   I think it‚Äôs because nowadays teams are willing to look and scout anywhere for tall people, and tall people worldwide all know about the NBA. Since scouts can find tall players and scout them easier more are coming internationally because America‚Äôs population compared to the entire world is relatively small."
"Basketball is now an international game and there are more athletic bigs born outside the U.S. than inside the U.S.  The NBA now has a vast network of international scouts looking for athletic bigs.  Colleges and even some high schools look for international bigs as well, offering them an opportunity to get ready for the NBA.  Meanwhile American players who would have been bigs in an earlier era would rather be power forwards and even small forwards.  Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant could have been centers but prefer to play as forwards.  One exception you forgot to mention is Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo, who sounds foreign but was born in New Jersey."

That Bam Adebayo would be out of the league by this time
"Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Joe Ingles, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo.  League fucked."
Bam Adebayo (Nets)
"I don't know about it being the hardest to learn on defense; off the top of my head Mitchell Robinson, Jarrett Allen, and Bam Adebayo all had really strong defensive showings right off the bat.   I'd say that it's harder for young wing players to be good defenders because they can't get by on athleticism alone, they need actual technique."
"yeah take how much juice you want you'll never achieve that shit, it put Bam Adebayo to the bench when he bumped that."
Bam Adebayo is huge and injured himself going shoulder to shoulder with 2020 Dwight.
"The Celtics 2 best players are top 3 picks, the Pelicans have 2 all-star caliber players who were both top 3 picks, 1 on their own accord and 1 through trading AD (yeah it‚Äôs called rebuilding, do your Googles), Donovan Mitchell was a lottery pick, Devin Booker was a lottery pick, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were lottery picks, Bam Adebayo was a lottery pick."
"A lot of team play ""bigs"" that aren't bigger than LeBron, lol. Like look at Bam Adebayo, he's the same size as LeBron"
Bam Adebayo is going to be a top 3 player in the East. The guy is unbelievably good.
1. Goran Dragic (All Star (sub-in) like 2 seasons ago) 2. James Harden (MVP and multiple NBA scoring leader) 3. Jimmy Butler (Averaged 26.2pts in his only Finals appearance to date) 4. Kelly Olynyk ( 3&amp;D player (needs work on both tho) ) 5. Bam Adebayo (last year All-Star whose young with a very high ceiling IMO)     Pretty decent starting squad but they definitely lose their depth in the process. Not so sure it would've been worth it.
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry   5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetounkounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Damian Lillard   9. Luka Doncic   10. Joel Embiid   11.

That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Bam Adebayo   Reason: He‚Äôs the only rookie I have ever followed from when he got drafted and I sympathize with his story. I am also a defense first guy so I like the hustle he brings to the team
"Honestly, no.  Sure, talent-wise, there's a lot there. I'm not convinced their defense can contain anyone, especially bigs like EMVPIID, AD or even a dude like Bam Adebayo.  I'm also not convinced that the rest of their roster can stay healthy, and if you attack DeAndre Jordan all game in a pick and roll - fairly certain that is a weakness of his. Buckets."
"Quote me like im doing you or sit down lol. Your original comment i was replying too was demeaning his performance as if it wasnt impressive .   I quoted your words and said very clearly my responses to each , respond to the actual quotes.   &gt;While you‚Äôre mentioning injury‚Äôs you could also include that Bam and Dragic (who I assume you‚Äôre talking about as the 2nd and 3rd best) both played in the series, with Bam playing 4/6 games. Bam was 6th on his team in minuets for crying out loud lol  You just enjoy (attempting) to leave out context dont ya bud?   Alright ill spank ya one more time i guess.   Dragic was playing through a torn plantar fascia and looked ridiculously hindered in the games he did play .  Adebayo had a strained neck and previous reaggrevated shoulder injury , and was also playing visibly hobbled.   You're attempting and failing to act like they were only injured for 2 games , they weren't , they just tried to play through it."
Lakers: Bradley Beal  Nets: Bam Adebayo and Demar Derozan
"&gt; Unless you think that Steve Clifford is a good coach I don't see your point here.   Yes, he is a good coach. Someone who can get the most out of a roster, even one the lacks talent.  &gt; Warren was average that series, Oladipo was ass, and nobody overperformed. The Pacers team was just less talented than the Heat.   This is the go-to explanation, but it's also a lazy one. Coaches need to put players in positions to succeed. Warren was being doubled on the catch, yet Nate ran no plays to free other players up or make Warren into a catch-and-shoot guy. Turner averaged 17 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 blocks, yet had no plays run for him. Brogdon was forced to repeatedly isolate on Bam Adebayo, a premier defender.   I could go on and on, but let's just agree to disagree. I have a different opinion of the Pacers' talent level and how they could have been utilized."
lol he was 6'10'' in the draft. guys be shrinking.   [http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Bam-Adebayo-72747/](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Bam-Adebayo-72747/)

"LOL I didn't even think about that double edge statement  Me too, and I don't even like Ben Simmons that much, but Bam def doesn't take the All Star spot over him  P.S. Also Ben Simmons vs Bam Adebayo is like the weirdest comparison to begin with"
Ben Simmons is a more impactful player on a better team than Bam Adebayo.
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don‚Äôt think Chris really belongs here, but I think he‚Äôll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he‚Äôs my pick to make it."
"Has to hurt that you guys passed up on Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell and Dearron fox for him, but hindsight is 20/20"
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
But did you know Bam Adebayo has more assist per game than Brandon Ingram?
"Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo. my opinion is not biased what so ever  In all seriousness though they will lock you up and throw way the key"
"Surprised he wasn't mentioned - Bam Adebayo. Dude's a center who guards 1 through 5 - ideal modern player. His glaring defensive weakness would be against taller and heavier low post players. He's only 6' 9"" and there are times when you'd see him struggle with tall and strong guys down there.     On offense, he leans more (at least for now) towards being a facilitator/hub. When he has the ball, it's almost obvious that he wants to pass it. Scoring is secondary with a wet midrange. He can pound it and bully his way inside, but he rarely does it."
LaVine $19 mil   OG Anunoby $3.8   LeBron $39.1  AD: $32.7  Bam Adebayo $5.1
"I‚Äôm not trying to hate on Randle, and I think he‚Äôs closer to too 30, but since I already did 19 players I‚Äôll keep going:  Curry, KD, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, AD, Kawhi, George, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, Paul, Kyrie, Beal, Vucevic, KAT, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion, Zach Lavine, Trae Young, SGA, Luka,  Bam Adebayo  That‚Äôs 28, there‚Äôs probably some players that are slipping my mind right now. But that puts him right around top 30, like I said. Idk about 36th though, unless we start counting guys that are out like Klay Thompson, Nurkic, CJ, etc."
Bartholomew ‚ÄúBam‚Äù Adebayo
Bam Adebayo and it's not even close. He's on a similar level as an offensive player and is much better defensively. He has far more playoff value because of his defensive advantage.
"Bam Adebayo has a career usage rate of 19.1%, should we discount his whole career? Shut yo ass up"
Bam Adebayo
Bam Adebayo.
"Bill Russell would be like the ideal center now, Bam Adebayo has already shown what a Bill Russell might look like in the modern NBA"
"I mean, Bill Russell was at least as athletic as Bam Adebayo is and he was an awesome passer. if he was born in 1997, he'd be a star level player growing up with a modern skillset. he didn't ask to be born in like the 30s when no one had any idea what made efficient basketball players."

"To be fair, it was MVP candidate Joel Embiid versus DPOY candidate Bam Adebayo."
"Bam ""Marc G"" Adebayo"
&gt;Bam Adebayo making a push for that DPOY late in the season.  No he's not but he's clearly one of the best in the league and a favorite for the award next yr
"Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, and Bam Adebayo are the top 3 right now imo, and then I'd give an honorable mention to Jimmy Butler.  Edit: And another honorable mention to Giannis and Embiid."
"Potential MVP candidate Joel Embiid vs NOT DPOY candidate Bam Adebayo: 1/4, 2 points, 2 turnovers"
Bam Adebayo &gt; Ben Simmons  And it aint even close
"In my opinion, NBA Draft 2017 has a lot of potential MVPs. 3 players have great chance and potential to become MVP - Tatum, Mitchell and Fox (yes, I'm serious). I also see serious potential for becoming MVP at Bam Adebayo and OG Anunoby. I believe in these guys."
"Maybe they need a Zion injury again :)  But they might need to get a bit lucky. Guys like Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Myles Turner, Jusuf Nurkiƒá, Clint Capela have all been picked in that range in recent years. We'll see."
So are Bam Adebayo and Draymond Green? Each missed 5 games and are nowhere even close
"Randle is a lock over Jimmy because narrative and carrying a worse team to a the same record, without having DPOY candidate Bam Adebayo who might just make All NBA as a center if Embiid is counted as a forward."
"I mean and [rim defense and several other things as well](https://craftednba.com/players/clint-capela).  [Bam is absolutely more versatile](https://craftednba.com/players/bam-adebayo) defensively and that is where he providers a ton of value. However Clint is straight up better at rim protection and contesting shots at the rim and blocks. Clint has had a better year defensively than Bam.  Obviously offensively Bam is the better player with his ability to facilitate and score from mid range as Clint is very limited there.  Clint makes up for some of that by being extremely elite on the glass and getting a lot of extra possessions for the Hawks.  Obviously over the long run teams would take Bam because of his versatility, but It isn't that weird to say Clint has had a better year this year."

"Nate McM fit the roster a lot more than Nate Bjorkgren does imo. Brogdon is slow, our frontcourt is slow, Caris isn't exactly a dynamic transition player either.  I think the New Nate has made plenty of mistakes trying to play weird trap happy blitzing defenses with a bunch of slow footed players that are mediocre defenders individually. He's tried to gimmick his way out of it. However, Old Nate was stubborn af in his tenure as a Pacer. This stubbornness allowed the team to have an identity though, which is huge to me.   It was a mix of the three: roster, coaching, and health.  Again, I never called for McMillan being fired, until after watching the Miami series and hearing him say several times that Bam Fcking Adebayo was the switch they were hunting to guard Malcolm Brogdon. After dozens of failed attempts at this, I was ready almost ready for something new. Even then still gave him benefit of the doubt, until reports came out of players also being disgruntled by lack of flexibility.  He's a very good coach, but has his flaws. He's still in the 2nd/3rd tier though. No need for this BS about an org that saw him for years being dead wrong and ignorant. It wasn't a good fit, even if he got more out of them at times than was expected nationally."
Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo are officially the owners of the Boston Celtics.
Bam Adebayo was robbed by this metric
"BAM will win it in the next seasons , he is awesome   ### 3. Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat  [Last week‚Äôs Ladder](https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-sizing-up-dpoys-impact-on-title-chances): 3  Here‚Äôs an indication of Adebayo‚Äôs defensive versatility: In its game notes highlighting the 23-year-old‚Äôs prowess at that end, the Heat talk about his success against guards, limiting them to 38.9% shooting this season, including 31.8% on 3-pointers. Among the players held below their usual production when Adebayo has been matched up with them ‚Äì per NBA.com tracking info ‚Äì have been Steph Curry (1-of-5), Bradley Beal (1-of-7), Devin Booker (3-of-11), Kyrie Irving (4-of-14) and LeBron James (2-of-8)."
"Not when we have Bam ""fuck the nets"" Adebayo."
"Yea I think he‚Äôs just playing fast and loose with the rules to get those he feels are most deserving on all the NBA and Defense teams.  I just noticed this in reading it again as I skimmed through it the first time around:  ‚ÄúFor example, Embiid is eligible at forward despite playing 99.9 percent of his minutes as the lone big on the floor. Since he is eligible, I would love to put him on the first team to match my MVP ballot. That‚Äôd also slide Gobert up to the second team. But I can‚Äôt do it because it would mean removing one of my current forward- or guard-eligible selections for a third-team center. Capela, Adebayo, and Karl-Anthony Towns are all worthy of consideration, but there are a number of players I‚Äôd select ahead of them.‚Äù  I agree with this take. If you move Embiid to forward than one of the two forwards on the 3rd team, PG or Tatum would get bumped for one of the centers he mentioned. I think PG and Tatum are both more worthy of 3rd team than Capela, Bam or KAT.  You see on the All-Defense team he has Bam as a forward too. He essentially has four centers on the two All-Defense teams, five if you consider Draymond a center. I think this makes sense too as centers typically have the biggest defensive impact."
The heat Skill boost: Herro Idk but yeah Size boost: Bam Adebayo I think he already should be a DPOY candidate and adding 3 inches to him would make him amazing  Athleticism boost:MAN IDK BASKETBALL UHHH JIMMY BUTLER

"Bam ""The Miami Player"" Adebayo"
No they do not.  Bam Adebayo lmao...shut your ass up
"After having looked through r/nba more than I had before, I noticed a trend of a disproportionate amount of attention going to Jokic and Doncic. However, I also noticed crazy amounts of attention going to guys like Anthony Edwards. Overall, I think that the sub has a bunch of players it really likes to focus on, but I‚Äôm now more inclined to agree that skin color plays a role in determining those players. It‚Äôs my fault I got overly defensive. I just wasn‚Äôt expecting this sort of thing in this sub. I‚Äôve seen people make a big deal over players being white, like Steven A. Smith making a big deal about ‚Äúthose two white dudes‚Äù on the Heat, or an article I saw somewhere that ranked the best white players in basketball while claiming it wasn‚Äôt just Republican, white nationalist propaganda, but I didn‚Äôt think that there were fans like that. I try to determine a player‚Äôs merit only based on their stats and quality of play, unless they‚Äôre a Heat player. If Bam Adebayo was a top 10 NBA player, I would constantly be calling him MVP. I still think he needs more DPOY consideration."
"Bam Adebayo&gt; Ben simmons. The maximum Ben Simmons would be is a athletic draymond green (Not a slight), but that's his ceiling at the moment."
"Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Hakeem Olajuwon, Sabonis, Lamar Odom, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis, Andrea Bargnani, Boris Diaw, Nikola Jokic, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony-Towns, Bam Adebayo, Rasheed Wallace, Kevin Love, Nikola Vucevic and more all have fadeaway jumpers in their bag."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."

This is called a conversation, and normal people participate in it every day.  I‚Äôm just imagining a group of friends talking about who would win in a fight, Spider-Man or Batman and you coming careening in rolling your eyes and swearing because that could never happen cuz they‚Äôre canonically different comics companies and that‚Äôs sacrilege to talk about.  &gt; It‚Äôs like the heat saying they woulda won the series if bosh never got blood clots.  Which would... not be an invalid argument?  &gt; You were favored anyway - expected to win the series. So idk how you can say you woulda won if Hayward was in when on paper you were supposed to win anyway.  This is a child‚Äôs logic. What? You don‚Äôt know how I can say we would‚Äôve won if we had our third best player when we were supposed to win without our third best player? Is your argument that no matter how much better the Celtics got, because they already lost when they were favored, they were DESTINED to lose the series and a 20ppg All-Star would have had zero effect on the series outcome?  If Bam Adebayo had gotten injured game 1 of the playoffs and then you lost in 6 to the Celtics, where three of your losses were less than 4 points, you would be well within reason to say ‚Äúwe would‚Äôve won if we had healthy Bam all series‚Äù.  This is wild. I‚Äôm more than happy to have a long thread where you get downvoted for being weird and I get upvoted for being right if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôd like this to go. I‚Äôd discuss that your opinion and perspective might garner upvotes but I don‚Äôt want to trigger you with a hypothetical."
"This is the exact type of comment I resent.  The Heat were 6th in the east last season and ended up going to the finals.   This season we were ravaged by COVID early, and ended up losing a bunch of games as Duncan Robinson was our best player available through that stretch.   And yes, we‚Äôre 6th in the East. But the last time that happened we made the finals.    Randle is getting up a lot of shots and the Knicks are still ranked 20th on offense. He is by no means a bad offensive player but is clearly not the best offensive player on a championship roster.   That he leaves his defense and playmaking to do a lot of work, and Bam is a way better defender, and a moderately better passer and ball-handler. Adebayo is better and anyone from Zach Lowe to Nate Duncan has said as such."

"Winning the series is one thing, but making just the most basic adjustments is another. Like at some point he should have realized along with the rest of us that switching onto and then driving directly at Bam Adebayo every possession wasn't getting us many points, or that spamming Bojan Bogdanovic ISO wasn't a terribly efficient way to play the game."
Nobody is talking about guys like Bam Adebayo. He is a good player but he isn't carry your team to a championship or even the playoffs by himself. We are talking about MVP caliber players. Embiid was the favorite to win MVP this year until he got hurt. The type of guys that massively impact winning in the NBA. We can just got over the last MVP's and their draft order.   Going back 38 years you have 4 guys taken outside of the top 10. Even if you change it to outside the top 5 it's only 7 guys.   * Giannis - 15 * Harden - 3 * Westbrook - 4 * Curry - 7 * Durant - 2 * LeBron - 1 * Rose - 1 * Kobe - 13 * Dirk - 9 * Nash - 15 * KG - 5 * Duncan - 1 * Iverson - 1 * Shaq - 1 * Malone - 13 * MJ - 3 * Robinson - 1 * Hakeem - 1 * Barkely - 5 * Magic - 1 * Bird - 6 *
"Who won: Chris. This feels like the best combination of roles. True playmaker, two defend-and-defer guys who aren't useless on offense, pure scorer, and a two-way guy. Malik's team is gonna be ass on defense, Simon's team is alright but a little weak defensively (with Simmons being the only average or positive defender on the whole thing), Nate's team has worse spacing than the 2019-2020 76ers, Sasha's team is solid but I have serious doubts about a Trae/Fox backcourt due to defensive issues, and there may be too many mouths to feed on offensive.    What I would do with the same graphic:   PG: LaMelo Ball, $2  SG: SGA, $3  SF: Mikal Bridges, $1  PF: Zion Williamson, $5  C: Bam Adebayo, $3."
"* Zion Williamson and **Chris Paul**. CP3's playmaking can help open the floor for Zion, and he won't be taking shots away from him like other ball-dominant guards. Also, the lobs would be fun. Bam Adebayo is another good option, a solid secondary playmaker who can cover for Zion's defensive limitations thanks to his versatility.  * LaMelo Ball and **Nikola Jokic**. LaMelo has thrived this year thanks to Hornets' ball-sharing system, which lets him function as a playmaker and an off-ball threat. Jokic is the perfect fit for that, even if Melo/Jokic would be serviceable at best on defense. Of course, if Melo-Jokic pick and pops aren't your speed, Melo-Zion would also be fun, again because of lobs.  * Tyrese Haliburton and **Damian Lillard**. Hali doesn't iso a lot, usually having others set up his shots for him, but is a great playmaker. Dame can create his own shot with ease, but isn't a spectacular playmaker, and can be worn down if he has to have the ball in his hands on every possession. The strengths perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Hali and Steph would also be a really fun pairing, or Hali and Jimmy Butler."

ok I'll bring up other players from their class. Bam Adebayo a center shoots 5.7 FTA per game and is shooting 80%.
"I'll happily take the clowning and getting called a nephew, I just wanted to have a discussion about it.  I don't view Rudy as a bad defender overall. I think he's the best rim protector in the league, which is super important for so many reasons. I don't view him as the best defender in the NBA. I said I was playing Devil's advocate after all. Going along with that I also don't even view Ben as the best overall defender in the NBA because he's not a great rim protector.   I think players like Draymond, Embiid and Adebayo (Also AD) are so much better than the rest of the field in terms of defensive impact/versatility that anyone else being mentioned for DPOY other than those 3 is, IMO, stupid. Those players are not an easy bucket at any spot on the floor, and each of them deserve a 1st team all defense nod.  Ben is insane at guarding 1-4, Gobert is insane in terms of his rim protection. I think both of them are the best at what they do. Ben needs to get better at protecting the rim and Gobert needs to not get targeted in the PnR/Switches before I consider either of them the best defender in the NBA. But that's the narrative right now.  If I need the best perimeter defender in the NBA right now it's Ben, if I need the best rim protector, it's Rudy.  If I need a versatile 4/5 who can guard multiple positions, not get abused in mismatches and lead a top defense it's one of Dray/Embiid/Bam. AD should also be in that conversation dude is fucking nuts on defense when he's locked in.  If that makes me a nephew then I guess I'm a nephew."
"Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown:  A combined 51/13/8 with 5.4 turnovers on 57.8% TS and 58.6% TS respectively  Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo:  40/16/12 with 4.8 turnovers on 60.1% TS and 62.6% TS respectively, with better defense.   Scoring at high volume isnt everything guys, Bam and Jimmy generate the same amount of offense with better efficiency, rebounding, and defense."
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."

Theyre both better than Bam Adebayo
Bam Adebayo
the best i can think is Bam Adebayo. so if Giannis keeps creating more points away from the basket teams are going to have to rethink their rosters
"I'm gonna be honest I see your points but I'll explain something. It'll be a bit long so bear with me. If you are defending a player like Dame, If you foul him in the clutch what's the chances he makes every free throw? Imo pretty high. So ofc you can't stand too close. PG knows this when he guards most players. So ofc he gives them a bit of space. Not too much to a point where its disrespectful but where he can contest without fouling. That however is too much space for a player like Dame. Also I never said he was a better defender than kawhi, I'd rather have kawhi guarding down the stretch too. And I'll be honest. I don't think pgs defense was that good while on the pacers. It was just kind of average. And Adebayos block was clutch but when a player drives on an elite shot blocker we know what to expect. PGs guarding a shot. Bam adebayo didn't follow JT. JT came to him(which imo as a celtics fan was not a smart idea) so bam was in position. However on the k love one I will admit that was great defense."
"Third Team: Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Shaq  Fourth Team: Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  Fifth Team: Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Jason Tatum, Zion Willamson, Bam Adebayo"
How'd it feel getting your dunk blocked by bam adebayo in the ECF?
Bam Adebayo got sent to the Mariana Trench by Onyeka Okongwu but keep talking ur shit brother
This is so true. He goes up for a lot of soft layups despite having the length of a Bam Adebayo and a 36 inch vertical
"Hey Jajson, how do you turn it on again after that block from Bam Adebayo in the playoffs."
What do you think of Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat?
Hi Jayson - can you describe what went through your head after the Bam Adebayo block in Game 1?
How does it feel to be the son of Bam Adebayo?
"For the 2020 playoffs, he repeatedly tried to isolate Malcolm Brogdon on Bam Adebayo when the Heat were switching. Even though Warren was red-hot, he did not run him off of pin-downs or have him in any off ball action, just isolated at the elbow where Jimmy and Bam could contain him. He also did not try to attack Herro or Duncan Robinson through isolation or PnR, even though we had Oladipo, Brogdon, and Warren (decent isolation players). His lack of offensive sets also ensured that the bench was unplayable, since no one could generate their own offense.  On defense, everyone apart from Myles Turner was out of position. Oladipo esp. kept helping off of Duncan Robinson, and Dragic killed the Pacers when Brogdon went under screens on PnR. He made no schematic changes either, where going to a switching defense would've helped when the guards were chasing Robinson and Herro off of multiple screens. Instead, the guards were left chasing and the team paid the price.  After the playoffs, 4 different players went to management asking for him to be fired (Brogdon the chief among them). I can't say anything about his success in Atlanta, but his firing from Indiana was well-deserved and long overdue."

"He really is ""small"" for a big, clocking in at 6'9"" to 6'10"". Bam Adebayo is a good comparison size-wise.  &amp;#x200B;  Dude averaged 17.9 points and 12.9 rebounds from 2006 to 2018 (age 20 to 32) for 953 games. He has had a couple of major injuries as well. At age 35, he's right on track for the usual regression for big men. It does not help that the league has significantly change since he entered it. I'd say, he hangs on pretty great despite his stylistic limitations. If we allow him to continue with those embarrassing post ups of his as a centerpiece, he'd prolly still average around 15 and 10. Remember, in 2017-2018, he was still averaging 16.6 and 12.5."
Bam Adebayo is definitely a top 5 center
"I got you. I‚Äôll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
"The Knicks are currently at the end of their rebuild and starting to contend.. why the hell would you give up your star player that is leading your team, just entering his prime, for a down grade and some Picks???  None of those picks are getting you a lebron or a KD so you don‚Äôt do it.. not with the momentum and potential to be a real playoff contender with Randle on the team.   The Knicks won‚Äôt be able to trade for a superstar until their reputation gets cleared and you need Randle for that...  What would you do then? Dump your assets to get Cade??? He‚Äôs not helping you win now. You still have to develop him... so no.. you don‚Äôt trade him for bam adebayo and some picks lol"
Who in their right mind would trade Randle for bam adebayo???  Bam has 3 30 point games in his career... Julius Randle has 31 lol   Like why would you think they are comparable???  Julius is winning MIP player this year and will likely end up 5-6 on the mvp voting list.
"Trae Young, Bam Adebayo, Fred VanVleet, Gordon Hayward, Jerami Grant, Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler  There were a lot of really good snubs. Tobias Harris isn't clearly ahead of that pack. Trae Young should have been next up if anything."

"&gt; gobert is a rim runner and AD is a faceup threat plus rim runner.  How are you going to say Bam Adebayo is some exclusively post up player but AD doesn't count cause he's ""a faceup threat plus rim runner.""  You can describe AD that way too...again, you are totally cherry picking who actually counts as a post up player.  If Nurkic is a post up player, Gobert is too.  If Bam is a post up player, AD is too.  This is just a sad attempt at crafting a narrative"

"Are we comparing Nikola Vucevic vs Bam Adebayo? Or are we comparing Kelly Olynyk vs Nerlens Noel?  I think in most cases, you take the defensively versatile big because that's easier to build around. But in some cases (teams like the Bucks or Lakers), the stretch big might be the better option."
"Eliminating the Nuggets from playoff contention, giving them a lottery pick they might have missed otherwise, as they won their last two games. I believe Portland held the tiebreaker over Denver, but Portland also could have easily lost to San Antonio the next night - as it stands they only won by 1 point.  In 2017 draft, the Nuggets got Donovan Mitchell with their lottery pick. Various advanced stats place Mitchell as the 2nd to 4th best player from that draft so far. Portland, meanwhile, won just as many playoff games as Denver that year, but ended up with Justin Jackson, who has had a rather lackluster career thus far.  The only players of roughly similar value to Mitchell picked after him are Bam Adebayo (who was picked by the late-lottery Heat and thus unavailable to any playoff team), John Collins, and Jarrett Allen.  Westbrook's 35 foot dagger was a building block in the future of the Nuggets."
They‚Äôve got Marc Gasol on here but not Bam Adebayo. Their algorithm is drunk.
"All jokes aside, Jacob is Bam Adebayo, kills the Jimmy Butler Man in Black and stuffs him down a chimney or whatever that was, puts a cork in him, and then Jimmy comes back as a cloud of smoke and eats everyone."
I thought it said bam adebayo topless and got excited

any shot involving Bam Adebayo as the on-ball defender is a low percentage shot baby
Took one look at Bam Adebayo and thought ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôll sit this one out‚Äù.
"I know we‚Äôre talking in theory, but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense to negate the physical barriers that exist. Is there such thing as a perfect base? I don‚Äôt think u can have the strength and height that you desire while also having lateral quickness and agility. Since you can‚Äôt have both one must take priority over the other, and in this case the lateral quickness matters more. Players with builds like Giannis and bam adebayo won‚Äôt do as well as the physical base of tony Allen. That is the entire point that I‚Äôm driving.   If Giannis being a kd defender is only possible under imaginary circumstances that can‚Äôt exist(him having the lateral quickness u said he doesn‚Äôt have to while also maintaining the strength and height), then he isn‚Äôt a perfect kd defender even in theory. Tony Allen has the perfect base to stop kd in my opinion, if they are going one on one on the perimeter."

"So my dear Casual nephew, as I told  Here the results   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard  https://mobile.twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1404574866418900999"
"The Giannis issue seems relatively easy to fix. He is an opportunistic scorer, he is not striking fear to his opponents when played straight up (unlike say a certain Durant guy or another Steph guy).   Meaning that the more he holds the ball when *no opening exists* the worse his team is. A proper Milwaukee offense should always search for him in case he has an opening (because if he does it is something like a 80% score, or sth equally ridiculous) but then have him *immediately* getting rid of it if there is no opening. Him forcing things is an ugly thing to watch, it offends my (basketball) senses. Basically you need more playmakers. Jrue is good but not elite and Middleton is not a very good ball handler.  One extra issue with Ky's injury is that I won't get to see Giannis under Pitino. They are playing team Canada late this month and Canada plays full strength, basically a proper NBA team (sans Murray for understandable reason). An ... accidental deep run from the Bucks means that we are going to see more Giannis under Bud (and I think we had enough of that for one season, at least I did) and less Giannis under Pitino.  I have no shadow of doubt that Pitino would have played him Center in a sort of Bam Adebayo role. I think he would have shined and basically show the blueprint of how Giannis should be played now that he is north of the 250 pounds range... but again a deep Milwaukee run means that Pitino won't get to coach Giannis in late June (at least we will see Doncic in a slightly different role, so *that* would be interesting. Probably Jokic too :p)"
"Giannis is averaging 30 (on great efficiency if you discount the dumb 3s) in this series. It was Bam Adebayo against the Heat that was indeed giving him trouble. Only 23.5 on bad 2p %...  Apart from game 2 he is not having trouble when he is playing his game (i.e. do not shoot stupid 3s). His finishing is as top notch as ever, I don't know what people see."
oh no better not sign giannis we have bam adebayo
"This post is pretty dumb and he is not getting traded, but for the sake of arguing, let me see if I can take a stab at naming some players that may be similarly valued...don't bite my head off if you disagree.  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Bam Adebayo  Donovan Mitchell (maybe a little more valuable)  Christian Wood  Zach LaVine"
IDK what was up but they were all sweating like crazy. Bam Adebayo had it the worst that I saw.

"&gt; Had one all star on their team who was also the lone all-NBA player that season.  I can see this happening now for the same reason it happened in 2004 - a team starting very slow record-wise and getting no All-Star love.  We saw Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo miss the all-star game this season because of their team's record in the first half of the season, and that trio plus another borderline all-star (the Pistons had 4) would definitely contend."
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
"Yeah it‚Äôs because of Trae Young, not the versatile two-way center who averaged 16 points, 11 rebounds and 4 blocks on 57% FG and 43% 3PT in the playoffs against Bam Adebayo lol."
"By the time Jokic was 3 years in the NBA he was putting up 18/11/6 on 32mpg at 22 years old.  RW3 is 23 and in his third year putting up 8/7/2 on 19 mpg.   I agree MPG doesn't tell a whole story, but don't try to compare RW3 situation to Jokic's. Jokic proved in his first couple seasons that no one deserved to be played over him. RW3 couldn't take the job from Theis.  I'm not trying to say RW3 is a bum or anything. Solid player and will probably be a good player for the Celtics for years to come. But saying he has the value to be the centerpiece of a superstar trade is delusional. Bam Adebayo isn't even good enough to be a centerpiece in a superstar trade and he is far better player in a similar mold as RW3."
"Draymond and Adebayo can guard anyone 1-5 incredibly well, just because they're best offensively at the 4 or 5 doesn't mean they are best there defensively. Bam has had Bradley Beal and Steph Curry as his main assignment and done very well.   Simmons, Draymond, and Bam can all guard any person in the NBA about as good as anyone, Jimmy can guard smaller players very well, as well as anything up to smaller 4's, while being one of the best in the league at attacking passing lanes, and Gobert puts the paint into complete lockdown, while being well above average at guarding the perimeter for a center."
"For more hot takes, further down the draft class there's Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Kyle Kuzma"
Let‚Äôs also be reminded that the Pistons drafted Kennard right before Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo was selected.

"Because he *is* far better in the playoffs than people think, under a more competent coach nobody would think that he has bad series most often than not. He was never played off the floor, even in his bad games he was elite defensively. Merely the guy is a small ball 5 playing playmaker (i.e. out of position in most matchups) which costs his effectiveness greatly.  Giannis as a 5 would terrorize opposing defenses, especially ones without a dominant big, he's more akin to a Bam Adebayo on steroids (complete with his lack of shooting).  A lot of the Bucks' woes is explained by the way Bud chooses to build his system. There is barely any movement offensively and they give up 3s defensively. It is unworkable.  Given that they are no match to the Nets I hope they get swept and we get a chance to see how coach Pitino will play Giannis in the Olympic qualifiers.   IMO we may get a chance to see a better use of his prowess (Pitino has his own drawbacks as a coach, but he is way more tried and successful than Bud, so Giannis + a better coach might give us a glimpse of how things could be)."
Thybulle is so overrated. He‚Äôs a good defender but he‚Äôs already 24 and has 0 offensive game  Just for reference he‚Äôs older than Bam Adebayo and OG Anunoby also
Have fun with aging Butler who can't shoot and Bam 'Ben Simmons at center' Adebayo
Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo
"Such a dumb question to begin with. This team would go for a 48-0 3-peat and win every game by 30 points:  Donovan Mitchell  CJ McConnel  Paul George  Bam Adebayo  Karl Anthony Towns  Bench: Dragic, Robert Covington, Nurkic  So I guess Paul George (or whoever you pick) is capable of being the best player on the greatest dynasty ever"
I cry every time I think about drafting Zach Collins over Bam Adebayo.
"if shelling out huge contracts for Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Moe Harkless and Meyers Leonard won't do it, or drafting Zach Collins over Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, John Collins and Derrick White won't do it, this asinine shit is fine.  How does this MFer still have a job?"
"That's too bad.  This year's USA team could've been one of best one they had:    PG Steph Curry (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Dame Lillard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Chris Paul (has shoulder injury, might skip if Suns plays deep in the playoffs)    SG James Harden (has hamstring injury, prbly want to rest it)   SG Paul George (might skip if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)    SF Kawhi Leonard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet, but might want to rest his legs if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)   SF Kevin Durant (would prbly skip to prevent overworking so soon after his achilles injury)    PF LeBron James (prbly skip to promote his movie and heal up)   PF Anthony Davis (injured)   C Bam Adebayo (would likely play)      C Myles Turner (still injured?)"

"Yes.  This so much.  Olshey had made some great moves and his team is very good at evaluating guard talent, but Portland's forward situation has been abysmal since we lost LMA and Batum.    The 2016 offseason and the 2017 draft are the core reasons for the situation we're in.  The 2017 draft is just crushing.  It isn't his fault that Zach Collins has been perpetually injured, and Collins could have been a good player, but the decision to trade up 2-for-1 for him was questionable at the time.  That was a deep draft and they list of players we missed out on is absurd.  With the 10th pick (we traded 15 and 20 for it) we could have had Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo.  With 15 we could have had John Collins, who many perferred to Zach Collins.  With 20 we could have had Jerrett Allen or OG Anunoby.  WIth 26 we drafted Swanigan when we could have had Kuzma, Derrick White, or Josh Hart.    This was the last draft where we had any serious draft capital.  We got lucky with GTJ in 2018 (again, Olshey's people are good at evaluating guards).  2019 was thin late in the draft (though we might have been able to trade up a few spots for Clarke or Thybulle).  No FRPs in 2020.  Going into 2017 with 3 FRPs and walking away with basically nothing is the biggest source of Portland's problems right now.  Much more than coaching on a team that really only has 2 playable forwards."
I‚Äôll take one bam Adebayo please
"AD out there just being Bam Adebayo rn, just getting the ball and passing it, not looking to score, dude looks like he can barely move, get him the hell outta there."
"True, I guess I feel like there's a chance ownership decides that the Butler + Adebayo combo hit its ceiling last year and would retool around Bam for the future"
"CJ + Picks + assets (Nassir Little maybe) for Jimmy Butler, Heat might think the Butler + Bam combo hit its ceiling last year and want to retool around Adebayo for the future"
"There really isn‚Äôt anything problematic on what Riley said.   &gt; Asked if Bam Adebayo needs to immediately become an effective three-point shooter to increase the list of power rotation options who could be added to play with him, Riley said:  &gt; ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt need to happen quickly. Spo likes to use Bam with a stretch five or four. You might have to change. You might have to think about what‚Äôs next thing in the NBA to require you to stay with that kind of play. I‚Äôll leave that to Spo and we will talk about it. ‚Äú  &gt; Riley said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a possibility‚Äù of playing Adebayo with another traditional big but ‚Äúwhen it comes to what coach Spo is going to do when he pairs a front line together, it will be situational. These are questions that can be answered later on by him and what‚Äôs out there.  &gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a possibility it could be big/big or possibility it could be similar to what you have in the past. If the impact of that pairing doesn‚Äôt impact winning, and you‚Äôre not winning at a high level, that‚Äôs something you have to think about.‚Äù  &gt; Riley acknowledged that ‚Äúwe got outrebounded incredibly bad‚Äù against Milwaukee.  &gt; ‚ÄúSpo has to evaluate how he uses Bam. Bam is one of our primary ball-handlers, gets us into offense. Sometimes there is a disconnect between running offense and really being effective as an offensive player."
I saw someone one time say a better rebounding Bam Adebayo and I think that could be accurate
Ben Wallace would be a better Bam Adebayo
"1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14. Michael Porter Jr. 15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young  I love Trae, but this list isn't absurd.   There's a few positions I would change but a lot of those guys don't have the physical limitations Trae does.  I do think, just like many others on this list, Trae has HoF potential."
Their other option is struggling to reach .500 for the next few years with Bam Adebayo being backed up by Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson
"that‚Äôs not how you improve at 3‚Äôs though, there‚Äôs plenty of players like Bam Adebayo that can hit 3‚Äôs at an ok rate in practice but its still not a good idea to take them in game"
"Bam ""Naruto"" Adebayo"
"Ah yes, name value. That‚Äôs how the playoffs work. That‚Äôs why Giannis beat the piss out of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo last year. That‚Äôs why Durant and Westbrook won all those titles. That‚Äôs why the 2004 Lakers are the greatest team of all time.  Those were good teams. They were good teams in the regular season and they were good teams in the playoffs until they played LeBron. Yeah he never had a 2016 Warriors/Spurs/OKC shitshow to deal with but the PG Pacers and Lowry/DeRozan Raptors are exactly the kinds of teams that I would expect to be challenging the conference favourites most years."

"I think that you are wrong. Brooklyn do not have the size that the 2019 raptors or 2020 Heat. To stop Giannis at the rim, you have to build a wall but you can not just build a wall with Blake griffin. They do not have good centers like Bam Adebayo that can stop Giannis from dunking.  Giannis can score a lot of points in that series."
"Weird if they did, though.  *Bam Adebayo will enjoy the crude hospitality of our locker room and never go free unless you make this a seven-game series!*"

Bam Adebayo
Maybe talk to Denver about swapping Michael Porter Junior for Bam Adebayo. Miami gets a talented versatile scorer who struggles defensively. Nuggets get a defensive forward who can guard centers as needed and play make on offensive.
"1 of those things got corrected. The sad one, unfortunately.  I just keep thinking about Jimmy ""Locked in"" Butler and Bam "" Gotta be more aggressive x999"" Adebayo. Love those guys but sure sounds like bullshit right now"
Hes a lot closer to bam adebayo than he is to either of those guys
Bam Adebayo better
You're bringing out a side of bam adebayo
"Bam ‚ÄúShuffle, shuffle, elbow‚Äù Adebayo"
"*Finally, the last minute of the game*, thought Jimmy Butler as he received a quick inbound from his trusty big, Bam Adebayo. *This is where I excel.*      Jimmy dribbled down the court and glanced around at the mass of Heat fans cheering his name. He smirked and reached towards a small sack tied around his waist by a simple string. He dug his hand into the plump pouch and grab a hand full of its contents.      *South Beach sand.* He takes it everywhere he goes. Jimmy, while dribbling, brought the sand to his nose and wafed the smell. Ah yes! That smell! He could sense the gulf shore breeze in each granule. It was the perfect smell to remind him of his destiny, to be one with Heat culture. He dreamt of this moment.       He ritualistically blew the sand out of his palm and all over the NBA court; the crowd went **wild**. Jimmy then began squaring up his defender, Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis was a large man, that was certainly the case, but Giannis lacked one critical factor.      *Tyler Herro.* Jimmy quickened his moves. Right, left, right, left. Giannis had no chance. Butler approached the 3-point line and whipped the ball over to Herro, ready at the corner for the 3.       Routine catch-and-shoot from one of the bubble‚Äôs biggest breakout stars, Herro collected the pass with style and immediately jumped for the release. He flicked his iced wrist; tiny South Beach sand grains sprinkled out from underneath his fingernails.      *An S-tier release*, noticed Jimmy Butler. He gazed as the ball achieved a beautiful arc over the Bucks‚Äô defense. Jimmy turned and began his shift to defense. *Herro had too much drip to miss--*      Clank!      Jimmy spun around to see that the ball had smacked the front of the rim and was hurtling toward him. He nabbed the ball, eyeing the shot clock. 14 seconds. They were down by 1. He squared up Giannis again. The sand he had previously blown onto the court was now crunching underneath his shoes. *Down to the wire*.   Sure, It was surprising to see that Herro had missed, but it didn‚Äôt matter anyway. The Heat just needed to bring Jimmy to the playoffs. They needn‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôll handle the rest.      He darted towards the basket, worming his way around Giannis. Bucks‚Äô center Brook Lopez slid into the lane. Jimmy juked outside, spun, and jumped. A mid-range attempt.      *I‚Äôm stupidly locked in.*      \[Game Ended. Milwaukee Bucks Defeat Miami Heat 4-0 in series sweep\]"
"Yea my bad, I‚Äôm sure bam ‚Äúcan‚Äôt create his own shot‚Äù Adebayo and Tyler ‚Äúhood tendencies‚Äù herro will develop into stars/superstars before Jimmy ‚Äústupidly locked in‚Äù butler and goron ‚Äúdirty pos‚Äù dragic are too old..."
I remember a heat fan made a post on here about how Bam Adebayo was better than Embiid and Simmons put together lmao  Like they are usually just being assholes   HAGS
Count how long brook Lopez stays in the paint without having bam adebayo within arms reach   Hint:  it‚Äôs more than 3 seconds
"Jimmy ""Bubble God"" Butler has been missing, Tyler ""Better than Harden"" Herro and Bam ""Giannis Stopper"" Adebayo has been doing good though"

At least drop a name  Bam Adebayo
"or Bam Adebayo, works for both"
"Bam "" I refuse to shoot"" adebayo. It's actually ridiculous now. We are 3-0 down just try an open your offence just a little ffs"
I see Bam Adebayo still is missing this series.

If anyone on the heat deserves that title it's probably Adebayo.  Good player but the thought of Bam isn't quite the reality yet.

"ESPN loves Bam Adebayo, which is fine of course - he is the man.  His team does a great job of hyping him up and giving the right media people access to him.  It's like Zach Lowe had a slumber party with Bam and his friends and now he has to do 5 minutes on Bam's greatness on every pod."
"Yeah instead of Pat ""Crackhead"" Beverly we have Bam ""BAM"" Adebayo and instead of mr. LeBron coached me to the Finals its Erik Spoelstra and the Godfather. Thats a real upgrade for Kawhi"

"He might have a shot if Tyler ""Snarl Boy"" Herro and Bam ""Giannis Stopper"" Adebayo shows up"
"Jimmy Butler had scored half of the Heat‚Äôs points for almost the entire first half then disappeared in the second. Heat‚Äôs offense is awful post-Dragic and Herro injuries. They get absolutely killed on offensive rebounds. Someone needs to file a missing persons report on Bam Adebayo. They better hope to get Lowry or somehow Kawhi for next season. At this point, I just feel bad for Heat fans."
Bam Adebayo? more like Damn HisSkillsSaidByeYo   \-- Twitter
"Jimmy, Adebayo and Hero having considerable worse performances. Crowder not being properly replaced as as a primary defender to Giannis so thay Bam, Iggy, etc could crowd the paint, this ended up in Bledsoe or Brook taking the shot. Dragic was amazingo. Bucks made good trades, Middleton closes and adjustments actually being made."
From Tyler Herro to Tyler Zerro   From Bam Adebayo to Bum Adebayo   Who else next?
He went from Bum Adebayo back to Bam
While Bam Adebayo is an amazing player.... he isn't a 2nd superstar that will take over games for you.
Do we add a moving screen counter every bam adebayo offense
"[Magic Johnson]: The Miami Heat need to play better! Specifically, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, Udonis Haslem, Coach Spo, Pat Riley, their fans"
Bam Adebayo should be prosecuted for robbery
Seen a lot of hooplah about this Bam Adebayo guy. I don‚Äôt see star potential tbh
"Every one does it. If you watch Bam Adebayo closely, every single screen he sets are moving screens. Warriors build a dynasty on illegal screens."
"*Looks at Bam Adebayo*  Lol, that‚Äôs cute you think those screens are bad."
"Whatever the solution is so Bam Adebayo gets the respect he deserves in regards to DPOY, then I‚Äôm all for it."
"Maybe the Nets are just a real-life KOT4Q rebuild experiment, they just gotta get Alec Burks for the asset value and a dump truck of picks to Flip em for like Bam Adebayo"
"If that player were Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons, Giannis or Bam Adebayo I'd give them a chance, if it has to be someone else from their roster that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.  Also the Celtics need a 6th player on offense, preferably Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic or Damian Lillard"
Bam Adebayo is 23 years old lol
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
Is that impressive? Any team that adds a star will become a playoff contender. More than half the teams in the league make the playoffs it isn't some noteworthy achievement.    Lol Jimmy with the Hawks roster last year wouldn't have won 10 games because his offensive in every facet is worse than Trae's and we weren't losing games because of defense.    Jimmy was out there carrying those scrubs of Dragic and Adebayo last year. You sound like a clown man.    As soon as fans are back in the building that man folded. His greatest achievement outside of some fluke bubble season is making the 2nd round with the Sixers and getting folded by Kawhi. Dude is the most overrated player in the league. People talk like this man is carrying teams like Lebron is.    Who the fuck gets swept and puts up 14 points on 29% shooting? 36 year old hobbled Lebron still put up 23 points without another star on the court! Jimmy still had Bam and he played like a bum. Fuck outta here.
"Thats not even including Trae Young, Bam Adebayo and Brandon Ingram who were All Stars last year"
"20% chance of a franchise player at each pick (so 40% odds that between the two picks, at least one guy is a real franchise piece) actually represents better odds than I would've guessed offhand. Given that TOR has some of the best scouting &amp; development in the league, the odds are probably better still. Not to mention that Wiseman represents a third (purely development-based) roll of the dice.  Now compare the odds of a positive outcome with the pick(s) and/or Wiseman with the odds of Siakam ever being a core part of a Raptors title run (or even ECF run) again. It's harder to quantify the latter, but I can't really think of any reasonable path for a return to contention for TOR anytime within Siakam's prime. The odds of that are far slimmer than at least one of #7, #14, or Wiseman being as good as Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ, or Julius Randle -- though of course part of getting rolls of the dice is the possibility that you could hit multiple times and have a home run on your hands.  But so what if only one player works out and they're not actually as good as Siakam (or even if it's the rare, total-disaster outcome and TOR bungles all 3 assets)? What great achievement would TOR be potentially missing out on in that scenario? It just doesn't really make much sense to keep Siakam if a team were willing to give good young/draft value for him, and a package like this from GSW would be phenomenal value for him. It'd be an overpay that GSW should absolutely not offer."
"So Bam Adebayo would become ""Mpam Antempayo"" right?"
The best team I could come up with:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Andre Iguodala  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Bam Adebayo
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
Trae young  Jaylen brown   Iggy  Zion  Bam adebayo  Maybe goes against the spirit of your question since all of these guys will probably end with multiple All-stars. But right now it's probably the most talented lineup
Can‚Äôt Bam Adebayo
HERE COMES BAM ADEBAYO
"Stephen Curry was a #7 pick. Bam Adebayo was a #14 pick. The draft is a crapshoot, and with a bit of luck you can get a marquee, franchise-changing player. What's far more certain is that Siakam will not be a core part of anymore Raptors championships."
"The fact that it should have been a flagrant on CP3, and also Booker got away with 3 last game, and 1 obvious one this game. Why would the NBA want to promote giannis over CP3, Dbook, Trae Young, KD, Kyrie,  Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo?"

Daily Discussion Thread : [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules#wiki_daily_discussion_thread)"
"You're very conveniently forgetting Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson, and Bam Adebayo. Also, Towns was born in New Jersey, he could absolutely play for Team USA if he hadn't been essentially scalped at age 16 to play for the DR."
Zach Collins over Bam Adebayo is the 2017 pick that really killed us.
"Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo who is literally on the team.  Just stop bro, I‚Äôm getting secondhand embarrassment."
"You‚Äôre a true Blazers fan that understands the power of Baby Sabonis. He‚Äôs a 2x all star by age 24. He‚Äôs improved with every season. And he‚Äôs on contract for the next 3 years for 50% less than Bam Adebayo, a player with similar value."
"&gt; The second overall pick that was a huge gamble and looked horrible for most of last year?  He still has significant value and can easily be a very good player. You can't say that he doesn't have potential/trade value.  &gt; The late 20s picks are basically second rounders  you sound like every user in the BOS/BKN trade 8 years ago. It's asinine to say that they will be late 20's picks 6 years from now. Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond will be in their late 30s or retired. Dame will be old asf too. Those are valuable unprotected picks.   &gt; Pick 14 is usually a low end starter to good bench player at best  Devin Booker, Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell, SGA, MPJ, Herro etc.,  GSW easily gives you the best offer."
"My friend saying we should've drafted Dante Exam over Joel Embiid on draft night  My roommates dad saying three months ago we should keep Ben Simmons and trade Embiid  ESPN ranking Bam Adebayo over Joel Embiid less than a year ago  Paul Pierce saying he was a better perimeter shooter than Klay Thompson is  On r/sixers last off-season I was downvoted for saying Devin Booker is better than Ben Simmons. Their reasoning for why Ben is better was literally just that he plays defense  My GFs brother, a Mavericks fan, saying at the time of trade that they got the better player in the Josh Richardson/Seth Curry trade  My friend draft night saying that Luka Doncic was gonna bust"
"Ehm, Bam Adebayo?"
"If only the US had Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Bam Adebayo to make up for that."
"Bam Adebayo on replacing Bradley Beal: ""A dude just got Covid. You don't really think about who's next when somebody catches Covid... you think about how they're doing, what's their symptoms and what they're going through."" https://twitter.com/ChaseHughesNBCS/status/1415766819240034310"

"Against the NBA champions, they were the only team to push them that far  Correct me if im wrong but it‚Äôs possible for a team to have 3 max players and solid supporting players. The problem is giving a max to Tobias Harris   You‚Äôre never gonna quantify Simmons impact by counting his PPG, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to with Draymond Green or even Bam Adebayo. Without Simmons defense on Kawhi, his ability to push the ball in transition and play make for others i promise you its would have been over in 5"
I think Bam Adebayo is the only guy I've seen sweat even close to as much as Middleton at least from the face
"That‚Äôs not true. The people who actually hold down the viewership during the regular season want real basketball. The nba is a joke because it caters to casual fans who only want to watch Lebron vs KD or Lebron vs Curry and don‚Äôt know anyone other than superstars.  The NFL for all its faults doesn‚Äôt treat the fans like complete idiots and markets the entire team and more than just the QBs. There‚Äôs a reason Richard Sherman and JJ Watt are household names. In the nba, casuals have no clue who Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Lowry, or Bam Adebayo are despite them being amazing defensive players and with good personalities."
I‚Äôd take Olympic patty mills over bam Adebayo
And there‚Äôs also the fact that for some reason Jerami Grant and Bam Adebayo are on this team.
"To be fair, Bam Adebayo is closer to Nigerian than Okafor and Bam is playing for team USA"

"Already been said, dude needs to be more aggressive. He's too damn good to be taking a measly 13 shot attempts a game. The Heat have Butler, Herro, and Dragic (expecting his role to decrease because old and hurt often) running the offense so I'm expecting Adebayo to be more involved. Maybe 24/10/6 next season.  Sincerely,  Someone who got Bam in fantasy last season"
"It‚Äôs not even just that.  Our stars played like Kentucky Fried Ass.    Kevin Durant, who is hailed as the most unstoppable scorer on the planet, shot 30% from the field against guys who wouldn‚Äôt be dominant in the NCAA.  Bradley Beal, the man who until the last game of the season was giving Stephen Curry a run for his money for the scoring title, shot **14%** from the field.   I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible.  I assumed that if you shot that bad they just stopped counting like Warriors fans do with Draymond, who incidentally was one of the only players who didn‚Äôt play like they wanna be waived next season.    Jerami Grant, 6 points on 6 shots, but I don‚Äôt count him because who the fuck even is this guy and why did he play the same amount of minutes as Bam Adebayo?  If they don‚Äôt put on some Dream Team level shit in the olympics, they along with Popovich should be walking home.  From Tokyo.  Through the ocean."
Giannis is Nigerian and So is Bam Adebayo who played for Team USA today.   The big sports infrastructure deficit is closing up as more families emigrate to the US and Europe.
Bam Adebayo is Nigerian as well.  So its a bunch of Nigerians just taking pics.  We should have brought Giannis too. He is Nigerian
why isn't Bam Adebayo playing for Nigeria?
"Adebayo obviously, but don't forget Bam Bam Bigelow either."
Who‚Äôs the best Bam of all time?  Bam Adebayo?  Bam Margera?  Bam-Bam from the Flinstones?
"About the best chance to stop the death of the big man I'd bet on guys like Bam Adebayo and DeAndre Ayton. Fast, athletic centers. Ayton is the reason why the Suns are going to obliterate the Bucks."
Fair enough. Sounds like a Rudy Gobert mixed with Bam Adebayo. Probably a top 10 NBA player in terms of overall impact in today‚Äôs NBA above and beyond counting stats.   That‚Äôs a bit of a toss-up with Durant if he could be close to Bam‚Äôs lateral quickness.

"You're not necessarily wrong, but you're also overrating the knowledge of a casual fan.   The blame falls on the media for focusing hard on a few household names, focusing harder on anointing young talent without marketing the rest of the teams that are doing well.   The Jazz and the Suns were, record wise, the best and 2nd best in the league for almost half of the season. They did not receive the level of coverage that the Lakers did last season, or the Warriors did any season. The focus for the Suns was all on Chris Paul and even less for anyone on the Jazz not named Mitchell or Gobert.   The opportunities are there for the taking. The narratives are there for writing. The problem is, either it's pride or it's incompetence, the media will not give Devin Booker his respect for proving the previous narratives wrong, and as a result, they won't market him the way they'll market other young stars (Tatum, Zion, Luka). They won't market Ayton the way they'll market a second tier star like Bam Adebayo, Rudy Gobert, even Kuzma and THT get more coverage than Ayton.  It's just extremely lazy journalism and that's why casuals end up tuning out when the actually well-constructed teams with extremely disciplined players make it past the ones who have received all the media hype."

"Probably because he's an American.  I know there's a lot of emphasis on players' parental origins these days, but Bam was born in New Jersey and  went to high school in North Carolina. He grew up with his mother, who is an American. While his dad is Nigerian, in [Bam's own words](https://theundefeated.com/features/miami-heat-bam-adebayo-is-embracing-his-name-and-his-nigerian-heritage/) he wasn't close to his father and his father remained in Nigeria while Bam was growing up. He very much views himself as American.  Plus, he has a much better shot at getting a gold medal if he plays for the US."
"Lebron played well but anyone who watches lebron knows he wasn't even at 80%. Hes lebron of course he can catch lobs with a bad ankle.

You're talking abt Anthony Davis , Mcgee and Dwight Howard vs Bam Adebayo and a bench stretch 5..  Kcp , rondo, Alex Caruso vs dragic, and lebron vs butler   In that match up lakers were Heavy favorites. No one can say suns were favorites against lakers nuggets or clippers if both sides r healthy.

I wonder of that would change of he needed to play 33 minutes a night instead of 20. For me: Best Case: Bam Adebayo Probably: Jarrett Allen Worst Case: Willie Cauley-Stein  You are probably right re intensity though
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs close between him and Bam but then you remember that Bam is 23 and a DPOY candidate who is better at playmaking and doesn‚Äôt need the ball nearly as much as Boogie.   I‚Äôm not sure I could have ever envisioned prime Cousins having a finals run the way Adebayo did. He shut down Giannis and lit up the Celtics while defending multiple positions.   When cousins got to play with Jrue and AD it was just so underwhelming man. He occasionally stuffed the stat sheet but they got much better just replacing him with Mirotic
"Philadelphia's win percentage the last four seasons:  63%, 62%, 59% and 68%.  Across those four seasons Embiid missed a combined 80 games in the regular season.  Are you seriously suggesting that Philadelphia would have won more games if we'd replaced Embiid with a very good centre?  That having full seasons of say Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela or Nikola Vucevic will make Philadelphia a consistent 58+ win team?  If so, let's trade him now!  But I think, instead, it's showing that ABILITY IS THE BEST ABILITY."

I love the game, but damn, it is tough to watch and in no way do I trust the results.  Watching grown men fall like a ton of bricks when another player taps them, but yet quickly puff up their chests when they are disrespected is fucking hilarious.  The way they fall, no doubt my 5-9 190 pound self would beat the shit out of 90% of the league (bam adebayo, jimmy butler, Blake Griffin, watch your backs.  Im fucking you up when I see you lol)"
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.

But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors ‚Äî Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats ‚Äì 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats ‚Äì 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers‚Äô defenders but couldn‚Äôt do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam‚Äôs field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim.

I remember when ‚ÄúBen Simmons is overrated‚Äù or ‚ÄúBam Adebayo is better than Ben Simmons‚Äù was one of the biggest hot takes on here. Saw a dude say Simmons and a 1 for Lillard was a massive overpay.  Sub likes to pretend they thought he was overrated from the beginning now lmao  Edit: Bringing this up because I remember some past hot-take threads
Bam Adebayo is the best defender in the NBA no bias
"I still laugh every time he pronounces Bam Adebayo as ""Bam Outta Da Bayou"""
"Adebayo didn't take a step back defensively this year. He was literally top 5 in DPOY voting, and as someone who watched almost every Heat game this season, he was as good as he was last year if not better.  Ayton also isnt a true 7 footer. He's measured in at 6'11"".  The entire Heat roster got exposed. Every team that made the conference finals last year got roasted in the playoffs due to fatigue and injury. Bam got cold from midrange because he lacks confidence in his shot. Something that the pressure of playoffs probably exacerbated. He was automatic in the first half of the season, and has made strides in that area. A 4 game sample size with a multitude of outside factors is hardly a good reason to take the far worse player."
Four years ago Bam Adebayo was not BAM ADEBAYO and Mason Plumlee was a decent role player for the Nuggets.
Good lord this is a defensive juggernaut:   Miami Heat  Glen Rice  Tim Hardaway  Jimmy Butler  PJ Brown  Bam Adebayo

"Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside (when he still tried)   A score of 50 to 47 can still win a game"
Bam Adebayo
"Okongwu‚Äôs, Bam Adebayo comparison is looking really good right now lol"
"Trading someone like Dame is tough because trading for him is clearly a win now move, but there are so few young players in the league that are both good enough to be a starting point for a Dame trade, but also not so good that swapping them for Dame wouldn't result in a serious contender.   Its a really short list: Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons (depends how highly the blazers value him tbh), Bam Adebayo, and past that I'm struggling the think of anyone"
"&gt; They just drafted a center last year who made All-Rookie, getting Wiseman just stunts both of their development.  You don't draft for fit. Take the best player available. Particularly the Pistons have no reason at all to cater around their current roster.   &gt; \#7 and #14 are also nowhere near enough value for Cade. I don't consider him a ""generational talent"", but he is All-NBA potential.  I think of it more probabilistic. #1 pick has an some chance of turning into a franchise changing player. A #7 pick has a slightly lower chance, and #14 lower. But I don't think it's crazy that #7 + #14 + Wiseman collectively have more odds than Cade.   Let's say conservatively Wiseman is worth #15. If you look at past drafts in the 1-and-done era, around half the time #7 + #14 + #15 is better than #1:  - **2007: Yes** (Brewer + Thornton + Stuckey &gt; Oden) - **2008: No** (DRose &gt; Eric Gordon + Anthony Randolph + RoLo) - **2009: Yes** (Steph Curry + Clark + Daye &gt; Blake Griffin) - **2010: No** (Wall &gt; Monroe + 2Pat + Larry Sanders) - **2011: Yes** (Biyombo + Marcus Morris + Kawhi &gt; Kyrie) - **2012: No** (AD &gt; Barnes + Hensen + Harkless) - **2013: Yes** (McLemore + Shabazz + Giannis &gt; Bennett) - **2014: Yes** (Randle +  TJ Warren + Adreian Payne &gt; Wiggins) - **2015: No** (KAT &gt; Mudiay + Cam Payne + Oubre) - **2016: Yes** (Jamal Murray + Denzel Valentin + Juan Hernangomez &gt; Ben Simmons) - **2017: Yes** (Lauri + Bam Adebayo + Justin Jackson &gt; Fultz) - 2018 onwards: too early to tell (eg MPJ vs Ayton)  So if you look at the 11 year span from 2007 to 2017, you have 7 times (64%) where it's better to take #7 + #14 + #15."
Tatum on Bam Adebayo üòï
"According to Heat fans, Bam Adebayo is clearly better than him so I guess not."
just like bam adebayo was the 3rd best center until the heat started losing?
People on this subreddit really are amazing. Even if we ignore the players contracts and salary cap Tyler Herro is just straight up not better than Ben Simmons. Also why would the Heat want to surround Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler with even less spacing lol?
Once Bam Adebayo shaves his head it‚Äôll be him and nobody will ever question his status ever again. He‚Äôs gotta be the sweatiest player in the game.
Bam Adebayo is up there. Just the calls when he dunks it.
"Butler, Jimothy Adebayo, Bam"

Wtf? What does Bam Adebayo have to do with injuries?
&gt; And five more: Bam Adebayo (No. 14 in 2017); Domantas Sabonis (No. 11 in 2016); Pascal Siakam (No. 27 in 2016); Nikola Vucevic (No. 16 in 2011); Zach LaVine (No. 13 in 2014).  I feel like Brogdon was a bigger steal than Sabonis.
"15 players according to Bobby Marks, Kevin Pelton, and Mike Schmitz of ESPN this year. Here are the 15 players they‚Äôd take ahead of Trae:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Zion Williamson 3. LaMelo Ball 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jayson Tatum 6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Ben Simmons 8. Devin Booker 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Brandon Ingram 12. Jaylen Brown 13. Jamal Murray 14.

Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"So if all you need is one of your parents to be Nigerian...   I guess this means,  Victor Oladipo  Bam Adebayo   turned them down?  Nigeria's got one of those teams to watch, in that they got a lot of NBA talent so feasibly they match up well with the USA, the other team I reckon to watch being Canada (no Jamal Murray though.)  Men's Olympic BBall should actually be amazing this time."
"&gt; Jaylen Brown  &gt; Bam Adebayo  &gt; Klay Thompson  &gt; DeAndre Ayton  &gt; Ja Morant  All of these guys are very good defenders outside of Morant, but his offense more than makes up for it.

He trained with Bam Adebayo a couple offsessons ago though.
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"

"Lol. So, in 2K21, I went to a team that was good but needed a point guard, since for whatever reason I suck while using bigs in 2K21 when that‚Äôs usually my go to because I like blocking shits. Naturally, I picked Miami, moving Dragic to the bench and we went in to wreck the league. I basically just pick‚Äôn rolled lobs to Bam every game if I wasn‚Äôt shooting, so he was amazed by the dunks and the blocks Bam would get(I‚Äôd be regularly draining 32 footers, but whatever), so I showed him some real Bam highlights and he freaked out and was obsessed after that. Lol. I don‚Äôt have a second controller, so he would grab this old Super Nintendo controller I have and pretend like he was playing as Bam Adebayo.  I‚Äôm going to get him a Bam jersey this weekend and I‚Äôm saving up for court side(or as close as possible) seats for when the Heat come to town next season."
"No disrespect meant at all but this reads like you‚Äôve drawn the conclusion you wanted and adjusted your logic accordingly. For instance you‚Äôre giving all the credit to the young players while not even mentioning Butler who had the best playoff run of his career. He averaged 23.4 ppg on 68 TS% and was by far the biggest reason the Heat took that series.  Duncan Robinson isn‚Äôt even young, he was 26 during that series. Crowder was 29. Olynyk was 28. Iggy was 36. Adebayo definitely was young, but since that series his play has generally held up, even earning him an all star appearance. The only major outlier was Herro, and even his overall play is extremely exaggerated. He averaged 13.2 ppg for the entire series. The way you‚Äôre describing it you‚Äôd think he averaged 30 a game.  &gt;Simultaneously disruptive sleep schedule normally found in playoff basketball was eliminated, giving those who can function off of pure IQ and habits(older players have less of an advantage). The heat having young players like nunn, robinson, bam and hero benefited more than others.   This is weird logic. Using this same logic, shouldn‚Äôt Butler have had a bad series? He was 30 years old after all. And shouldn‚Äôt Giannis have had a good one? He was definitely sub par for his standards. How can you say that any of these players had their sleep schedules disrupted. Not only that, how can you say that it affected them so accurately that you‚Äôre claiming it affected their games on their behalf?  &gt;Finally the large amounts of time off between the playoffs and the regular season gave injured players rest not normally given, and dragic and butler both benefitted from this(very injury prone). This would not be found in other playoffs and therefore you are incorrect, this amount of variance was indeed higher.  This has absolutely nothing to do with variance. Regardless, ‚Äúwe would have won if the other team was more injured‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exactly inspire confidence."

"AD actually has better lateral agility. AD has a 7'7 wingspan, I don't know what Giannis wingspan is, but it is def not longer than ADs. They are both elite as defenders, I would say Giannis better as a help defender, AD is slightly better as a rim protector and does better when he switched onto guards. Bam Adebayo is probably the best switch defender for a big in the entire NBA."

"Our guys play hard and give it all on the court from start to finish. We're one of the top teams in the league when it comes to developing players and we're always looking to compete. In our 33 years as a team, we only missed the playoffs 11 times. We got swept badly in the playoffs last year, but we made some moves and are in the process of making some trades to come back stronger this season because, as I said before, we want to compete. We have a balanced roster of old and young players. I suggest watching highlights of Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Max Strus. Those are some of our young guys. We have arguably the best coach in the league by the name of Erik Spolestra. We pride ourselves on what we like to call Heat Culture, which is giving it all on the court until the final buzzer as I said in the first sentence. Overall, you'll feel very satisfied as a Heat fan while watching our games."
Bam Adebayo?

"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
&gt;Bam Adebayo  Care to explain?
&gt;By this subreddit? Bam Adebayo  How?
"By this subreddit? Bam Adebayo  By the wider nba fandom? Used to be Drummond, now I‚Äôd say Lonzo probably, or maybe Booker"
I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
"In this modern era, your franchise's developmental program is nowhere near top 3. You sign a lot of guys that are already established and do away with your young talent. A lot of other franchises have that player that they can say they developed into something big. The Jazz has Donovan Mitchell. The Hawks have Trae Young. The Celtics have Jayson Tatum. The Heat have Bam Adebayo. The Pelicans had Anthony Davis and has Zion. The only guy I can see potentially fit that bill for y'all is THT, but only if you keep him."
"I think Adebayo is used because there is a plethora of 6'7-6'10 guys who aren't quite tall enough to play a conventional 5, and aren't skilled enough to play a 4 next to a conventional 5. but Bam is like the holy grail of those guys"
Imagine Shaq in today‚Äôs Nba. Who‚Äôs going to stop him? Gobert? Bam Adebayo? Lmao. Only guy that may be able to hold him off for a bit is Adams and that‚Äôs only coz he‚Äôs kiwi and strong as fuck.
"I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto-- Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn were both undrafted players. Bam Adebayo, way better than draft outlook. Herro better than draft outlook. Team frequently finds G league diamonds in the rough. A lot of your teams rotational players were at some point Heat development projects (Tyler Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr, Josh Richardson, etc etc.)"
Every undersized C can now be Bam Adebayo
"I think Ben Taylor on the Thinking Basketball Podcast really recently described this but in the 2020 draft (following the bubble playoffs) me and my roommate were going insane over how many times FVV and Bam Adebayo were used for player comparisons.   Think about that. I don‚Äôt really think Adebayo is a useful comparison for any NBA player (maybe Draymond, call me crazy but I think they play a similar role on offense, really felt that watching the Olympics). I don‚Äôt think FVV is a useful comparison for any other guard (maybe Lowry? They‚Äôre possibly the best two defenders in the league below 6‚Äô3‚Äù.)."
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Bam Adebayo  Key Bench Players: Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, Max Strus, Markieff Morris, Dewayne Dedmon"
"Accolades from a players career don‚Äôt hold much bearing on a players current ranking. Melo has way more accolades than say bam Adebayo.   Fox is the more valuable player. He‚Äôs younger, he‚Äôs shown actual major improvements every year where Ben has by in large been stagnant, he‚Äôs not a great shooter but he‚Äôs much better than men, is better at every form of scoring while being a better playmaker, since his excellent passing which rivals bens is made more effective with his scoring gravity (why dame is a better playmaker than rondo), he fits in more systems and is more portable, overall he has a lot more trade value"

"I think you‚Äôre overestimating how many legit bully ball centers there are in the playoffs. The east had brook lopez and The west had Jokic and Jonas.   Most playoff centers are guys Zubac, Griffin, Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Noel, Capela etc."
Bam Adebayo for bigs
Future Celtic Bam Adebayo.
"Sure, here.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/bam-adebayo-shot-chart-this-season  Right elbow range: 29%  Left elbow range: 38.5%  Free throw range: 44 and 45% (only range he did around average in).  He is a below average elbow range jump shooter, even last year, and it‚Äôs just a fact. I love bam and I‚Äôm hoping he and Lowry work great together, but I‚Äôm not biased about the fact that he needs to work on that range.  Overall outside the paint area he shot around 43%, but really mostly in that area right around the free throw line. He needs to extend his mid range abilities to be a bit further out and work along those elbows. He‚Äôs unfortunately a below average mid range shooter."

"He was born there, but I believe he moved when he was young to his mother's home state. This is the source I used: [https://www.si.com/college/2017/01/26/edrice-bam-adebayo-kentucky-wildcats-recruiting-freshman](https://www.si.com/college/2017/01/26/edrice-bam-adebayo-kentucky-wildcats-recruiting-freshman)"
"Right, so just as I said, ""defense"", ""shooting"", etc., - are arbitrary terms that are more intended to be unrefutable than to actually make a positive argument.  RJ Barrett is a better defender, but LeVert's lead over Barrett offensively is significantly higher than Barrett's lead defensively. Barrett has little ability to playmake or create his own shot, where LeVert does. RJ Barrett was assisted on 52% of his shots, LeVert was only assisted on 42%.  Which leads directly to shooting. The fact that they have the same true shooting (so I'm not sure why you're calling Barrett a better shooter to begin with) is not great for Barrett considering the degree of difficulty on assisted shots is much lower, so he should make more of them than LeVert makes off his own creation - but he doesn't, outside of spot-up threes, which LeVert doesn't really take.  As for playing in a system, Caris LeVert was the leading scorer on *two* playoff teams, whereas Barrett scored 14 points on 38% shooting and 28% from three in his playoff system debut. Regardless, ""playing in a system"" is more contingent on having a coach with a good system than anything to do with the players. Kevin Garnett never played in a good system the whole time he was on the Wolves, but they never had a functional system, so we don't hold it against him.  As for potential, that's just not really relevant. Evan Mobley has more ""room to grow"" than say Bam Adebayo right now because Bam is approaching his prime and Mobley isn't. That doesn't mean you give Mobley some prima facie credit for improvements he hasn't yet made.  All in all, to believe Barrett is better, you have to have a reason why ""defense"" and ""spot up shooting"" are sufficiently more important categories for a shooting guard than shot creation and playmaking, which are generally the go-to skills at that position. After all, in all the categories you value, Barrett is better than Devin Booker (better defender, higher 3pt%). But I'm skeptical you would use that to argue Barrett&gt;Booker."
"Ben Simmons, a guard, shot 61% from the line.  Bam Adebayo, a centre, shot 80% from the line.  Bam also scored more on better efficiency, rebounds and blocks more, whereas Ben has him slightly beaten on assists and steals - but as a guard, that‚Äôs not surprising.  In the last season, Ben had a PER of 18.3, Bam had 22.7. Box plus-minus also heavily favours Bam, as do a LOT of advanced stats.  Where exactly is the case for Ben Simmons being better?  For ‚Äúprobably the best answer you‚Äôll get‚Äù it‚Äôs a pretty piss-poor answer."
Bam Adebayo has a good chance
"Heat - Nuggets. Heat win. Bam Adebayo FMVP.   Both teams have the guard, wing, big trio that is really rare and hard to come by. Nuggets have the homegrown core that is incredibly potent offensively between Murray, Porter, and Jokic. Heat have the veteran trio in Lowry, Jimmy, and Bam that is much more solid defensively and has more playmaking, but in the absence of shot making.   Heat win due to superior defense and composed play in the clutch and Jimmy Butler getting bullshit foul calls.   The Heat have lost the last 2 NBA champions (Lakers, Bucks). The Nuggets have lost to the last 2 Western Conference champs (Lakers, Suns). Both teams will do one round better than they did in the bubble."
"Bam Adebayo will win a DPOY, 1st team all nba and get mvp votes by the end of his career."
A lot more is holding Markelle back from being an all star than just a jumper. Gotta remind y‚Äôall Trae Young did not make the all star game this year in the east. Bam Adebayo did not make the all star game this year. Jimmy Butler did not make the all star game. It‚Äôs crazy competitive. Is Fultz with a jumper really so much better than guys like Brogdon and FVV who were like 5th and 8th in east all star votes for the snubs.
"we talk about Nerlens Noel? Nerlens Noel? not Joel Embiid, not Bam Adebayo, Nerlens Noel."
"Yes, Bam Adebayo."
"His mobility and fluidity as a 6'10 player with a 7'7 wingspan is freaky. He is just not very powerful or explosive as an athlete. Prob only AD and Ben Simmons are that fluid off the ball for players that are legit 6'10 and up. They move their feet so well and can legit stay in front of small, quick and shifty guards. Maybe Bam Adebayo too, but he is prob more like 6'8/6'9."
"Heat-Nuggets Finals, Heat win it all. Bam Adebayo FMVP."
"Wow, cannot believe anybody on this thread hasn't said them yet, so I'll say them, the Miami Heat. I really think they're going to win it all this year.   I just love the fact that they have an All-Star caliber player at the guard, wing, and big positions, and in the case of Lowry and Jimmy, they have 2 of the smartest and most reliable decision makers in the entire league.   People have over-corrected far too much on Jimmy Butler after he had a bad series against what ended up being the NBA champs, who had a great defense. He will rebound.   And I agree on your Nuggets choice, I have them making the Finals, but losing to Miami. Bam Adebayo Finals MVP. But the same principle applies to the Nuggets. I'm aware that Murray and MPJ haven't been All-Stars and aren't likely to be, but they can be All-Star caliber, and it's just difficult to imagine anybody in the Western Conference being able to defend all 3 of Jokic/Murray/Porter. Plus, the thing I like about Denver is they actually play defense (unlike Brooklyn), they finished 11th in Cleaning the Glass's Defensive Rating last year.   If there's one takeaway everybody should have after last season, it's that while you can outscore teams in the regular season and win a lot of games, at the end of the day, defense still fucking matters.   I have Heat-Nuggets Finals, with Miami winning in 6. Miami has lost to the last 2 NBA champions, and the Nuggets have lost to the last 2 Western Conference champions."
Penny Hardaway? Cool shit. Also have Bam Adebayo and Thanasis on board.
"Going by my summer league stats, I'm roughly Bam Adebayo. How I play? I'm basically Zach Randolph at this point. Too lazy to use what athleticism I have left except on defense so I body people and just use the big man game."
who tf is bam adebayo?
"&gt; The Bagels traded Bruce Brown, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, a 2023 1st round pick, and a 2025 1st round pick to the Cyclones for Bam Adebayo, Dewayne Dedmon, and Kyle Lowry.  Lol, thanks Brooklyn."
"This game was insane  Kendrick Nunn - 36 points  Jimmy Butler - 20/18/10  Bam Adebayo - 30/11/11  Duncan Robibson - 34 points, 10 threes"
"With the NBA as it is today what with all the shooting and smaller 4s, I'd argue that perimeter and/or versatile defenders are more important than rim protectors. You saw how Gobert (the premier rim protector in the NBA) was taken advantage of by the Clippers. Ideally you want a Bam Adebayo that can switch 3-5 as well as block shots instead of a Gobert that marks his territory inside"
"I just checked out the game for a few minutes and it seems really, really cool. Only thing I'll say is that the trade system seems a little...bugged. I added Bam Adebayo to a trade, pressed ""What would it take to make this trade work?"" and the Heat wanted to give me their entire team for Jayson Tatum.  If there's anywhere I can report bugs or issues, I'll make sure to post there as well."

As for the foul baiting, it's clear he's still trying all his tricks to get to the line, especially on drives. There was one instance where he blew by Adebayo then just stopped and hooked his arm under Bam to try  to get the call.   I think Harden can bounce back, but it's more attitude and rust than anything else really."

How did Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant out-rebound Bam Adebayo and Blake Griffin?
Durant's 3 favorite things.  3. Leading team USA in scoring.  2. Scarlett Johansson bathwater.  1. Bam Adebayo.
He just beat bam adebayo off the dribble‚Ä¶
Still remember thar Bam Adebayo buzz beater last timw the nets faced the heat   Nets just dont have the personal for good centers and Bambis about to feast
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over?

I would argue that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell archetype isn‚Äôt as good as Anthony Davis/ Bam Adebayo archetype
"I‚Äôm expecting perimeter defenders to not get beat at the rate they were getting beat in that series. That level of defensive incompetence is inexcusable.   The exact same thing didn‚Äôt happen with Houston at all. When Houston matched up against Utah they still had Capela. They rarely ran 5 out. Gobert did underperform against Houston, but that‚Äôs cause Harden and chris Paul would constantly target him 1v1. No Centre save for maybe Anthony Davis and bam Adebayo are handling that. Again you could either blame harden for being so good, or blame the Jazz perimeter defenders/ defensive schemes for allowing switches to be forced so easily, but you can‚Äôt blame a 7 foot rim protection specialist for not being able to guard an MVP guard in isolation.   And no it‚Äôs literally not that. When he was guarding the 3 point shooters like Morris and Batum, he was handling them just fine. Because they were playing as catch and shoot players. They were easy to defend. The issues came when Gobert had to help inside. Again what exactly do you expect in those scenarios ? You‚Äôre either asking Gobert to be in two places at once, or you blame his team mates for allowing the blow-by. There aren‚Äôt other options.   You‚Äôre just showing how much you‚Äôre running with the narrative and not actually paying attention to what‚Äôs happening with Gobert by comparing Houston and LAC, which were completely different issues for Gobert"
"Realistically, no.   But, in theory, yes.  This line-up, if it was ever assembled, would win a ring IMO:   PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Norman Powell  SF: Khris Middleton  PF: Julius Randle  C: Bam Adebayo"

I see the Bam 'literally never not moving on a screen' Adebayo is back.
"So serious question, who is winning MVP? Jimmy Butler or Bam Adebayo? Or will they just give the MVP to the entire Miami Heat team like they did for the Hawks with that Player of the Month award?"
"Just going to go with cities with 4 C's for reference.  San Francisco: James Wiseman, Alex Mack, Buster Posey, Logan Couture  Los Angeles: Anthony Davis, Corey Linsley, Will Smith, Anze Kopitar  Arizona: DeAndre Ayton, Max Garcia, Carson Kelly, Johan Larsson  Denver: Nikola Jokic, Lloyd Cushenberry III, Elias Diaz, Nathan MacKinnon  Dallas: Kristaps Porzingis, Tyler Biadasz, Jose Trevino, Tyler Seguin  Minnesota: Karl Anthony-Town, Garrett Bradbury, Mitch Garver, Joel Eriksson Ek  Chicago: Nikola Vucevic, Sam Mustipher, Yasmani Grandal, Johnathan Toews  Miami: Bam Adebayo, Greg Mancz, Nick Fortes, Alexsander Barkov  Washington D.C: Daniel Gafford, Chase Roullier, Keibert Ruiz, Evgeny Kuznetsov  Cleveland: Jarrett Allen, JC Tretter, Roberto Perez, Boone Jenner  Detroit: Isaiah Stewart, Evan Brown, Jake Rogers, Dylan Larkin  Philadelphia: Joel Embiid, Jason Kelce, JT Realmuto, Claude Giroux  New York: Mitchell Robinson, Billy Price, Gary Sanchez, Mathew Barzal  Boston: Robert Williams III, David Andrews, Christian Vazquez, Patrice Bergeron"
Bam Adebayo if he was an olympic level high jumper with insane skill and knowledge as well as having mamba mentality (minus being a huge asshole)
so Bill Russell was Bam Adebayo? Bam is also a very good playmaker and is short for a center in addition to being a great defender
"Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis.  Arguably Clint Capela and Nik Vucevic."
"I'm pretty sure guys like Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Bam Adebayo, Udonis Haslem, Markieff Morris already brought toughness."
"Mvp: Giannas. Lakers too stacked. Nets durant and harden cancel each other out. Curry-&gt; 2nd  Dpoy: Ben simmons on another team or Bam adebayo   Sixth man: Grayson Allen, Cameron Payne   Roy: Scottie Barnes.   Coach: Hawks coach. Nuggets   Mip: Michael porter,"
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"

"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
Tyler Johnson/Kendrick Nunn/Duncan Robinson/Tyler Herro/Bam Adebayo/Hassan Whiteside/Max Struss/Wayne Ellington. All these guys are good or had career years with the Heat. Raptor fans are either bitter or ignorant. Either way I don‚Äôt care. Super excited for next season.
"Plenty come to mind, Kawhi and Giannis for sure, even Paul George and Jrue Holiday.  Anthony Davis, Gobert, Bam Adebayo.  Those are just the good defensive players who are also much better offensively.  Soo many more who are average defenders but way better offensively, which helps more in todays NBA.  Draymond does have 3 rings but as stated those are mostly due to Steph, Klay and KD.  We saw how 2019-2020 went without those 3, but with Draymond."

Bam Adebayo is better. That's the difference.
My picks   ROY: Cade Cunningham   6MOY: Chris Boucher   DPOY: Bam Adebayo   MIP: Dejounte Murray/Terrance Mann   MVP: Giannis Antetokoumpo
Bam Adebayo for MVP.  Is like 100-1.
"Ben Simmons Jrue Holiday Kawhi Leonard Draymond Green Anthony Davis.   Bench: Marcus Smart, Mattise Thybule, Giannis, Bam Adebayo  This lineup is allowing 50 points per game"
"This is current, but Bam Adebayo."
Bam Adebayo
"If round 5 is players ranked 120 to 150, you're probably going to see Bam Adebayo,  Jack Sikma, Bill Lambeer, Alvin Adams, Vlade Divac, etc.  Ewing is top 50, Dwight and Jokic are top 75, and Embiid is top 100.  I'm willing to bet Davis gets picked in round 3 at the latest and T-Mac is a round 2 pick."
So does Bam Adebayo. He‚Äôs elite at defending guards on the perimeter.

Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"Leading up to the 2017 NBA Draft, I was messing around on my laptop in a Summer A lecture and found myself on the Wikipedia page for the draft, in the section of players who declared. I saw the first name on the list (alphabetically): **Bam Adebayo**  And I said to myself: ‚ÄúDamn, that‚Äôs a dope-ass name.‚Äù  *Fucking Prophet.*"
"LeBron on the Nets!   But realistically, I think Bam Adebayo would be a nice addition to the Mavs alongside Luka. He can provide the Mavericks defense/rim protection, additional playmaking, and be a more reliable 2nd option that Porzingis. He would give them some things they need   Luka and Bam would be so fun to watch and highly competitive. But I hope to God the Mavericks never end up with Bam!"
"Not OP, but I think we did both! Duarte is good now, but doesn't have a superstar ceiling, and we got Isaiah Jackson at #21 who's 18 and has a very high ceiling as a two way big with Bam Adebayo vibes."
"Jesus christ do miami heat players go through a 6 week flopping course? they got this ""tough tenacious defender"" Bam Adebayo floppin all over the place so bad that Brook Lopez is imitating him?  This is the guy who just said their locker room is a kennel, is that a kennel for prize poodles that can lay down on command? Lol"
"It's kind of weird, since I wouldn't really consider any of those 4 to be at the same level or good comparisons between each other.  I think with Luka Jayson Tatum would be better example of being a young player in the similar level.  With Trae it would be someone like Bam Adebayo, although it's very possible if not even likely that Trae will take the jump this year to a higher level if he can limit his defensive liabilities a bit. (or his team uses him in different kind of defensive role). In his current state it was kind of difficult to find other players of similar position and size to him. I'd say he's somewhere comfortably higher than Kemba, but at least based on last year a step or two behind Holiday. Good comparison of his ideal future would be someone like Lillard who is also relatively (although not quite as) short point guard who's negative on defense but major positive on offense which is basically Trae's profile right now.  For Ja Morant maybe someone like Brandon Ingram could be more fitting comparison of someone that provides similar value overall.  Then for Herro I think Kuzma example already given in this thread was great. Also names that float around him that  I'd bring up are Markelle Fultz or Svi Mykhailuk."

"Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Rudy Gobert  &amp;#x200B;  I'd put him top 6 probably after those 5, but I don't see how that's *""at the absolute worst""*."
Bam Adebayo.
Bam Adebayo could benefit from being a bit more assertive with his scoring.
Bam Adebayo. 50% of the time he gets the ball he‚Äôs looking for a handoff
"Or Jimmy Butler , crowder and Bam Adebayo two all NBA defensive guys and another great defender , it's truly isn't hard at all. Why doesn't everyone just do that. And even the heat wall this year wasn't as effective"
"Lamelo, Dejounte Murray, Draymond Green, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis, Ben Simmons üòñ"
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
Finals Winner: Heat  Finals MVP: Jimmy Butler  MVP: Jimmy Butler   DPOY: Bam Adebayo  ROY: Micah Potter  MIP: Tyler Herro
"Does anyone else always hear think ""born on the bayou"" everytime they hear ""Bam Adebayo?"""
"So? It‚Äôs a subjective selection process, just as fallible as DPOY.  If this season say Myles Turner and bam Adebayo both snubbed out gobert for all defence 1st team, it wouldn‚Äôt make Gobert any less deserving of DPOY. It doesn‚Äôt change how immensely impactful he is"
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
"&gt;consistent DPOY candidate to justify a max  I mean Rudy Gobert is a consistent DPOY candidate and he is a supermax player.  The max for a young player this year is $28m.  Towns will make around $31m.  Bam Adebayo makes about $28m.  Jarrett Allen will make aroudn $20m this season (his contract is flat though, important caveat).  I mean maybe  you could argue Ayton is closer to Allen than the others. but I don't think I would agree.  I'd say he and Adebayo are pretty close.  The only convincing argument that there's a lot of daylight between them IMO is the rarity of Adebayo's skills - the playmaking and excellent 1-5 switchability.  Maybe that's enough to say he's in a different category than Ayton even if he's strictly worse in the other areas, I mean idk.  Given how bad the Suns were for the last decade and how difficult it was to come down with two high level prospects in Booker and Ayton, I say just pay the man.   If this goes on too long and he loses patience and decides to force his way out, it's going to be hard to justify to fans that the sticking point was like $5m a season."
"That's the logic for bigger market too, it's not small market vs big market hype that you people love to push  Miami Heat maxed Bam Adebayo too, he isn't a max player like that, he's obviously very good but no  Brooklyn had to max D'Angelo Russell, again nope and many other examples of overpaying   Overpaying happens to every team, it depends on context but most of the time you just overpay because that's how the cap works, it has nothing to do with big market small market literally every franchise has overpaid or has had some insanely bad contracts"
&gt;he‚Äôs Bam Adebayo with Joel Embiid‚Äôs wingspan  His wingspan is the one thing *specifically* not being compared to Timelord.
We wouldn‚Äôt have drafted Bam Adebayo in 2017! The Bulls may have picked him instead. We should be thanking D-Wade and Jimmy Butler for helping Miami in the long run.
Jimmy Butler: 20-6-6 on 49/35/87 splits  Bam Adebayo: 22-10-5 on 60/30/83 splits

"&gt; You mean fucking Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo? They‚Äôre not even all stars. Nobody expected even a fully healthy heat team to win that series  Alright, you lost me. But I'll humor you.  &gt; Again, the Lakers lost AD and Bron for a significant amount of the season. That helped the Suns to be the 2nd seed and regular season success doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre destined for the finals.   The Suns are the reason the Lakers lost 32 games? We only played you 3 times.  &gt; The Lakers took a 2-1 lead when they had both AD and Bron (not 100%) on the floor.   When they had CP3 (not 100%, not even 50%, not even 25%) on the floor.   &gt; And you suns fans like to pretend that CP not being 100% is comparable to Bron AND AD being injured.  You lakers fans like to pretend that CP not being 100% = CP being 100%.  &gt; Again, you‚Äôre comparing CP to Kawhi which is another false equivalency. Clippers would‚Äôve beat the suns if Kawhi was healthy, too.  No, we don't know that. Especially because of how the Clippers rallied AFTER Kawhi went down, all the people who stepped up failed to do so beforehand in the Mavs series and the first 2 games of the Jazz series. I will admit they should be favored healthy. But it doesn't matter because *we knew the team we were getting when they cooked the Jazz*. ""But Kawhi"" is blaming US for the injury as if we're the one who tore his damn ACL lmfao. Flawed and lame ass argument.   &gt; Even with the suns not ‚Äúperfectly healthy‚Äù, they lost to the first relatively healthy team they faced.  They were in the fucking finals? They were playing the last best team standing?   &gt; They dodged superstars every round of the playoffs   I want you to seriously explain how a team can control superstars -- injury prone superstars, mind you -- going down before they even played us. We just played who was in front of us. You frame this like we went and tore Kawhi's ACL ourselves.  &gt; choked as soon as they got their opportunity to win it all.  That's what happens when you play an all-time great player who clicks with his co-stars at the right time. Credit to the Bucks who outplayed us. We also were only outscored by 2 points per game average in the series, so framing it as a beatdown is disingenuous. Just dripping with objectivity. If you want to actually make an argument, don't overexaggerate to the point where a simple bball reference google will disprove you.   &gt; they beat better teams because they lucked out on injuries... we‚Äôll see what this suns team really is, which is a team definitely not getting out of the west.  Better teams would have been better in the regular season and would have been better in the postseason. West is wide open once you take off your hater shades. You say your team retooled and has a superteam with depth, I say your team has no continuity, didn't address any injury bug concerns, is only getting older, and your three stars are a poor fit. You're still one of the two favorites to win the title, and all I can do as a fan is use stats and history to challenge that. I already wasted time addressing your shitty recycled takes, I doubt I even remotely changed your mind on anything. Most of you Laker fans just lie over and over again with enough loud voices until you believe it's the truth, as if we all can't actually go watch the games with our own eyes."
"Lol it‚Äôs ironic that you ended your comment with ‚ÄúUltimately, people just have their narratives and will take any argument to fulfill that narrative‚Äù when that‚Äôs exactly what you did with every point.   ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄùInjury-plagued heat team‚Äù? You mean fucking Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo? They‚Äôre not even all stars. Nobody expected even a fully healthy heat team to win that series  ‚Ä¢ Again, the Lakers lost AD and Bron for a significant amount of the season. That helped the Suns to be the 2nd seed and regular season success doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre destined for the finals. It was shameful for them to tank, but if they could‚Äôve predicted the Lakers would have a compromised Bron and no AD then they obviously wouldn‚Äôt have. Suns lucked out on their bad bet.  ‚Ä¢ The Lakers took a 2-1 lead when they had both AD and Bron (not 100%) on the floor. They lost it when AD couldn‚Äôt play anymore. And you suns fans like to pretend that CP not being 100% is comparable to Bron AND AD being injured. It would barely even be comparable if only one of them was.  ‚Ä¢ Again, you‚Äôre comparing CP to Kawhi which is another false equivalency. Clippers would‚Äôve beat the suns if Kawhi was healthy, too.  ‚Ä¢ Even with the suns not ‚Äúperfectly healthy‚Äù, they lost to the first relatively healthy team they faced. They dodged superstars every round of the playoffs and choked as soon as they got their opportunity to win it all.   I know you guys are proud of being in the finals but you know damn well they beat better teams because they lucked out on injuries. Now that the west is somewhat healthy again (excluding Kawhi) we‚Äôll see what this suns team really is, which is a team definitely not getting out of the west barring some more injury luck."

"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he‚Äôs technically a SG but I couldn‚Äôt find any other PG‚Äôs besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren‚Äôt from NY and since it‚Äôd be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"In **South East** I'd change Suggs and Hayward for LaMelo and Isaac to have:  Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Bam Adebayo.   In **South West** I'd change Thad Young for Dejounte Murray straight up.  In terms of rankings, I'd go:  1. **Pacific** \- LeBron, Steph and Kawhi is just too much. Especially with a rim-running big man and a lights-out shooter.  2. **North West** \- When the worst player in your lineup is Shai and you have elite shooting throughout, that's scary. 3. **Atlantic** \- my one concern here is that unless FVV develops it, there isn't really an elite playmaker in this lineup.  4. **South East** \- Massive firepower in Trae, LaMelo and Beal, and then you bank on there being enough defense from Isaac and Bam to cover it. Isaac and Beal won't be taking a shot.  5. **Central** \- Lots of talent in the lineup but the lack of versaility made me put them so low. Their 3-5 can't really shoot from the perimeter. 6. **South West** \- Honestly, just the last talent?"
I was never big into basketball until the nba bubble was the only sport on TV after half a year of nothing. The Luka buzzer beater against the clippers and the bam adebayo block on Tatum made me realize how great basketball is
"I‚Äôm not here to say we aren‚Äôt the worst, but I would like to throw in consideration for the 2016 and 2017 drafts for the Phoenix Suns. With two top 10 picks in 2016, they drafted Dragan Bender at 4 (in front of Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield) and Marquese Chriss at 8 (in front of Sabonis). In 2017, with the 4th pick, they selected Josh Jackson in front of DeAaron Fox,  Bam Adebayo and many other players that have been more notable. Those Kings picks in 2011 and 2012 are still worse IMO because the talent in each drafted was better than 2016, though blowing two top 10 picks in one draft and then missing on Jackson in 2017 is a very rough go."
"A small-ball lineup of Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Duncan Robinson, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo could be very interesting. The regular lineup with PJ could effectively do the same, but his shooting has been terrrrible recently."
"DENVER: Marquese Chriss, Bam Adebayo, Troy Brown Jr., Leandro Bolmaro; other 1st rounders would be Guerschon Yabusele and Caris LeVert"

"They celebrated beating a cinderella Heat team without Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic lol. In a bubble where games were scrimmage level of intensity at times.   That was, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm exaggerating, the worst team to make it to the Finals in the last 20 years. Maybe the Nets or Sixers edge them out, but definitely bottom 3. Insane the delusional Lakers fans that exist"
"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
Missing Bam Adebayo
I think this has to do more with Bam. He literally was scared of taking a shot from the field that series and all the defensive focus was on Jimmy the whole series. If there‚Äôs someone who has a worse series it would be Adebayo for sure.
"I don't think anyone is pretending like the blazers are a good defensive team. But teams that are not obnoxiously deep can't typically guard every scheme well.look at the bucks which were the best defensive team in the playoffs: Pg tucker was the best Defender against KD and he was bad against the hawks. Brook Lopez completely locked down bam adebayo and he was a liability against quick guards in the p&amp;r against the hawks, suns and Kyrie Irving. There are few guys in the league who can adjust against everybody and no team is able to stack them.    For the jazz the problem was Golbert offense not his defense. No player in the NBA history can guard five guys in the perimeter who can take their opponent off the dribble and shoot threes at 39%+ , and protect the rim because everybody else was getting beat.  If he dunked on them every possession they would have changed that offense real quick"
" i can understand you sticking with Fox for 17 but  to me Adebayo, Siakam, Haliburton, Luka would be better. 19 pick went to celtics i believe, while you guys had 5 and 10 in 17 so i guz u could have fox and bam in 17  or get  thybulle or clarke in 19 instead"

If Sac doesn‚Äôt trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I‚Äôm okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"

"His length, athleticism, and quickness would put him close to a Bam Adebayo or Giannis type player. He was another absolute freak athlete for his time and had great IQ. His passing would have been much better in today's game."

"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.

Bam Adebayo was also asked the about rule differences. He said he likes the goaltending rule a lot and also mentioned that scoring is easier in the NBA.  [video here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSOyJUPqeNc/)
"Myles Turner could be that Center, or Bam Adebayo  I guess if the Bulls get(have?) a good defensive coach, they can get Vuc, Lavine and Demar all up a notch, and they already have Lonzo."
"trae young, westbrook, middleton, tobias harris, bam adebayo"
"I never said he was a bad player. I expressed my love for him plenty of times. I really like him as a human and as a player, but if you want me to put him above Jamal Murray, Deaaron fox, Bam adebayo, Khris Middleton, hes gotta learn to use his right hand  These are elite players in the NBA. There's no shame in being behind them"

"Bam Adebayo is the most overrated ""star"" in the league, dude is a fucking 0 on offence"
Frank Ntilikina is gonna throw it down in Bam Adebayo Face in the Gold Medal Game
Bam Adebayo is 24?!
"Precious is a 5 though. He is the same size as Bam Adebayo, has the sam standing reach as Jarret Allen.   THT is paid 10 million a year as an inefficient guard that he stepped on the court in 6 playoff games total. He hasn‚Äôt had a deep playoff run and is a poor shooter. Ok prospect, but considering he is already getting paid more than lotto pick in year 3 really reduces his value.   Thybulle is probably the weakest All-d selection in recent memory. Barely played any time and usually shared minutes with at least 1 and sometimes 2 DPOY candidates. Thybulle is a guard with no offensive game, Precious is a big with the offensive game as a big. Thybulle is also 24 and not really a prospect. At best he is a 3&amp;D wing with streaky 3 point shooting.   Caruso wasn‚Äôt in trade talks, and again he is overpaid from this free agency.   And there was reports that Herro was offered. Herro was the 13th pick on a down year, he had a good bubble but Jake Fischer who has had a ton of insight (and details before anything was available) on this specific trade said the Raptors had the choice. I don‚Äôt care how you feel about them as prospects, it was reported Toronto had a choice."
Hey now. As a Kentucky fan I feel I must point out his UK team was quite talented. He was teammates with Bam Adebayo and De‚Äôaaron Fox on that team
A team with both Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo ain't winning anything.     2 of the softest big men in the NBA

"So you don't think it's mostly that USA had a bad day against France, but assign their low scoring mostly to France's defense? I'm not buying it personally, especially when I look at how other team did against France and how USA did against other teams. CZ and ITA scored 77 and 75 respectively against FRA, with USA scoring only 76. Surely you don't compare the US offense to that of CZ and ITA? It's a small sample yeah, but that's exactly the point. Daily form matters, so just because they beat one ""good"" team unexpectedly once, it doesn't mean they would necessarily be able to repeat it.  What I'm saying is, I don't think France held USA down as much as USA held themselves down that game...  As far as the rebounds go, please sort by rebounds and comment on the results: [http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/playerstats](http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/playerstats)  Slovenia takes first and second spot, while the first US player on that list is Bam Adebayo with 5 (!) per game, ranked 21. Next one is Durant, at 32. place. By your logic, USA is one of the slowest teams in the tournament... I think you are extremely undervaluing Slovenias rebounding ability (desire?), so I will be curious to see the comparison between FRA and SLO rebounding after the game.  And last... Score prediction? Pick a result you find the most likely."
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
"Sort by rebounds: [http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/playerstats](http://www.fiba.basketball/olympics/men/2020/playerstats)  And yes, they totally are lmao...  And I don't know what the fuck USA is doing, with their first player on the rebounding list being placed 21. (Bam Adebayo) with 5 rebounds per game. WTF?  Out of top 69 rebounders, USA has only 5. Yes, it's a strategic choice of 69 (not just cultural), kind of like how Americans like to cherry-pick their stats ;)"
They're quite often starter or star level players at 13-15.  **13th pick over last 10 years:**  Donovan Mitchell  Devin Booker  Zach Levine  Kelly Olynik  Markief Morris  **14th pick over last 10 years:**  Michael Porter  Bam Adebayo  TJ Warren  Marcus Morris  **15th pick over last 10 years:**  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kelly Oubre   And that's ignoring a bunch of guys who have had long careers off the bench.
"Kings sign Malik Monk.  Kings trade for Bam Adebayo.  Kings trade for Hamidou Diallo.  Bring in Wenyen Gabriel and Isaiah Briscoe.    Fire Walton, hire Calipari."
"I think the problem with JJ Hickson was that he couldn't guard anybody, which would be even truer now. There's a greater variety of players and body shapes who can play center now, but the common denominator is that centers have to be able to defend. I guess a guy like Bam Adebayo prob would've been considered a tweener like Hickson, although he's also way better at just about everything so he would've been successful in any era."
"Its the risk/reward.   If Rudy Fernabdez helps to win a gold medal then he will be praised forever in his country. If he doesn't win then people will say ""nice try"".   If Bam Adebayo wins the gold then people will kind of just shrug it off. If he doesn't win gold then it will be outrage.   There's not that much upside for team USA players."
FIBA Rubio drops 38 and stuffs Bam Adebayo.
Bam Adebayo is trash.
"3rd Quarter observations:  - way to be more assertive on the glass and on offense, Bam Adebayo - that was a big part of the turnaround  - Durant was way more effective as a spot-up shooter than dribbling the air out of the ball. Seriously.  - Passing is great, but near the end of the quarter, the USA threw it out for threes instead of taking high-percentage layups. That's what will kill them in the long run.  - Speaking of which, the US made a concerted effort to go to the basket in the first half of the 3rd, and it was awesome."
Where Shaq at? Bam Adebayo is shaqtin a fool over here.
Fucking Bam Adebayo is blowing these east points
BAM CINDERBLOCK HANDS ADEBAYO
Bam Adebayo looks like real fool's gold after the 2020 season
"Miami needed a PF and he's the right price, and all the decent offense creators were off the board already. It's an organization that values defense so he'll be welcomed here.  Starting 5: Kyle Lowry, Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, PJ Tucker, Duncan Robinson  Defense heavy, for sure. We had offense problems last season, looks like we're in for more of it.  If Oladipo signs a small contract then in the later part of the season we can put out a defensive 4th quarter lineup of Lowry, Bam, Jimmy, PJ, and Dipo."
Welcome to Toronto Bam Adebayo
The median pick at 9 is Derozan.  All this article really proves is that for some reason teams that pick 8th are just way worse at picking than 9th.  Also he's still a bust.  How are there still Knicks fans arguing that a dude drafted before Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo isn't a bust?

Chris Duarte is older than Bam Adebayo
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo  is his full name by the way"
"Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo"
"Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo"
"Well I don't know his history in depth but pretty sure his father was a Yoruba man from Nigerian noting from the fact that his middle and last name are literally yoruba (Femi and Adebayo). Don't know if bam is strictly a nickname but if it came from a name then it is likely it came from Bamidele, as a Nigerian I think I would know."
"Was thinking the same to be honest, start with Draymond and Bam and gain more inside presence. You lose some spacing, but tbh if you start with something like Lillard, Booker, KD, Green, Adebayo you have three great shooters on the floor. at the same time dray gives a lot of energy from the bench which is also important."
"Last year in the Finals, the Heat had:  - Bam Adebayo miss two entire games and half of a third  - Goran Dragic miss the entire series after getting injured 14 minutes into Game 1  - Jimmy Butler play the entire series with a sprained ankle he got in Game 1‚Ä¶the same injury that kept LeBron limited/out for extended time in 2021  You going to dismiss the Lakers‚Äô ring too? Of course not. Injuries happen. LeBron‚Äôs Lakers ring isn‚Äôt cheapened because the Heat were decimated by injuries. Neither is Giannis‚Äô."
"For some reason Pick 13 and Pick 15 have been amazing picks for various teams over the years.  Pick 13: Mitchell, Booker, Levine, Kobe, Karl Malone.   Pick 15: Giannis, Kawhi, Nash.   &amp;#x200B;  Strangely cannot say the same for the other picks from 11-16, just not on the level of 13 and 15.   Pick 11: Shai GA, Klay Thompson, Reggie Miller.   Pick 12: Steven Adams, Mookie Blaylock.  Pick 14: Michael Porter Jr, Bam Adebayo, Tim Hardaway, Clyde Drexler.   Pick 16: Ron Artest, John Stockton."
"I LIKE THE EFFORT BUDDY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL DO THAT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE OTHER TEAMS IN THE DIVISION. NETS ARE 1, BUCKS ARE 2, 6ERS ARE 3. SO NO THEY'RE NOT A TOP THREE SEED. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO LEAP FROG THE CELTICS THE KNICKS THE HAWKS AND NOT TO MENTION THE NEWLY MINTED BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE BAM ADEBAYO"
"Simmons for Butler  Simmons is friends with Bam Adebayo through discord, and that gives Miami a longer window to try to build some type of contender as Simmons is more in line age wise with Bam and Herro. It‚Äôs unlikely Miami can build a team to beat the Nets, so it‚Äôs best to move on.  For Butler he gets to more seriously compete for a championship with his friend Joel Embiid with some nice shooters around them."
That Myles Turner and Bam Adebayo duo ü•µüî•
"Jrue Holiday, Kris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irvin, Jaylen Brown. None of those are first options"
If he changed up to play as a playmaking switchable big kind of like Bam Adebayo then he'd be fine. Problem is he thinks he always has to have the ball and when he doesn't have it he literally just stands around.
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"Bit early to call but yeah, I tend to agree:   **2020**: Josh Green at 18 and left Saddiq Bey, Tyrese Maxey, Immanuel Quickley and Desmond Bane on the board.   **2019:** Dennis Smith Jr at 9 and left Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo and John Collins on the board.   Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Saddiq Bey, Kristaps Porzingis, Dwight Powell/Maxi Kleber."
"Who you got winning? Bam Adebayo?  (Giannis obviously wins if he qualifies, though for what you're going for, he should be left out)"

"Who's filling out the SF, PF, and C spots? If it's just role players, then they're a non-playoff team. If you put a good All-Star next to them (i.e Paul George, healthy Zion, Butler, etc.), I'd say 2nd round exit.   A good, fun, contending lineup for the Ball bros would be:  Lamelo, Lonzo, Paul George, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bam Adebayo  LiAngelo is your 11th/12th man"
Bam Adebayo tricked me he not that good
"Jimmy signed with Miami in 2019:  Start: Wade, Robinson, Butler, James, Bosh  Off the bench you have Dragic leading a bench mob of Adebayo, Battier, Allen, and Ellington.  Thats an elite defensive team with a lot of talented iso scorers, elite playmaking, and some of the best shooters in the league outside of Steph and Klay.    Peak KD warriors (which is probably the 2017 team, not the 2018 team) is obviously a fucking cheat code, but Miami has the tools here to at least challenge them. It would be a 6 or 7 game series.  The Warriors death lineup revolved around small ball switching and running teams off the court, but with Bam and Bosh as the team's two centers, they'd be able to keep up with that lineup defensively as well as anybody, Bam is obviously a gifted perimeter defender and Bosh is capable on the switch as well."

Bulls really lost to a team missing Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro
"Bam Adebayo was a top 5 ranked high school prospect, fell to 14 in the draft, and is now a top 5 player from that class"
"Gobert is a historic level defensive rim protector which Nurkic has never been  Which center can? A few can, like Davis but you will come in and say he isn't a center, Bam Adebayo can, Draymond can when he plays center and he plays it a lot, Myles Turner, Ayton etc"
Tbf I think Simmons probably is but he's not playing right now.  [This is a great article with a bunch of examples at the bottom w/context.](https://www-si-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2021/04/28/bam-adebayo-heat-defense?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#aoh=16379606852115&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fnba%2F2021%2F04%2F28%2Fbam-adebayo-heat-defense)
"I promise you Bam Adebayo is not the best wing defender in the league, that would be Jrue Holiday, or Ben Simmons. Hes your boy though, so I get it but lets not take it too far"
"It's fascinating to me how, even though this era is thought of as guard and wing dominated, there are so many teams that would kill for a Clint Capella, Jarret Allen, or Bam Adebayo type center. The Mavs, Raptors, and Thunder immediately jump to mind, as well as the Kings, Hornets, and Wizards to a lesser extent."

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Deni Avdija allows 0.54 points per isolation possession. It's the best result in the league by wide gap among all players which defended  at least 20 iso possessions (2nd place allows 0.68 pts). And he almost always defends the best scorer of the other team on the floor e.g guys like KD, Harden, Giannis, Butler, when needed he also defends against bigs like JJJ or Bam Adebayo, and also against guards like VanVleet or Rozier... (look https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive&amp;sort=PPP&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=POSS\*G\*25)  He also was 6th in DFG% among all players with at least 100 DFGA at 36.9% before the last game... and in the last game against Charlotte opponents were something like  1 FG on 13 FGA with 2 blocks so now his DFG% is even better (look https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?CF=D\_FGA\*G\*100&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=D\_FG\_PCT&amp;dir=-1)  He also ranks 9th (and 27th overall) in the Defensive RAPTOR  metric (look https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/ )   And also 11th in   ( look [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_2022\_advanced.html#advanced\_stats::dbpm](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_advanced.html#advanced_stats::dbpm))  So if Wizards continue to be play-off team and his minutes continue to go up (more about it in a minute) he can be seriously considered for maybe... 2nd all-NBA defensive team  &amp;#x200B;  Now. The other fact people forget is that he was back from rather significant injury just before start of the season (started ramp-up full activity only in pre-season camp and even missed first pre-season game)  So in October his production was 4.7 pts (44.8 TS%) , 5.3 reb, 1.2 ast - 20.0 minutes  per game  And in November it is 6.9pts (57.3 TS%) , 5.7 reb, 1.5 ast  - 22.8 minutes  per game  Still not great but I think that it's clearly positive tendency"
"It's stupid with or without context.  The best player picked after Fox is like Donovon Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.  They went 13th/14th at the time.  Even if it may have worked out, that's such a reach for 5th.    And Haliburton at 12th, is there even a player in that draft that would've been better?  They're just hating to hate.   For a draft thing to be a true mistake, I think you should have to have reached on someone, or picked someone where the next pick or 2 are just supremely better.  Getting Fox was such a reasonable pick and no one til 13th is better.  Im not sure anyone drafted after Hali is better"
"yeah he was almost the athlete Wilt was, which is to say elite of elite. he'd at least be more like Bam Adebayo but with Draymonds brain. super underated player just because dudes back then had no idea what was efficient or not, with no 3 point line, so everyone just ran from basket to basket chucking shit up. lol"

Bam Adebayo.
"Leftovers? Mitchell was the 13th pick. Fox averaged 25 pts at 47% shooting + 7 assists last season. Among all those players, Lonzo belongs at best among the 10 top picks. A top 3 for him is a fucking absurd, we're talking about the draft who had Mitchell, Tatum and Fox, then you have Bam Adebayo, John Collins, Jarret Allen... how in the name of hell Lonzo belongs in a top 3 among these players? And again, a top pick between 1 and 3 is supposed to have a talent level similar to Tatum, Luka, Embiid, etc.. you name it, that's their supposed potential, how Lonzo gets close to that? It's unbelievable how people have the audacity of defending this dude, the reality show bullshit is still in effect after 4 years?"

"Only through solidarity will the GMs of the NBA continue to be able to create toxic workplace environments, harass &amp; belittle their employees all while trading future picks for albatross contracts attached to washed stars of yore in a last-ditch effort to save their jobs.   Also if handing out $200M+ worth of contracts to Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Meyers Leonard &amp; Moe Harkless and then passing on the likes of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby &amp; John Collins for Zach Collins isn't justifiable cause to fire someone IDK what is..."
"Bam Adebayo is the only dude that can possibly contain this guy and he still drops 20 easily on him, just insane"
I'd go with:  1. Draymond Green  2. Bam Adebayo  3. Rudy Gobert
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
So Bam Adebayo is the key?
"Bam ""Andre Drummond"" Adebayo"
"Yeah and they had Bam Adebayo above Joel Embiid.  I love Bam and think he's a very good player, but you're legitimately smoking crack if you would take him over Joel Embiid"
Really you won a championship? Lets see some pictures of the parade.. oh wait you beat the depleated Miami heat without dragic AND bam adebayo. Oh and they never had to play the clips. Most pathetic championship ever. Good thing there was no parade
"[Dispelling Myths Around Gobert‚Äôs Defense](https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/)  &gt; Myth #1: Gobert can‚Äôt guard on the perimeter  &gt; Let‚Äôs start with isolation defense. This year, there were 87 players that guarded at least 50 isolations. **If mainstream highlight reels are your source of information here, you‚Äôd expect to see Rudy at the bottom of the pack. Actually, the opposite is true**. Gobert allows the seventh fewest points per possession (PPP). Opponents score an average of 0.71 points per isolation when Gobert is defending. **That‚Äôs less than Simmons (0.73), Anunoby (0.76), Bam Adebayo (0.78), Mikal Bridges (0.97), Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.06), Clint Capela (1.07), and Myles Turner (1.08)**. Gobert also allows the third lowest scoring frequency (30.6%), the eighth lowest FG% (32%), and the fourth lowest FT throw frequency (4.7%) when guarding opponents in isolation.  Wait, so you don't think having 4 other meh to poor defenders on your team would contribute to a DPOY centre getting dunked on? How do you think an offensive player gets a chance to dunk on Gobert? They have to first get downhill into the paint, which would mean they blow by their defender in isolation (which happens a lot for the Jazz) or through handoffs/screens. If you have bad defenders, do you think it makes it easier or harder for a player to get into the paint with enough freedom to go up and dunk on a 7'1 DPOY centre? And do you think having bad defenders would hold up an offensive player long enough for a big man to get into help position and ready up for a good contest vs being late on the contest? Defense is a team game, not even Rudy Gobert can single handedly cover up all the issues with the Jazz's defense, issues that aren't on him but his teammates and the coaching staff having a defensive system that is ""let Rudy Gobert just clean up your fuck ups""."
ADs not a good defensive player. Go ahead downvoted me. He's an above average rim protector. Slightly above average. Miles behind someone like Giannis or even bam adebayo
"Not really. On similarly difficult schedules the Clippers are 8-5 and the Heat 9-5 (Jimmy's games are 7-4) - whereas while Butler has Bam Adebayo, Lowry and Herro (who I include in this list completely unironically), the peaks of PG's supporting cast are probably Batum and Reggie Jackson.  By the boxscores PG is 26.5/8/5, Butler is 23.5/5.5/5 albeit on better efficiency - but Butler has twice as many of his shots assisted and hopefully not too controversial but Lowry&gt;Bledsoe."
Ehh Calipri says a lot of things. He also said Bam Adebayo is the first point center that is revolutionizing the game and that the league has nobody tht can run the point like Bam can at 6‚Äô9 lol
"Daniel Theis with the 5 TOs  KPJ with 2-11 and 5 missed open layups   Silas with the clueless coaching  Silas trick y‚Äôall man, he ain‚Äôt coaching, he just pretending to coach and smiling  Man is using Theis like he‚Äôs Bam Adebayo. He‚Äôs using him as a roller in PNR when we have Christian Wood  Wood at center should be the way.   Anywaysss, Jabari Smith JR and Patrick Baldwin Jr on the way. Need Sengun and Green to be patient, we not surrounding you with these bums in your primes"
Bam Adebayo full name is Edrice Bamonte Adebayo Dattebayo
Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo no  Dani Avdjia yes   Ok lol
Right now I‚Äôd say   1.	Draymond  2.	Giannis 3.	Gobert 4.	Paul George  Although what‚Äôs crazy is so far this season the top 10 by defensive rating are:   1.	Jokic 2.	Gobert 3.	Draymond 4.	Paul George 5.	Steph Curry  6.	Bam Adebayo 7.	Nic Batum 8.	Nurkic 9.	Jarrett Allen 10. Jordan Poole
"Unlike the Heat, that need to rely on cats like Bam Adebayo and Kyle Lowry."

"Spot on.  My only update is that Jimmy Butler is most like Kise. Noted for having a complete all-around playstyle with less emphasis on the three, plays true small forward (vs. Lavine and George who also often listed as SF/SG), has outside business and modeling interests, known for a more humorous personality, adapts his playstyle depending on the situation (like in the scrimmage with the third stringers where he only shot the ball once), and can enter the Zone to compete one-on-one with the greatest like in his 40-point triple double win against the Lakers in the Finals when Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic were out.  &amp;#x200B;  My only"

"Notice the trends in the East. Also notice the Heat didn‚Äôt win because Jimmy Butler led Heat were not enough against LeBron AD led Lakers. Also It‚Äôs not just Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo was also an All Star at that point.   Also the Raptors have Kawhi a top 5 player, Lowry was playing like an All Star, Siakam was playing like an All Star his MIP season, with Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, FVV and all around depth..  Those are a bunch of talents and Star players. And the Raptors still wouldn‚Äôt win if the Warriors didn‚Äôt lose 2 of their star players in KD and Klay"
No it's clearly Bam Adebayo and unless he gets injured or Miami have a major slump he'll win DPOY.   With that being said Mobley will definitely compete for DPOY awards in the future if he keeps it up
Bam Adebayo
What does Jimmy have to do with that? From when Butler checked into the game with 6:47 left:  * 6:32 - Tyler Herro missed 3PT Shot * 6:24 - Tyler Herro floating jumper * 5:55 - Kyle Lowry Free Throws * 5:20 - Tyler Herro jump shot * 4:53 - Kyle Lowry turnover * 4:18 - Tyler Herro turnover * 3:38 - Caleb Martin missed 3PT Shot * 3:13 - Bam Adebayo missed shot * 2:44 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 2:13 - Caleb Martin missed layup. * 1:47 - Jimmy Butler free throws * 1:11 - Jimmy Butler jumpshot * 42.9 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 17.6 - Tyler Herro free throws * 10.4 - Jimmy Butler free throws  Jimmy was in the game almost 4 minutes before he had a possession finishing action. A big problem with Miami down the stretch was that the offense wasn't funneling through Butler for large stretches of the 4th until he decided to take control of the situation once the lead shrunk very small.
"Closest defender stats are wildly different from how we view them. Decent contests from our perspective  are often classified as ""Open - 2-4 ft"". That dagger 3 by AD over Adebayo in the Finals is a good example. Bam is right there with his hand up but it's considered a wide open 3"
"Bam Adebayo is currently the 3rd option on the Heat, but I expect Herro‚Äôs usage rating to drop off below Bam‚Äôs as the season goes on."

Lonzo Ball  Paul George  Rudy Gobert  Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo
Chris Bosh with better defense. Or a taller Bam Adebayo. Both which are HOF caliber players   People say AD but I‚Äôm not sure his offense will get there  AD was a guard who went through a serious growth spurt. His fluidity on offense can‚Äôt be taught

Is Bam Adebayo the sweatiest guy in NBA history?
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there‚Äôs still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who‚Äôll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."
What the fuck rating system are you using that puts Trez and Dre over guys like KAT and Bam Adebayo?
No offense to John Collins but teams are gonna be willing to tie up cap space for Deandre Ayton. He‚Äôs a legit #1 pick who‚Äôs over shadowed by being in Luka and Traes class and on Devin Bookers team. He‚Äôs probably one of the most talented big men in the league while also being one of the best all around defensively and he‚Äôs only 23. His floor is being an elite rim runner who can hit his free throws and his ceiling is being a bigger bam adebayo. The suns are fucking up with a great talent just because he‚Äôs not luka.
"&gt; -Jimmy Butler currently leads the league in Defensive Win Shares, followed closely by Bam Adebayo at No. 4. Tyler Herro (17), Kyle Lowry (18) and Duncan Robinson (19) all sit within the Top 20.  - Jimmy Butler currently leads the league in Defensive Points Saved at +21.59. Bam Adebayo is No. 6 at +8.81.  These are literally just stats that look at team defensive rating and mostly assign credit based on minutes played  Defensive Win Shares is not even a useful stat OVER MULTI-SEASON STRETCHES. Absolutely kills me when people use it for like 6 games lol"

"Yes he was. You're going to pretend like you watched 18 and 19 year old Kobe play in the NBA? Green has already made some defensive stops that show his potential. He literally guarded Tatum for one possession and shut him down. Tatum is tall, long and one of the best one v one players in the whole league and a 19 year old was able to stop him with no help. All young players look lost on defense, especially when you're playing for a terrible team with many other young players and an inexperienced coach. Do you think Green's defense would still be looked at as bad if he played alongside Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler and coached by Spoelstra in that Heat team with that tough culture cultivated by Pat Riley?"

BAM ADEBAYO
"Paywall   Heat, P.J. Tucker not interested in hype, just beating opponents to a pulp  Ira Winderman South Florida Sun Sentinel  Oct 28, 2021 at 9:07 AM  MIAMI ‚Äî P.J. Tucker did not arrive to the Miami Heat as some sort of promotional vehicle, even with his build as a compact Mack Truck.  So while Heat Nation, Heat Culture, The Kennel and other buzzwords have become part of the Miami Heat lexicon, the 6-foot-5, 245-pound veteran power forward shoos them aside, just as he does opposing big men when fighting for rebounds.  With the Heat at 3-1 after Wednesday night‚Äôs 106-93 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, Tucker bodied up against early-season Heat hype with the same vigor he utilized in defending Kevin Durant at Barclays Center.  ‚ÄúAs players, you don‚Äôt think about it like that,‚Äù Tucker said of the catchphrases that supposedly crystalize and define this season‚Äôs Heat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòOh, he‚Äôs a dog.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like an energy. The way y‚Äôall talk about it, it‚Äôs not like that. We just go out and play. We just play.‚Äù  If anything, Tucker said, it is as simple as a matter of trust, that with so many quality individual defenders alongside, including Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry, there is no second thought about switching on defense and allowing a teammate to momentarily handle a challenge such as Durant.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be on a team where you can really be happy to trade off,‚Äù Tucker said. ‚ÄúI can be on KD and Bam will switch, and I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòcool.‚Äô Jimmy will switch, I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòcool.‚Äô Kyle will switch, it‚Äôs like ‚Äòcool.‚Äô  ‚ÄúI know what those guys are going to do. They‚Äôre going to play hard, they‚Äôre going to give everything they got. Whether they score or not, do it again the next possession and we can talk to each other. Bam can say whatever to me, I can say whatever to him, and then we can yell at each other, and then go out there and we‚Äôre going to play and it‚Äôs done. To have that kind of chemistry with guys this early in the season, it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù  With the NBA back to a typical 82-game schedule after regular seasons were reduced to 73 and 72 games the past two years by the pandemic, the reality is the Heat are just a single week in, as they turn their attention to Friday‚Äôs visit by the Charlotte Hornets to FTX Arena.  ‚ÄúWho cares, man?‚Äù Tucker said when asked about quality victories over a pair of Eastern Conference favorites, in the Bucks and Nets. ‚ÄúListen, man, we just played our fourth game. We got to build. We‚Äôre going to go through some stretches where we‚Äôre going to be bad. It‚Äôs just not going to be good. But it‚Äôs how we come out of that.  ‚ÄúLike [Wednesday], they took the lead. We could have given up and been like, ‚ÄòAw.‚Äô But we fought. To get that this early in the season, it‚Äôs nice regardless of how the game went, the refs, shots made, shots missed. I just like our competitiveness and how much we fought. This early in the season, that‚Äôs all you can ask for.‚Äù  Since the start of the season, Adebayo has spoken of how the Heat have come to view the locker room as a kennel, a place for hungry dogs, or dawgs, to fight their way to respect.  Such is the impetuousness of a 24-year-old.  But when the analogy was raised to Butler, 32, he rolled his eyes as he shared a glance at Tucker, 36."

Bam Adebayo
"Yo these are good points! Saddiq is on a tear for sure, and agree he is easily our best player right bows  I honestly think Stew has been pretty awesome on defense. He switches really well onto wings and guards and can stay in front of them for the most part. I think he‚Äôs possibly the biggest reason why we‚Äôve had defensive success. Also while he‚Äôs not scoring very much, he‚Äôs stretching the floor really well again this year.   I agree we need more from him, but he‚Äôs doing a lot of things well atm. He really does remind me a lot of Bam Adebayo, save a few differences."
"I don't remember the Celtics or Raptors being considered serious contenders against the Bucks, only the Heat because of interior defence (Bam Adebayo) and good 3-pt shooting. I'm not implying that the Heat winning the EC that year was a fluke, as you went 3-0 vs the Bucks and beat them in 5 games. Also, if I recall correctly the only game they beat you was an OT win. So even if the bubble did have some effect on the series, I don't think the Bucks having HC advantage would change the result (maybe they could extend the series to 6 or 7 games at best).  It is however extremely unusual for a Finals team to get swept in R1 the following year, but weird things do happen. And it was to the eventual champs."
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"Start: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle, Bam Adebayo  Cut: The rest of em  Shooting guard is definitely the most difficult to decide. Close race between all of them."
"Bam Adebayo on Jimmy wanting him to be more aggressive: He wanted bully ball right.....I talked to Jimmy, he does want me to be more aggressive. I just got to find that balance. You know me, I like to pass. The role I'm in now, shoot first. He's been harping on me about that.  [Original source Here:](https://mobile.twitter.com/Brendan_Tobin/status/1383918325198049297)"
"Gobert has been the best player on the best team this season. That's why I rank him higher than Bam at the moment. That said, I have a lot of respect for Adebayo and actually had him as the 3rd ranked center in the NBA this offseason. His domination of the ECF was super impressive."
HIS NAME IS BAM ADEBAYO
"Along with the buzzer-beater, Bam Adebayo held the Nets to 3-17 shooting as the primary defender today."
"Bam is a great defender, but he‚Äôs not better than Ben. As Ben can guard anywhere from a point guard to a center if he wanted to and Ben‚Äôs 2 inches taller than Adebayo. Not to mention he‚Äôs a much better perimeter defender as well."
Bam Adebayo MVP
why does Bam Adebayo turn into god against us
"I think the 76ers would prefer to play Boston, because Joel Embiid has a tendency to feast against us. None of our C's match up well against him, and people always mention 'stopping,' Embiid, but you can't really stop him, more like slow him down.  I do think I'd rather have the Bucks or the Hawks, but I'm not gonna pretend to act like the Heat/76ers don't scare me.  Embiid/Simmons has been on a tear/bench way ahead of last year's, and the Heat have been struggling, but they're a team that potentially could be a dark horse contender like last year. (I'm not counting out Jimmy McBuckets or Bam, 'I'll-Block-The-Game-Winning-Dunk' Adebayo."
"Its because LeBrons the GOAT, nobody gives a shit about duncan robinson and bam adebayo"
"Th√© only point of contention I have is as you typed out Brons build and vert, it‚Äôs or actually identical to Bam Adebayo"
He sat Tim Duncan out in the NBA finals for defense  He chose Mason Plumlee over Bam Adebayo for Team USA then lost with the dream team
"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
"Tyle Herro got a song named after him and has 2.4M followers on Instagram. Bam Adebayo has 748k.  My friends who are not into basketball at all know Kelly Oubre Jr and follow him on socials, but they probably have no idea who Julius Randle is. Oubre has 2M on Instagram, Randle hasn't even hit 900k."
"Whenever Bam Adebayo blocks tatum  ""This ain't tookay!"""
"Raptors fans don't hate Jeremy Lin, but I think we get especially annoyed by people who think he should still be in the league.  Bam Adebayo injured Fred with a dirty screen in the last game of the 2018 season and I'm not sure everyone forgives him"
The Chad Bam Adebayo vs the Chad Jayson Tatum
"There were multiple games there where Tyler Herro or Bam Adebayo were the best players on their teams. More times than not honestly. They got to the finals off team basketball, Jimmy wasn‚Äôt carrying them there on his back like Tatum and Brown were."

He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
"Fox is super emotional but also smart so I wouldn't expect him to do anything more destructive than start slinging the ball with 1 second left in a game. I'll never forget when he managed to still give a passable interview while crying from an NCAA tournament loss minutes before, consoling Bam Adebayo right beside him. I hope he doesn't start getting a bad reputation from media or social media."

PG: Kyle Lowry 17.1 SG: James Harden 25.2 SF: Andre Igoudala 4.4 PF: Jae Crowder 10.3 C: Bam Adebayo 19
"I agree he is serviceable, but serviceable can still be exploited is what I‚Äôm saying.   If you have bam out on the perimeter too you can sag off him, because you know he doesn‚Äôt really score often from 10-16 ft and even when he does it‚Äôs at a fairly low efficiency compared to other plays.   You can easily sag off Adebayo, as he doesn‚Äôt have the shooting or dribble drive game to take advantage of sagging off him. It isn‚Äôt going to work 100% of the time, but it can work wonders in a playoff series."
"Are you really trying to compare Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid to Bam Adebayo? They are tier 1 players, Adebayo ain‚Äôt. It‚Äôs obvious that they will get criticized more."
"The heat have no anwser for Brook Lopez' size and they don't have the shooting to punish the Bucks for playing him, atleast not as long as Bam Adebayo keeps pretending he's allergic to taking shots.    In the possible matchup vs the Nets I think we'll see a lot more PJ Tucker as opposed to Brook Lopez."
"One fluke playoff run turned Jimmy Butler into a superstar, Bam Adebayo into a top 5 center and Tyler Herro into the next Devin Booker"
It felt as if the game was over the moment Bam Adebayo went 0-3 with the first three possessions in the game. Awful body language and demeanor. They had to bring in Dedmon for any offensive spark and thats a huge red flag because that dude doesn't know where to be on set plays and defensive rotations.
I just want to see Bam Adebayo shoot over 60% from the field in Game 3.
Missing person alert for BAM ADEBAYO
Nah worst case scenario is Bam Adebayo hitting a funk and then mentally regressing at the very end of the season.     His avg stat line for the last 3 games against Milwuakee is the main reason why Miami is down 0-2. I don't know if it's the size in the paint or what but dude looks so frustrated to the point of tears.
I'm not happy we got blown out but all Miami has to do is defend home court. I don't think they're sinking 18+ 3s again this series.      This series is far from over but Bam Adebayo needs to figure his shit out otherwise everyone will forget about his breakout year last year.
"They're saying now how r/nba just hates the Heat's success and people need to grow up, etc. Also saying crazy stuff like Dewayne Dedmon should be starting over Bam Adebayo lol"
"Bam ""Bismack Biyombo"" Adebayo"
Bam and Adebayo?
MAYBE BRING BACK SHAQ IN HEAT?  YOU CAN USE HIM NOW BECAUSE BAM ADEBAYO IS A BUM RN
ROBERT SWIFT &gt; BAM ADEBAYO
CHRIS ANDERSEN &gt; BAM ADEBAYO
&gt; spo finally wised up and played dedmon &amp; adebayo together. not to toot my own horn but i called it.  Bam is at his best when paired with a stretch big (Dedmon can hit 3s). Olynyk and Leonard was great for him last season.
wut  Edit: ok I see you changed it lol. It said bam and adebayo and my drunk ass read it 5 times trying to figure out what was going on
"I like the intensity from Miami in the 2nd quarter, felt like they were asleep in the 1st with zero energy.      But it's game 2 of the playoffs, I don't know if the lights are becoming too bright for some of these guys on the road but Miami is fucked if Bam Adebayo doesn't snap out of it."
Bam and adebayo? You having a stroke?
damn thought that was drummond out there but it's bam adebayo
"but but bam and adebayo just needs to play their averages, lmaooooooooo"
jimmy stupidly locked in doe. he botta call rachel nichols and blame bam adebayo on their poor performance
Remember when people trashed Duncan Robinson for only putting up numbers in the bubble?     Let me introduce you to Bam Adebayo.
Wow Bam Adebayo has looked like absolute garbage the past 2 games. I know Robin Lopez is a hard match up for him since he cant bully his way to the basket but man he looks like he's checked out mentally.
"Bam Adebayo would do well, I think."
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
"&gt; So far this season, Ayton has flourished playing a two-way game that reaches rarified territory among All-Star big men. Ayton is one of eight centers producing +0.71 points of offensive impact and +0.50 points of defensive impact per 100 possessions, according to B-Ball Index; he and the Heat‚Äôs Bam Adebayo are the only other centers younger than 25 matching these marks. Per B-Ball Index, Ayton is first in the matchup difficulty metric (players he guards are high impact, high usage offensive options that other bigs don‚Äôt take on) among 37 centers who played 1,000 minutes this season. In addition, Ayton and Rudy Gobert of the Jazz are the NBA leaders in screen assists per 100 possessions and roll man impact per 100 possessions.  &gt; ‚ÄúI want to be certified as the best young two-way center who‚Äôs ever played the game,‚Äù Ayton told The Athletic. ‚ÄúI definitely see myself as being that player, but better. Being the guy that‚Äôs known for that, and not just capable of that. Defense is so important to my play style and that‚Äôs what creates my offense and that‚Äôs what helps my team score. Defense wins games ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what I want to be known for when I‚Äôm done with this thing."
"When it‚Äôs Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Jrue Holiday, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and P.J. Tucker on the floor? You‚Äôre not gonna see many easy buckets."
"Nikola Jokic   Joel Embiid   Rudy Gobert   KAT   Clint Capela   Nikola Vucevic   Bam Adebayo   Myles Turner    I think he‚Äôs around top 10, I guess depending on how you classify some guys like AD, Wood, etc.  Are there any obvious centers I‚Äôm missing who you rate over Nurk?"
Robert Williams and Deanthony Melton continuing the per 36 monster tradition from Bam Adebayo
"Also one issue I see is he has no clue how to use a pick and roll to either get a favourable matchup or get someone else open, he kept trying to iso bam adebayo who's one of the best guys in the league in defending him.  I agree he should initiate the offense less, they weren't getting many good offensive possessions when he was running the point"
"Yeah, not gonna lie I was pretty relieved when I saw the personnel they had out there on that play once Dragic was running the inbound. With it having to be a catch and shoot play, you had Butler (not a good shooter the past couple seasons), Adebayo (not a shooter), Duncan Robinson (so help me this man better start missing next game), and Trevor Ariza (ok shooter but not spectacular this season) out as potential shooters. That's two guys I'm perfectly ok giving the last shot to, and another that isn't a ""defend him on the catch and shoot no matter what"" level guy. I think it makes way more sense to have one of either Bam or Butler running the inbound and moving Dragic to one of the potential inbound targets."
I can‚Äôt count on my fingers and toes how many illegal screens Bam Adebayo set today
*Why were 12 players drafted before Bam Adebayo?!*
Bam Adebayo still sleeping..
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
Bam Adebayo at 14
5. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (1.2 percent)  5. Bam Adebayo (1.2 percent)
"The Lakers, Philadelphia and New York are the standouts to me. Philadelphia have a lot of great defensive personnel; and the Lakers and Knicks are coached really well defensively. Gobert and Embiid are great at rim protection. Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Thybulle, Caruso and Jrue Holiday are great on the perimeter. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green and Giannis are great help defenders."

Only 3 separate for Bam adebayo and Magic Johnson
Bam Adebayo and Bill Russell can be connected by only four players. That's insanity to me.
"That Bam is a more valuable defender due to his role as a rim protector, but is still more versatile because he can defend P&amp;R's both as the guard and the big man, is elite at closing out on the perimeter &amp; at the rim and is legitimately a better defender 1-5.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mib3dr/highlight\_bam\_puts\_the\_clamps\_on\_steph\_resulting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mib3dr/highlight_bam_puts_the_clamps_on_steph_resulting/)   There's a clip further down, 2nd top comment that shows him clamp Curry again.  He's also a good defender 1on1, the most recent stat I found shows his D on premier players  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/me0gw9/notable\_players\_when\_guarded\_by\_bam\_adebayo\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/me0gw9/notable_players_when_guarded_by_bam_adebayo_this/)   [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nbxtin/mvp\_candidate\_joel\_embiid\_vs\_bam\_adebayo\_tonight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nbxtin/mvp_candidate_joel_embiid_vs_bam_adebayo_tonight/)   [https://www.si.com/nba/2021/04/28/bam-adebayo-heat-defense?utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/04/28/bam-adebayo-heat-defense?utm_source=reddit.com) (the clip of him vs the Pacers is crazy)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtmxdn/espn\_stats\_info\_along\_with\_the\_buzzerbeater\_bam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtmxdn/espn_stats_info_along_with_the_buzzerbeater_bam/)   [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtticd/highlight\_bam\_adebayos\_defense\_on\_kyrie\_irving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtticd/highlight_bam_adebayos_defense_on_kyrie_irving/)   Look at how valuable his game is come playoff time especially. His defensive abilities were on full array last playoffs."
"would literally be unanimous (so far) if Chris Haynes didn't use his ballot as a chance to set himself apart by not even putting Randle on the ballot, putting Curry on his 2nd team along with Bam Adebayo, etc"
"On my team? Bam Adebayo, not on my team, Chris Paul or Jokic probably."
"Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, and Jayson Tatum probably won't even make All-NBA this year, so I'm going to say there are at least 20-25 guys in the NBA who you can build around.  They're not all top-7 guaranteed playoff run guys, but they're building blocks."

"How did I know a Philly flair would be posting this after the ""MVP candidate Joel Embiid vs Bam Adebayo tonight: 1/5 Fgs, 2 points, 3 turnovers."" post from a few days ago hahahaha ohh this sub"
"Bam ""Ben Simmons"" Adebayo."
"I dunno, one of the main reasons the Celtics got beat by Miami is because they had absolutely no answer for Bam Adebayo. Given that, I can't imagine what Anthony Davis would have done against them."
"Did anyone else catch Rose when talking to Mobely about a comparison to ""fellow USC alumni, Bam Adebayo""?"
Did Jalen just say Bam Adebayo is from USC? He went to Kentucky.  I think he confused him with Okongwu.
"Jalen Rose said ""fellow USC alum Bam Adebayo??"" Lmao Bam did not go to USC."
Usc alum bam adebayo??
2022: Lillard   2023: Edrice   2024: Femi   2025: Adebayo   2026: Bam
"&gt;Bam Adebayo was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  &gt;Jimmy Butler was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  Both these player's get most of their points within the paint. To open up the paint for easier scoring, we need spacing. We had ZERO spacing all year and in the playoff's, the Mammoths that are the Bucks front court just packed up the paint and neutralized that aspect of our game. Hard to be a factor in the paint when one of your main shooters has gone ICE COLD because he can't create separation from other guards."
"Bam Adebayo was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  Jimmy Butler was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  The whole team completely shit the bed, probably due to the fatigue of the compressed schedule over the last year."
"Middleton, KD, Bam Adebayo, Harden, DBook, Draymond Green, Beal, Dame, Jayson Tatum  And now Kevin Love"
"So in your opinion   Bam Adebayo is also completely useless right?   Gobert for sure, Clint Capela, etc"
"To be honest, Simmons is a 6'10 point guard who guards 6'4 guys but he can't guard big men and he can't guard elite scorers which is why Trae roasted him. It would be beneficial to him to play the 4 since he can't shoot, but at that position he can't guard big dudes which makes his value go way down.   &amp;#x200B;  Did he deserve DPOY? No. The right man won it. Rudy Gobert deserved it. Bam Adebayo was also far more deserving than Simmons."
"As a Heat fan, I would cry watching Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, and Jimmy Butler sharing the floor together. That spacing would take us back to the 1940s."
so is bam adebayo too short? he's 6'9
"2017 - give the ball to Paul George and let him do whatever he wants. Fair enough at the time, but given what other coaches were doing in the conference it was definitely uninspiring.  2018 - Surprising to even be at that spot, but Vic was playing like a top 10 player at the time of the playoffs but the Cavs countered simply by double-teaming him and we just couldn't figure it out at all.  2019 - Did not make a single adjustment once Vic went down, so much to the point that out late game crunch time offence consisted of Bojan Bogdanovic ISO-ball, because that's what we did with Oladipo in.  2020 - Did not seem to know what to do on offense with Sabonis out that didn't involve hoping TJ Warren goes nuclear. Ran tons of pointless weaves against the Heat that almost always involved switching onto and then driving straight at Bam Adebayo for some reason.   Neither of our descriptions of what happened between those years are fair but it's quite a bit more complex than you might be making it appear."
[I ain't complaining.](https://heatnation.com/media/bam-adebayo-team-usa-snub-motivating-him-breakout-season/)  Dude became an All-Star and has been All-Defense since.
"I was thinking ""Bam Adebayo, with less range, and more passive on offense,"" and I don't know why people are so convinced that that's a winning move."
"Lol, but why keep picks when you do stuff like pick Dennis Smith Jr when Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, John Collins and OG Anunoby are all still on the board?"
So Bam Adebayo? Who isnt a top 3 center in the league
"Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam or Macolm Brogdon then we didn't have picks 2 years because of bad trades."
"Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Bam Adebayo?  That spacing ü•µ"
"No one has had any verbal commitment yet, but I assume Bam Adebayo is playing and either one of Plumlee/Turner/Lopez if the US really needs some size."
"Yeah that‚Äôs true. I guess I really just think that the DPOY award can be flawed sometimes, similarly to the MVP. I‚Äôd say there were four players deserving of the award this season (in no particular order):   1.	Simmons- Obviously. He‚Äôs an elite man defender that can guard 1-5 at will.  2.	Gobert- One of, if not **the** greatest rim defenders in history, able to win DPOY multiple times from that facet alone just by his dominance.  3.	Adebayo- A bit underrated until late in the season, but probably the best perimeter defending center in the league, able to consistently hold the opposing teams‚Äô star players to well below their normal FG%.  4.	Draymond- A perfect showing of defensive versatility. Amazing on the perimeter and rim protection (especially at his size), while also elite at both man and help defense. Has the greatest defensive BBIQ of all time.  All four of these defenders could‚Äôve won this year without much outcry, but it just always seems **obvious** that Gobert should win, mainly because rim protection is the easiest detectable defense for the casual watcher, not to mention it‚Äôs the most flashy.   Additionally, it makes sense that Gobert **being** the Jazz defense gives him some more sway. Both Bam and Simmons have at least one other all-defense level player along them. However, Draymond‚Äôs basically in the same position as Gobert, and he doesn‚Äôt have that deadly, exploitable flaw. Difference between the two players is that the Jazz had the much better record. Hence, why the award is similarly flawed as the MVP. Sadly, there‚Äôs no real way to fix this issue, and Gobert definitely doesn‚Äôt **not** deserve to win so many, but still, I‚Äôd probably rather have Draymond be the 3x DPOY"
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Bam Adebayo died for this
Are you saying Ben Simmons is better then Bam Adebayo????
Bam Adebayo
Bam Adebayo lmfao

They have a dude playing like prime Olajuwon and the Heat have Bam Adebayo.  So obviously yes.
"He made a ton of mistakes in the USA v France game too. He was making mistakes like calling Jrue Holiday ""Bam Adebayo"" multiple times."
"You're making up a question that was never asked and making it seem like I answered that.  The question was ""What other countries have a legit front court?"" Not ""What countries have a front court that is going to make Bam Adebayo into BBQ chicken"""
"Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  3 letter first name, 7 letter last name, very similar first names with just a 2 letter difference  You'll be alright"
virgin bam adebayo vs Legendary Chad HaDaddy
"Jerami Grant got 0 minutes in the games that USA lost so I don't know what your point is about the team being better with him when he wasn't even given a chance.  Devin booker was on a 11 hour flight a few hours before the game, and was playing in the finals less than a week ago.   Bam Adebayo played great last game, he was not the reason they lost.  Seems like you just hate every young player seeing that you ignore context and blame the them for every failure of the US team and dismiss KD or Dame's bad playing since they are ""proven"". Quit your bullshit"
"They're both FA, Miami don't need to offer anything.   Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, PF?, Bam Adebayo."
Im sure he would.....only obstacle is just telling Pat Riley to include Bam Adebayo in the trade(which he rightfully would laugh at).  Lonzo/Duncan Robinson S/T would be more feasible(I bet both fan bases wouldnt like it)
"Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo"

"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can‚Äôt just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team. I think it‚Äôs a good mix of scoring, passing, size, defense and experience.  Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
"What can Pop do when the 40 of the top American players all flake out on the team in 2019? The only notable roster cut was Bam Adebayo to make room for Mason Plumlee (egregious, yeah yeah).  Here's the [whole list] (https://i.gyazo.com/7ca4f08d4c0157b509462f1ff5e1ea93.png) of guys who didn't go though.  And I get the blowback against picking Keldon Johnson, but he was on the Select team and at least was already with the team when they lost Beal."
"4 years from now 12 man roster could realistically be any combination of:  PG: Cade Cunningham, Ja Morant, De‚ÄôAron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young SG: Brad Beal, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Green, Devin Booker SF: Jayson Tatum, Brandon Ingram,  PF: Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson C: Evan Mobley, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton  That is an absolutely stacked, deep talent pool. There was an unprecedented number of injuries and players sitting out this time around, but the USA talent pool is so incredibly deep."
"He also called Holiday ""Adebayo"" several plays in a row when Bam wasn't even on the floor..."
"Starting 5:  Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Evan Mobley  Bench: Cade Cunninghan, Mikal Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, Kevin Durant (will be like Melo in 2016)  Coach:  Pop, Monty, Kerr, Spo"

"This is what happens when you have Jerami Grant, Keldon Johnson, Javale McGee, and Bam Adebayo  Their WORST player should be Middleton or Booker."
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
the only good things I've seen today are Bam Adebayo on the boards and Jrue Holiday taking it to the basket. Everything else Team USA is doing has been straight up trash
Please keep in mind that it definitely wouldn't have been unrealistic for Bam Adebayo to play for Nigeria.
"It‚Äôs funny hearing the 3x3 guys talk so much shit on the NBA players. If some NBA guys, especially stars, went after this, they would destroy this event.  You could have a team with Curry, Harden, and KD and just put the other team on skates the entire game and end the game quickly with the 2npoint threes.   You could do a team with Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo and just steal the ball from these bums every possession. Hell, even the offensive Steph/Harden/KD team might steal the ball every possession."
Bam Adebayo only went 24 a couple of days ago feels like hes been around a lot longer
"This is a great question.  I'll keep my answers to current players.  Players I'd take over Cade is Bam Adebayo (this assumes Bam doesn't get significantly better otherwise it would be an easy decision).  He isn't an all-nba level player but his defensive versatility and skillset is very rare and valuable in todays game.  Klay Thompson and Al Horford would also be my other choices.  I'd take Cade's potential over all-stars Draymond, Ingram, Derozan and Oladipo."
Paul George for Dame is not even lmao.   But to answer your question I‚Äôd say something like Bam Adebayo for Jaylen Brown
"Between pretending to not know his birthday, and Bam Adebayo not giving him his ball back, I think Team USA is picking on Kevin."
"Of all the young guys, it seems to me like JT &amp; Lavine are already pretty polished. Zach needs to add defense to his game and JT I can‚Äôt really say what his weakness is, the guy is already All-NBA level.  Bam Adebayo is the guy who‚Äôs got the most room to grow for me. He needs to learn how to get buckets, point blank. No better place than Tokyo to learn that."
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"

Lies. Just about all of the Nigerian NBA players are currently Igbo or half Igbo in the NBA right now outside of Daniel Oturu and Bam Adebayo  Name one non Igbo Nigerian in the NBA currently that I missed?
"and Victor Oladipo, Bam Adebayo, Israel Adensanya, Anthony Joshua, David Alaba, Jerome Iginla. Some great athletes."
"It truly is. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo make a decade of my salary every game. I‚Äôm not hating. It‚Äôs just truly astonishing. We‚Äôre all shitting on Ben Simmons, meanwhile he just bought a $17 million house. It would take me 8 lifetimes of salary just to pay the principal for that lol. Jrue Holiday just got a $1 million bonus for winning the championship, it‚Äôll take me 15 years to make that. Wheretf does all the money come from? Like I understand there is ‚ÄúTV money‚Äù but where is that originating? All from advertisements?"
Not many  you need a great scheme and Bam Adebayo
The acting in that Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo commercial is atrocious.
