"Okogie is destined to be a Cardio Man, carrying on the legacies of PJ Tucker and Tony Snell, he just doesn't know it yet."
TIL Tony Snell plays for the Hawks
I'm not counting out the possibility of someone like Tony Snell randomly hitting 9 3's for absolutely no reason
You put up Tony snell numbers everytime you comment or post on this sub
"I don't know how serious Atlanta is about acquiring him but they have all of the assets going forward to cash in if they wanted to.  I'd keep Hunter and Trae off the table, but that leaves plenty of assets including Reddish, Huerter, Okongwu, Bogdan and there's good salary filler like Tony Snell. I think they own all of their FRPs moving forward too.  A trio of Trae/Beal/Gallo is Nets-lite but with a bit more depth and they'd be fun to watch."
"I kind of like the Raptors idea but I don't know if the Raptors would pull the trigger on that.  I know Denver gets mentioned as a Beal candidate but even with MPJ being an enticing prospect I don't think it's enough.  I don't see Wiggins getting moved in a Beal trade. Sure the salaries match up, but Wiggins is still a negative contract regardless of how you cut it. It'd probably be Wiseman, Oubre (expiring) and picks. I'm not sold on that either.  I think it'd either be Atlanta or Philly. Philly can offload Simmons and Atlanta has a warchest of good assets and young guys (Collins, Okongwu, Huerter, Reddish) and vets that can be attractive salary filler (Bogdan, Tony Snell) and future picks."
"I speculated today that something like Bogdan, Collins, Okongwu and a first may be enough. What do you think?   There's obviously enough assets to mess around with: Reddish, Huerter, Tony Snell. I'd keep Hunter off the table."
"The Hawks have the most assets.  I wonder if Bogdan, John Collins, Okongwu and 2 firsts would do it.  But they have plenty of other stuff to offer; Huerter, Reddish, Tony Snell as salary filler."
"John Collins, Tony Snell, Cam reddish and 2 firsts"
You must not be watching any games we have. Adams comes off the floor and our defense goes to shit. Zion is not there defensively at all and Adams covers that need. The Pels are putting up plenty of PPG. Zion and BI still fill up the bucket.   Hill would have been nice to keep but he's not on this timeline. The Pels ceiling this year is play in game. No player has played a full 82 games for the organization. Get chemistry. Learn and grow. So we chose the assets and Bledsoe contract over Hill. Bledsoe will fetch something decent for the future when we do move him. (I could see Bledsoe for Beverly + Kabengele + Oturu + couple 2nds + Protected 2027 1st OR Tony Snell + Picks from Atlanta)
Tony Snell?
"A waaaay better Tony Snell on D... that 0/0/0/0/0 game must've brought the comp up. Snell was never that great as an on ball defender. He was very smart within the system, but wasn't getting you near the game changing plays/blocks/steals/assists as Tisse in double the minutes."
"His three looked decent last year so I still have hope. Also I think there’s always a place for smart, defensively-minded players like him. He reminds me of Tony Snell but better"
"Lloyd Pierce is insistent on using the worse lineups he can possibly configure. We are short handed. So instead of playing his young stars a little more than usual he trots out lineups with Brandon Goodwin, Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and our rookie Okongwu. Combined with refusing to call a timeout."
"John Collins, Tony Snell, Cam Reddish, a couple picks"
"This is what I'd do:  **Minnesota Receive**: Ben Simmons  **76ers Receive**: Bradley Beal  **Wizards Receive**: Minnesota FRP (unprotected?) 2022/2024/2026 + pick swaps 2023/2025/2027, Anthony Edwards, Jarret Culver  Matisse Thybulle (PHI), Philly 2022 FRP (Top 15 protected, if not conveyed then 2 SRP)  Hawks FRP (Protected Top 20, 2022-2025, if not conveyed then SRP 2025/2026 conveyed), Tony Snell  **Hawks Receive**: Ricky Rubio  You could sub out the Hawks for a different team that you think could use Rubio more (maybe Blazers/Heat/Pacers/Bucks)."
[Tony Snell once played 29mins and recorded nothing except one foul](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702240MIL.html)
DJ augustin is legit gonna give us the Tony Snell line tonight
Ish Smith  Bruce Brown  Issac Bonga  Tony Snell  Felicio
Our starting center had fewer rebounds than every Hawk except Solomon Hill and Tony Snell (both coming off of the bench and playing 15 and 12 minutes respectively).  Ryan is a shit coach too.
Yeah Solomon Hill and Tony Snell and co may not be great but still better than Damian Jones and Vince Carters corpse lol
tony snell is making 3's? that dude is still in the league?
Could be worse. At least he didn't get the Tony snell all-zero game in 28 minutes
PJ dropping a Tony Snell stat line lmao
Tony Snell is on the Hawks somehow
Lost in all this other great basketball was Tony Snell’s return to action. Snell immediately contributed and gave us a signature 0-0-0-0-0 game
Tony Snell
"5 Tony Snell clones. 40% from 3, ankle breaking handles, supple touch around my rim, selfless."
Patrick Beverley is Tony Snell with confidence
"Gallonari, reddish/bogdan(whoever doesn’t start), rondo, kris Dunn, Kevin huerter, onyeka okongwu...  This is deeper than most teams(sadly 5 of these guys are injured right now), and Gallo is maybe the best player coming off the bench in the league. Not including tony snell or Solomon hill who both got solid minutes last year. Near last huh"
Is it half a Tony Snell or is it a Tony Snell in half the time??
Damn how freaking talented is the league now. Yesterday someone posted a LiAngelo and today someone posted a half Tony Snell. I feel blessed to be able to experience this era of NBA basketball.
Tony snell dropping 50😎

"Disagree, I think this is harder. One because it has to be an away game so half the time you’re not even eligible, and two because you actually have to do *something* it just has to be one really specific thing one time and no more as opposed to just doing nothing at all.  Like, insert me into literally any NBA game any time anywhere on any time and I’m 100% confident I could go out and do a Tony Snell. I’m also extremely confident that I couldn’t do a LiAngelo, even ignoring the fact it’s literally impossible half the time."
"Although difficult, certainly not more difficult than the 'tony snell'."
That’s exactly what the real Tony Snell would say
Are you really tony snell
"Hangxiety! All of my friends act like I’m nuts when I talk about feeling guilty and sure that everyone hates me the day after I drink too much. Joke’s on them, imma tell them Tony Snell gets it too."
Thibbs famously played young Jimmy over Tony Snell despite GarPax threatening to fire him if Snell wasn't a starter. Butler had just bet on himself so the Bulls front office didn't want him to breakout yet in order to have him commit long term for less money.
I'm hoping that this means Tony Snell now has the longest made free throw streak
"Siakam hurt his groin last year and turned into Tony Snell  It doesn't have to be a competition - Jaylen looks amazing, but it's true that we should wait till at least midway through the season before coming to conclusions"
"Injuries on the hawks:  * Gallo (at least 2 weeks) * Dunn (just got surgery, no idea how long recovery is) * Onyeka (Beginning to think we drafted him just so he'd look pretty on the bench) * Rondo (old) * Tony Snell (pretty sure he hasn't moved to ATL yet) * Huerter (ankle injured v. Cavs, ginger)  I'd give so much to see this team at full strength."
Whoa you take that back about Tony Snell. Seems like too nice of a guy to hate on.
Looks like Tony Snell
Tony Snell is like our 10th guy (possibly even deeper) and he has started over 200 games in the last 4 seasons.
"I swear some of you have the memories of goldfish. Giannis was stuck playing under the most spacing-averse coach in the league with dudes like Bledsoe/Parker/Henson/Monroe/MCW starting alongside him. There was basically an entire season where Middleton (who was never an All-Star until a couple seasons ago) was injured and Tony Snell was the team's best shooter. None of this stopped him from being an All-NBA player or a 27 PPG scorer before turning 24.   So sorry but ""Giannis can't score without shooting"" isn't the gotcha statement you think it is lol. Never mind I'm saying nothing anywhere near as ridiculous as ""AD sucks."" Come back when you have something to contribute"
"Trae, Collins, Bogdonavic, Gallinari, Capella, Reddish, Hunter, and Huerter (if Kennard starts for the Clippers, Huerter is a starting caliber player in my mind). Then add onto that Rondo, Okongwu, Kris Dunn, Solomon Hill, and Tony Snell. We mad deep"
Wtf is this. But honestly who could resist the Dark prince Tony Snell
Tony Snell   Khris Middleton  Bismack Biyombo   Kelly Olynyk
"Tony Snell, Jason Terry, Brandon Knight. Just mention their names and I’m sure people remember their poster."
So much disrespect to near 60% Tony Snell on 2.5 attempts per game
Tony Snell no longer just runs around
Shout out to tony snell
Would you like to learn more about our lord and savior Tony Snell?
Those teams didn't have Tony Snell
Tony Snell for All-NBA. get in like folks
It's your fault if you leave Tony Snell open.
"So I was checking his stats because of this thread, is it just me or does his pic on espn website look just.....weird?  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2528353/tony-snell"
Still better than Tony Snell.
The patented almost 30 minutes of playing and 0 points for Tony Snell
"Bro, we are starting Tony Snell right now. I kind of feel like Atl is over performing given the injuries + no camp. Also, this is the first year we are trying to win after a 3 season rebuild."
"Wiseman's not *that good*, they'd rather have Picks IMO. Warriors would also need to trade Klay.   Something like this - (Salaries work!)  ATL Gets: Klay + Wiggins (Klay+Trae+Reddish/Wiggins+Collins+Capella) would be a great lineup next year Klay+Wiggins help on D etc.   MIN Gets: Tony Snell (Expiring) for salaries + 2021 MIN 1st + 2023 GSW 1st + 2021 ATL 1st + 2022 OKC (1-14 prot) 1st + a couple seconds.  GSW Gets: KAT + Gallo + Bogdan + Rondo (Kat! + Gallo/Bogdan for even more shooting + Rondo as a backup playmaker). Giving them even more shooting + depth (Curry, Bogdan, Oubre, Dray, KAT with Rondo/Wiseman/Gallo as mix/match pieces)"
The hawks starting wings were Kevin huerter and tony snell. It’s not like we had our two actual great defensive wings out there
"No, Tony Snell starts for Reddish."
Tony Snell LMFAO
Tony Snell
"I mean, besides JC yeah weve pretty much been running this out there the past 3-4 weeks.  Gallo has been out there too but he just absolutely blows.  EIther hes still not healthy or hes just washed.  But yeah right now Tony Snell and Solomon Hill are our go to wings.  But ill give you I started using this games excuses in an argument about all season."
"The injuries with this team are unbelieveable.  We now have the worst bench in the NBA again and are down two/three starters from last year if this turns into a longterm issue.  Anyone who projects this Hawks record as a failing on Trae Young is either an idiot or is making an argument in bad faith.  Trae was just out there with Tony Snell, Skylar Mays, Okongwu, and Kevin Huerter in the early half of the 3rd quarter"
"A team to match us on players out in those trying times! Anyway, expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-21) | [](/ATL)Hawks (13-17) ---|---   D.

OP just recorded a Tony Snell
On a minimum contract as an experiment that’s just disrespectful. He can average prime Tony Snell numbers and still be worth it given the potential upside that might have existed.
Him [pulling off an actual ankle breaker](https://youtu.be/tegT43D3n_A) is still the most shocking thing I’ve ever seen on a basketball court. That’s *Tony Snell* doing that shit.
"We do if we add Tony snell and okongwu. But it was a joke, Jaylen is too good to trade for Collins."
Bojan bogdanovic for John Collins and tony snell
Worth the money even if he averages a Tony Snell plus 2 drawn fouls against Harden a game
Tony Snell I love you
Tony Snell
Nice. Tony Snell All-Star
mark jones does not know which one is Tony snell
"Nice, but this ""on pace"" doesn't really fit my sense of what on pace means. Tony Snell would have to supercharge his pace significantly to meet the reqs."
Tony Snell the GOAT?
"You asked a question in an incredibly stupid way. When I answered your question, rather than reclarifying what you meant, you doubled down with a different argument comparing Curry to Tony Snell.   Your comparison doesn't even align with your original question."
I had think outside of the box in the most stupid way possible to realize how **you** interpreted my question: when I'm asking whether volume affects percentage you think I'm asking whether 1/2 is more than 6/12.    Im fucking mindblown there is a person that is active on /r/nba that could interpet my question in the most brainless way possible    I will dumb this down as much as possible to the point where it's impossible for you to misinterpret (hopefully)   I LITERALLY GAVE YOU THE CONTEXT OF BRINGING UP THE CURRY AND SNELL ARGUMENT. VOLUME AFFECTING PERCENTAGE = SHOOTING MORE WILL MAKE THE PERCENTAGE GO UP / DOWN. IF TONY SNELL SHOOTS FROM 3 12 TIMES PER GAME HE WONT KEEP HIS HIGH PERCENTAGE. IF HARDEN ONLY CHOSE GOOD SHOTS INSTEAD OF SHOOTING 13 3s  A GAME HE WOULD SHOOT HIGHER THAN 35%.
"You're not even talking about the same thing at all though. Like at all. I don't think you even understand what you're asking.  What you've just said literally has ZERO relevance to the conversation.  Tony Snell has a higher 3 point % than Curry. Yes. That's 100% a factual statement.  I don't understand what you don't understand here...  &amp;#x200B;  What you're trying to ask is whether or not there is a statistic that takes into account the number of 3 pointers a player takes within a game as a way of discerning who is better. You asked the question incorrectly by saying ""does % take into account volume""."
I can’t tell if you’re trolling    Tony snell shoots 57% from 3 on 2.5 attempts    Curry shoots 40% from 3 on 11.5 attempts per game    Tony snell is better because his fraction/percentage is higher
Tony Snell is better than Curry¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
i say this every week but man does adam lefkoe lead a charmed life. marginally talented at best by any definition. he's just there. the broadcaster equivalent of tony snell
"This is unbelievable viewing, the only guy to attempt one and not hit is the league leader Tony Snell lol"
Tony Snell
"Tony Snell has started on literally every team he’s been on.   Death, taxes, and Tony Snell starting on your team are the constants in life"
"If Tony Snell is starting, a team has major issues"
I think you misspelled Tony Snell
Quick shout out to my boy Tony Snell
"Not being historically bad is a huge deal when literally every other player who has been healthy is a massive liability on D besides Tony Snell. Trae, Lou will, Gallo, JC, and huerter are all bad to all time bad defenders. Plus I expect the hawks to be top 20 in D at seasons end. Their remaining schedule is pretty easy"
"Huge overpay for one of the best 2 way players in the league, a guy with a fully developed offensive game, completely in control in clutch situations, highly touted as one of the best guard defenders in the league, a phenomenally hard worker and culture guy, and he's bought completely in to our team and culture in barely half a season. Man, we could have thrown that money at Tony Snell or Delly or Thon. Preferably all 3. The Bucks will regret it and want those picks back after the 3rd ring"
Tony Snell is a basketball savant
Tony Snell
"i dont watch the heat much, but from what ive seen, hes a smart cutter, really good at navigating thru screens on offense and getting open, and a really good shooter who can hit off balance 3's off screens  thats a really valuable skill set for any offense. theres a big difference between guys like tony snell who generally shoot spot up 3's only and guys like duncan robinson"
I remember Tony snell playing like 35 mins and not recording a single stat 😂 I think that was a first in nba history
"Tony ""Larry Bird"" Snell"
Tony 'Cardio' Snell
You know he wouldn’t have stayed on your roster right?   He would’ve been flipped again for cheap young guys and picks. Or knowing fertita maybe like iguadola and Tony snell lol
Tony Snell
Lol this sub would have lost their shit if Trae did the play where Curry fully kicked his left leg into Tony Snell to get the foul
Damn Tony snell really is the 🐐
I honestly never would have guessed Tony Snell shoots 40% from 3 for his career.
"I wonder how much Tony Snell is gonna get in free agency. If nobody offers a good deal, he might be a ring chaser. Contenders got their eyes on him for the right price"
capela with the 3  actually they're saying it was tony snell
"Tony ""nsinθ1 = nsinθ2"" Snell"
"That volume is so low, in my opinion any player who’s shooting 57% from 3 is doing that simply because they aren’t taking enough 3’s.   If Tony Snell is that good of a shooter, as a coach it’d be frustrating to watch him only take 3 3’s a game especially with so many injuries"
Oh no guys its TONY SNELL
if tony snell scored as many points as wilt chamberlain he would be averaging 50 points per game
Basically SJ2 is just a trailer for Space Jam 3: Snell You Later starring Atlanta Hawks Tony Snell.
Everyone always asks “where is tony snell” never “how is tony snell”
Tony Snell and Lou Williams
So superstar Tony Snell just doesn’t exist huh?
"Draymond Green, Wanamaker, BolBol, Pat Bev and Tony Snell all ahead of him tho."
Tony Snell shoots 100% from the corner it's insane
I remember when Bulls fans thought Tony Snell was gonna be the next Kawhi.
"I mean, he’s got higher usage too, which explains the extra attempts.  I’d be curious to look at their per 36 comparisons.  Joe isn’t even a starter.  Not saying it’s not impressive, just definitely a cherry-picked stat.  Tony Snell is shooting 57% from three but only averaging 2.5 attempts a game.  So why didn’t they say 1+ attempt a game or 2 or 3 or 5?  And if the extra attempts are the more impressive part why aren’t they mentioning Steph who average 40.9% on 11.5 attempts per game?  The stat was specifically picked to exclude people who are shooting just as impressively or more impressively than Joe Harris just this season, so I wouldn’t call it “the best 3pt shooting season in NBA history.”"
Tony Snell hours
[Bucks legend Tony Snell?](https://i.redd.it/ec5hi5g7ciy51.jpg)

Tony Snell breakout game
I wanna see the clutch points graphic on this. A la the classic Tony Snell all 0’s statline or his perfect game.
"gallo needed to double the instant jokic turns his shoulder to the basket on the left elbow (you can see he has half a mind to). But when gallo commits, tony snell needs to pick up millsap underneath the basket and they spin the wheel with capela running to the corner and trae recovering to campazzo. unfortunately that takes a lot of coaching for the team to do that in a live sequence"

Tony Snell unironically won us that game. Honestly a pretty terrible performance from us considering the team the Rockets had to put out there because of injuries.
Handed the 17th loss in a row thanks to Tony Snell
"They focus too much on being a football school.   Also a lot of the talent gets recruited and divvied up amongst the powerhouse Pac 12 and to some extent the Mountain West programs. If you grow up in a talent rich SoCal there isnt one or two particular programs you choose from unlike Bama/Auburn, Texas/Texas A&amp;M, Ohio/Ohio St, or Michigan/Michigan St etc...Theres a ton of options. You can go to UCLA, Arizona, ASU, Stanford, San Diego State or other really good programs on the west coast.   Also because its so talent rich, if youre a lesser star recruit for instance playing in SoCal, you might either slip through the cracks or think of being the star of a nearby Pac 12/Mountain West program than being more of a role player for USC/UCLA. (ie Kawhi at SDSU, Tony Snell at New Mexico, Spencer Dinwiddie at Colorado, Klay at Washington State, Delon Wright at Utah, Matisse Thybulle at Washington"
"Yep and Tony Snell was on Kawhi’s team, Ryan Anderson, Landry Fields, Allen Crabbe, Dinwiddie, and Darius Morris all around that time too"

Tony Snell is my lord and savior
Love for Tony Snell knows no earthly boundaries.
1. Tony Snell  2. Tony Snell  3. Tony Snell
Tony Snell hasn’t missed a free throw in over 2 years.
Tony Snell is the goat so idk man
"Based on the last game I saw, not only is Tony Snell is far and away the best player on the Hawks, but he is their go-to closer as well."
I want to burn this stat to the ground for insulting Tony Snell
Isn’t Tony Snell kind of bonkers from 3 this season?
"Give me both plus Ennis. Add 3 rotation players in one shot.  Ross + Fournier + Ennis  For  2021 1st, 2023 2nd (we have a solid one), Danny Green, Mike Scott, Ferguson, Poirier  Orlando redirects Danny Green to a 3rd team for more compensation - ATL for Tony Snell?"
All I know is Tony Snell hasn’t missed and that should be enough.
Tony Snell. No explanation needed
"This is wrong, Tony Snell actually has the highest 3pt % at 57%"
Tony Snell is missing good sir.
"Tony Snell is like the perfect complimentary piece to pretty much any team, but he's not gonna be good just on his own. But put him on a good team alongside good players who can get him open looks and he'll hit 3s and play defense like it's nobody's business."
"I mean his defense is great. It’s his offense that’s wildly inconsistent. This stat also says less about who the best defenders are and more about which players are routinely tasked with the toughest assignments.   With Dunn missing the entire year and Hunter missing the majority of it, that leaves Reddish with the task of defending the toughest assignments night in, night out. And now Reddish is out for a couple weeks, so our only wing defender left is Tony Snell lol."
"Fellow Bulls fan here, and I feel obligated to point out that Tony Snell was **not** good with us. He would randomly go off for like 27 points one game and you’d think “Alright! He’s starting to put it all together!” then he’d go back to his usual first team all-cardio form. I watched damn near every game during the Jimmy era and Tony Snell made me profoundly sad on a near nightly basis lol. I know he hit that game-winner the other night but he’s not that good now and never really was.  Hard agree on Bobby and Zach, though. I loved Ol’ Crazy Eyes but everyone else just knew him as the dude who punched Mirotic in the face. And all the Zach love this year is great, but he was basically doing the same thing last year. Can’t blame folks for not wanting to watch our game, though. The Boylen years were... rough."
Isnt Tony Snell shooting 57% from 3? GOAT imo
"Not sure if he’s played enough games, but Tony Snell is above 50% on something like 2.5 attempts per game."
"Its been a really annoying past couple years as a Bulls fan having to convince everyone of our players value from people who never watch us but have strong opinions on our players ability.   Bobby Portis, Zach Lavine, Tony Snell, Justin Holiday, Jimmy Butler if you go back far enough. The list goes on on separate accounts I've taken mad flak for just saying they're not the trash this sub acts like they are.    It really killed my engagement on here. Everyone just assumes you're a homer &amp; writes you off. Whats the point of discussing my team if somehow /r/NBA always knows better?   I wish there was a sub where we could regulate who could comment based on some way to validate if they were watching games and what games they were. They would still be able to comment but you could easily check &amp; see ""Oh they've only been verified as watching 1 Nets game this season, their opinion on them is probably malinformed &amp; can be written off."" Its authoritarian but I think the discussion &amp; content that would arise from such a thing would be really unique &amp; insightful instead of just ESPN on reddit."
"Tony snell:  &gt;""wonderin which record to smash next🤔🤔🤣🤣😅😅"""
What about Tony Snell? He’s shooting 52.9% from three
"Uh, TONY SNELL"
"You thought a guy unironically thought that Tony fucking Snell was better than Lebron. Bruh, use your noggin lol."
"Tony ""the free throw"" Snell"
Not included: the goat Tony Snell -- 57% on 2.6 3PA
"Can’t forget trae young, Steph curry, isiah Thomas, Bam, Aaron Gordon, and Tony snell."

Tony snell has arrived and will make statiscal history once again
Have you heard of Tony Snell?
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop   ""Tony Snell ain't 'bout this, Tony Snell ain't 'bout that""   My boy a BD on fucking Atlanta and them   He, he, they say that buddy don't be putting in no work   Shut the fuck up   Y'all losers ain't know shit   All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about   ""Tony Snell ain't no hitter   Tony Snell ain't this   Tony Snell a fake""   Shut the fuck up   Y'all don't live with that buddy   Y'all know that buddy got caught with a ratchet   Shootin' at the police and shit   Buddy been on probation since fuckin' I don't know when   Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that   Them Hawks savages out there   If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Tony Snell   I'm fucking beatin' they ass   I'm not fucking playin' no more   Y'all know them buddies roll with Trae Young and them"
"Tony Snell is unironically better than lebron at this point  He shoot 56% from 3, he’s been more clutch this year, he makes less mistakes on the court, and is a better defender than lebron"
Game winners Tony Snell has hit for the Hawks: 1  Game winners Lebron has hit for them: 0  &amp;#x200B;  Need I say more?
Hitting buzzer beaters finally getting a free throw what a week for Tony Snell.
He’s no Tony Snell
Tony.   Snell.
He's no Tony Snell tho
Why compare Tony Snell to lemn peppa lou tho
"I definitely think it's the most realistic package but ironically the biggest factor may be how much the team values Tony Snell of all people.   He's someone that has gone from expiring contract filler to one of the most important pieces on the team and he's basically the contract that would be used to match Edwards' big #1 overall rookie contract to supplement Collins' humble mid-late first rookie contract. If the team continues winning and clawing back into the playoff hunt under McMillian, Snell might not only stay on the roster but get a pretty sweet extension."
"Doesn't matter, Bogdan Bogdanovic &amp; Tony Snell."
Crazy part about this play is that Tony Snell made the shot.
Tony Snell deserves some recognition for shooting 57% from 3 this season

Yeah but did you guys see Tony Snell knocking down the long ball?
In this house we love and support Tony Snell
Here's Giannis falling out of bounds passes behind his back to Tony Snell for the three.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT8gEZLmATI
The most surprising part of this replay is that Tony Snell is still in the NBA
"No idea why but i thought Tony Snell was a ref, and was waiting for the baseline ref to get hit with an errant pass."
Tony Snell is in trouble if the Hawks come to town.
"Hawks also don't need him. They're loaded with wing shooters - Bogdanovic, Huerter, Lou Will, Gallinari, Hunter. Even Tony Snell shot lights out for them"
Tony Snell
Tony Snell😈
"Gar Forman is a fucking idiot and WAS the problem in Chicago.   Ask any bulls fan how they feel about that man, nobody will have anything nice to say. They got stupid lucky in drafts (somehow getting DRose in the lotto, JB turning into a legitimate all star), and had a fantastic scouting team. Gar’s actual picks were players like Tony Snell and Marquis Teague lol"
Hmm interested as well. Most likely some random NBA player that has a track background and got into basketball late. Or maybe Tony Snell he's surely got the endurance e.g. the 0-0-0-0-0 game when all he was doing was running for 28 mins lol
Tony Snell in shambles.
Shooting like Tony Snell on volume
I was sure Tony Snell was going to win it. That’s what this sub keeps telling me at least.
LaBlue Ball went full Tony Snell with a 0-0-0-0-0 stats line
"If the hawks win a ring, it ends the GOAT debate and Tony Snell can ride off into the sunset"
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/tony-snell-ts-this-season  Snell is at 72.3%
Tony Snell has a 57.5% from 3.  Stop Sleeping
&gt; Also shoutout Nikola Mirotic being -37 in the first 4.5 games despite us outscoring the Raptors over that span.  Dude one thing I wanted in that series was that Bud had the balls to bench Mirotic and allow Tony Snell to take his minutes...   I don't think it would be game changing but certainly would help the team since Snell was fundamentally a better player for us than Mirotic within his role.  Mirotic managed to play worse than Bledsoe ffs
"Sure, I agree with all of that. But I still think it's not fair to put all the blame on him. It's not like he had *this* version of Giannis and this roster in his time with Milwaukee. His top 5 in minutes played in his last full season was a 22 YO Giannis, Tony Snell, Dellavedova, Brogdon, and Greg Monroe. That's not a good defensive team, and I don't think you can put that on Kidd. In contrast, Bud's first year had 24YO Giannis, Middleton, Lopez, Bledsoe, and Brogdon as his top 5 in minutes played. That's hardly the same team.  I agree that if he's stubborn with his approach, he probably shouldn't be hired. But to instantly knock him because he wasn't amazing his first 5 years is a bit premature imo. I think it's insane that people expect every coach to be Kerr when they start, or how players are expected to instantly become Luka/Lebron or they're failures."
"Where is our lord and savior, Tony Snell?"
Wow Tony Snell getting robbed on this list.
1) Michael Jordan  2) Tony Snell
Sorry that is going to Tony Snell
Where the fuck is Tony Snell bruh
Probably around the level of Tony Snell.
Putting up Tony Snell numbers
i see no tony snell here
HE STOLE MY FLOW - Tony Snell
Prime Tony Snell
Since I’m petty I’m going to deflect the blame from the cavs to the bucks for trading their 2019 pick which turned into KPJ and tony snell for a salary dump to then not retain Malcolm Brogdan  LolBucks   but in all actuality I doubt they care since they’re a contender
Tony snell
Tony Snell. Man went from 0-0-0-0-0 to the 50-60-100 club.
"&gt;no idea how they got blown out by the Pistons though the night after  half the team is injured.   Trae Young, Lou Williams, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell were all out and Kevin Huerter and Brandon Goodwill both left the game injured."
Kawhi Leonard and Tony Snell
So is Tony Snell (57% 3pt shooting on 2.5 attempts) a much  better 3 point shooter than KD (46% on 5.4 attempts)  this season?
Tony Snell
Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
Tony Snell exists?
And Tony snell is a power forward??
Tony Snell 0/0/0/0/0
"Deandre Hunter (our second leading scorer this season), Kris Dunn, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell."
Tony Snell shaking
Tony Snell is shooting better than both. So Tony Snell &gt; everyone else in the league
Tony Snell could never
50/50/100 split Tony Snell and 0-0-0-0-0 statline Tony Snell would be the best Duo in the league
You're not even Dunn listing our injuries. How could you forget Tony Snell?
I thought Tony Snell was on that 50/50/100? What happened
"The truly funny thing about this is that both Craig and Thompson are just such extremely mediocre role player caliber guys. Sure Thompson is a little bit higher up on the hierarchy of NBA players than Craig, but its about the same as comparing two guys like Tony Snell and Robin Lopez against each other."
2019 Tony Snell
can you **SNELL** what **THE TONY** is cookin’?
"Tony snell is going to retire from the nba to chill with the homies. Still gonna put up the same stats he did on feb. 24th, 2017."
"Hawks gotta be up there. You're losing Trae, Clint, and JC.  LouWill, Bogi, Gallo, De'Andre Hunter, Nathan ""The Dark"" Knight, Kevin ""So Big It Might"" Huerter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell, Okongwu all left over. Pick your poison"
"Yep, Tony Snell is out too. Lotta injured superstars"
The touches are the opposite of limited for this stat lol. If you limited touches it would be good non passing shooters like MPJ or Tony Snell and efficient big men like Gobert
Not a single mention of who leads the race for Tony Snell?!?!
Tony Snell is the cardio king
Can we stop acting like Tony Snell isn’t the MVP
U right...I’ll change my answer to Tony Snell on the hawks
Trae on the Lakers  Hell...Tony Snell in the lakers...
"Not only that, but he nearly had a perfect Tony Snell just running up and down the court for 16 minutes if it weren’t for that 1 foul."
Tony Snell: 0/0/0
I was with you until....   &gt; unless you think Tony Snell is the best 3pt shooter in the NBA today  Tony is the Goat
"This is probably a troll post but look at the threes that he takes. Usually off-the dribble, deep threes. Those are tough and he makes them at a good percentage. Not Steph Curry percentage, but Steph is a cheat code obv.  Of course, unless you think Tony Snell is the best 3pt shooter in the NBA today"
I’ll take Tony Snell in the corner for 3 too
Tony Snell
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
You're just a Tony Snell hater. It's like I'm talking to a brick wall.
If Tony Snell scores 50 in a game I will post a video of myself eating 40pc chicken nuggets
Breaking a record of some arbitrary stat line doesnt make him a generational talent. You must also think Tony Snell is a generational player for having a 50/50/90 season lmao. No one is doing what Tony Snell is doing.
Bucks were my all time despicable team with Tony Snell Thon Maker and Eric Bledsoe I never gave them enough props now here I am
"Glad I’m not the only one, they’re borderline delusional. Who cares about postseason experience? Ohhh but they have Lou Will and Tony Snell to “contend” with on the bench lmao"
Tony Snell is the MVP
"As a pistons fan who had to suffer through watching tony snell “play basketball” for 27 minutes a game, where he essentially just jogs up and down the floor, didn’t move, set screens, or dribble the ball, while also somehow being a total defensive liability even though he was advertised as a 3&amp;D player, this is absurd.  Edit: makes more sense now, it’s on 5.5 ppg"
"Tony Snell has not missed a free throw since March 12, 2019.   That is more than two years!"
Can you Snell what the Tony is cookin??
"Noice. Joe Ingles currently sits at 52/49/87 so he's got a small chance, but certainly not as likely as Tony Snell"
"Tbh I wouldn't put it past Tony ""Michael ""Jesus Christ"" Jordan"" Snell."
This dude all over this thread like tony snell fucked his wife dudes taking it personal lol
mans putting up more 0’s than tony snell
I don’t think anyone is comparing Tony Snell to Curry/Lillard/Kemba type of guys who take OTD threes
Bulls legend Tony Snell.
"If Tony Snell scores 14,000 points over the next 16 games, does he deserve MVP?  Are the Hawks seen as title favorites?"
Fun fact: tony snell and Kawhi were on the same high school team
"&gt; Solomon Hill went 6/8 from three I think he made up for missing tony snell and others  Tony Snell is the worst player we're missing...  Just to make sure you don't read it wrong, L's an L's znd the Bucks are really good, nothing wrong with losing this one."
"You assume the bucks play the exact same defensive/offensive sets with your other players on the floor. It’s not as simple as add x player and you win. Side note, Solomon Hill  went 6/8 from three I think he made up for missing tony snell and others"
What if my favorite player is tony snell
Mikal Bridges one rebound in 20 minutes. Dude was so close to the Tony Snell stat line lol
"It's incredibly stupid and selfish to complain about being double teamed, open gym pick up game or not.  If you don't want Joakim Noah to send Tony Snell to double you, either pay him them to double you or quit your whining. No one deserves to get a handout for free."
Joakim Noah yelled to Tony Snell to go and double Book so he did.   I don’t think Tony went in there thinking “imma work on my doubles today!”
It’s even better that Bucks legend Tony Snell was the one who brought the double team in that practice game
"Worked out and played at the same LA Fitnesses as Kawhi, Tony Snell, and Michael Snaer in high school  Just occasional pickup with them (mostly before the actual good players got there)  Saw Kawhi the most. That one gym was closer to us. Very good, blocked pretty much anyone that wasn’t really good. Massive hands, could palm a 10lb barbell plate. We used to mimic him and play at the lunch tables using a Cutie (mini tangerine thing)  At the time my friends and I actually though Snaer was going to be the best of them. Boy were we wrong"
Tony Snell must’ve turned them down already
The GOAT Tony Snell must’ve turned them down already
He’s either Tony Snell or Michael Jordan lmao
"According to Knicks beat writers, Lillard is available and is coming to MSG along with DeRozan, LeBron, prime Kareem out of retirement, Wilt Chamberlain's ghost who can shoot 3s and free throws like ~~Steph Curry~~ Tony Snell, and most importantly, Bugs Fucking Bunny."
Best I can do is Tony Snell and a future 2nd rounder
The top brass wants some new blood with fresh perspective to steer this ship around. Word on the street is they're looking for someone who's able to deliver Tony Snell numbers.
Tony Snell
"Respectable, but you’re pushing it. Tony Snell better not be snubbed from your top 7 players overall list"
"Abrines is kind of whatever, Tony snell level player. Mirotic is legit starting level 4."
"That’s basically his MO, he either goes Supernova or becomes a Rich Man’s Tony Snell. Very weird."
Definitely unbiased are you? I guess KDisney turns into Tony Snell without his superteam.
"He's definitely not referring to John Collins. The Hawks only have 5 free agents; 10 players on their roster are already under contract next season:  Bogdonavic, Capela, Hunter, Young, Okongwu, Huerter, Fernando, Gallinari, Dunn, Reddish.   They spent about 115m in 2020-2021, and are spending 95m on the roster so far next year. Collins should get signed for a bit over 20m. It's a no-brainer and I'd guess he wants to stay.  &amp;#x200B;  What they're actually referring to is probably more cultural. They probably really like some of the role players they're going to have to let walk:  Tony Snell, Solomon Hill, Brandon Goodwin, but the person they're really talking about:   Lou Will. Playoffs were good for him but a really terrible regular season. This is what he's talking about. No one in that locker room wants to see him go. Get that man an assistant job"
Tony Snell from the stripe
"Tony Snell, Jamal Crawford, Tacko, Grant Williams (since you said doesn't anger *opposing* fanbases)"
"Ah yes, the old Tony Snell line"
"I remember a tweet along the lines of ""Michael Jordan is Tony Snell without therapy"""
Tony snell
Tony Snell will be back on the Bucks next season. Bet. ❤️
"Tony Snell was a fun player this season. But he did that on insanely low volume, only wide open shots created by others. Their defense isn’t even in the same league. Do you people even watch basketball or do you just look at box scores"
&gt; He got replaced by fucking Tony Snell  Who shot MORE THAN TWICE AS WELL AS HIM from 3
"He got replaced by fucking Tony Snell and Solomon Hill that is absolutely not the reason why they took off, good lord y’all need to actually watch the games before talking"
"Sign and trade Collins for literally anything, he's a negative asset with a large contract  Draft BPA  Honestly I'm confident with Bogdan running the 2nd unit PG so I don't think we really need a solid backup point guard (30 min to Trae, 30 minutes to Bogdan, 25 minutes to Reddish, 25 to Huerter, 25 to Gallinari, 25-30 for Hunter, 30 for Capela, 15-20 for Okongwu, and around 30-40 minutes for backups like Kris Dunn and Brandon Goodwin, some min contract vets like Solomon Hill and Tony Snell, and our draft pick."
"They Bucks talked to one Hawk for a longer time- and I was like “wait that is Tony Snell” forgot Hawks had him, he didn’t see any floor time."
The Tony Snell special
"This Season made my year. No joke. The ups and downs was a ride.   From the 14-20, Steve Nash “that’s not basketball” comments, and Lloyd Pierce locker room issues  To finally getting in the playoffs with Nate McMillan, Trae Young shushing the garden, leading an epic comeback against the sixers to complete a huge upset, and our team showing heart through and through.   Even the little things like the Tony Snell game winner against the raptors, Cam Reddish’s games against the Nets, or the steady development of Okongwu in every game has been a treat to watch.  We put ourselves on the map and made some noise.  Thank you Atlanta and thank you Trae Young for making this season so much fun to watch as a guy who just wanted to escape the world. Lets dominate next year."
Just looked up Tony Snell pics. I think he hasn’t been playing because he hasn’t been unlocked yet.
I think ‘millionaire’ would work well. Tonight’s millionaire is Tony snell with playing 28 minutes and doing absolutely nothing !
Nope   When Tony Snell wins FMVP all the haters will be in shambles
That's only member in the 50-50-100 club Tony Snell you're talking about. So you already know what the answer is.
"ah, that sucks. :( That's not the kind of Tony Snell surprise hero stats I was hoping for :("
"Tony Snell has played 66 minutes these playoffs and gone 2 of 16. 5 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, 4 turnovers, 5 fouls. That's bad."
"Tony Snell has started more than half the games he’s played in the NBA, and he led the league in 3pt% this season.   He’s just extremely low usage and he will only give you 5-10 ppg on offense."
Lol tony snell was not our problem last night
He's tony snell. Will play some regular season minutes to give other guys rest. That's about it. You explained the rest of it.
Idk what’s going on but I need tony snell in NOW
WE WANT AN ABDUL NADER VS TONY SNELL FINALS
Tony Snell is on the Hawks   Since when?
Tony Snell the GOAT sighting
Tony Snell bout to take a nap. He knows the game plan doesn't involve him
Tony snell
Tony Snell
Tony snell
"Hawks don’t have the star power the other teams have but their depth may be the best in the league. What other team in the NBA has two quality players at each position?   PG: Trae Young, Lou Will  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kevin Huerter  SF: De’Andre Hunter, Cameron Reddish  PF: John Collins, Danilo Gallinari   C: Clint Capela, Onyeka Okongwu   Additionally, they have long bodies they can throw like Tony Snell, Solomon Hill and Kris Dunn   They had the perfect mix of a decent young core, cap space, and picks last year to make this roster. So the Knicks for example should follow in the same way. They have two firsts plus two seconds and almost $70 million in cap space to add a top player + depth to match the hawks"
"Andre Drummond's presence was *actively hurting* the team. He can't catch, can't protect the rim, can't space, and can't reliably score inside. All he does is occasionally rebound for putback buckets and make a good pass from the high post once per game.  Tony Snell is only getting DNPs because Atlanta has enough guys who the same thing as him, but better. That doesn't mean he's value-less league-wide."
Yeah the Tony Snell currently recieving DNP’s in the playoffs is a much more impactful player than Andre Drummond. Jesus this sub.
"And Tony Snell is a much more positively impactful player than Andre Drummond at this point, so that makes sense."
This is a league where Tony Snell made $12 million this year.
Tony Snell
Bruh the Hawks have Tony Snell
You never know if you're getting Larry Bird or Tony Snell
"yes, a no trade clause, so it'd have to be somewhere he wanted to go. that was something they could discuss with him early on in the process. as for the trade kicker, I'd say it's worth a trade kicker and, like, Tony Snell to get a pick.  ""Kings reportedly elected not to take draft pick from Hawks for Bogdanovic - Sactown Royalty"" https://www.sactownroyalty.com/platform/amp/2021/1/4/22214256/sacramento-kings-rumors-bogdan-bogdanovic-sign-and-trade-turned-down-atlanta-hawks-draft-pick"
I'm excited for thanasis vs tony snell
I'm leaning towards my friend Tony Snell.
"And traded dedmon for Tony snell, and rondo for Lou will plus picks"
How about when former Bucks legend Tony Snell plays?
"Sir, you spelled Tony Snell wrong."
Finals MVP at this rate: Tony Snell
I got Tony Snell dropping 80 in a 120 - 82 blowout by the Bucks (Trae gets 1 floater in).
Tony Snell 0/0/0
Tony Snell just traveling between Hawks games to play in full PG cosplay confirmed.
"[Tony Snell actually played 28mins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702240MIL.html) in that game, took 2 shots (missed both) and fouled once, did fuck all else"
"You said it in your open, but it's still my favorite. Tony Snell for Milwaukee Bucks vs. Utah Jazz, February 24, 2017  [0-0-0-0-0 in 28 minutes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702240MIL.html)  0/2 from 2   0/1 from 3   1 PF   -9 +/-    Somehow, he was not the worst +/- on the Bucks that game."
Fricking Tony Snell numbers
Tony Snell has a textbook jumper
"Even a broken bone isn't a huge deal. I was worried about ligament damage. This isn't the Hawks' year anyway, Trae was already hurt, and so is Bogi and Reddish. At worst next year they lose Lou Will and Tony Snell, and everyone else that matters is still under contract, plus their extremely young core all got playoff experience and another year of development. I want the Hawks to win a chip this year but if that doesn't happen and there's no long term injuries to any of the Hawks core I'm still hella bullshit on them for next year."
"Hey, we love Tony Snell!"
Gotta stay humble when you alternate between playing like Tony snell and Kobe bean Bryant
Sign Tony Snell on a minimum obviously.  Realistically there are no significant trades to be made. Kinda locked into this group.
Please Atlanta... dont release tony snell on us
"kris dunn, tony snell, and cam reddish had zero minutes tonight. a big lineup of both OO and capela could also be a thought.  their are options, even if it’s for just a few minutes so that someone shooting 3/16 isn’t playing 36 minutes"
Get Tony  Snell some help
Where’s Tony Snell?
That's not a nice way to refer to Tony Snell
"Perfect and most realistic IMO: sign one of Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, or Devotne Graham on a medium sized deal. Have a decent prospect fall to us in round 2 pick 38, someone who can immediately contribute. Sign and trade markkanen to get something for him. Keep Theis, Temple, Green. Waive Arcidiacano, sign a forward and a 3 and D wing. Furkan Korkmaz or Tony snell. Also should be interested in Bryn Forbes"
Tony Snell comes to mind.
"Tony Snell, only because I’ve been following since UNM."
"It was pretty loud. And random lol. Like, if all the people you’re going to heckle, why poor Tony snell?"
Tony Snell has 8 seasons in the NBA. If he sucked he'd be out of the league after one season. Or maybe he'd never play in the NBA if he really sucked.
"He was a teenager and Kidd was his first real coach. He's also one of the most loyal dudes ever, as evidenced by him signing a new contract with the Bucks. Like dude was upset when Tony Snell was traded.  All his other comments, like the one I posted above hint that he realizes Kidds act wasn't the norm. He has another quote about Kidd making them practice for extended periods, like 4-5 hours straight, and Giannis not realizing that wasn't normal.    But the worst thing about Kidd by far was his refusal to abandon the terrible trapping defense that got shredded night in night out.   Kidd also had a major hand in personnel decisions and deserves a lot of blame for the Bucks crappy roster outside Giannis/Middleton/Bledsoe. It's no surprise that the Bucks bench and roleplayers dramatically improved the off-season after Kidd was fired.   But hey, it's possible he's been humbled, learned a lot in LA, and could be a good coach. I wouldn't bet on it based on his time in MKE, but good luck."
Tony Snell is shooting GOAT c'mon man get yourself together
No tony snell slander allowed whatsoever
Tf did tony snell do
Imagine hating Tony Snell. Like wtf??
Tony Snell not being Italian is a scam
Fuck that asshole! He needs a lifetime ban from FF.  Tony Snell is one of us!
"I know all the Bucks players, and Tony Snell lol"
"Tony Snell getting some minutes, Bucks 7th man 3 years ago"
He yelled tony snell is back when Tony came onto the floor for the first time...
"Anyone got a loud ""Tony Snell sucks!"" in the audio too?"
WHATTT! WE LOVE TONY SNELL.
bruh someone just screamed tony snell sucks lmaooo
Lmao who said tony snell sucks
Tony Snell was finals MVP according to 2K. So was brown and anunoby tho.. fun game
Tony Snell is a God in these parts!  That fool better think twice.
TONY SNELL SUCKS!!!  Tony Snell: [https://i.imgur.com/9qhRq2Q.png](https://i.imgur.com/9qhRq2Q.png)
I literally just heard a fan scream “tony snell sucks” and I’ve never been more enraged.
That’s like asking if I would choose lebron over tony snell
"re kerr, he significantly lucked out in david lee having some injury concerns in his first year which led to draymond starting, so there was a significant roster difference to unlock. at that point we didn’t kno who dray was so the warriors were able to do better than expected.   maybe the blazers will have that, but tony snell isn’t a needle mover like draymond was then"
"Don’t hate on Tony Snell, he is a legit playoff rotation player."
but he sure made up for it by acquiring TONY SNELL
"Exactly, like Chauncey billups, someone who’s never coached a team in his life, is gonna increase CJ McCollum’s lateral quickness, or turn Tony snell into a viable playoff rotation player (all time hilarious off season pickup btw)."
Tony Snell: Helping teammates up off the ground
Your weird. Tony snell is my boo.
"You do realise spacing is not the same as 3 point %? Tony Snell shot over 50 from 3 yet, teams still weren't guarding him like he's Klay. Giannis has a perfect 3&amp;D roster around him that allows him to be a non-shooting 4 in the NBA. Whereas, Joel plays with poor spacing as a 3 level scorer. No one is guarding Tobias, Simmons, Thybulle, Maxey at the 3 point line even if they shoot 50 from 3."
"Lost what? A General Hospital playoffs where they injured his star PG and his ""shooter"" Mr.Harris turned into Tony Snell when it mattered most? This season doesn't count."
Idk who ranked ahead of him but I imagine it’s hard for him to compete with a dude like Tony Snell who only shoots 3s and hits like 55% of them
"That’s such a bad take that gets shoved down people’s throats because it rhymes. Tony Snell played more games than Embiid last year but he still isn’t better, the best ability is actually just ability"
They picked up Tony Snell too
"Tony Snell, obviously"
&gt; tony snell but taller  So Jerami Grant
pretty good. but i think replace PJ for Tony Snell
PG: Luka   SG: Tony Snell   SF: Tony Snell but a little taller   PF: Also Tony Snell   C: PJ Tucker
Tony Snell.
Jimmy was offered $44 mil/4 with the Bulls. Butler declined and as a result Garpax told Thibs to not play Butler as many minutes so his value drops and instead play Tony Snell who we drafted that season. Thibs told Garpax to fuck off and he (Jimmy) ended up winning MIP that very season.
"It would be cool enough for him to shoot, miss, get his own rebound, and then shoot again and make it. But for it to be a buzzer beater is just extra special.   Something about this play being so rare seems right for it to happen to LeBron. I’ve never seen something like this before, at least not in such a pleasing manner. If some random guy like Tony Snell did this, it just wouldn’t seem right."
"I’m so tired of this narrative behind pushed:   They added Ben McLemore, Cody Zeller, and Tony Snell aka The Needle Movers"
"&gt;We just hired a new coach, and despite what dumbass fans of other teams say, had a pretty solid off-season in terms of bolstering our bench defense. While I would like to see CJ traded, it doesn't look like that will be the case.  You lose me here. Dame, by his own admission, said ""this team isn't good enough and a coaching change won't be enough either to make us a contender"". You've added Tony Snell and Cody Zeller, lost Kanter and Melo, and kept Nurkic, CJ, Norm, and Covington. It sounds exactly like the same team with a different coach.  This is the whole reason people keep talking, because Dame was pretty clear in wanting to compete for a championship and pressuring the front office to make a change. So far you're talking about two bench pieces, Dame isn't dumb he knows this team would be in the same position. He literally said pretty much that, in the same press conference you quoted down in this thread"
"Ok go by what he said. His words earlier this summer was that the team “wasn’t good enough” and that a coaching change wouldn’t be enough. So far what has Portland done to address his concerns? They’ve signed Cody Zeller and Tony Snell so far…they have the exact same team more or less, that Dame publicly said wasn’t good enough. If he’s serious about wanting to compete for a championship, he knows his team is not at that level"
"Unless Damian Lillard is a huge Tony Snell fan, none of those acquisitions moved the needle in the slightest.  Those are end of the bench guys you just mentioned.  Lillard himself said this team wasn’t just a coaching change away from a title contender and Tony Snell certainly isn’t changing that lol"
"Went back to this thread to reply to a few people  I get what he's saying here though - if the Blazers are in win-now mode they can't have any holes in their roster and unfortunately RoCo getting traded would create that. To be fair, the Blazers have signed Tony Snell since then but ideally you want him coming off the bench.  If the Blazers want to work over CJ and all of the picks and pick/swaps then I can see that being enough."
"Not really, imagine a guy like Dennis Schroder and a guy like Joe Harris, give them both a team to lead where they'll need to score a lot? The Dennis team is gonna be way better, but that's not what is asked of a role player like these two, so Harris gets, and will keep getting big contracts and minutes as long as he is a great 3pt shooter, while Schroder is clearly a better pure scorer, but often he takes the ball away from better players. If he falls in production he's out of the league, just like IT and unlike Joe Harris, or even worse guys, like a Tony Snell"
Tony Snell was making $11mil/yr until last season.
TONY SNELL
Dame: We need to make some changes to improve our team!   Olshey: Adds Cody Zeller and Tony Snell
Prime tony snell
"As is, the roster isnt good enough to make a deep playoff run. They got destroyed by Nuggets starting Campazzo and Austin Rivers. That should be a wake up call. The West is stacked as hell and in a year where tons of contenders were injured, they couldn’t make it out of the first round.  Olshey is also incompetent. Dame asked for help and they got fucking Cody Zeller and Tony Snell. That should tell you enough."
"Idk who wrote question 4, but rightful king is Tony Snell."
lol tony snell
😂 Nah he's right Joe Harris was carrying KD that series. KantWin DurCant reverts to Tony Snell without his superstars.
I mean regardless if that’s true or not he would of been better than Solomon hill and tony snell.
The Tony Snell slander is out of control
"I think, as you pointed out, some significant roster overhaul was needed.  I'm not sure their 1st round pick situation but my Bulls just turned 3 future picks and a bunch of space parts in to Vucevic and Derozan, so the idea that Portland is stuck is just not trying hard enough.   Dame is absolutely in win now mode so mortgaging the future is the right move for the Blazers, especially knowing you can turn around and trade Dame for a cache of 1st rounders if it doesn't work out.  As an aside, they are paying Robert Covington, Tyler Zeller and Tony Snell a combined $39M which is just terrible."
"“If you can’t win with Tony Snell, you can’t win with anyone”"
Anyone better than Tony Snell or Ben McLemore
What does he mean? Portland got Tony Snell
I wonder how much the lackluster Blazers offseason is affecting him. There was all that drama  before the Olympics and then almost nothing happened. Their major FA acquisitions were Tony Snell and Cody Zeller. Norm extension was basically the only good thing they did.
Nah Hawks lost Tony Snell  Snell has two L’s for the Hawks offseason for losing Tony Snell
Y'all will be eating your words when McLemore averages 20 ppg and Tony Snell wins finals MVP 😤
The Tony Snell disrespect
"They also lost Zach Collins and Enes Kanter, and have brought in Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, and Ben McLemore. So, they have made some other moves, as well as re-signing Powell, but the question is if these move the needle for Dame. Either way, I think he lasts there until at least the trade deadline, if not into next offseason."
"Simmons will probably be routed to a third team that will send assets to y’all, along with picks and Maxey from us. Dame demanded a better roster and y'all GM gave him Tony Snell. He’ll be asking out within 72 hours of the Olympics ending."
He’s going to leave when he notices that Portland’s best offseason move was getting Tony Snell
I'd bet my money on Tony Snell
Yeah he warned them and they said aight dw bro we got tony snell like what the fuck
Someone told him he got Cody Zeller and Tony Snell as his “big additions” when he gets home
Is Dame happy about Melo and Collins being gone and Tony Snell signing there?
This is crazy.  Loyalty in a business is bullshit 9 times out of 10. Lillard has given them his all and the Blazers FO has been completely dicking around throughout this man's career. They seem perfectly content with just drawing fans in with Dame while doing the bare minimum. They clearly aren't serious about playoff success and I hope Dame sees through this.   No one can honestly believe the roster as is represent contenders. Imagine signing Cody Zeller and Tony Snell and then having the audacity to tell your superstar who has voiced he wants serious moves that.
"This is not going to end well for the Blazers. Dame flat out called them out for not having a good enough roster, and they're essentially going to run it back with Cody Zeller and Tony Snell added. And they're still in the absolutely stacked West. I can't believe how badly Olshey is fumbling this."
When did Tony Snell and Avery Bradley have a baby?
"I’d take Tony Snell over Kawhi next season, for what should be obvious reasons"
"Oh man mad doesn't begin to describe it, fucking GarPax should have been shot to the sun after that 2014 draft.  We traded away 2 picks to acquire a dude that we really didn't need, and didn't even finish his rookie contract on the Bulls because we then traded him (and Taj, ffs) for a bunch of pointless garbage  We already had Dunleavy and Tony Snell playing the 3, what the fuck was the point of drafting McDermott?"
I think he's down to fourth now that we signed Cody Zeller and Tony Snell.
"I got a lot of downvotes for mocking the Tony Snell signing.   With that being said, Damian Lillard has zero excuses not to win a championship this year.   Dame+CJ+Nurk+Snell=superteam"
"Tony Snell is about to drop 30---minutes, 0 0 0 0 0 0"

Contenders? With Tony Snell you've already won
"I feel like you answered your own question when you typed out Cody Zeller, Ben McLemore and Tony Snell tbh."
dont get me wrong I rock w Tony snell since his bulls days I am just worried at the lack of a big move
He should be really excited to play with Tony Snell and Cody Zeller. Those are the guys that are going to bring him a championship.
"Nah those free agent signings are definitely putting them over the top into contention. I mean Tony Snell just shot 51/56/100 so he's probably the best player in the league  Neil Olshey is an alpha male, he's got the situation under control"
Damian says “i need help” Front office gets Tony Snell.  Now we’re in business
"He moves kinda like an action figure whose joints can bend all the way... or idk how to describe it. Like, he's always got some kinda chicken-wing, invisible lat syndrome thing going on where his legs move fluidly but his upper body looks really stiff. You'll see him glide into the lane, rise up for a poster dunk looking like prime MJ, but then he gets blocked into the shadow realm because he telegraphed his intentions from a mile away and just held the ball out on a platter   https://youtu.be/CIyjffjFq38  https://youtu.be/gs8cSdhsM7Q  Couldn't find any others from googling.. i recall at least a few with the Bucks that left him crumpled on the floor ""hurt"" for a few beats.. either the wind knocked out or embarrassment. For the record though, I love Tony Snell."
Dame's *definitely* staying now that you've signed... Cody Zeller and Tony Snell! lmao
Tony snell is going to lead them to a championship
Tony Snell could play 10-15 rotation minutes on every team in the league
"You can sign Tony Snell, but you'll never never get r/TonySnell!"
50-50-100 Tony Snell😤😤

I see no mention of the GOAT Tony Snell
"Play Tony Snell instead, you cowards."
None of Danny Green or Tony Snell move defenses around like Duncan Robinson does just running around screens. Terrible examples.
"Our roster was certainly embarrassing. Tony Snell, thon maker, Jabari Parker, Jason terry, Eric Bledsoe. I like them all a lot as a bucks fan but none of them were great basketball players. And all of them coached by Joe Prunty."
Tony Snell had a 50/50/100 season this year
"Tony Snell, Trey Burke, World B. Free and Mike James"
Tony Snell
"2017 Game 4, had a chance to go up vs. the Raptors 3-1 at home but Giannis was outscored by Tony Snell, tied with Greg Monroe on his own team."
"He’s made $25mil so far in his NBA career, which is about half of what Tony Snell has made. He can more than double that total in the next few years, if he sticks to the same goal that brought him to Milwaukee in the first place."
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
They aren’t getting decent shooters on a vet minimum. Even guys like Tony Snell get 2.3 million on the open market and everyone wants them. They can’t afford to take discounts.
"I thought the Bucks made a great decision in giving a pretty big contract to Tony Snell a few years ago. I really thought he’d become an elite 3 and D guy, and then two years later I swear I was the only fan who didn’t hate him."
Thats best 3pt Shooter in the League Tony Snell to you
I love how they never compare players to trash dudes. Like his comparison is never Tony Snell it's Jimmy Butler lmfao
"The thing is Tony Snell was also on that team, and he still had a Blackberry.  So he selectively punished the players for Thon having an Android even though that wouldn't have resolved the issue.  That was just Kidd being an abusive shit to a younger player."
"RJ and Green is not the same as comparing Tony Snell and Cade. For the record, I would take Jalen Green."
I got my man Tony Snell da Goat
"so if the question was cade vs tony snell, who would you pick"
Tony Snell is my alma maters only NBA player. Good thing he’s the undisputed GOAT.
"I don't think pure talent evaluation in terms of drafting is the issue. Like a lot of these are just mid-1sts and 2nds underwhelming or washing out, that happens to pretty much every team.   I do think the Bucks have left a lot on the table in terms of value/roster-building and these are the main points:  1) Getting nothing out of their #2 pick. Out of everything you listed this is the most damaging one. There was never really a great time to trade Jabari that fans would have accepted, but he still had value even after the 1st ACL tear. Never really made an impact on the court in a meaningful way then ended up walking to the Bulls.  2) They made a shrewd move by selling high on Brandon Knight, then fucked it up by taking back MCW instead of the Lakers 1st that went out in the same exact trade and became Mikal Bridges with Shai and Miles Bridges on the board as well. MCW became Tony Snell.  3) The Bledsoe/Brogdon crossroads. I think Brogdon is one of the most overrated players in the NBA and was never going to be the PG on a team next to Giannis that wins a ring, but as an asset had way more value which really came to a head this past offseason when they had Bledsoe as a boat anchor and a thin backcourt.  These things plus some mediocre drafting is all what culminated in a roster around Giannis that has been thin on assets at times when stars/better help may have been available.  That said, Horst of course deserves a ton of credit for the things he did do right especially since they culminated in a championship. The Bucks had the raw ingredients to win a title the past two years, they weren't considered contenders for nothing. A combination of bad luck, inexperience, suspect coaching, and certain players actively weighing them down in the postseason is what doomed them. He was exactly as reactionary as he needed to be after the bubble last year and it paid off."
You’re forgetting that the GOAT Tony Snell also came out of that draft
Once they re sign Tony Snell the decade long dynasty will be set
J Lamb Khris Middleton THJ Tony Snell  One thing in common: catch and shoot gods of 2k14
They invited the kitchen sink to the parade. Tony Snell and Jabari Parker even got invitations.
"He already has one. We got Trae Young, Lou Will, Tony Snell, Nathan Knight, and the ghost of Kris Dunn. We're loaded!"
Tony Snell finals mvp
hawks need to let tony snell run the point
Poor decision by the Hawks to not intentionally foul Simmons with their bench players. Why not sub in Solomon Hill or Tony Snell to do it?  Bogdonovic and Huerter each have 3 fouls at half now
"Idk man I think they’ve still got a solid chance, tony snell just needs more minutes"
"Hawks need to let their best player Tony Snell feast, smh."
Why is Tony Snell in the NBA still? Dude is fucking garbage
"Oh fuck the GOAT Tony Snell is in now, it's over for the 76ers"
Legacy game for Tony Snell
This is what the bucks get for getting rid of Tony Snell
"Like they just were gushing over Harden playing injured, all four points or whatever he is at. Wow. What a warrior. He's a few fake fouls away from Tony Snell numbers"
James “Tony Snell” Harden
Tony Snell shot 50/50/100 this year. Disrepectful
Fun fact: Tony Snell hasn’t missed a FT since the 2018-2019 season. He’s made 47 straight since then.
That's an insult to Tony Snell
Him and Tony Snell are friends from High School and even Snelly Cat only checks the internet on his ipad that he still keeps in the box. These dudes are living the life
There is no way he is any worse than Tony Snell who is shooting 9% in series right now
I legit have never seen anyone wear a Tony Snell jersey other than Tony Snell. I give it up to that guy sitting courtside.
The Hawks need more Tony Snell minutes!
"Trash is awfully strong don't ya think? They're literally guarding him with 2 of the 5 best perimeter defenders in the league, and he still led you in points and assists in Game 2 and 3. Where's Capela? He is letting Embiid score at will and has missed approximately 500 layups this series. Where's Bogdanovic? If they're throwing Simmons at Trae defensively he should be able to score much easier. Tony Snell? He led the league in 3P% and has scored 0 points on 0/5 shooting in 21 minutes. Hunter and Reddish are hurt so Tobias Harris is scoring literally every time he touches the ball. His worst shooting performance so far is 58%.  To me Trae is the ONLY Hawk actually living up to his talent. Gallo and Collins are playing pretty good too."
Tony Snell 0-3 big time regression for my boy
Tony Snell what the fuck
I want Tony Snell vs Anthony Tolliver in garbage time.
When Tony Snell is shooting… you’re gonna have a bad time
"Hey guys, it’s the GOAT Tony Snell"
"&gt;\-Tony Snell: Sounds like someone faking a deep sounding voice   All those years hanging with Kawhi, Thor and Star Lord"
Tony Snell is MJ on steroids
"Yeah, its rough because this is where we’re really missing Hunter. Kevin spent a large part of game 3 in foul trouble which meant that we were either playing Solomon Hill or Tony Snell with our starters. You guys could just key in on Trae and Bogi and give us a lot of trouble because they were the only two guys on the floor who could create offensively."
Tony Snell
Tony Snell taught him a few tricks it seems
Tony Snell would never
Has Tony Snell ever made a basket before
Tony Snell doesn't really *need* to try to run the break...
"Funny how Tony Snell can now not even see the court, yet so many people tried to convince me he was a great player!"
"They would have to get it off so fast and only spot up, no way they could ever create a clean shot against a halfway decent defender. Maybe like a Tony Snell kinda guy"
"It does account for volume. Which is why Tony Snell averaging 5 PPG on 71% TS only gets him 47.9 TS Add.  For every point scored it accounts for how efficient every point was compared to the league average.  But yea, I hear what you’re saying it does devalue volume scoring, but to be fair it shows that having a mega volume scorer is not the ideal way to run an offense. And we see what happens to a lot of these guys when the playoffs start. It’s just not a good way to run an offense.  Not like 2019 Harden had any choice besides being a mega volume scorer, it just wasn’t ideal."
So you're saying Tony Snell is the greatest offensive player of all time if we extrapolated his possessions?
so is tony snell.
Tony Snell snubbed. 50-50-100 I’m just saying
"Yeah, they probably didn't want us voting for Tony Snell."
Where the hell did Tony Snell go?
Tony Snell somehow about to get uglier
"Wait, Snell gets busted open, but Embiid got the free throws? The Tony brothers are at it again"
I miss Tony Snell
How could they let this happen to NBA legend Tony Snell.
Damn Tony Snell comes in the game and immediately gets his lip busted open
has anyone ever seen tony snell make a shot before?
"Tony snell two hand shoved Embiid, thats why he lost the ball"
Tony Snell please just shoot the three every time. Your drives are painful to watch. I've watched you all year and I don't think I've seen you make one basket driving. Just stop lol
Tony Snell still getting the NBA bag. We love to see it
If its not a 3 Dont shoot it Tony Snell smh
Tony Snell over John Collins
"Is ayton averaging 26/11/4 on 62% shooting against the Nets ?  Ayton is not the focal point on the Suns offense so he can take more efficient shots  There’s a reason Tony snell shoots a higher 3pt % than Curry this season, because he’s not the focal point"
Tony Snell
Khris Middleton with the Tony Snell game
"thats whats so sad is his potential was so scary especially pre-injury on the knicks I thought he could be a top 10 player in the league or at least an all-nba kinda guy, but I think everyone loved the idea of what he could be, and now hes just 7'3 tony snell"
My boy Tony Snell with 4 minutes and a +9. Sure feels like the difference maker in a 4 point victory.
trae has tony snell tho
"or Gallinari, Tony Snell, and they had a younger DeAndre Hunter. Atlanta had an asbolutely insane offseason and their GM deserves a lot of credit for it"
Tony Snell no stat but +9. He is there for the vibe.
"Shoutout Tony Snell +9 in 3 minutes, no stats posted."
"I wish Tony Snell hadn’t hurt his ankle he was legit fantastic for us before that. Tbh I would maybe wonder if Snell over Solo in the starting lineup would be better if Hunter’s out, since Solo is just sitting behind the line shooting 3s anyways"
Who tf in Hawks management signed Tony Snell?
The disrespect to Tony Snell lol
The disrespect on Tony Snell is so uncalled for!
Hey Thon Maker and Tony Snell and DJ Wilson and Ersan Ilyasova the keys are still under the mat  bbs

I will not and shall not tolerate Tony Snell slander. Other than that great post!
Where are Tony Snell and Khris Middleton?
Tony Snell snubbed

"Mikal bridges, tj warren, Terrance Ross, serge ibaka, pj tucker, tony ""100 percent free throw shooter"" Snell."
Tony Snell numbers
"Tony ""Return the Slab"" Snell nor Isaac ""30 at 13"" Banga retired right?"
Nah Tony Snell evolved into a catch and shoot demon
A performance Tony Snell would be proud of
Jared Dudley with the Tony Snell special with 0 stats even in 4 minutes of garbage time
"The Bucks, and any team Tony Snell is on. I also root for Phoenix and Denver, since they’re my two closest NBA teams and almost every game I see in person involves one of them."
"Mike Scott, all the worst parts of Tony Snell and Kenyon Martin rolled into one."
"Bertans: Has a Tony Snell meme game, gets the start the next game  Gafford: Bites on Embiid's fake 3 times in under a minute and gets benched, gets the start the next game"
Obviously Tony Snell
Good thing Trae has Tony Snell to help him out in tough matchups like that
Tony Snell all day
he saw tony snell on our bench and wanted to thank him for being an inspiration but his teammates stopped him from embarrassing himself and asking for an autograph
Tony Snell&gt;Randle
why the fuck isn't Tony Snell getting any reps? The Silent Assassin is brewing on the bench
"So he's the anti Tony Snell, playoff version?"
Lmao and Tony Snell somehow shot like 50-50-100 this season
Meanwhile Bertrans is pulling Tony Snell prime time statlines vs 76ers
"Aye if y’all lose the series just send kawhi to us. We’ll give you tony snell and kris dunn, one is a great defender and the other is the best 3pt shooter in the league."
Tony snell?

"Big Ja Morant fan too  Jerami Grant (prob my favorite)  De’Aaron Fox  Larry Nance Jr  SGA  John Collins  Kent Bazemore   Luka is fun, but I don’t actively root for him  Edit: formatting. Also, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for Tony Snell"
Your stuck with the other guy with a questionable history. At least yours recognises the basketball world figured out a little something over the last 18 years and isn’t running post-up after post-up for Tony Snell.
Tony Snell moment
Portland fans in shambles after having no idea just how bad that Tony Snell signing was this offseason.
We seriously signed Tony Snell this off season after Dame gave the front office an ultimatum to improve the roster. Looks like we should have made a run at picking up Avery Bradley off waivers.
Tony snell is the goat
Long live the king Tony Snell
"Ahh yes, following great legends like Thabo Sefolosha, Joel Anthony and of course the *GOAT TONY SNELL*"
Tony SNell
Tony Snell special.
Tony Snell with a tear in his eye rn
The disrespect to pistons tony snell
"Yeah IIRC Brogdon was injured or something so they randomly decided to boo Tony Snell.  Two years ago they went to Indy to boo their assistant coach Dan Burke (now on the Sixers) for talking shit about Embiid, and also to cheer for TJ, who has been on the pod twice.  TJ had to explain to the rest of the team why there was randomly a large section of Sixers fans in the building booing for no apparent reason lol"
Were those the same ppl that booed Tony Snell lol
Danny Green is in the Halloween spirit and dressed as Tony Snell tonight.
Tony Snell
Larry Sanders was because [Jason Kidd and the Bucks fucked him over](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/08/12/book-jason-kidd-held-christmas-eve-practice-with-bucks-that-left-larry-sanders-hospitalized/) and he walked away...  Tony Snell was proof positive of how easy it was to move a contract. They had two years left and they traded it along with a pick for one year of Leuer. The Bucks CHOSE to stretch Leuer. They could have just waived him and paid him all out in one season
Considering we still have dead cap hits from Larry Sanders and Tony Snell (Jon Leuer's contract) I am very familiar with getting stuck with bad contracts.
Tony Snell is that you?
Someone lookout for Tony Snell
"Yeah like it’s hypocritical for me to say, but can almost any of us actually provide intelligent critique on teams and players? Hell no, most sports discussion is just throwing around a bunch of formless intuitions about who you *think* is better, on the top level of the sport these guys all know miles more than any of us  I mean I’ll give you that Tony Snell is obviously not as good as Giannis, but when you compare players of very similar talent we usually can’t say much worthwhile"
Tony Snell currently plays for the Blazers
"The hawks need to trade Tony Snell, the NBA has a conspiracy to stop the GOAT ever getting his deserved 7-peat"
Tony Snell
"That’s Tony *Most consecutive minutes played without attempting a free throw(471 minutes)* Snell, to you"
"That's nice and all but it's not that significant. Bey hits stand still assisted open threes which aren't invaluable, but they don't do the same thing to a defense as a guy like Duncan Robinson who his threes off movement.   It's not the same thing (due to volume) but it's why teams are never fighting each other to try and sign Tony Snell"
Tony snell
"Umm Taj Gibson,  jimmy butler,  tony snell,  and James Johnson are some late round gems that disagree.  Just admit you’re  biased against him due to him having a bad stint in Minny.  But let’s be fucking fair,  your organization is ass and your stars were soft as shit.  The jimmy butler trade would have worked if KAT wasn’t a bitch and Wiggins a lazy fraud"
I bet Tony Snell is gonna make the difference this year
He doesn't need to run that much. He's not Tony Snell.
Exactly. It shows just how much Philly fans respect Tony Snell.
the good old tony snell special
"With about 10-15 mpg it’s VERY doable to at least get a point(which is one made free throw), an assist, and a rebound. To this day it amazes me how Tony Snell managed to put up that complete 0 game."
"Ah, a Tony Snell"
"I can tell Tony ""The Prince of Darkness"" Snell mentored this dude without anyone telling me."
Yes because Tony Snell will lead Portland to a title
Only reason Tony Snell is in the league is because he's Kawhi's BFF from high school.
Tony Snell can at least shoot the ball.
tony snell literally signed with the blazers this offseason and passed on his knowledge to blevgod
Tony Snell and Keljin Blevins about to fight it out
Tony Snell - esque numbers
Ahh. The Tony Snell stat line. That's impressive.
"Keljin ""Tony Snell"" Blevins"
"Tony Snell playing 28 min and recording zero stats in every category, zero! Lol"
Those are Tony Snell numbers
Bol Bol Reggie Jackson Kevin Looney Elfrid Payton Tony Snell
"It's like that graphic of Tony Snell having 0 points, 0 rebounds, 0 assists"
"Tony Snell had a 70.8 TS% but an 8.6 USG% in a decent sample size of 992 minutes last year.  Not saying he should try to put the ball on the floor and create, but damn. 57% from 3 and barely taking any."
"where was all this sh#t talking before, Tony Snell threw his body weight on Lebron's ankle.... didn't hear sh#t about Lebron not being the best, when he held up that finals mvp, or at the beginning of the season?  are we forgetting after the nets / bucks ....the excuse was Durant got tired, no one said he was the best... everyone only agreed Giannis wasn't better than Durant."
Tony Snell
"Tony Snell, cardio"
"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
"It’s kinda silly to bring in his starting record with the Pistons  Wood was starting alongside guys like John Henson, Tony Snell and Svi lol  It’s the logic that some people used against Booker when he performed well on some horrendous teams  Basketballs a teams sport"
It's never good when you let Tony Snell score lol.
"Sixers fans travel well. 100% there will be a group of fans who will travel just to boo Ben Simmons.   Hell, [we traveled to Milwaukeee to boo Brogdon as a joke](https://twitter.com/eric_nehm/status/970479383822635008), and then when he didn't play, voted to boo Tony Snell instead. This will be a hilarious saga to watch imo."
Clown take. Tony snell is way better
"Jimmy Butler &gt; Bojan Bogdanović  Marquis Teague &gt; Festus Ezeli   Tony Snell &gt; Gorgui Dieng  Doug McDermott &gt; Dario Saric  Bobby Portis &gt; Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  A slight downgrade for the bulls since I’d rather have JB, Bobby, and Doug McBuckets. Of course it really wasn’t as exciting seeing as we had generally low picks these years since we were a solid playoff team."
"Look drop the fox vs ja beef and the wanting of Simmons. Be real, I love fox over ja as much but Ben Simmons didn’t attempt the same amount of shots as ja or else we’d be calling Tony snell and Bobby portis better shooters than Dame and kris Middleton"
Don't disrespect the goat Tony Snell
Tony Snell minding his own business and catching a drive by heckle
Whoever said that Tony Snell sucks should be banned from Fiserv.
"dead silence and then ***""TONY SNELL SUCKS""*** i'm in fucking tears"
Does Tony Snell suck?
"Lmao ""Tony snell sucks"" haha"
did someone just say TONY SNELL SUCKS cuz I agree
You now remember tony snell
Can't we get a fucken Tony Snell vs Jeff Teague matchup
this series should be decided by a pat connaughton tony snell game of 1 on 1. first to 11 wins
Tony snell
"I mean Kidd had to play Tony Snell and John Henson 30mpg.  Bud had Lopez instead of Henson and Snell played 17mpg.  That's a significant talent increase.    I get it Kidd wasn't the greatest, but saying that it was the exact same roster is not fair."
"Actually the Hawks' salary construction is pretty smart. Tony Snell and Solomon Hill come off the books this year, and their salaries will make up most of JC's new deal. The last year of Gallo's deal - which is only guaranteed for two million and which Atlanta probably won't keep - will be the first year of Trae's new deal.  Because of expiring deals, Atlanta has room to go get another playoff-rotation caliber player, maybe another with the midlevel exception (which is probably just re-signing Lou), then resign JC with Bird rights, then extend Trae and they'll still most likely be under the tax."
Trae shot better from 3 than Harden last year and his percentages are around the same as Harden's in the playoffs.   Also *sample* size. Trae shoots over double the amount that Harden does from that range. You can't tell me Tony Snell is better than Curry from from 3 because he shoots 56% on 2 attempts to Curry's 42% on 12 attempts.  &gt;Flair up homie.  No. I don't think I will.
There was an open gym run where he had the ball at the wing and Joakim Noah told Tony Snell to double Book. He got pissed saying you don't double during open gyms lol
The disrespect to Tony Snell
Remember when dumbasses were trying to convince me Tony Snell was a great player and the reason for the Hawks turnaround
"because Hunter is out, and Cam is just now getting back from his injury, and Tony Snell... well, I don't know. He is much better offensively for sure, but he hasn't really got minutes in the playoffs."
we havent even gotten the tony snell revenge game yet. mans gonna go OFF for 12-2-2
"I'd rather see Tony Snell than a guy who hasn't played in 4 months, lol."
"coming into this series i thought we would go 6 and lose to the bucks.  but if we have to play solomon fucking hill and tony fucking snell extended minutes than I'm creeping towards ""bucks in 4"". And playing an injured Bogi hardly counts as an upgrade over a healthy Snell or Hill"
"Bogi one of our most powerful offensive weapons. With him so gimpy, we need John Collins to step up. Players like Solomon Hill and Tony Snell are just warm bodies for defense really. Heurter needs to carry a much bigger offensive load as well."
My poor Bogi. Trae isn't 100% and Bogi is gimped. Hunter is out. I wouldn't mind if we played Reddish over Solomon Hill or Tony Snell at least.
The duality of Tony snell   Either he's 100% or he gets 0/0/0/0 in 28 minutes
"No matter what happens, bucks and Hawks fans alike, can all agree… Tony Snell is the goat"
I hope if Tony Snell checks in the Bucks fans give him a standing ovation
Who starts if Bogi doesn’t play and why is it Tony Snell?
"Tony Snell is a cash money shooter when wide open, there's a reason he shot 52% from three  So him"
This is blasphemy. Nobody can be better than Tony Snell
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
"If this is about the free throws, everyone misses free throws sometimes (besides Tony Snell). As someone else said, he got clutch baskets right before then. He shot kinda badly from the line and kinda badly from 3, but played ok. If he made 1 more field goal than he had or made both the free throws we'd say PG came up clutch and won the game, because they would have won. If he had made 1/2 then probably overtime and who knows."
Tony snell lowkey will be a nice addition for a contending team IMO this offseason
"Doc is a terrible coach. He's had so many great players, hof players and he's won once, and made 2 finals appearances, while the celtics made multiple conf finals when he left, only to be really stopped by lebron during doc's clipper tenure.   Brett Brown lost to kawhi leonard on a basket with 04.2 to go. Doc Rivers lost to kevin huerter bulling seth curry in the post in game 7.  Who's really responsible for the collapse? it's doc. Think about it the 26pt lead. Does that happen without hack a ben? How is atlanta going to generate 27 points without fouling a terrible FT shooter to come back in the game. You mean you couldn't keep ben out for that amount of time?  Come on man. I've seen the doc story way too much. He made Kawhi Leonard look like tony snell in game 7 and had him guarding Jokic because he refused to take out montrezl harrell who was a -61 for the entire playoff run. Jokic even said it himself that Zubac is a tough defender after the series.   Doc didn't play zu in second halfs of the game, pretty much all year.   When Ben Simmons gets traded and he will and Doc messes up again, you'll see doc is a bigger issue to worry about then ben simmons. Ben simmons just has a shit contract, that's really all. He's a decent player, just not a max or big contract player."
Tony Snell is their best player based on QZ per 100
Tony Snell is definitely a wing
Trae young is not a wing and neither is Collins so unless you’re about to make like a Tony Snell joke I’m not sure who you’re referencing
"I think the US should recruit roleplayer type guys. You need somebody willing to do the dirty work, and those guys might even play harder than stars who are just trying to get summer cardio.  What I'm saying is, Tony Snell is so hot right now. Did yall see him doubling Booker in the summer? My man's got no off switch"
"Tony Snell, so hot right now"
"Now they just need another versatile wing. PG, Butler, or Tony Snell would be perfect."
Thank you for the reminder the GOAT Tony Snell is a free agent this offseason!
The 🐐 Tony Snell
It could have been avoided if: - Thybulle didn't foul on a 3  - Dwight didn't get a flagrant foul - Danny Green didn't get injured - Kevin Huerter wasn't Kevin Huerant - Trae Young didn't have ice running through his veins - The Pacers didn't fire Nate McMillan - The Hawks didn't fire Lloyd Pierce - The Sixers didn't hire Doc Rivers - Tony Snell
"I think we are getting to a point where the hawks current supporting cast is overrated. Hunter is hurt, bogi was awful, and Clint is good but he can be exploited vs bigs with range. Huerter, and Gallo are solid, and Collins is good but not a max player. Lou is trash 70% of the time, and Solomon hill and Tony Snell have not been playable in the playoffs. Big O has given them solid minutes though."
"Or it was they hired a new coach, tradef for capela and Tony snell. Signed Bogdanovic, Gallinari, drafted okongwu, than traded for Lou will"
Disagreed. Don't think Ben will ever be a major piece in a contending team while not improving his Tony Snell-tandem offense. If the 76ers are able to replace him with an offensive point guard then they'd definitely be more in contention without him.
"Except arguably their two biggest wing pieces, Reddish and Hunter, didn’t play.  Imagine if they were playing and you had a rotation of Trae, Bogi, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Heurter, Gallo, Capela and Okongwu.  All the while having Lou Williams, Kris Dunn for defense, Solomon Hill, and Tony Snell for “as needed” situations.  These are all at worst rotation players in the nba. This is an insanely deep Hawks roster."
Oy Tony Snell
"Tony Snell is actually good in the playoffs tho, that man turns into a goddamn sniper"
Except Tony Snell literally can’t miss free throws
To clear up money for next year to re-sign John Collins. This was reported by multiple hawks reporters all through the year.  Even the kings reporters said this.  https://www.sactownroyalty.com/2021/4/30/22412679/sacramento-kings-news-bogdan-bogdanovic-sign-and-trade-tony-snell-atlanta-hawks
Two big storylines I think everyone is missing are:      1. Tony Snell facing the franchise he once carried on his back      2. A final way to settle if the bucks should have taken John Collins over DJ Wilson in the draft. This is an all timer imo and will probably never be settled.
Don’t you dare disrespect King Solomon or Tony “God reincarnate” snell
Trae wouldn’t be here without Tony Snell.
The ECF has enough intrigue as it is! The Bogdan drama. coach Bud and his Hawks history. TONY SNELL!
The Hawks 60 win conf final run was 6 years ago with coach bud.  capela was in a rookie contract with the rockets. gallinari just came back from his acl injury with the nuggets.  we were figuring out why the pacers were starting solomon hill.  tony snell was considered this steal with the bulls and was a grinder.  time has certainly changed quickly
Lmao Tony Snell menacing staring
#Hot Take: Tony Snell drops 40 in the 2nd half in a Hawks game 7 W.
Oh ok. But who is Tony Snell again?
"Cause I remember watching Tony Snell playing for the Bulls and he was not good. You act like I don't know him.  And so far all I've seen here is that he is getting very few minutes but when he's out there, he is hitting his 3's.  So to me yeah... It is very surprising that he's getting paid this much *already*. If someone paid him next season or something, I would still think it's a bit much, but more understandable, but he's getting paid $11 million in his *current contract*."
You're in a thread about how Tony Snell is actually pretty good and teams should want him and then are surprised that he's making a salary that indicates that lol
What?! Tony Snell is making $11 million???
"&gt; beyond their ability to count   I'd honestly argue against that as well.  The amount of time I've seen people talking about Tony Snell as if he was a great 3 point dude because of his percentage, then you check his attempts and you realise these people don't understand numbers either."
TIL Tony Snell is a bench GOD  I love how this has turned into the Tony Snell thread 🤣
That 41% was on 1.5 attempts per game. Context is important. Tony Snell ripped a 51/57/100 season this year.
"wait, Tony snell is that good?  in my mind he is one of those super average players that can shoot and defend well enough to be decent rotation players but not much else"
"Tony Snell has how many fewer attempts than Harris? Idk, it's annoying to me when completely inconsequential players win these sort of things....but it turns how Harris helped the Bucks more than the Nets so idk maybe you've got a point"
That’s what Harris gets for taking the 3pt% title away from Tony Snell based on a technicality
Otherwise: Tony Snell
Funny way of saying Tony Snell
Tony snell
Tony snell getting suspended lmaooo
i hope this turns into a tony snell game winner
The Tony Snell special
"The Thunder were similarly talented to this Atlanta team if you believe CP3 is the caliber of player you say he is.   CP3, Shai, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lu Dort, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazley, Mike Muscala, etc.   vs  Trae, Bogi, Capela, Huerter, Collins, Gallo, Lou Williams, Tony Snell, Okongwu, etc.  Left off Hunter and Reddish since both of them missed almost the entirety of this season and are out currently."
"Unfortunately, that's what I've come to expect from the same man who [recorded a zero stat game](https://www.sportscasting.com/the-infamous-game-tony-snell-played-28-minutes-and-didnt-record-a-single-stat/)."
"Speaking of Snellville, what happened to 3% league leader Tony Snell? 1/8 in the playoffs..."
The problem is if he doesn't start it's Solomon Hill or Tony Snell instead.
I guess Tony snell is better at winning too huh?   Sitting here acting like the hawks wouldn’t have gotten bounced by the healthy clips in round one too lmao
Tony Snell in every single season since he’s been drafted.
"Giannis won back 2 back MVPs with Bledsoe, Matthews, Sterling Brown, can't-shoot-versions of Pat and Hill and Tony Snell. And he did so with the best record in the league also b2b while being all-defense 1st team every year and winning a DPOY too, AKA trying on both ends. Sit down and show some respect.  Facu and Rivers aren't even starters for the Nuggets lmao."
Not everyone can be as good as hawks Tony Snell
"You fool, you forgot the guy who matched your stat line, he's on your favorite team, Tony ""fucking"" Snell."
Jose Calderon made his first 84 free throws in 2008-09 on his way to setting the record for best FT% in a season (98.1% on 154-of-157).  Micheal Williams made 83 straight to end the 1992-93 season as part of a 97 make streak that is the longest in NBA history across multiple seasons.  Tony Snell set the record for most free throws in a season without a miss with 32 in 2019-20. Jeremy Lamb is now tied with Stephen Curry (also 2019-20 when he played just 5 games) for the second most in a season without a miss.
The Tony Snell Challenge.
Tony snell is smiling down rn
Tony Snell has been a bit of an inside joke between my homie and i because of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjC_7MeyxXQ
Tony Snell with five minutes of defense and cardio off the bench. Just Tony things
That just shows how much he’s been improving though. He’s gone from unplayable to a Tony Snell stopper 😤💪. Just think of where he’ll be in a years time.
He’s surprisingly playable when he only has to guard Tony Snell for a large chunk of his minutes!
tony snell
Tony Snell doing GOAT Tony Snell things
Better stat lines than the GOAT Tony Snell
BREAKING:  The Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to send Tony Snell to the Milwaukee Bucks I. exchange for Giannis Antetokoumnpo.
How do you feel about Tony Snell?
"What's weird is you guys had a lot of good role player shooters just a few seasons ago (Luke Kennard, Tony Snell, Reggie Bullock, Wayne Ellington) and now all of them are gone"
So close to the legendary 0/0/0/0/0 Tony Snell stat line.
He knows better to Not challenge the prince of darkness Tony Snell
Tony Snell ran so Jeff Green could stumble. Unfortunate he grabbed the board.
"and we beat you by 15 last year whilst you had both brown and jb healthy, with stevens still as a head coach. albeit it is last year, your point was that we only beat you because you had key guys injured  might as well add, that tony snell defended tatum/brown in that game as well"
Lol. I’ve been sitting here thinking “man that is not the Tony Snell I remember at all”
"Tony Snell. The man, the myth, the legend"
Ever seen Tony SNELL?
I already know how this game ends...  Tony Snell will hit a game winning three and that will be his only field goal
tony snell could never
I fucking lost it when Tony Snell showed up
"I'm sure you're the person to go to for an unbiased analysis on what Heat players are/aren't and everyone who disagrees simply doesn't watch games lol. He still isn't a good defender even if he's a little more active now and he's not in the league for his rebounding/passing. He can obviously shoot and create opportunities to shoot in multiple ways but ""one-dimensional shooter"" still fits a guy like that unless you think the label should only be reserved for like Tony Snell"
"This is a fan base that [bussed people to Milwaukee to boo Tony Snell (as a substitute for their real target, Malcolm Brogdon, who was injured)](https://www.rightstorickysanchez.com/if-not-will-convey-as-two-second-rounders/2018/12/3/a-bus-the-process-history-lesson)"
Tony Snell :)
"Let it never be forgotten that, during this stretch, a group of diehard 76ers fans travelled to Milwaukee to boo Tony Snell. True dedication."
Tony Snell contract was awful. But he's been great overall.
Sixers fans came to a game in Milwaukee to boo Tony Snell as a proxy for the injured Malcolm Brogdon to protest him winning the Rookie of the Year over Joel Embiid lmao what can you do
tony snell
"Christian ""Tony Snell"" Wood  (nvm just realized he has a steal)"
"Tony ""0/0/0/0/0 in 28 minutes"" Snell"
"That's gonna be a hard sell because embiid has asked to play in Portland. Tony Snell, Keljin Blevins and cash for Embiid. You guys probably would need to throw in a couple first rounders to make it work."
"Love to see the ex Bulls here, Rose, Thad, and of course Tony Snell"
Tony Snell had 50 50 100
"The abuse continued this season with the signing of Tony Snell, anonymous sources said. The same source said that Olshey was also considering signing Paul Zipser to a long-term contract."
That boy Tony Snell with a classic Tony Snell game
"Sixers fans come in 2 flavors, those that are ready to ship Ben Simmons off for Tony Snell and a tub of vanilla ice cream, and those that have some weird Stockholms thing going on with Ben where he can be as big of a dick as he wants but they'll always welcome him back."
Tony Snell stay killing the sixers.
"Had no idea Tony ""The GOAT"" Snell was on the Blazers."
tony snell 56% 3 point shooter last year
Tony snell literally doesn't miss
Same with Lonzo. He had LeBron stats on Monday and Tony Snell on Wednesday
The Tony Snell will always be funny. Legit a dude who was just out there doing cardio.  Impressive? LeBron’s double digit scoring streak. That Hawks game last season could have potentially ended it
"Nobody has outwardly complained but one of the pluses of Hunter, Cam, Bogi, Gallo, etc. all missing time last year is that the people who took their minutes like Solomon Hill, Tony Snell, Skylar Mays etc. don’t need shots. Guys like Bogi could get 20 attempts and be in a supreme rhythm throughout the game. Now outside of Okungwu, we’re healthy. We have guys on our 3rd unit who still deserve rotation minutes but can’t get them. And rotation players who are starting level caliber. Our offense has looked weird at times because you can tell we’re trying to figure what works with who and trying to get certain players going."
You should do one where you make Chris Paul Wiggins and make Silver Tony Snell and make the ref COVID lol.
"Alright Dame we got Blevins, we got Zeller, McLemore, we even shelled out the cash for Tony freaking Snell! How much help do you need??"
never heard of Fly the Process have you? Tony Snell is still shook...
"Tony Snell, Delly, Thon, John Henson, Tyler Zeller, and Jabari all had significant minutes and we had Joe Prunty as our head coach. Anyone who bet on us was a moron."
GOAT shooter Tony snell 50/50/100 splits
&gt;Brogdon didn’t play so they just decided to boo Tony Snell instead  Maybe Brogdon and Snell looked the same to them ?
As a bucks fan... I also boo'd Tony Snell.
"You boo'd Santa! It was another eagles fan too, and you guys bood him and threw snowballs at him. That's the worst example but let's not pretend like 76ers fans didn't boo Tony Snell for the crime of Malcolm Brogdon not playing and them just being riled up. It goes beyond expecting the best from your players and you know it."
Tony snell is kawhi Leonard's evil cousin.
"Love Tony Snell, think he has a lot going for him. Looks like a total mouth-breather."
Tony Snell probably confused af
And they’ve held onto the Tony Snell grudge haha
"The Brogdon trip bugged a bunch of Bucks fans because   1. Brogdon is arguably the most likable and thoughtful player in the league.   2. The RTRS guys kept calling Milwaukee a shit hole and said they would stay in Chicago and bus to the game.    It’s all fair play, but some Bucks fans had some legitimate gripes.   Also Tony Snell is an angel. Poor dude."
Lmfao “they just decided to boo Tony Snell instead”
Just found a thread posted on the Sixers sub by a Bucks fan asking why they boo’d Tony Snell. That’s fucking comical
Sixers fans don’t mess around. I remember a bunch of them travelled to Milwaukee to boo Malcom Brogdon for for winning Rookie of the Year but Brogdon didn’t play so they just started booing Tony Snell instead
"And they still kind of messed up drafting after he left and they sucked again. The only good pick they did was Kyrie and that was the easiest #1 pick in that era besides AD. In 2011 if they draft Kyrie &amp; Klay that’s amazing back court that would provide some of the most spacing ever and with Klay being the greatest off ball shooter he wouldn’t get in the way of Kyrie &amp; then eventually LeBron as well. In 2012 instead of drafting Dion Waiters, they should’ve drafted Harrison Barnes to have him play at the wing alongside Klay Thompson to make a very good defensive wing unit and keep LeBron at the 4 so the Cavs stay elite defensively and never have the drop off on the defensive end that they had in the 16-17 season. And with knowing how weak the 2013 NBA Draft is now, I think the Cavs should’ve traded the #1 pick to move down and get assets for future drafts. So in this scenario the Cavs draft CJ McCollum and have him be their 6th man off the bench with anywhere between the 5-10 pick if they traded down and instead of drafting Sergey with the 19th pick in the 2013 draft, they drafted Tony Snell who becomes another defensive wing off the bench that can shoot. Then the last move I would’ve made was trade some of those assets I got for trading the #1 pick to get Al Horford and have him play center so the team would’ve been ahead of the versatility bigs who can switch on the perimeter while stretching the floor. If the Cavs would’ve built their team like this, they could’ve been a 70 win+ team I truly believe and would’ve made those Heat teams look like amateurs."

"Tony Snell. Closer than you’d think though too.   Snells Peak [1 Year]   71% TS   12-5-3 per50   Rookie Kobe   54% TS   7-2-1   Snell has that indescribable quality that makes a star. The per50 highlights his all-around game. The 71% TS speaks for itself; Snell has a bag. Hesi jimbos, dropsteps into contact dunks, floaters, snatchbacks, and of course his signature move.   Tony [I call him Tony as a close, deeply intimate, personal friend] is a natural leader, a fighter, a thespian. People forget he was the #1 option in HS over one Kawhi Leonard. I would never say he’s better than Kobe or even a Kawhi; but when you look at the stats, the real hooper stats, he was better than them all…"
"I'm watching [here](https://youtu.be/NO7lWGbvV9s?t=338) and I don't see a screen, it looks like the doubler (Tony Snell?) is one pass away and just leaves his defender to trap, which is a totally legit and realistic play."
"I saw Tony Snell bricking 3 pt shots during warmups on live tv. This was when he just joined the Hawks. Obviously I wasnt enthusiastic when I saw that.  Welp, he turned out to be a sniper in-game."
Tony Snell has never done anything wrong in his entire life
Tony snell is wet. But that’s all but he doesn’t miss free throws and 50% on threes
"Easy NBA Championship, because Tony Snell is on the team."
That's Hawks legend and Bulls alumni Tony Snell to you.
"Top YouTube comment, “Khris Middleton the only player to play like Michael Jordan and Tony Snell at the same time”"
Tony Snell: 52/57/100
"Because the Hawks didn't make flashy moves and that people don't realize how hurt they were last year.  Like for real it's hilarious to me that people really think the Bulls or the Knicks could be better than them. They litterally were a 5th seed despite starting Tony Snell and Solo Hill at the 3 for half the season last year.   Trae missing the all star game was ridiculous already last year (they were better with him on the court than the Pacers were with Sabonis on the court even at that time).  The Nets and Bucks are tier 1, I wouldn't even be surprised if the Hawks are alone in tier 2 this year"
Kawhi Leonard and Tony Snell
"The Blazers were first in both isolation and pick and roll, because Lillard is incredible at those two play types- the defense with all the starters in ninth in the league too, the offense was elite as one of the best in the league and the starters were fantastic, but the team cratered with bench units.    Sending out Kanter and Melo, and bringing in Larry Nance jr, Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, all will help with that bench defense.  We’re hoping Afernee Simons and Nassir Little can grow and step up there as well, which would be huge to see growth there as Simons turned into a quality shooter and Little impressed in limited minutes."
Did you even watch Tony Snell play
The pistons got rid up all the old bucks crew. Butin 2019-20 their roster consisted of the following former bucks who had been on the bucks roster within the last 2 years:  &amp;#x200B;  Brandon Knight  Tony Snell  John Henson  Thon Maker  Tim Frazier  Christian Wood
"Shared elevator with Tony Snell..he seemed amused that we were high AF, he’s friendly/shy  Saw Shawn Marion outside a club.. just a cool dude with no ego and really appreciated when I told him I look forward to when he makes the HOF  I “saluted” Nate McMillan from across the street…he saluted back so that was cool (I was 14)  Daryl Dawkins, Kevin McHale, Jason Terry were really cool/acknowledging of fans..Eric Gordon too but he was really shy.   Dwight seemed to enjoy joking around with little kids and making them laugh  My friend saw Draymond at their apartment gym, said that he was really cool."
"Giannis was super shy when I met him years back. Tony Snell was chill, though another dude thought he was Thon Maker and kept yelling that out, so that was awkward  Embiid was chill  AD ignored me, so did Tyreke. Jrue was nice, as were Ryno and Jimmer. David Wesley was hilarious (and hating on Kobe). Monty Williams might have been the nicest person of all time  Dwane Casey was so nice and humble  Kobe was surprisingly nice and personable. Pau and Sasha Vucacic were cool. Shannon Brown I just said wattup, he was with a girl so didn't bother  Zbo was absolutely adorable  Bobby Jackson did not seem to want to talk or get a pic at all  Yogi Ferrell seemed douchey out of all people  DLo didn't want to talk or get a pic when I saw him right after the Lakers traded him to the Nets, so that makes sense. But before that got to talk and take a pic with him  Lou Will is one of the nicest dudes of all time, as is Jamal Crawford  Bagley was chill and we got a clean pic. Gallo was a cool guy as well  Jerry West seemed so genuine and I was like a fanboy seeing him  Pretty sure I saw Danny Granger at six flags, but I didn't want to yell out his name to confirm  Kareem was very quiet. I once got pushed by Shaqs bodyguard. Brian Shaw was quiet as well  Rick Fox, RJ, and Pierce were at an event and were chill  Larry Sanders and Arenas were cool  I'm sure there's more but I've blabbered long enough haha"
If Tony snell can jog back and forth for 28 minutes so can i
what exactly is your point? that AD was as bad as Tony Snell?  &amp;#x200B;  uhh.. ok.
Literally just the Hawks/Knicks first round series:  * Elfrid Payton * Julius Randle * Solomon Hill * Tony Snell * RJ Barrett  Even in the Lakers series how you coming away thinking you'd rather have Frank Kaminsky on your team.
"Sry for the homer but im gonna bet $1k on the Hawks over.    1. Hawks were one of the most injured teams last year - our only injuries this year will be Okongwu for half the year and Hunter for maybe a few games.   2. Coach change turned around almost every team stat 180 degrees   3. Young players will at least get slightly better   4. We lost Tony Snell, Bruno Fernando, Brandon Goodwin, Nathan Knight (one 9th man + g-leaguers) for Delon Wright, Dieng, and 2 solid rookies.    All this and we are only set to get roughly the same record as last year (last year we had 41 wins in a 72 game season)..? Easy money here."
Tony Snell and Thon Maker
"There are other factors though.  The Bucks no longer staggered their two best players because they played the same position.  You can put Giannis and Middleton on the court together, especially so you can play John Henson to camp in the paint and keep your guard options open with Delladova, Brogdan  and Tony Snell.    With the bench front court you had Monroe and Beasley with Thon Maker, Jason Terry, Teletoviz and Rashad Vaughn rounding out most of the rotation minutes.  Without having to satisfy Jabari's need for minutes, the roster actually got more balanced and settled into a functional rotation."
"I thought it might be Jamal Crawford, my first thought was John Collins but he wouldnt make sense in context. Then i thought of Tony Snell because he is basically Jesus Christ but man it just gets confusing ya know?"
Atleast Tony Snell wont be there to hurt the Raptors anymore
"DO YA SNELLLLLLL  What Tony Snell,  Is cooking."
Tony Snell😈
Tony Snell
Tony Snell
"Tony Snell, and I think he should be played by ASAP rocky"
"Get the fuck out of here with your Tony Snell facts, I’ve got shit to do.  *got another..?*"
Damn they really got beat by Tony Snell looooool
time to order a tony snell jersey
Another fun fact: today marks exactly TWO CALENDAR YEARS since the last time Tony Snell missed a free throw in an NBA game. He started 57 games last season and has played 24 this year.
Pure luck that 57% 3 point shooter Tony  Snell made a wide open 3 lol.
I hate that my Raptors lost to Tony Snell but I love to see Trae passing it to the open man instead of forcing a shot
Every throw is free for *Tony Snell*
"you joke, but I 100% saw it coming. The moment when we were only up by 2, I said that this was going to end in a Tony Snell 3."
Ex-Pistons great Tony Snell.

Tony Snell is the new Jeremy Lamb
You shut your mouth when you’re talking about Tony Snell!
Tony “Tony Snell” Snell
"0/0/0 Tony Snell hitting the game winner to send Toronto into fire sale mood thus netting the Bucks the final piece to a legit Championship run in Norman Powell, who should of been a Buck in the 1st place would be the sweetest kind of symmetry."
....is Tony Snell considered a wing defender?
"I hate Tony Snell, and i know he hates the Raptors lol.  Everytime he plays us he kills us."
Where’s Tony Snell?
TONY JABRONI SNELL SMELL
TIL Tony snell is on the hawks
🙌🏼TONY SNELL🙌🏼
I love Tony Snell what are you talking about
"It got to the point where I honestly believed I was the only Milwaukee resident who liked Tony Snell. Then we traded him, and then the Raptors destroyed our dreams.  I am very happy right now."
When will you fools realize Tony Snell was simply sparing the league from taking it over that game ?
I love Tony snell like a brother
"You cannot stop Tony “0/0/0/0/0” Snell, you can only hope to contain him"
Tony Snell is shooting 56% from 3....and 26% on 2's.
"Tony Snell is the type of dude who will probably never average more than 8 points a game, but will always have a spot on a roster and have a 17 year career."
"Tony Snell, so hot right now"
i enjoyed the stanley johnson tony snell matchup
TONY SNELL IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR
Game on the line I WANT TONY FUCKING SNELL BUZZER BEATER 3 TO WIN IT ALL. God damnit I needed this win so badly I’ve been going through a lot of shit

losing to a tony snell buzzer beater is such a Raptors way to lose.
Tony Snell stat line memes where the fuck y’all at
TONY SNELL CALLED GAME LMAO
"Nice! I was at UNM with Tony Snell when Jimmer was at BYU.   I’ll always hate BYU for those years, but I’m sure you’re used to that sentiment haha"
This is Tony Snell erasure and I want no part of it!! (I know he doesn't qualify cuz of attempts but 35 of 62 is pretty darn impressive anyway)
This list isn't legit without Tony Snell
"We have mad fights over him at the upvote factory. This is a tough decision.  As for the 3pt % he can definitely shoot but as another team I'd be cautious drooling over that number. He's shooting in a system that also had Tony Snell shootin' 57% from three on over 100 attempts. So, while we all know curry ain't shit compared to snellville, folks do be running a little hot in our offense. I think it's the crunk juice in our water."
Jordan Nwora and Tony Snell?
"Same. With Khris/Giannis being together for so long, it feels like we've had such a continuous roster (which in some seasons past was true and I think accounted for a lot of our regular season success), but this year was really a lot of new faces.  But you see the way they still embrace guys like Tony Snell when we face their new teams, and it sucks we couldn't get one for guys like that. Or even like, Thon, Jabari... guys that were supposed to be part of this future but just couldn't pan out"
Somewhere between Jordan and Tony Snell
"Tony Snell (for the memes), Luka Doncic"
Football is a waaaaaaaaay bigger sports. You want to be surprised? Check out NHL superstar salaries. The highest paid player is at 12.5M a year. There are less than 14 players making double digits millions.   Do you know who is paid 12.5M a year in the NBA?  Tony Snell is the 102 most paid NBA player with 12.2M.   The top NHL player is paid less than Dion Waiters and Corey Joseph (12.6M).

Tim Hardaway Jr vs Tony Snell
Tony snell
The energy Giannis expends in 38 minutes is = 380 minutes for a Tony Snell like player.
Torrey Craig with the Tony Snell statline.
"&gt;Here’s the thing, you’ve just listed a bunch of averages at me and no one actually shoots their average consistently, it’s like how Lebrons career average is 27/7/7 but he never records that. Shit fluctuates.  No shit. I'm not saying they hit their season averages exactly every game, but they have 5 players on their roster who hit 40% from 3 on the season. That means they're good 3 point shooters (all ranked in the top 70 of NBA players on the season), but they went 4/26. Julius Randle averaged 24 ppg this season. He had an uncharacteristically bad game 1, so it was easy to see a bounce back in game 2. That doesn't mean he's going to score exactly 24 points, but game 1 he was unlucky. He was missing shots he'd made all year.  &gt;Most of your players hit above their average last game.  I'm not a Hawks fan.  &gt;if you expect consistent from a young inexperienced team idk what to tell you.  The players I'm talking about are Gallinari, who is 32 and in his 12th NBA season. Bogdanovic, who is 28 and in his 4th NBA season. Tony Snell, who is 29 and in his 8th NBA season. Lou Williams, who is 34 and in his 16th NBA season. And John Collins, who is 23 and in his 4th NBA season."
Tony Snell is shook
The Tony Snell special
Living that Tony Snell live
Davis Bertans vs Tony Snell vs Kyle Kuzma in a triple threat ladder match!
In Milwaukee we call that the Tony Snell Special
"Ah man, was about to say real Tony snell energy then I saw he got two boards"
"&gt;I didn’t realize your team had multiple role players shooting 100% on wide open threes this season  Nice job being intentionally stupid. No one is saying the Hawks players shoot 100% from 3, but it's an absolute objective fact that 4 of their best shooters had terrible shooting nights from 3pt range.   John Collins shot 40% on the season and made 0/2 tonight for 0%.  Gallinari shot 41% on the season and made 2/9 tonight for 22%.   Bogdanovic shot 44% on the season and made 2/13 tonight for 15%.   Tony Snell shot 57% on the season and made 0/2 tonight for 0%.   Even if all of them shot 10% below their season average that's an expected point output of 26, but in the game itself they ended with 12. 14 points would have been the difference in the game. Unfortunately for the Hawks their 4 best 3pt shooters by % all had terrible games. Sometimes that happens, but it IS unlucky."
People keep making this mistake.   Tony Snell would have put up that statline but with a +21
"Put some respect on Tony Snell, man is an efficient ass scorer these days"
"Nate McMillan has personally cost the Hawks this game. In the 12:31 minutes he paired Tony Snell with Lou Will the Hawks went -14.  He stuck to his rotations as if this is a regular season back to back game and Trae is 36 and not 22, despite Trae carving the Knicks up every time he hit the court. Just terrible rotations by him despite excellent gameplan to start the game."
tony snell would put up 0 0 0 0 0  just brutal
"Wait you mean to tell me that Tony Snell, Lou Williams, and a literal Muppet can't carry a team down the stretch in the playoffs?"
Tony Snell got the rock and told them motherfuckers to clear out

Tony Snell
Laughs in Tony Snell
Question: commentator just said that Joe Harris led the league in 3 point percentage but I thought Tony Snell shot 50%? Min. attempts or was he just wrong?
1. Tony Snell
"I agree man, but you’re overlooking why it’s hard for bulls fans to root for the knicks in this series. Sure they have The Windy City Assassin, fan favorite Taj, and who doesn’t love Thibs. BUT, Hawks got arguably our most important/greatest player of all time: Tony Motherfucking Snell!"
he pulled a tony snell
"The goat himself, Tony Snell."
It's no Tony Snell but it looks promising
"As a bulls fan watching this knicks hawks series, I am torn for who to root for. For the knicks I mean they have thibs, Drose, and Taj. For the hawks they have Bulls legend and 50 50 100 Tony motherfucking Snell. It’s a tossup"
"&gt; Towns was injured when we sucked. We didn’t suck in the 2nd half when Towns was healthy. &gt;’Lo, Beasley, and Ant were better offensively than your backcourt after Towns came back from injury. McDaniels shot 36.4% from 3 at SF/PF and only Vanderbilt at PF couldn’t shoot in our starting lineup.  &gt;The Wolves were a much better team after Towns came back from injury.  You were an abysmal 17-31 when he came back, but go off.  [For all that cherry picking it still doesn't translate to Ws](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/joel_embiid_vs_karl_anthony_towns.htm), goddamn Tony Snell just made the 50/50/100 club but at least he's in the playoffs.    Sure, Towns IS better than Embiid as far as career percentages go, almost as if Embiid didn't play his first 2 seasons but you know good for KAT. [But for the past 3 years Joel and Giannis has left him in the dust](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/playtype-post-up/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=POSS_PCT&amp;dir=1). Give it time and that will change sooner rather than later.  With all these stats you want to incorporate, just a simple eye-test really. When was Towns ever in serious MVP discussion? When people talk about a post-scorer, does KAT ever get mentioned even? If you want more stats, All-NBA he had 1 as third team back in 18-19, Joel has double already and in a higher spot, same goes for All-Star but as a starter on all 4 instead of bench warmer.   KAT has peaked in 18-19 and you're not ready to have that conversation yet boyo. Every scapegoat KAT and the wolves franchise/fans have used are doing way better now, Jimmy, Wiggins, Thibs, Taj, Lavine and when you're over the honeymoon phase you'll ship Ant for some dumb reason yet again, like a bonafide stan.  Maybe your center should focus on efficient winning, ever thought of that."
"I like players like Snell. Nothing they do is gonna jump out to the casual fan, but they know their role and they play it perfectly. Snell doesn't really take bad shots, hence the high percentage and the attempts per game. He goes out there, plays high IQ basketball, and plays his role to perfection.   Good teams will always need a Tony Snell type player. Players like Snell will always be a positive for their respective teams."
"Tony Snell has made 62/107 3s this year, just 2.3 attempts per game but that's 57% wtf xD  MISS YOU TONY"
Fuck yeah Tony Snell
We’re gonna lose cause guys like Tony Snell and Huerter? Cmon

Tony Snell with 5 letters and a better % than all these guys
tony snell doesnt count hes 50/50/100

Isn't Tony Snell shooting 100% from the ft line ?

Can you SNELL what the Tony is cookin'?
"For a full 82-game season, the qualifiers for each stat are 300 FGM, 82 3PM, and 125 FTM.   Tony Snell this season had 88 FGM, 62 3PM, 11 FTM.  I'm not sure how they're doing the qualifiers for this 72-game season, but if it's just the same qualifiers adjusted for 72 games, then it'd be around 263 FGM, 72 3PM, 110 FTM."
Found the anti-Tony snell media pawn
The disrespect for Tony Snell is amazing
bruh you the one telling yourself kyrie not in the club LOL   its okay. i understand you don't have much to say now after that terrible example of tony snell.  keep telling yourself kyrie isn't in the club and tony snell should be.
tell myself what? you trying to convince ppl kyrie isnt in the 50/40/90 club because of your rules LOL and you bring up tony snell as your counter  LOLLLL
FYI tony snell was a joke. talking about not too bright
Is Tony Snell the best shooter alive?  Discuss.
Yeah I added an honorable mention section at the bottom for those that arguably have too few minutes played. The only members of that group are Meyers Leonard and Tony Snell :)
@Joshlloyd48 is this what you mean by pulling a Tony Snell? Elite efficiency leading to a league SHATTERING record?
Ya all tony snell.   The hawks were the 10 or 11 seed when NM took over
"The fate of the universe on the line, the Martians have the death beam pointed at earth, you better hit it, I WANT TONY SNELL."
Great dude.   But never has someone been more invisible on the court than Tony Snell with that kind of talent.
Except Tony Snell turned into the GOAT and MCW makes my beer taste bad
Oh god that shit was awful   Haha MCW and Tony Snell woohoo   The teams were basically like “We’ll give you our garbage for your garbage”
who's fault is it that he's taking difficult shots? he missed a quarter of the season. tony snell shot 50/55/100 why isn't he included
i played in a ymca league once where we kept track of stats for some reason and i went 11/11 one season.  even got intentionally fouled to stop the clock in the last game with 10 seconds left.  basically i'm as good as or better than tony snell.
Lol what a bs stat. 11 ft attempts for the year. Harden has the record for most made in a single game without a miss at 24. Twice this number.  Tony Snell had 100% last year too with only 32 attempts which is marginally more impressive.
Man pulled a Tony Snell
"Not impressed cause a few people has already achieve this feat. Just found out Tony ""OFFICIAL GOAT"" Snell is the only player too average 50/50/100. Now that's GOAT %"
&gt;Tony Snell is officially the first player in NBA history to have a 50/50/100 season (min 100 attempts).  He's only attempted 11 free throws this season though.
"Maybe a hot take, but Tony Snell is better than Michael Jordan"
"Tony Snell, as in the artist formerly known as Young Darkness?"
The bloke who owned the neighbouring farm where I grew up was called tony snell lol
"Tony Snell is a mysterious man. He just shows up, makes shots. But doesn't want to take too many shots, that would be unfair to the rest of the league."
I'll remember forget the GOAT Tony Snell because of the stat where he didn't record a single stat of any type for 28 minutes lmao. Dude was out there just running
Tony Snell and Jeremy Lamb turn into Reggie Miller against the Raptors
