CJ McCollum is a NBA Twitter goat.
"His playstyle reminds me of Lou Will, CJ Mccollum"
CJ McCollum is shooting 11 threes per game this season and making 44.1% of them.  It's amazing how quickly we got used to unbelievable accomplishments.
"Who would win:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  vs.   Dame, GTJ, Hood(?), Covington, Kanter  With how CJ was playing, I honestly think that top team would win. Lol."
"Blazers hospital team:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  Luckily Roco is back from his concussion!"
"I mean, could we even come to an agreement right now?  I have:  pg: Curry / Luka / Dame / Cp3 / Kyrie  sg: Soften / Beal / Mitchell / Dbook / CJ McCollum  sf: LeBum / Kawhine / Jimmy Butler / Jayson ""6'10"" Tatum / PG13%  pf: Giannis / AD / Sabonis / Siakam / Williamson  c: Jokic / EmbiId / Bayumn Adebayo / KAT / Zhe Baguette Money Man  &amp;#x200B;  and I guarantee there would be a bunch of angry people regarding those rankings."
"Lots of #2 guys are on max contracts. Klay Thompson, Khris Middleton, CJ McCollum..."
"&gt;davis saying that klay getting hurt was karma is way more fucked up   Being injured doesn't give you a free pass. When Chandler Parsons (another guy getting paid millions to hang out in street clothes for multiple years) went at CJ McCollum, CJ fired back and it wasn't considered ""so fucked up.""  GSV is always wants to dish it out, then gets all sensitive whenever someone talks back. [Heck, Klay talked about ""hurt feelings"" and ""it's a man's game"" - then got all upset about LeBron *eating a cookie*.](https://www.complex.com/sports/2018/12/klay-thompson-calls-cavs-bums-over-halloween-cookie-troll)"
"Ok first off, the portland trailblazers and Damian Lillard have a much better roster than the warriors right now. That's not a debate, the warriors have no depth.. Outside of their average starting five, they have one of the worst teams in the NBA.   So if we look at the team success so far, Steph Curry's warriors, who are a worse team than Lillard's blazers, are essentially tied in record (10-9,11-9). Don't underestimate that blazers team though. CJ McCollum is an all-star level player, he just hasn't had the appearances because the team he's on isn't usually high enough in the standings to warrant a #2 guy like McCollum to make it. Why are the blazers not usually higher in the standings then? It's not the coaching, Terry Stotts has built a great system. It's not the surrounding cast, the blazers have guys like Nurkic, Kanter, Trent Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Rodney Hood, and others in the past, etc... It's because Lillard is not good enough to push them to the next level. It's not always as easy as just putting up the numbers. It's the same reason why Harden, who puts up crazy numbers, hasn't had much team success. Both are not as efficient and don't affect the game in different enough ways to make up for that, unlike a guy like Lebron who does everything, or KD &amp; Curry who are extremely efficient."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
Mike Breen said IQ bases his game after Lou Will and CJ McCollum
"In my opinion, 2k Ratings are 80% accurate, based on the general opinion (though in my opinion CJ McCollum is ranked a bit too high)"

"CJ McCollum is treated like a D Tier defender, when he is actually a damn good on ball defender"
"You’re telling me CJ McCollum isn’t starting ahead of KCP, DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, or Reggie Jackson. Only team I’ll give you is the Nets for obvious reasons"
CJ McCollum.
CJ will be re evaluated in about 2.5 weeks. Nurk will be reevaluated in about 4.5 weeks. The 4 and 6 week thing is about 10 days old.   [Source](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/cj-mccollum-jusuf-nurkic-injury-timeline-return-updates-trail-blazers/1dd8fd229s0u314tmiht6i8526)
“Ouch” - CJ McCollum
"I think the top 5 playing now are: Rudy Gobert, CJ Mccollum, Hassan Whiteside, Danny Green, and Fred VanVleet"
  Is KP appreciably worse than Jrue Holiday? Or CJ McCollum? Or Clint Capela?   When AD missed the playoffs in NOLA you guys put it all on him. You would do the same if Lillard or Trae misses this year. Why is it different with Luka?
CJ McCollum has a real argument
"[Bro Donovan met with Kamala Harris](https://www.nba.com/jazz/news/donovan-mitchell-discusses-voting-education-and-police-reform-vp-candidate-kamala-harris) (along with CJ McCollum and Tobias Harris) to discuss voting, education, and police reform. He was one of the biggest people involved in the Say Her Name efforts for Breonna Taylor. If that ain't social justice I don't know what is."
He has a better chance now that CJ broke his foot. McCollum was ballin' out before the injury and would have had a strong case for an all star spot.
He would have been CJ McCollum
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
"Yeah, and with Covid, there's some people who missed a bunch of games like Jimmy Butler. CJ McCollum also had a really good month but he's now injured so kinda interested to see how something like will turn out."
"Simons I get, you take a swing at 26  Going into the 2017 draft with 3 picks and coming out with Collins and Swanigan is unforgivable though considering what was available in our range.  That draft is the biggest mistake of the many he’s made since being here(and he’s made A LOT).  He’s a good GM around the small margins and is good at drafting in the 2nd round but his record of good picks in the 1st round is...CJ McCollum and that’s it"

"It is kinda interesting to think about players' scoring outside of just a plain per-game average.  Here's the current top ten players in PPG with their scoring standard deviation.

Fuck CJ McCollum. Shits on him all over Twitter and now tryna act like everything's cool
CJ McCollum on Dirk vibes
"lol fr. kyrie spends way way waaay too much time hunting his shot in the midrange. its not an efficient playstlyle at all. hes playing like an overglorified cj mccollum rn, which isnt what you want outta kyrie at all"
KD did the same to CJ McCollum I can't lie but Shaq was way outta pocket
Off eye test he looks 6'1 to me  Looks shorter than CJ McCollum (legit 6'3)
1. Jokic 2. CJ McCollum 3. Klay Thompson 4. Bam Adebayo 5. Mitchell
I'll always dislike it when people say that because there's so many types of jumpers.      Is it like Kyle Korver/JJ Redick where the player can hit curling jumpers off screens?        Is it like Joe Ingles where the player primarily is just a stationary catch and shoot from the corner?      It it like Serge Ibaka where the player can hit elbow pick and pops?      Is it like CJ McCollum where the player can pull up and shoot from anywhere on the court from creating their own shot?

"Brother behind James Harden, Beal is the second best 2 gaurd right now followed by Devin booker at 3, CJ McCollum at 4, Jaylen Brown at 5,  Middleton at 6. Even tho Middleton is playing as a 3 he’s really a 2."
"I think I have a mental block or something. Until your comment I was picturing CJ McCollum. I just can't keep those two straight. My first thought reading your comment was ""how does someone think this guy is white?"" Someday I hope to read one of there names and not have figure if the guy in Portland or philadelphia  is being talked about."
Looked up some records vs recent stars:  10-0 vs Dipo  22-4 vs Hayward 22-5 vs CJ McCollum 12-2 vs John wall
Before injury CJ McCollum turned it up a notch and was playing at an All-Star level this season (26.7pts/5ast/3.9reb).
&gt; CJ McCollum will miss at least the next four weeks  This is like a minor injury. My guy will be ready for the playoffs.
"There's a reason I named this dude my first [cool cat](https://crispbouncepass.com/issue-6-cool-cats-cj-mccollum/). I think he brings such a good, introspective presence to the league and I enjoy watching him both on and off the court."
I feel bad to all CJ McCollum fantasy owner 💔  Dude's ballin out. Dame gonna take all CJ shot
[CJ McCollum and Andre Iguodala chiming in](https://i.imgur.com/kZDT9Lm.png)
&gt;Dame put up 30-5-8 on 63% TS last when when our 3rd best player was Hassan Whiteside. Watching a warriors fan try and use the spacing excuse now is fucking hilarious by the way   And the 2and best player was cJ McCollum. The warriors second best player is Draymond or Wiggins.   &gt;My bad didn't realize playoffs two years ago is a factor in the 2021 mvp race.  Neither of them are in that race though. Or most the players on the list above.
"CJ McCollum needs to make it, and Mike Conley has a chance"
He considers himself a Lou/CJ Mccollum hybrid.
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
There was a game last year where CJ McCollum was assessed a flagrant for kicking his leg out trying to draw a shooting foul. I don't know if thats been codified but it was a great call.
"Until this year, CJ McCollum was the inverse of this. At PG he would actually move the ball and play a team game but whenever he was in the game with Dame he just shot a midrange fadeaway every time he got the ball. Seems to be much better this year though."
He said he modelled his game after CJ McCollum and Lou Williams
"I'm a homer, but I think immediately of CJ McCollum. He has a smooth, crafty handle, plays well in tight spaces, and scores from all ranges efficiently. I love Dame, of course, but CJ's game is a little more aesthetically pleasing and he doesn't interrupt his flow to foul hunt like Dame does."
Agreed. When he is cooking which unfortunately is not in big games nor consistent. His career fg % is below what you would expect for a guy with his size and talent.  CJ mccollum is equally as smooth and actually efficient.
CJ mccollum and Khris Middleton
CJ McCollum
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"
"Nah not if you mean #2 most important player. Portland’s biggest needs are literally defense, rebounding, and playmaking. That is literally exactly what Ben Simmons brings to the table. Don’t believe me? They rank 26th in points allowed per game, 22nd in rebounding, and 28th is assists. They literally are the perfect team that needs Ben Simmons. I’ll get downvoted because CJ McCollum scores more points and shoots more threes than Ben Simmons and on here that’s the end all to any conversation and people can’t even wrap their head around the fact that Portland is literally the Crystal clear example of why the phrase “offense is more valuable than defense” is just not true (ok sure maybe in terms of fighting for the eight seed) playoffs that shit matters more. Ben Simmons would undoubtedly be #2 player in Portland.  They lose games because the can’t defend for shit. The guys on Inside the NBA were literally talking about the other night, and they’re literally former NBA players, with Shaq and Chuck being like top 30 players all time and Kenny having played many years in the NBA as a guard with some of the greats (ex.

"How can ""LeBron has AD"" be an argument against LeBron winning MVP, but CJ McCollum and Malcom brogdon aren't a knock against Lillard and Sabonis."
My boy CJ McCollum and Domantas Sabonis are both up there as well... Middleton def deserves some love too!
CJ McCollum was above average from all zones in [2018-2019](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?flag=3&amp;CFID=33&amp;CFPARAMS=2018-19&amp;PlayerID=203468&amp;ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;section=player&amp;sct=zone).
random fact: Mike Muscala beat out CJ McCollum for conference player of the year twice for patriot league conference with both sharing the same four years in college
Yeah lmao CJ McCollum is such a Draymond fan boy. Too bad he doesn't understand basketball better

"Not totally agree. CJ also last year and 2 years ago was much more valuable. Russ was still an all time bad shooter, and as much Russ can do other things, combine this with is poor decision making and any team offense would be limited more by having Westbrook than McCollum. Moreover CJ was always a better defender (Russ had the potential but was never willing to sacrifice on that end).  On the other hand, CJ was yet elite shoot creator, great teammate, great shooter and can play decent D. Russ only has accumulated more stats because he is more interested in that, but also in Houston and last years in OKC he shows all his flows and prevented good team to reach their potential. In both case I think CJ would be much more useful instead."
"CJ McCollum, Draymond, Jimmy Butler but knowing  Jimmy he prob wouldn’t do it"
"Jaylen Brown, OG, Brogdon, CJ McCollum.  Some of the best non-all stars in the league who are versatile defenders (except CJ) and can all shoot very well to create space for Shaq to eat BBQ chicken."
"Malcolm Brogdon, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavine, Zion Williamson - not necessarily role players but none of them have been all stars (yet)."
"CJ McCollum, a playmaker like Mike Conley, PJ Tucker and probably a defensive stopper or honestly another playmaker. All w/o all stars."
"Im gonng go with Cj mccollum, ik its a bad time to do it but hes streaky, hes on the high end of his streak rn, hes a ball hog with tunnel vision. Seems to have it out for and blue balls the players that threaten his number 2 spot.   Also probably deandre ayton"
"I don't think CJ McCollum is a 44% shooter from three, but he's been a career 40%er and has hit 42% a couple times. This season he's taking a lot more of them, and that part at least looks very sustainable, as he's mainly just moved a lot of his midrange work further out. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't regress very much."
&gt; Maybe WB 4-5 years ago  lmao maybe??? you would *maybe* take the league mvp over CJ MCCollum? ok lol
CJ the shark McCollum over Curry. Less assists but also half the turnovers and some more steals.  Also Luka...
Watch out for CJ the Shark McCollum
Damian “CJ “shark” McCollum” McLillard
Winner: CJ McCollum who is now a shoo-in for All-Star if he keeps playing as well as he has been.
"Theres a bunch of VPs. Igoudala is the 1st VP then the other VPs are Biyombo, Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Kylie, CJ McCollum and Garrett Temple."
I just appreciate that CJ McCollum takes naps.
"CJ McCollum: “Right before my nap huh . Most entertaining sport in the business”  And yet he might just a beneficiary of this trade, maybe possibly finally getting an All-Star berth!"
"Why?  And for who?    You do know about salary matching, right?  With the combined cap numbers for Drummond and Love, pretty much the only players they could trade in return would be.... Damian Lillard and like another $5 million player....... or both CJ McCollum and Nurkic AND an additional ~$20 million worth of players.  Seems super likely, to get the services of Kevin Love and Andre Drummond.  /s  There is absolutely no one who is going to take both Drummond and Love off your hands at the same time.  That's a fantasy."
"I just said he’s all star talent  Not everyone with all star talent is an all star  (CJ McCollum, Jrue Holiday, Lavine) not that I’m saying he’s better than any of those guys."
Oh cool I was wondering about how cj mccollum fit into all this
"At this stage in 2007, Dirk was on a 3-4 team he won MVP. Phoenix was 4-5 in 2006 to star the year. Cleveland was 4-3 in 2010. MVP rankings shouldn't be allowed until like 20 games in.  Because if we are being honest, Joel Embiid, CJ McCollum, Jaylen Brown or Gordon Hayward have been the most valuable players through 8-9 games. Anyone saying LeBron, Luka, Steph etc... are all projecting."
"exactly which is why I said I'm not trying to get into a Luka v Steph debate. I personally don't think Luka should be #2 in the MVP ranking (for that matter I don't think anyone should) MVP rankings this early are stupid, if we are being completely honest, Gordon Hayward has probably been the MVP thus far.   Luka's only saving grace is he's led his team to a winning record without his 2nd best player, he's doing so with new starters, and he's still averaging 26/8/8. Again, not MVP frontrunner numbers, but then again neither are Steph's.   IMO: top MVP candidates in no order should be Embiid, Jokic, Giannis and then in the next batch you have LeBron, Hayward, Luka, Tatum or Brown, CJ McCollum, Steph"
"You should checkout my podcast “Ball Talk” wherever you find podcasts we talked about a lot of potential Harden destinations at the end of our most recent episode.   You could almost definitely get any 2 players you want from a team like the Raptors, or you could probably get someone like Tobias Harris, or CJ McCollum with picks. And even though none of those guys are better than Kyrie, none of them are head cases, you’re probably getting more and better picks, and the fit on the Rockets would be much easier (Fertitta seems to still want to win games form what I’ve heard)."
"CJ McCollum, aside from that his game is awesome I listen to his podcast and tweeted at him about a topic he brought up and he responded since then I Stan him."
Ingram Booker Jokic Embiid Sabonis CJ McCollum DeMar (just bc i got mad C already) Durant and Beal
Michael Jordan  CJ McCollum   Bradley Beal
ever hear of CJ McCollum tho?
"Draymond, CJ McCollum, Jaylen Brown"
"CJ McCollum could be the “guy” for a lot of teams if he wasn’t in Dames shadow, though he’s kind of been the dude this season so far"
"CJ McCollum could be a legit first option on a semi playoff team, especially if he had the green light to let it fly every night.  Outside of that, Sabonis can really be good as a second option on a good fuckin team. Hes a 20 20 machine, and I could see him starting to get more triple doubles, especially this season."
"I just don’t value Kyrie’s impact on a winning team highly. That’s why I would rather have someone like Kris Middleton, CJ McCollum, etc. over him. People like him for his empty stats. He’s just another regurgitation of Stephon Marbury in my opinion.  He can have impressive numbers but his overall impact to the team is overrated because his numbers look gaudy. Meanwhile the bad defense gets overlooked. The horrible work ethic gets ignored. His impact on negative team chemistry gets thrown out the window.   In a few years he’ll be eating Vaseline and playing in China"
Ah yes Notorious role player CJ McCollum
Its not lol. I thought kd was talking about him when he called cj mccollum a 6th man
No. CJ McCollum led the league. The Celtics stat was the average.
"The average starter ran just under 2 miles a game in 2008. As per one of the last Zach Lowe Podcast on GrantLand. He was citing research that the Celtics had done in house when they won the chip. In 2018, CJ McCollum led the league by running 2.65 miles a game. So... no."
&gt; 2011 Mav had the same situation as the 2019 Raptors.  It's not exactly the same since no one else on that team was an all-star like Lowry was in 2019. Terry was on fire in the playoffs but he was basically on the caliber of what CJ McCollum is regarded as now.  Also I'd argue Dirk carried harder than Kawhi did in bringing the team to the Finals. Dirk didn't play amazing in the Finals but what he did to the western conference during that run was insane.
"Except it's not the most important factor. The explosion in three point attempts and the increase in the average guard's skill is the main factor. Second tier guards like Terry Rozier and CJ McCollum were not nearly as effective on offence ten years ago because they were not launching 7-8 threes per game at 38%+. Similarly, if Steph Curry had played 20 years ago and had his 10-12 3PAs cut in half, he'd be a far less effective offensive weapon."
Why're you pretending CJ McCollum isn't putting up 24/5/4 this season?  CJ has put up 22/4/4 in 6 seasons as a starter but some of ya'll act like Dame has gotten zero help.
Teams are finally understanding that it's better to let CJ McCollum or Norman Powell score than to let him score
I would agree with this if it was about Jamal Murray or CJ McCollum   This is kyrie. We’ve seen him do this in the finals
"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players — and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  “It’s hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,” said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  “It is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I’m going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,” Ms. Hassam said. “Americans looking to profit off China’s market find themselves in a much more challenging place.”       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade’s Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  “By speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,” Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.’s biggest stars, is known as “China Klay” to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand’s social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to “commit genocide and crimes against humanity” in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.’s reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey’s message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.’s partnership with China was “complicated,” but that “doesn’t mean we don’t speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.”  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D’Angelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  “My decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it’s not just one way of doing things,” Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell’s contract in November 2019. “I had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.”"
"And Edwards has put up 25 a game since Finch was coach. On pretty solid efficiency too. If you wanna see a player he’s been scoring similarly to, look at CJ McCollum before this year. But on slightly better efficiency."
"With all due respect to GTJ, he doesn't have that 'smoothness' to his game that CJ McCollum has. CJ is legit one of the smoothest operators in the midrange and so far up until this most recent injury, an ELITE 3 point shooter. Pretty above average ballhandler too, Gary hasn't strung together a lot of that yet, but I really hope he does.  Also, CJ was the same age as Gary when he was drafted. For whatever its worth."
He was to CJ McCollum what CJ is to Dame. Thought he'd be a really solid backup for any team not trying to contend.
Now do CJ McCollum
"To be fair he did argue with CJ mccollum on his podcast that there's nothing wrong for a ""star"" to come off the bench and that would benefit the team (arguing that cj should do it for example). Of course it's easy for him to say, no way he would ever be in that position"
He’s prob the worst player this season to actually get minutes. His pre draft comp was Cj McCollum.
We really had him playing like CJ McCollum when that wasn’t his game at all. I’m glad Pop corrected that part of his game and unlocked his potential.
"In the playoffs everybody not named Russell Westbrook fucks Dame up, people just like his loyalty to much to see it.  Dame has played in 11 playoff series in his career, 4 of those he shot under 40% from the field and twice he shot under 20% from 3. The argument that he gets double teamed is also so stupid it doesn't make any sense, James Harden and Steph get doubled in 99% of the possessions they play, they still don't shoot 18% from 3.  Portland fans on this sub love them some CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic until they have to defend Dame's struggles, then they hate them and say that Dame doesn't have enough help."

"&gt;Ya i think OG should have got a tech too  It really wasn't a hard play to call.  Obvious Flagrant-2 on Anunoby, and then offsetting single technicals on Harrell and Trent for the aftermath.  Common foul on Schroder for the live ball play.  A Flagrant-1 is ""unnecessary"" contact, and this was clearly that.  It upgrades to a Flagrant-2 if the contact is ""excessive"", again, absolutely no doubt on that point.  That the officials somehow screwed that up into offsetting double techs on Harrell and Anunoby, and nothing for Trent, is typical of NBA officials.  Apparently Trent has compromising pictures of this crew, because he also got away with drilling Caruso with an intentional elbow later.  &gt; Unless fred and co are out there ... escalating   That is literally what Van Vleet would be doing, were he not restrained by a security guard -- see the image linked above.

"He might not be a superstar, but definitely not a role player and definitely an excellent scorer. It's not really surprising for CJ Mccollum to torch a team from time to time."

Cj McCollum needs more help.
"lol idc about his offense in a starting lineup with damian lillard, cj mccollum, and hopefully jusuf nurkic (who knows with these injuries) he's needed for his defense.   portland was essentially matching the clippers bucket for bucket, but still down by multiple scores because they couldn't get a single stop."
Trade Ingram for CJ MCcollum. I think trade helps both teams equally.
I’m taking Jamal Murray over CJ McCollum and Ja Morant
No Dame or CJ McCollum?  Not a good list.
"Jesus christ guys, he's taking about cj mccollum"
"But all their possible targets come from teams that don't even need Simmons (Wizards, Bulls). So assume Minny land that top 3 pick they better go for that to get valuable assets to go for those players.   Or it could be Blazers' CJ McCollum but I heavily doubt they want a non scoring player to help Dame"
"He's just so much better in every way. His playmaking is so much more improved and that's the big deal, but he has some high efficiency scoring nights too. He's not got it together in any sort of consistent way, but if he can be who he has shown then I think he could be a cj mccollum level guy."
Damn CJ McCollum got old af
"Jusuf Nurkic yelled, “There you go!” CJ McCollum gave a look of pleasant surprise. Norman Powell belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Damian Lillard hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
You could probably line them up pretty well       THIS IS NOT SAYING THEY ARE EQUAL SKILLS/RANKS BUT THE CAN ROUGHLY FILL THE SAME ROLE IN AT LEAST COMPARABLE WAYS  Dame ~ Curry  Jokic ~ KP  CJ McCollum ~ Jamaal Murray  Gordon ~ MPJ ~ Wiggins  Melo ~ Tim Hardaway ~ Oubre ~ Kleber  Paul Milsap ~ Draymond  WCS ~ Wiseman ~ Boban
That play the other day where he blocked cj mccollum on one end and dunked on the other was all i needed to see.
"&gt; Paul George, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant (insistent), Damian Lillard (insistent), CJ McCollum, PG13, JJ Redick, Kelly Oubre.  Is that enough for you, or do you know better than NBA players?"
"Paul George, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant (insistent), Damian Lillard (insistent), CJ McCollum, PG13, JJ Redick, Kelly Oubre"
devin booker received the 26th most all star votes from fans. He received more votes than:   * Chris Paul   * Rudy Gobert   * Ben Simmons  * Kyle Lowry   * Nikola Vucevic   * CJ McCollum   * SGA  I'd say he is properly rated
Cj McCollum?
I think CJ Mccollum and 2 future 1st round picks is a fair deal.  We can use our draft picks to make another huge trade for a pg.
This guy in the Wingstop commercial looks a little like CJ McCollum.

I honestly don’t know what they can do. What is CJ McCollum getting for you in a trade that makes them that much better?
"I want to keep Jrue, like a lot, and this McCollum trade isn’t it imo, but CJ is a better on-ball threat. Khris is rather messy with dribbling, and isn’t the best shot maker in ISO’s"
CJ McCollum is not expiring and the Bucks wouldn’t even entertain a swap if one was available.

"No, CJ McCollum hasn't even been an allstar"
"&gt;Okay, and D’Lo hasn’t even shot above average efficiency lol, so what’s your point?  because he has yet to have a star to make things easy for him?   &gt;How can I not compare them offensively? Klay scores most of his points assisted as well? But nobody is taking McCollum over prime Klay.  We don't know how good CJ would have looked next to Steph, and besides Klay shot like 38% from 3 whenever Steph wasn't on the floor."
"&gt;Wiggins doesn’t look average though, he literally is scoring 18 on above average efficiency, and offense isn’t even his more elite area.  Being a little bit above average isn't exactly being elite  &gt;I appreciate the stats, but either way, I’d rather have Wiggins. Neither player is a good first option, but you can at least surround Wiggins with better players. If D’Lo is playing with other ball-handlers he loses a ton of value, and his shot-creation is significantly less valuable.  But you've never paired D'lo with good players before, you can't say how the fit will look with KAT and Finch has been saying he has a lot of plans for him. Especially late game since the Wolves have a creation problem where teams smother Towns and nobody else can get a bucket, D'lo's self creation is valuable.  &gt;It’s like comparing Klay Thompson and CJ McCollum. Except the defensive gap is even greater.  I mean you can't compare them at all offensively since like I said Wiggins has more than half of his shots assisted is a meh ball handler and meh passer."

Cleveland with LeBron and CJ McCollum to play at home with Larry Nance Jr
Moses Brown and CJ McCollum
[CJ McCollum](https://streamable.com/2xv5cz) of course.
For real. McCollum carried hard that game shooting 17/29 for 37 points. Saves his ass. Imagine if they lose that Lillard will get blasted or not cause blazers fans are blinded by Dame time. They always blaming cj lol when infact cj steps his game up in playoffs.
CJ McCollum
"Im not even a big fan of shaqs tv persona. He needs alot of support from the other 3. He’s actually pretty terrible on Tuesday nights when chuck, kenny, and ernie ain’t around.   Tnt should look into people who are already comfortable behind the camera and mic like someone mentioned jj reddick is a solid choice. Draymond is solid. Id throw in cj McCollum as well."
Dames best teammate has been CJ McCollum while Westbrook has played with Hall of Famers
"I don't see it.  While they have the talent, they haven't put it together.  Theyve had the worst luck with H&amp;S protocols, but several of the teams above them in the standings haven't had a lot more luck:  Mavericks also had tons of H&amp;S protocol games and other injuries- have a better record  Blazers have missed their 2nd/3rd best players in CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic for the majority of the season- have a better record  Even the top contenders like Lakers and Nets have a lot of accumulating missed games from their stars, and they've all hold better records.    I'm not going to complain too much about them being put above the Spurs, Hornets, Knicks, Hawks, and Grizzlies.  Still, that's FIVE more teams with better current records."
"Spurs won 5 rings without being a ""super team"". Obviously they were a good team...they won a ring, but they were not ""super"" by any means.   '99 Duncan and DRob were pretty good and had a good cast. 2003 was a carry job by Duncan. 2005/07 were good teams, but Tony/Manu were fringe all stars. The same as CJ McCollum or Kris Middleton. 2014 was just a complete team effort.   Super teams I consider teams with like 3 of the best 15/20 players. Like Miami with LBJ, Wade, Bosh or Celtics with KG/PP/RA or GSW with Curry/KD/Klay or Nets with Harden/Kyrie/KD"
"Raw bigs with top 5 picks have a *really* dubious track record. Olowakandi, Thabeet, Kwame Brown, etc etc. That doesn't even get into guys like Bargnani and Darko.  Lots of guys in the top 10 were at least ""silver"" quality, for part of their career. Oladipo, Porter, Noel, McLemore, KCP, CJ McCollum.. I though Oladipo should have gone #1 at the time and still do, given the consensus and outlook for these guys at the time."
"They made a mistake, it's actually CJ McCollum."
"Nah he should get some flak for giving out some of the worst contracts I’ve seen.   He matched Allen Crabbe on a huge deal then traded him to the team who made the offer.  He gave CJ McCollum a huge extension before it was necessary locking up big money for basically no reason on a player that will never be a second option on a championship team (as long as Dame is first option anyway).  Dame supermax, yeah “he had to” especially with all the stuff Lillard says about loyalty. Maybe Dame can live up to this contract though so it’s not as bad as the others. This is the first year of the deal, he turns 31 iirc and will have four more years with rising salary. I know Portland fans would prob shiv me for suggesting this but IMO this should’ve been the time the sold the farm and either went all in on Dame or rebuilt. The supermax will imo cripple this team for the next 5-8 years.  Meyers Leonard at 10m/yr when he barely looked like a rotation player in Portland.  Evan Turner, 4/70, enough said.  Just terrible contracts, then iirc they had to basically swap GTJr with another guy cause he’s gonna get paid and they can’t afford it with all their bad deals. How the guy both still has a job and isn’t considered in that Billy King tier of GMs is absolutely beyond me. Late draft hits don’t make up for constantly tying up your largest resource in bad players."
“Give me my props for being loyal and convincing everyone each season I can put up huge numbers and will win a championship with CJ McCollum and Terry Stotts. LOOK AT ME NBA FANS!”
"Wow, this made me realize CJ McCollum has never been an All-Star. What a joke."
"If Dame is known as the best clutch performer in the league, CJ McCollum might be number 2. He did it last night. It's always nice to have a back-up superhero."
"I think you’re being a little disingenuous here, honestly.   I don’t think too many coaches actively want players to be taking early shot clock, contested 3s. Now they may not want players taking deep 2s either, but the good news is you have 24 seconds to move the ball around and find a good shot.   Look at someone like CJ McCollum, a guy who has always been a skilled scorer in the midrange. This season, for the 1st time in his career, he’s taking more 3s per game than 2s. His 3pt% has gone up, his 2pt% has gone down, and he’s still averaging a career high PPG, eFG%, and OBPM. He’s taken a definitive jump.   Compare him to DeRozan, who has made virtually no attempt to shoot more, or really any 3s and is still shooting over 90% from his shots from 2pt range. DeRozan is a very good midrange shooter, but he’s still behind McCollum in eFG%, BPM, PER, and just good ol’ PPG."
"The Blazers are doing it now with Lillard, CJ McCollum, and Powell as starters."
"They should have given it to Oladipo considering that MCW was putting up empty stats. So empty that his own team immediately disposed of him after winning the award. Funny that the 2013 batch also had CJ McCollum, Steven Adams, Gobert, Schroeder, and Giannis but they weren’t very good right away. Of course Giannis was a project for several years."

"I don't think I really agree. While it's certainly possible have both, the vast majority of dudes at the top do so with athletic prowess. Not to say it means dudes are dumb, but I think the vast majority of the top players in the league are of average mental capacity at best. In my experience, the greatest sports minds are often role players. Some notable exceptions off the top of my head are CJ McCollum, Kobe, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love, Mike Conley, and I'm sure there's more but again, I'd argue they're the exception, not the rule."
everyone acting like ben simmons is better than CJ McCollum lol
Cj McCollum
CJ McCollum is not better than Draymond and Klay by himself
"Not like Dame doesn't have good teammates either, unless CJ McCollum doesn't exist anymore"
Happy CJ McCollum Day.
"&gt;Dray isn't a net positive on offense  That's not even close to accurate. Dude isn't averaging 9apg by being bad at offense, he's doing it by blowing up 4 on 3s whenever Curry draws doubles, as he has for years. That's why Kerr is so diligent about keeping them on the floor together (even moreso then his defense). GSW as a whole and Curry's own splits with/without Draymond back this up, going back several years.  &gt;oubre and wiggins do get staggered.  Oubre plays more than 80% of his minutes with Curry. Contrast with players like Kyle Lowry and Donovan Mitchell, or to a lesser extent Anthony Davis and CJ McCollum, who all played somewhere from 55% to 68% of their minutes with their team's top player this year or last year -- that's what staggering looks like. No wonder Curry's on/offs look better than LeBron's or Dame's when their 2nd best player is on the court most of the time they're off of it, while Curry plays with his best teammates 96% and 81% of the time."
"How much did that guy from Dallas end up getting from Memphis? I remember cj McCollum roasted him on Twitter for it. As a blazers fan I was happy we didn’t sign him, same with hedo turkalu. Big money zero production."
I think I’m with you on that. Like would Sabonis for CJ McCollum work?
"&gt;So you’re saying they elevate their team by creating scoring opportunities for teammates? Which is directly the result of Steph playing off ball? Just a different play style?  Dame and Harden on ball creates more and better looks than Steph off ball.  &gt;Nobody who watches Steph Curry play basketball thinks this doesn’t occur pretty much every time he crosses half court. He is doubled constantly at the same distance and the rest of the team does to 5 v 4.  But he plays more off-ball....so it happens much less frequently.   &gt;You said above average. Those are the words you said lmao.  14 &gt;15. It's technically true, but you're also arguing semantics my man. Look at the roster Dame carried to the #2 offense last season.  &gt;That’s genuinely a much better offensive supporting cast than what Steph is working with now. Steph would murder somebody to play with CJ McCollum.  Is it the difference between 22nd and 2nd on offense? Think we both know that's a no  Dame would also murder someone to play with a guy like Draymond that can carry the defense and facilitate...cause Dame has literally no one on the entire roster than can pass.  Robert Covington at 1.8 APG is literally second on the team lol"
"&gt;Dame and Harden dominate the ball the entire game. They spam ISOs and PnR over and over and over.  So you’re saying they elevate their team by creating scoring opportunities for teammates? Which is directly the result of Steph playing off ball? Just a different play style?   &gt;By being on ball more, they also draw more doubles (many of which are 30 feet out), which lets guys go 5v4 the entire game.  Nobody who watches Steph Curry play basketball thinks this doesn’t occur pretty much every time he crosses half court. He is doubled constantly at the same distance and the rest of the team does to 5 v 4.   &gt;GSW is 22nd right now. 14th is the worst result of Dame's career lol. Think that supports my case.  You said above average. Those are the words you said lmao.  &gt;Dame also took a leap last season to be a true top 10 guy. Like Dame/CJ/Bazemore/Melo/Hassan had no damn right to be the 2nd best offense in the NBA  That’s genuinely a much better offensive supporting cast than what Steph is working with now. Steph would murder somebody to play with CJ McCollum."
Dame  Kyrie(when he isn't playing us)  And I'm not sure why but I've always liked CJ McCollum
"Klay, Cj McCollum, Oubre."
13 year old CJ McCollum. /s
"Maybe a little like a longer CJ McCollum? At least as far as change in pace/direction, but SGA has a little more...slither to his game? Idk what a good word to use there is"
"I wonder what that means for Dame, who with CJ McCollum next to him got swept by that very same GSW team the next round."
Cj McCollum. I didn’t think there was any way in hell we draft small school guards back to back and they’d both work out.
"Harrison Barnes, Kevin Love, De’Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, Buddy Hield, DJ Augustin, Trevor Ariza, Julius Randle"
"&gt;The fact that Zion can get to the rim from anywhere on the court makes him a better perimeter shot creator.  No it doesn't. Because he's limited to 1 spot.   &gt;Obviously CJ McCollum is a better perimeter scorer than LeBron James  If this were some alternate universe where LeBron never developed the ability to score outside the paint, this would have been a decent analogy"
&gt; Nobody said it did. But the fact that Tatum can create his shot from anywhere on the court makes his offensive skill set more valuable than a player than can only score at the rim.  The fact that Zion can get to the rim from anywhere on the court makes him a better perimeter shot creator.  Obviously CJ McCollum is a better perimeter scorer than LeBron James.
"I appreciated Lowes description:  &gt;“Dame, Terry Stotts, it’s just like duct tape over there. Duct tape over the crack in the wall, duct tape over the cupboards falling off, the hinges, duct tape, duct tape, duct tape, we snuck out another win.”  &gt;“One every three games Melo gives you 20 off the bench. And Kanter gives you 14 and 15, they just find ways. People want to shit on the Blazers because “oh they are another mid-rung playoff run … two small guards.”  &gt;“The Blazers just endure, and they are currently enduring and if you count them out of the playoffs when CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic got hurt, I got news for you, they’re not out of the playoffs right now. They just endure and Dame, he’s so good that it’s just, it’s crazy how good he is, he’s just so so good, he’s a show every single night. He singlehandedly gives them a chance to win every game.”   Yet half our fanbase is upset at Stotts because the Blazers aren't *better* than 20-14 with all the injuries. Craziness. He's closer to a COTY candidate than someone getting fired."
CJ McCollum
"You're definitely right, but I wish players like him would get more attention. It's easier to get a big jump in your numbers when your role completely changes. But when you're on the same team and have the same role then suddenly you ratchet it up to the next level? That often takes a similar level of improvement, even if the raw numbers aren't as dramatic.  Rosier probably hasn't done quite enough, but in a perfect world I think he should at least be up there. Another example is CJ McCollum, at least if he hadn't been injured this year. He was already a borderline all-star level player for years, but he took a leap from 23 points to 27 points along with some large efficiency gains.   Yet more often than not those guys are ignored and the award goes to a 3rd or 4th year player who just got more playing time and more touches. Funny enough, that's exactly how CJ got his MIP award. lol"
"Well, there is two of him. Before his injury, CJ McCollum was having a career year, often leading the Blazers in scoring. He's not quite at Lillard's level, but he's very close and does many of the same things for the team that Lillard does."
100%.  Would love to see Draymond and CJ McCollum on that.
Powell can put up CJ Mccollum numbers if he had the same amount of touches
"Here are a few short sections for those who don't have The Athletic (it's a much longer article)  &gt;His emotions had been worn thin because, in the past 18 months, it seemed like he had lived a lifetime. In 2020, he was the first to discover the dead body of his cousin and personal chef. An aunt died from cancer. A family friend died of COVID-19. And in the early months of 2021, a cousin was killed in West Oakland.  &gt;And then last Thursday, the day before the Lakers game, Lillard learned of the shooting deaths of two people in his inner circle. One was a cousin close enough to Lillard to be at his family’s Thanksgiving dinner in Portland in November. The other was like family — the best friend of perhaps his closest cousin, who was among the first family members to move to Portland when Lillard was drafted by the Trail Blazers in 2012.  ----------  &gt;In May of 2020, he checked in on the Portland-area home of his cousin and personal chef, Brandon Johnson, and found him dead on the kitchen floor. Brandon, or Chef B as he was called, was 35.  &gt;“I stood over his body, man. Like, he was dead. Minutes. I’m standing over his body,” Lillard said. “People don’t know what type of trauma that is, and what that is to have somebody that close to you laid out and you stand over him. Like, I still struggle with that. You know what I mean? Like, I still struggle with that. That’s a battle for me.”  &gt;That morning, Lillard called teammate CJ McCollum, who was also close to Johnson, and when McCollum arrived, the two cried together in the kitchen.  &gt;“I was hurt by that,” Lillard said. “I cried a lot. Just hurt … I was with B every day, and in the summers when I would travel to train, he would come and make sure I was eating right. I was with him every day. Talked with him every day. Sat there with him every day. So that one just had me hurt. To this day.”  ---------------  &gt;“I told Nate it’s been weird, my son (Damian Jr.) has been like ‘Dad … Dad … Dad … every 30 seconds,”’ Lillard said. “Dad, let’s go downstairs. Dad, let’s watch TV. Dad, play dinosaur. Over and over. And I told Nate that it just brought me happiness, that he was calling me ‘Dad’ over and over. He doesn’t know what doing on with me, but he knows I’m his dad.”  &gt;If Lillard leaves the room, Junior stops what he is doing and follows.  &gt;“And when I’m holding the twins and feeding them, just knowing they belong to me, and that one day they are going to feel as strongly about me as Junior?” Lillard said. “It helps things a lot when you come home to that.”"
The Nuggets are the 7th seed in the West. They're behind the Spurs and Portland with no CJ McCollum. That's bad either way you slice it.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"&gt;	Steph was getting called for a foul every time he looked at a Cavs player.  You literally said this in your original comment, yet you are saying I’m the one that doesn’t have an actual argument?  &gt;	you're just repeating a meme that you've read a million times on this sub that you've never seen any proof for  this is hilarious. Was CJ McCollum just [repeating](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/blazers-mccollum-warriors-set-lot-illegal-screens) a meme when he said the same thing?   Even he says,   &gt;	They are **moving and stuff**. That’s the respect you get when you are champions  So you’re gonna say that CJ doesn’t know what an illegal screen is either?"
"Using that logic, you'd think Kawhi would've gone to the Lakers.  The fact that other current players, like CJ McCollum, have clowned KD for the move speaks a lot on how that move is viewed, regardless of how fans try to rationalize it."
Cj mccollum has a journalism degree and wants to
Poor man's CJ Mccollum maybe.
This dude thinks cj McCollum is better than booker. I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about.
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"Sorry, but if you want Lavine you’re gonna have to do a lot better than CJ McCollum"
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
"LeBron James, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, CJ McCollum, Ricky Rubio, Jusuf Nurkic, Jared Dudley, DeMarre Carroll, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller and other NBA/former NBA players disagree with you"
"to add to your list, CJ McCollum  obviously couldn't be the replacement, but he would've had a spot if not for the injury"
CJ McCollum
It’s a shame CJ McCollum got hurt. Dude was balling the fuck out. Was heading for his first all star appearance for sure
Should I trade for CJ McCollum And give up RJ Barrett miles bridges on Charlotte. Worried about CJ injury and coming back and my playoffs being 3 4 weeks away
"Holy shit those have to be the worst stats I've ever seen in my life lmfao.  The first one has Lamelo Ball above Kawhi leonard and Kyle Kuzma above Ben Simmons.  The other one has CJ Mccollum at 11, which is laughably stupid, and Devonte Graham at 9."
Cj McCollum be like damn if Booker hasn't made it again. How am I ever going to make it.
"TS% is what matters most when it supports your argument, sure. lol  A 25 ppg scorer on the 4th best team in the NBA makes the all-star 99.9% of the time. That's not really a debatable statement.   If the Blazers had a .667% win percentage OR CJ McCollum averaged as many points as Booker than you might have a point, but neither of those things are true.  Yes, Dame has been snubbed, never when the Blazers were this high in the standings."
Techs/flagrants for foul baiting. CJ McCollum got called for one last year.
"I was part of the first ones invited to the platform. So I bought 2 of the first packs, thought to myself, ""This is kinda dumb, who is going to care about this"" and then never logged in again until I saw the thread about the LBJ one selling for $100k.  Logged in and the first moments I pulled were worth about $500.  So I sold that initial batch of moments and have used the funds to continue buying packs. I think I've gotten 3 or 4 more at $9 a pack and I'm at $775, so it's generated about another $250 is profit.  Have only gotten base packs since I started paying attention again. I did get the ""Gift"" pack and sold I think a CJ McCollum for about $60."
CJ MCCOLLUM And it’s not even close.  The man can dance.
"Probably could add CJ Mccollum, Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker. Julius Randle is having a hell of a year."
CJ McCollum being able to make tough shots and iso while not being the fastest/strongest.
"When CJ McCollum is on there is no one I enjoy watching more, great handles and ridiculous shot making"
"CJ McCollum is fun to watch.. he’s one of the few players I rewind frequently just to see how he makes certain moves. He’s not as technical as say, Kyrie, it looks more organic. I dig it."
* Luka will be a borderline all-star but nothing more  * Gary Harris &gt; CJ McCollum  * Mario Hezonja is a better Lance Stephenson
"It's easy, wait for a Kawhi-level wing to be available and flip CJ for a rental and hope for a Raptors-level miracle.  Even if someone like Khris Middleton is available I doubt that a McCollum/Middleton swap would actually bring them over the top."
&gt; CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons  This isn’t 2K
wat happend to CJ McCollum he aint playing
Did some guy really make a fake trade about Ben Simmons and CJ McCollum...
Exactly literally every team wants and needs one they are the rarest player in the nba and when one becomes available usually there will be a lot of better offers than Cj McCollum
"Rodney Hood for PJ Tucker CJ McCollum for Blake Griffin Sign likely soon to be released Demarcus Cousins And if so, cut Zach Collins Throw around picks here and there."
I mean a lot of times the magical move to become on that short list of title contending teams is just not there. I thought Covington/Derrick Jones were the correct moves to try to give them a punchers chance.  Not gonna lie CJ Mccollum having a career year had me a little intrigued when I was thinking about their playoff chances
"All three are players who aren't as consistent as the top tier players.  Oubre and Draymond are definitely rhythm players who thrive on constant chaos on the basketball court, Draymond doing it with his intelligence and making excellent decisions in real time, and Oubre making plays with his elite athleticism.  Both Draymond and Oubre while trying to make great plays end up making very poor ones, and if this is happening in the same quarter, the Warriors can implode.  Still, their energy gets a bunch of very nice runs and comebacks going(also a reason I like Juan Toscano-Anderson as a player, energy).  Out of all your descriptions, I think Wiggins is probably the farthest off.  He's benefited greatly from not being a primary option on both ends because although he is good, he isn't necessarily great at anything yet.  His offensive statistics are ok, his defense is good, but does have issues, but truly he hasn't really improved much from his stats his entire career.  There are minuscule differences in his stats from previous years, and I think he's probably a bit more patient, but he still takes some horrible shots, particularly in the 4th quarter, especially turnaround, fadaway ISOs that don't have a great chance of going in.  Rather see ball movement as it's the primary way the Warriors conduct offense.      Wiggins shoot at the league average now which is nice, but I imagine the splits between when Curry is on/off could be helping that a bit.  He's almost the same player as he was when he was as a rookie, except he's now at a career low amount of shots within 0-3 feet(21.3% of his shots at the basket, career average is 27.4%).      Do I think Wiggins is a decent player? Yes.  I don't think he's done much different since he entered the league except slightly increase his efficiency each year until it's reached average.  There is more data on him since he entered the league than almost every player than Lebron at his age.  He's 74th on the active list in minutes played.  He's played more  regular season minutes than Kawhi, Draymond, the Morris brothers, KCP, and CJ McCollum.  The book might not be completely written on Wiggins yet, but if anyone doesn't know who Wiggins is by now, they probably don't watch basketball.  Draymond and Oubre can elevate the team, and also crash it down, Wiggins is a shorter Marvin Williams who shoots more."
"My first thought after seeing it was “I knew CJ McCollum was small, I didn’t realize he was Carlton Banks small.”"
"This is not necessarily true. Jokic leads in BPM and WS/48 (Embiid is #2 in both), and consequently VORP (which is volume conversion of BPM) and WS. He also leads in RAPTOR WAR by quite a large margin (again Embiid is #2).  Embiid leads the league in Total RAPTOR by a fairly large margin (Jokic #2) and for what it's worth; he also leads the league in PER - which would be the highest of all time over Giannis last season (Jokic is #2 for the season)  Other relevant stats:  * ESPN's RPM: Disqualifying CJ McCollum for GP - Embiid is 4th and Jokic is 8th (LeBron is #1).  * Raw Net Rating (again, for what it's worth): Embiid is 13th, Jokic is 31st using &gt;20 mpg and &gt;20 GP qualifiers.  * PIE: Jokic leads the league by a slim margin over Embiid.  Does Jokic have the best overall advanced stats? I'd say so by a solid step. But he's certainly not blowing Embiid away, that is a gross exaggeration."
1. *Stephen Curry (Golden State) 2. *Luka Dončić (Dallas) 3. Damian Lillard (Portland) 4. Donovan Mitchell (Utah) 5. Devin Booker (Phoenix) 6. Ja Morant (Memphis) 7. Chris Paul (Phoenix) 8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City) 9. CJ McCollum (Portland) 10. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio) Sorry for format it was copypasted
"&gt; CJ  I agree with your point, but McCollum isn’t gonna be an All Star.  Breakout year but he’s played less than half the season"
"Agreed. CJs quick af. Isn't that a form of explosiveness? He doesn't jump out the gym like guys like Zion, Ja, or a young Blake Griffin, but that doesn't mean he's not athletic.   When I think of unathletic I think of guys like Zach Randolph, not CJ McCollum."
"They typically pickup random players. Biggest being Klay. Others in history like Hayward, Rondo, Evan Turner, and I think CJ McCollum."
CJ McCollum
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
"You mean CJ ""I don't defend the corner three"" McCollum?"
I remember watching this dude at Duke getting beat by CJ McCollum at LeHigh in the 2nd round of the NCAA tournament. Thinking he was gonna be a as good as Steph because they were brothers lol. I’m so glad this man is doing his thing now
He's almost 30 and the second best player on the team is CJ Mccollum who can't play defense or create for his teammates.   Do you people even watch basketball or just come on this app to troll?? Look at their cap situation and Dame's age. Time will tell what? How much longer before he demands a trade?
CJ McCollum gonna be the Michael Redd of this era
Cj McCollum vs Khris Middleton
"Listen I know Blazer games are on late, so maybe you don’t watch them but, and I say this with the deepest affection, Damian Lillard is in a different class than CJ McCollum. Give him a big who screens and finishes well and a few shooters, you’ll have a top 5-8 offense. He’s that good. When he’s on the floor, I know the offense is going to run, even if it’s not running through him. Have you ever looked at Lillard’ on/off splits? They get out scored by like a million in the 12 minutes he doesn’t play. CJ McCollum is a fucking nuclear bomb. He can go for 50 in three quarters. What he did was extend his range out a few feet, so instead of taking tough isolation twos and hitting them at an astounding rate, he now takes tough isolation threes and hits them at astounding rates. Plus he’s a better passer this season. But you don’t get the amount of single coverage he gets without a guy that can casually step into 35 footers or drive to the basket in a blink. Not to take anything at all away from CJ, but he definitely benefits from playing alongside Dame, in the same way Klay benefits from playing alongside Steph, even when Steph has an off game or two."
It was infuriating as a Rockets fan who has seen what he’s done in Houston to see people act like Harden is like... CJ McCollum or something
"If we’re only considering the stretch of games while CJ and Nurk have been then Gary Trent Jr has been better than Wiggins. Wiggins has regressed on offense and floats in-and-out a lot. Also, people love to crap on Enes Kanter but he has played really well with Nurk injured. Anfernee Simmons has been shooting 48% since 48% on 3s since 1/24 per CJ McCollum Twitter. A lot of guys have stepped up for the Blazers."
CJ McCollum would be fantastic
i would say everybody but dbook &amp; zach lavine and maybe cj mccollum. i wouldn’t trade him if i was jazz though cuz i feel like he’s a perfect fit for this team because they built around him for him.
"CJ McCollum for sure, unless he picked up a certification at some point"
"Here’s one I’m surprised I haven’t seen and I will admit to.  CJ McCollum.  I had seen him play in the Patriot League. There was no question he was the best or second best player in that league. But let’s be honest it’s the Patriot League and he was a high usage guy. Not extraordinarily athletic, not the highest IQ guy, super cocky too, and not the most efficient shooter. He was also coming off a, at the time, serious injury that could have hampered his athleticism even more.  I thought he was going to be an inefficient shooter who turned the ball over, and ultimately wasn’t going to cut it physically or just be too much in his own head. Glad to see I was wrong though. I really like the stuff he has written and that team can be very fun to watch."
"Another case of a shooting guard stuck in a point guards body.  The Bulls have lacked a playmaker at the 1 since.... what, Derrick Rose? Kirk Hinrich? Rajon Rondo?  However, guys like Lou Will, CJ McCollum, etc have carved out some big roles on solid teams.  I think Coby will have a role anywhere in the league as an instant offense type of player, but man him at the 1 is rough."
CJ Mccollum is shooting a higher percentage from 3 than Russ is from 2
CJ Mccollum contract is so huge but he &amp; Lillard are playing d same position.
CJ McCollum of the East
"CJ Mccollum, Conley, De'Aaron Fox, Jamal Murray, Brogdan, Tobias Harris, DeRozan, Ja Morant, Zion, KP, etc. Guys like that, even if some of these guys will prob make a team this year"
CJ McCollum is at 11 3PA and 44%
"Partly that CJ McCollum was the Blazers best player for a lot of the season. Which even if you don't agree with that, he was at worst 1B to Dame."
"Dude is better than McCollum. Blazers should trade CJ, while his value is so high, and just start Trent. CJ hasn't been able to get it done and is singlehandedly wasting Lillards prime."
"While that is true, in no word does CJ McCollum by himself command a star, a young piece, and multiple first round picks. That’s just absurd"
"Honestly, I like CJ McCollum and want to keep him here. There's no guarantee that we'll be able to keep Gary Trent Jr. in the offseason, he'll be getting a great contract."
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
downvoting a dope dunk because your favorite player got dunked on is ridiculous lol  I saw Dirk get put in a spin cycle by CJ McCollum or LeBron dunk on Dirk in the all star game and upvoted both. Good basketball should transcend personal fandom.
CJ McCollum barely shoots FTs and I can't remember him ever flopping (I watch every game and have his entire career).
**PG:** Mike Conley   **SG:** CJ McCollum   **SF:** Richard Jefferson   **PF:** Lamar Odom   **C:** Marcus Camby
Kyle Korver and CJ McCollum
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
He gets to the rim but for his career he’s only 55% finishing at the rim it’s probably the biggest reason why even in Charlotte he was closer to league average efficiency as a creator than elite. A little like CJ McCollum in that regard
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"Jaylen Brown &amp; Devin Booker are ahead of  several of the guys on your list so let's include them.  I'd also say SGA, CJ McCollum, Siakam, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Ingram and Middleton are all better.  Julius Randle &amp; Ben Simmons are probably where the line is, so that's another 8-11 guys at least (I am probably forgetting some).  It's interesting to name the guys, something we almost never do, as a result there are 12 top 5 players in the league at any given time.  EDIT: I forgot De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant and Zach Lavine, would take them over Murray comfortably."
"I'd like him to get it.  I'd prefer if CJ McCollum could have- he deserved it this year before his ankle got stepped on.  But I understand he didn't play enough games.  And Fox is a very fun player to watch, and he's stepped up a lot.  I wouldn't be mad at Mitchell either"
"CJ McCollum will get into the basketball media as well and be awesome. Then again, ESPN will probably pass them both up and hire Dwight Howard or some shit."
"Lillard, Steph, Mitchell, Luka, Shai, Paul, CJ Mccollum"
"He reminds me of an early CJ McCollum-type, but the Spurs don't have a Damian Lillard, who I think was huge for his development"

CJ McCollum is burning the Suns
Is Jaylen Brown better than CJ McCollum?
Cp3   Klay thompson ( if healthy if not give me CJ McCollum)  Brandon Ingram   KD   AD
"I disagree. Positionally scarcity on a team can make a player more impactful without being better. CJ McCollum is better than Nurkic, but with Dame and Norm on the team the Blazers can replace CJ's impact much easier than Nurkic. I'm sure you could find examples where that's true of the top 2 players as well."

"CJ ""Christian Laettner"" McCollum"
"Jusuf Nurkic and CJ McCollum have missed the exact same amount of games as AD and Lebron, and while Dame only missed 6 games, he was playing while busted up and only playing to keep us afloat. During that time he played 11 games and was averaging 21 points at low efficiency. Zach Collins one of Blazer's best defensive players has been injured for the last two seasons. Please don't complain to a Blazers fan about injuries"
"This. What version of CJ McCollum/Nurkic or Porziņģis/THJ show up? Does Terry Stotts shit the bed? Does Rick Carlisle refuse to change his rotations? Does a heliocentric offense completely centered around Luka bite us in the ass? Does Dame get hunted on defense? These teams are way too inconsistent to make serious runs, unless all the cards fall perfectly."
lol this is good  Kanter  McCollum  Simons (CJ and him are interchangeable imo)  Norm  Melo (these two also interchangeable)  Worst to best btw  Also don’t be one of those clowns. Terry Stotts needs to be fired.

Underrated picks:  CJ McCollum Paul George Jayson Tatum
I can see him be thst Cj McCollum type of player(maybe even way better). His game is just so crafty amd smooth to watch.
"He was the first option, you don’t think his efficiency would go up if he was playing next to LeBron instead of CJ McCollum?"
"Why are you including Jokic, Lebron, AD, PG and Kawhi? None of those players are recent additions. If that's the case, then let's just consider Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum as improvements for the Blazers too.  The point of this is that Dame and CJ made the WCF without Nurk/RoCo/Norman. Unless you somehow think Nurk/RoCo/Norman are worse players than Kanter/Aminu/Harkless, they've improved upon a WCF team."
CJ McCollum on the team and it’s lights out.
So...like CJ McCollum then? Lol
&gt; We already see dame can shoot the lights out and he has not benefit from the floor spacing / team strength Steph has.  Didn't the memo get sent out that you aren't allowed to do this anymore? Or not yet?  Curry has some of the worst non-Pelican spacing in the league this year and yet he's easily shooting a higher three point percentage than Lillard ever did in his career (as if playing next to CJ McCollum is bad spacing).
Cj McCollum
Who Eric Gordon or pj tucker lol or Cj McCollum
Player A is def a better offensive player. Cj McCollum vs Andrew Wiggins
Player A is CJ McCollum last year  Player B is Andrew Wiggins this year
Player A is CJ McCollum and Player B is Wiggins.
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  Who do these people expect to start at the 4?  Mike Scott?  35 year old Anthony Tolliver?  PF is literally our thinnest position and these guys are like yeah trade him for a guy who will replace Seth Curry in the starting lineup.  A Seth Curry by the way who's basically done everything asked of him.  Seth Curry + Tobias Harris &gt; Mike Scott + CJ McCollum
"&gt; It's ESPN. Thats a very credible source when it comes to something like this.   Yeah, same “credible” source that once had CJ McCollum ranked 13th best player in the nba, Demar 20 spots behind Davis Bertans and 6 spots behind KCP coming into this year, Bam over Embiid and Lamelo over Tatum lmao"
"You just can't jump him in with people LeBron, Luka, and Giannis, as he is tier or more lower in his overall scoring package.  Yes you can build a team around him.  I could also build one around like Siakam or CJ McCollum with the right role players.  The Knicks are having a damn good season with Julius Randle as their best player who is probably outside the top 25 himself.  Roster optimization can do a lot.  The question is why would you want to do that and how many other players would you rather have without knowing any of the rest of your roster.   Like I said, I think that number is around 40.  I also think you're handwaving three importance of shooting because it's convenient.  First, there is a major difference between decent but unremarkable shooters like Shake and high-gravity shooters like Seth.  If there weren't then it would be so expensive to get extremely one dimensional players like Bertans.  It's never going to be a reasonable thing to say ""eh you can always get shooting"".  You can always get replacement level shooters like Garrett Temple but that's not really enough especially when you have a centerpiece like Simmons.  Which is why the 76ers arguably downgraded in overall talent to upgrade their shooters.  They want to need to cover his weaknesses in order to make him somewhat close in performance to what they've invested in him."
I say run with it. You guys look great with that mid size combo guard archetype with Seth. And I think CJ is probably a better defender than Seth anyways. As long as you have Ben and Joel you’ll have a monstrous defense so get a guy that just gets buckets  Turning Seth/other assets into CJ McCollum (who can play make sometimes) is the perfect guy next to Ben and Embiid.
"Crazy fun fact: Steph Curry came 4th in Most Improved Player voting the year **after** winning MVP (and won MVP again that season). He even tied for the second most 1st place votes, not sure if that matters because it was a HUGE amount behind CJ McCollum but still.  When you look at the stats you can see it was absolutely justified, too."
Pointguards of that size allow teams to fully utilize players like CJ McCollum without taking a defensive hit.  Allows a ton of variability on lineups.
No I would put him #2 behind CJ McCollum
It's not the craziest assertion. March heroics can color the draft some. If Lehigh didn't beat Duke I don't think CJ McCollum would've been drafted as high....maybe if he had a similar monster performance but even then if Lehigh lost that would've cost him some positions I think. Transfer over to Hayward it's not insane to think that'd boost him some spots that draft.
"When Dame and CJ were Tatum's age, they were rookies. McCollum averaged 5.3 ppg.  &gt;The depth is non-existent.  No, it's young. Depth is overrated in the playoffs anyways. The Celtics 8 man rotation is pretty solid."
"Not really at all actually lol you bringing up shaq is stupid as fuck because of how different the game is..shooting and  spacing wasn’t nearly as important back then … and these comparisons are so bad dude lmao jerry stackhouse averaged over 23points like 1 time not even getting into the difference of eras  lol  cj McCollum averages like 25% -33% less points than Giannis. I honestly am not sure if you could have come up with worse examples. People said Giannis was unstoppable too going to the rim too until they saw him in the playoffs lol Its gonna be worse for Zion because the spread on his shot chart is WAYYYY smaller than Giannis or Butler. It is even a bit smaller than ben Simmons. To put it in perspective 963 of Zions 1037 shots this season have been with in 8ish feet that is a whopping 93%. Ben Simmons is at 85% Giannis is at 60% and butler is at 57%. Being able to be serviceable outside the paint is MASSIVE in todays game, and Zion just simply isn’t. Therefore Zion may be  a more efficient scorer, but overall scoring Tatum is definitely has the edge. If it was like 2001 or something I would agree with you, but its 2021."
"What a strawman argument.   I said it doesn’t matter when you are as proficient as a scorer as Zion.   Shaq was a dominant scorer who could only score at the rim. Routinely was among the leaders in PPG and scoring efficiency. He didn’t have as well rounded as a scoring arsenal as a guy like Jerry Stackhouse but he was a way better scorer than him because even though he was a one trick pony, no one could stop that 1 trick.    Giannis is a better scorer than CJ McCollum if you want a modern day example.   Jimmy Butler can’t shoot 3’s or midrange very well and he just lead a team the finals.   He is 100% a better scorer than Tatum. He averages 8% better scoring efficiency while scoring more points. Imagine trying to say a guy with a 49% TS that averaged less points than Tatum was a better scorer, purely based on shot profile. Because that’s exactly what your doing currently...   The fact is Zion is unstoppable at getting to the rim."
"Yeah questions like this are pretty loaded.   The league is more skilled now than ever. That’s why if you are to compare how skilled players are we should compare them to their era.   A guy like CJ McCollum in a direct comparison is more skilled than Jerry West. However Jerry West was one of the most skilled players of all time when he retired, when CJ isn’t even the most skilled guy on his team. That’s why when questions like this pop up we really need to compare the player to the era they were in, as opposed to a direct head-to-head comparison."
"I would take Russ over Kyrie and Cousy, for me Lillard is better and has been for several years.  Dame has consistently done more with less than Russ has (CJ McCollum is a nice player but he's a tier below Harden, KD, PG-13 and Beal) and their careers aren't over, it's easier to see Dame's game aging better than Westbrook's so it's hard to say at this point.  As for Gary Payton, I grew up watching 90s basketball and GP was unreal in that era and was one of the best players of that decade, he's probably the best defensive PG we've seen and would've thrived in a spread system.  Perhaps Russ is better but even so there's still plenty of guys ahead if him in the all time PG discussion (Magic, Zeke, Oscar, Stockton, Nash, Kidd, Curry, CP3) so Russ is a lot closer to 10 than he is to 5.  Again, I am not saying it's definitive that he isn't, I am saying you could defensibly argue that he's outside the top 10."
I have no clue I just remember CJ McCollum saying that. He might have been bullshitting or completely misinformed but I was assuming he'd know better than I do.   https://twitter.com/RealJayWilliams/status/1247252182245748737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1247252182245748737%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-24109528661933823638.ampproject.net%2F2104170104001%2Fframe.html
I don't have a strong opinion on this but it would suck for the guys on short term or low paying contracts. Ever since CJ McCollum came out and said a third of players live paycheck to paycheck I'm less in favour of fines.
I'm still pissed Portland didn't offer CJ McCollum for Harden. Houston made an offer but Portland refused it. Imagine Damian Lillard and James Harden on the Blazers.
CJ McCollum? Maybe a Sign and Trade for Derozan?
"While I feel bad for the Raptors a lot of teams have had struggles to deal with. Nuggets lost Murray, Nets had KD and Harden sitting out significant amounts of time, Lakers had AD and Lebron out, Blazers Jusuf Nurkic missed 35 games and CJ McCollum missed 25, and Zach Collins has been on the bench wearing pajamas for years. Oh yeah Golden State Warriors of course.. Etc, Etc.  It's almost a rare thing to see teams at FULL strength. Trying to keep players healthy is a lot of work and luck, and is part of the game"

"&gt;honestly who thinks about the Jazz enough to not like them?  SHAQ hahahaha  (edit: also Ben simmons lol. Weirdly picks fights with jazz players all the time for various reasons)    And I was sitting here knowing the point you were gonna make about golden state, but that's the thing there as well, no one believed in the warriors until they became THE warriors. Ppl shat on them and doubted them too before they became a dynasty, but the talent was already there.  ""Warriors always have sucked""  ""Steph curry is too small""  ""Their 3 pt shooting isn't sustainable cuz ______""  Ppl are just slow to give credit where its due.   And the rockets were 3 chuckers. The jazz are not. They're efficient as hell.  The warriors are not the exception. They were the start of the trend (because honestly, the nets are winning it this year and they're just gonna shoot all day long)   I'm not downplaying cp3 injuries. He's literally only been injured in the playoffs 3 times   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-playoffs-2018-for-chris-paul-hamstring-injury-is-just-the-latest-bout-of-bad-postseason-luck/  (I didn't mean to say leg though. I meant hand. That was MB)  But hey, he is indeed old, if you just eliminate them cuz you think he gets hurt, fine.  But your whole argument against them banks on that.   Cuz the nuggets have a really really good roster. And your point was they don't have a number one scorer without murray, and they do. It's MPJ. They can, and are, overcoming murray's injury...so...that's why I think that they can overcome it, cuz it's what's already happening.   Because lebron did NOT carry the team 8 months ago. He had AD shouldering the load, which there is absolutely 0 indication AD will (or even could, since ppl want to blame the injuries to AD, if he's really hurt, he can't carry, and the points the same, whether he's just lazy now or actually hurt)  Lebron absolutely cannot just ""will"" the team to a championship if AD is this version of AD and you know that.   So unless you have a point on why AD is just gonna start lighting it the fuck up, that's the end of that lol.   &gt;no one on any team you mentioned has gone further in the playoffs did Portland did a year ago.   The nuggets were in the conference finals lol. The blazers lost round 1.  And even if you meant 2 years ago...the nuggets made it just as far lol.   Dame and CJ are TERRIBLE defenders. I'm gonna call you out for being lazy again cuz Mitchell has identical (actually slightly better) shooting efficiency than Dame does (Dame slightly better from 3 but they're, again, nearly identical)   Dame just has more volume.   Conley is a way more complete player than cj mccollum (does that really need to be elaborated on)   I'm not calling any of the 3, phx, utah, or portland's back courts as *the* best.   On any given night, any of the 3 teams might have the best back court, the gap is basically non existent."
"You guys need to get your story straight about Randle. Either he was ready before and the Knicks made him the player he is, or he was always this amazing player.  Fun fact - it was the former.  Jrue Holiday was decent but certainly not as good as CJ McCollum"
"His draft comparisons were CJ McCollum and Kevin Martin. He was a high risk, high reward guy, but it didn’t pan out."
CJ McCollum=stephen urckle. But more like Stephon remember that?
CJ McCollum + ?? for Kevin Love trade inbound this off-season
CJ McCollum and Steve Urkel
"**If Damian Lillard dribble it up, you guard him. I don't care if that's CJ McCollum, I don't care if that's Michael Jordan, you pick him up. That's the ball right there and Dame got it. He gon shoot it from the NBA.**"
"It's more than that though. He had an underwhelming year at Duke (was the year they lost go CJ McCollum and Lehigh I think in the first round), then still get's drafted 10th overall because of his potential. Looks like a total bust for the first 3-4 years of his career, then gets traded to the Clippers and turns into a decent role player. Shuffles around to a couple teams and keeps it up, then ends up on the Knicks this year where he gets dropped from the rotation for... Elfrid Payton???  And now he's back to being decent for the Nuggets I guess?"
Already tied CJ McCollum lol

"What’s your definition of a role player? If it’s just a non-All Star without high usage (so not like a CJ McCollum), players like Mikal Bridges as you mentioned, and others like Joe Ingles, Serge Ibaka, Joe Harris, and Brook Lopez (who’s just a role player now) are all solid. Basically these guys would help any team but don’t require super high usage."

CJ McCollum vs TJ McConnell
"i get what you’re saying and it’s completely valid. but it doesn’t apply to every scenario. would you rather have joe harris (~15 ppg on great efficiency) or CJ mccollum (~22 ppg on good efficiency)? if you want to bring up defense, the same question could be asked with lu dort vs MPJ, for example.  there is no clear definitive answer. it depends on the team. however, harden’s team needed him much more than giannis’. if MVP always went to the most valuable player, it should’ve been harden. i know it typically goes to the best player on the best team, which was giannis, so i didn’t think the 2019 “snub” was as bad as 2017 for example. I’m more mad that harden couldn’t hit the game winner in the final game of the season against okc (he had an open look). that would’ve made them top 2 seed and if harden didn’t get it after that i would’ve been raging."
Dort  Dort  Dort  Dort  CJ McCollum
Bradley Beal is option 1 on the wizards and the focus of the other teams defense. CJ McCollum isn't.   Scott Brooks also doesn't know how to design an offense.
CJ McCollum has elite footwork. He doesn’t waste a step.

"In the bubble Zion Williamson approached CJ McCollum and pulled him aside - “Hey, that gumbo (CJ's Fatgainer 9000) you gave me was good,” McCollum recalls Williamson telling him. “A lot of people don’t know I like food, and I don’t know a lot about it, but I know that shit was good.”"

"Hard to compared a 2nd fiddle with a go-to-guy. Kyrie played few seasons with Lillard responsabilities and wasn't that great. He brutally failed in 2019 playoffs.  Kyrie has been great with Lebron and now KD or Harden on his side. Not exactly the same as having CJ McCollum or Aldridge.  Lillard is playing go-to-guy, so taking every shit when his team fails, all the responsabilities are on him.  Kyrie is playing CJ McCollumo role with the Nets, having KD and Harden as the best players."
"In the bubble Kelvin Benjamin approached CJ McCollum and pulled him aside - “Hey, that stack of pizzas (CJ's Pepblasters 9000) you gave me was good,” McCollum recalls Benjamin telling him. “A lot of people don’t know I like food, and I don’t know a lot about it, but I know that shit was good.”"
Who can CJ McCollum even be realistically traded for that makes the Blazers better and is mutually beneficial to the team trading for him? Having a tough time seeing good trade partners for CJ.
"Okay unfortunately CJ is pretty selfish. He can surprise with hustle plays on defense or important offensive rebounds, but tonight is a perfect reason why he kinda needs to go. He had great stats, was a net positive by box score, and kept us somewhat in striking distance. But there was a moment when we pulled to within 4 with momentum on our side, and for some reason CJ decided that was the time to wind 20 seconds off the clock and jack up contested jumpers on several possessions, which led to run outs by the Grizzlies. He does that kinda shit all the time! Like, I know you are confident, but for gods sake you are literally doing what the defense wants, and you don’t even get a clean look. It drives me nuts. It looks good when it goes, but you are honestly telling me that is the best shit you can get? Lillard takes his share of dumb shots, everyone does, but he is always looking to exploit the defense, never settles unless he has to, and forces the defense to deal with him. I get that now isn’t the time to make that argument, with Lillard struggling with his injuries. But when they are at their respective full strengths, Lillard is in a different stratosphere. I hate to say it, but McCollum really is redundant at this point. The problem is their is no way we are going to get a player of his caliber at a forward spot, with the defensive flexibility we need.   Anyway, Lillard could lead any decently assembled team with a good coach to a top 5-7 offensive ranking by himself when healthy. We have seen across a sample size of at least a half season. I’ve watched him play his whole career, he is that gifted offensively. The trick is surrounding him with enough shooting, defense, and secondary playmaking to actually win games comfortably, so when they DOUBLE TEAM A GUY AT HALF COURT EVERY SINGLE POSSESSION you can take advantage of that. McCollum is not that level of player, so they should honestly try to shop him to come up with someone who fits the roster better.  Edit: offensive ranking"
"Gary Trent Junior and CJ McCollum exist  Anyone that only shoots jumpers and doesn't get to the line/rim is going to be inconsistent. Ball being a decent defender and good passer makes him always have some value though , even when he's off."
The Sixers wouldn't want picks cause theyre trying to contend. They'd never trade Simmons for Mccollum cause CJ is nowhere near ben as a player and he has a garbage contract.
Philly has no leverage at that point. They have to trade Simmons for somebody because they cannot waste Embiid's few remaining years before he breaks down completely.          CJ McCollum might be the best available player that fits Philly unless Beal wants out
That's why I bring Dame up. I feel like Stotts and CJ McCollum are around to please Dame cause I can't think of another reason why they're around.
"no ""mediocre"" player is doing [this](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/01/19/cj-mccollum-trail-blazers-career-year-injury)  not saying 55% from 3 is sustainable, but he's clearly a special player  the way he started off the season he was absolutely worth his deal, the injury just took him off his rhythm"
"&gt; Royce is a borderline all NBA defender he will do fine against LeBron. Obviously LeBron will get his because he is LeBron, but Royce is a very solid option.  He’ll probably average 35/10/10 if that’s the case.    &gt;AD will face Gobert when he comes anywhere near the paint.  Have you ever watched them play?  &gt;Whos guarding all of Utah's 40+% three point shooters?  The same players who guarded Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, CJ McCollum, and Jamal Murray last playoffs. Oh and the law of averages.  Did I mention they’re the #1 defense this season with LeBron and AD missing 40+ games combined?"

"You're kind of just proving my point more. Butler plays 59 games, they make the playoffs. Butler plays 10 games, they don't make the playoffs...  They had Gibson, Wiggins, Covington, Rose, Teague, and Saric that year, and KAT played 77 games. They ended 36-46 as opposed to 47-35 when Butler was there...   The Blazers are 14-11 without CJ this season, not great but not bad and possibly still in the top 8.  They'd be a higher seed with McCollum, but they might still be a playoff team without him.

"He was exhausted. Even CJ McCollum, who is in about the best shape in the NBA, was exhausted. A relatively well rested Rodney Hood won us that game."
"I dont know about that.  I think Daryl wants to capitalize on MVP Joel, and CJ McCollum has to be near the top of the list of potential targets if they trade Ben. The playoffs this year will be telling.   Who else would be available besides maybe Beal?"
"Simmons is a better player than McCollum on a better contract, and younger  not that Simmons couldn’t be traded, but if he is, it’s in a package for a higher level star than CJ"

CJ McCollum
Depending on if u think CJ McCollum is a star
People said they should trade him for CJ McCollum
"He can come to Portland, we have one CJ McCollum ready to plug 'n' play."
76ers need CJ Mccollum
Agreed  Only option is getting CJ McCollum
We’ll take him for one lightly used CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum would absolutely eviscerate this Hawks team imo.
"Coach Bud.  Just kidding, yeah Simmons, probably. He's got potential to be a solid starter but maybe being a star is too much.  Edit: Actually I change my answer to CJ McCollum."
You forgot backup SG CJ McCollum
We have one CJ McCollum that could be available...
We'll offer you one slightly used CJ McCollum for your Simmons guy who can't shoot free throws. Should be a fair trade. ;)
Ben for CJ McCollum?
"Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum, who says no (I know its the 76ers)"
Toss in CJ McCollum
You'll get CJ Mccollum and say thank you.
CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons is happening
"Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum is happening this off-season, just y’all watch."
I think sixers should consider trading Simmons for CJ McCollum. He's probably the best player you can get for him at this point.
"I love Seth and he's very useful, but in no universe will he ever be better than CJ McCollum--they were even on the same team for a while, and it wasn't even remotely close."
Sometimes me too tbh. Dame deserves to have a better running mate than CJ McCollum.
"now would you be cool if you quit on your team all of next year, ignored Ty Lue/PG flying cross country to see him and then him requesting a trade and you getting CJ mccollum back for him?"
&gt;He reminds me of like a Tim Hardaway just a 3rd guy on a team.  People seriously forget how good CJ McCollum is. Tim Hardaway? Really?   He's a Khris Middleton/Kevin Love type player. Would be the 3rd best player on a championship team.

Is CJ McCollum a better defender than Jaylen Brown then? I’ll have some of what he’s smoking
&gt; Ben Simmons gets traded for CJ McCollum   Yeah it’s time to leave r/nba until Game 5 because what is this take bro
I guarantee that Ben Simmons gets traded for CJ McCollum in the offseason and everyone bashes PHI for selling low but it works out.   Salaries line up and the fit is so much better for Philly it’s crazy. I think it would be a win/win/win/win  Win for all teams and players
A lightly used CJ McCollum
Cj mccollum and one first rounder
"He gained muscle on the Warriors- not a lot but noticeable. I wonder if the extra weight contributed to his injury and he focused on slimming down recently.  I would put CJ McCollum in this category too. Gained weight, had injuries."
Hmm no excuses. Seems like sixers should trade him for a guard who can create their own shot and open up the floor for embiid. I would say CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons
"McCollum?  CJ McCollum?  Dame I get calling out (Though he at least tends to lean in/back or pulls up when he feels contact on his back, not hunting side to side), but CJ just takes contested jumpers, and typically doesn't get a whistle."
DeMar DeRozan is a better basketball player than CJ McCollum.
Those Rockets teams were pretty flawed though. Dude had Robert Covington playing center and no actual bigs. And no mid range. That takes CJ McCollum out.
You want us to give up a 24 year old allstar avg 25/6/3 for CJ McCollum?
Imagine trying to compare the all-NBA Warriors crew to a team that had CJ McCollum as its second best player.
"Among the top 10ish players major injuries are way up. If you compare 2020 star injuries vs 2021 for example, in 2020 we had Kd, Klay, Steph, Embid, and Simmons as the main guys with injuries. In 2021 we had Kd, Klay, Harden, Lebron, Embid, Davis, Murray, and Butler injuries. Perhaps Kyrie now too.  Way more top level players missing a lot of games this year than usual. Then if you go down a level you have guys like Jaylen Brown, CJ McCollum, and Jaren Jackson Jr. missing a ton of games too which really hurt their respective teams."
Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum seem like the same player to me
"[Wojnarowski] Portland has agreed to trade star guard Damian Lillard to the Trailblazers for CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Jusuf Nurkic, and 3 first round picks."
U mean the same team that made the ECF without him the year before? Kyrie has never been on a bad team in the playoffs while Lillard has been on multiple. Kyrie had had Lebron and KD compared to... Cj McCollum???
"I don’t think McCollum is your problem. I think the fact that your team tried building a winning team with him as the second best player is the real problem.  CJ should be a third option on a championship level team, not the second. The man shoots 40% from three for his career... don’t blame him, blame the organization for not adding better player to fit between Dame and CJ.   Like I said, you’ll need to trade CJ to grab any superstar. And at that point you’re going to miss CJ’s offense. You’ll still be missing a big piece no matter what.  I’m pretty sure that if you take all emotions out of it, you’d see that it’s much smarter to blow the team up."
CJ McCollum is the most overrated player in the NBA
CJ McCollum is great. Very insightful and actually gives thoughtful answers. He’s been especially great on a few long form pods.
CJ McCollum happened
"Does this bring his trade value down to say, one CJ McCollum? Asking for a friend"
He landed Indiana Oladipo and Sabonis. He landed OKC Shai and picks.   This time around? Maybe DeMar Derozan sign and trade? CJ McCollum? Middleton?
"&gt;I'm not sure why you think cj is more likely to get up a good shot late in the clock.   &gt;If you want to say cj is a little bit more dynamic and quick to break a defense down that's one thing   You just said it for me. We're talking about the same thing here.  I'm not claiming CJ is a more efficient scorer, I'm saying he's more likely to create decent looks out of nothing (i.e. when the offense gets bogged down) than Middleton is. For a more extreme example Joe Harris is a vastly more efficient scorer than McCollum, that doesn't mean I'll claim ""Joe Harris is more likely to find a good shot when the offense bogs down.""   By the way you might want to check the difference in these two players' efficiencies especially this past season, it's nowhere near the difference you think it is. Literally just 1%, and McCollum has never gotten the boost of playing alongside regular season Giannis."
"CJ McCollum is trash, no one wants him"
CJ McCollum is a glorified 6th man.
"Thanks Magic. We have two CJs to get the job done. As if CJ McCollum isn't enough, I'm willing to throw in the GOAT, CJ Elleby."
Hey Clippers people I will take Paul George off your hands if you are not happy with him for one (1) CJ McCollum
"Everybody wants to win a chip. Why should players be beholden to stay with a team that continually fails in the playoffs just because they were drafted there? If I was an NBA star and I spent 6-8 years with the same organization only for them to continually make poor decisions in the front office, why should I be expected to stay? If you want to keep superstar talent, keep them happy. Winning makes players happy. Dame is the best player the Blazers have ever had and the best they can do to compliment him is CJ McCollum. At a certain point enough is enough."
Giannis doing his best CJ McCollum impression
Oooh that is an interesting pairing. Probably works tbh but those non-Dame minutes that CJ McCollum would’ve gotten would be rough
"Grant is the type player Portland needs to have success in the playoffs. He’s good enough to be a #2 on a contender in the right system, though obviously a #3 is even better. I think the 2-5 construct in this trade allows for the team to be better.   McCollums skill set is redundant next to Dame at the cost of being a turnstile tag team on the perimeter defensively, and then needing elite defense elsewhere. By swapping Grant for McCollum, you take a step back in offense, but a giant leap forward in defense. Even with Dame, a line up of Grant, RoCo, Powell and Nurk would result in a top 10 defensive lineup, with a very good offense. When it comes to winning in the playoffs, you make that swap.  The depth, especially at guard is certainly a concern. Fortunately, regular season minutes at G can be had for the MLE, taxpayer MLE and even the vet minimum with an attractive enough roster for guys that want to win.   Portland’s biggest roster issue centers around it being damn near impossible to build around a Dame/CJ backcourt. The holes it creates defensively essentially need to be filled by defensive specialists, which then defeats the purposes of the elite offense. Good 2 way players are rare and thus expensive, hence why POR is limited to 1 way guys like Melo, Kanter or DJJ."
"Detroit literally got him from Denver for cash considerations a year ago. Chucking up a bunch of shots on an awful team hasn't changed his value that much in a year, especially since in Portland he'd be playing a role closer to what he was in Denver/OKC -- a solid but unexceptional two-way starter. That isn't worth a better player in CJ McCollum straight up (Grant + Plumlee might be, arguably), even if he's a better fit, let alone CJ, two promising young players, and a pick, which not only hurts our depth but torpedoes our chances of making any other moves since it takes up all our trade assets.   That's the level of package that gets moved for disgruntled all-stars that can elevate a team to the next level. Grant isn't bad but he's definitely not on that level."
"Does a POR trade of CJ, Simons and Little + at least 1 first to DET for Grant, Plumlee and Okafor (to make dollars work) make sense for POR? Would have a closing 5 of Dame, Powell, Grant, RoCo and Nurk. Detroit gets a good player in McCollum who they could later potentially trade + draft assets in their rebuild.   I feel Grant fits what Portland needs a whole lotta more than CJ."
Are you fucking dumb? Dame is a top 5 player don't even try to say its that man's fault. If CJ McCollum is your costar then you're a first round exit but u clown for real talking down on Dame
Lol that lone yr when cj McCollum who every blazers fans wants gone puts the team on his back in game 7  against the nuggets when Lillard shit the bed? They win 100-96 with cj shooting 17/ 29 shooting scoring 37 points meanwhile dame 3/17 scoring 13 points. Cj save that dude's ass and bring him to wcf PARTICIPATION lol cause they got swept by gsw without kevin fucking durant.  Edit: and guess what? We dont here a thing about him cause dudes loyal lol dude is a 1st round fodder
CJ McCollum
"I love Seth, but please don't ever try to insinuate again that he is anywhere near as good as CJ McCollum."
well he should get used to not getting left open by Cj McCollum every possession
"Past 3 seasons comparing Portland’s offensive ratings with both Dame and CJ on floor, just CJ, or just Dame.   20-21: both on-121, just McCollum-112, just Dame - 116, league average-112  19-20: both on-116, just McCollum- 107, just Dame-110, league average-110  18-19: both on-116, just McCollum- 105, just Dame-112, league average-110  Sources:  https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=203081&amp;VsPlayerID=203468&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_poss.html"
CJ 'Stefon' McCollum has a way with words and the ladies
That's true.  I doubt Kawhi cares that he doesn't have any MVPs lol.    Giannis has 2 and is playing like CJ McCollum in the playoffs and is getting BLASTED by everyone. (Idk a good comparison for Giannis cuz he's a freak)
Can I interest you in a slightly used CJ McCollum?
"This looks like a good place to repeat my somewhat-popular trade idea  Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 2 Blazers 1sts  * 2 Heat 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline. BI is the greatest asset in the trade so the Heat pay the most. They can build around a BI/Bam duo for the next decade.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as four first round picks to help with their rebuild. That leaves them with 8 picks they can trade if needed! Can upgrade PG and/or SF  -- maybe they package picks with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams. Or maybe offer the Cavs Bledsoe and 4 1sts for Colin Sexton. Etc."
I always laugh whenever someone posts a trade involving CJ McCollum because he once went off on Bill Simmons on Twitter (I think) for discussing a fantasy trade where he'd leave the Blazers.
"If they didn't trade Simmons for Harden, they are most definitely not trading him for CJ McCollum."
Hey my dudes if you guys don’t like Simmons I will take him off your hands for one (1) CJ McCollum
"Sixers could really use CJ McCollum rn, am I right /u/dmorey?"
First mistake is that I don't watch every team.  I guarantee I watch more of the league than you do.  A great defensive big isn't gonna get you a superstar especially when you have to attach a negative value contract in Kemba Walker to make the money match.  That's like me saying CJ McCollum can get you Kevin Durant if I attach Nurkic and a bunch of first round picks.
"How about a starting 5 of Curry, Lillard, Beal, CJ McCollum, and Boban?"
I’d just draft Giannis over CJ McCollum.
KD needs to win a ring on a team that wouldn’t still win if he was replaced by CJ McCollum before we start talking like that
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * OG Anunoby  Raptors get:   * Eric Bledsoe  * Anfernee Simons  * 3 Pelicans 1sts  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  Blazers flip CJ, for a SF, a desperate need -- and OG is a top 3 perimeter defender in the league. They contend with Dame/Norm/OG/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans pay up to flip Bledsoe's useless contract for a great shooterwho helps space the floor for Zion.  Raptors pick up assets and a young player to further help them retool"
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.

Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams"
CJ McCollum
"You have CJ McCollum playing alongside Melo and Kanter. Yes, the coach is the main issue."
"Right but Khris isn't an MVP or a MVP+DPOY. He'll get like, CJ Mccollum level of shit but that's never gonna be the prevailing sentiment."
"Damn I thought they were cool?? I try to defend KD a lot but he always seems to get into it with people, even those he’s supposed to be boys with. Big Perk, JWill, cj McCollum, Westbrook, Mike rappaport, Stephen A, etc. He seems to be the common denominator."
What can the FO do? What are CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic getting on the trade market that makes the Blazers any better? They just got beat by an unhealthy Denver squad in 6 games. Their run is coming to an end.
CJ McCollum is to guards what Rudy Gay was to forwards 10 years ago. Respected player...but no superstar wanted him to be his max player runningmate
If CJ McCollum is your primary ball handler your ceiling is 13th seed
I'm pretty sure you misread his comment. He is saying that POR should trade CJ to another team for a couple of 1sts then trade those 1st to DET for Jerami Grant. Problem with that is *nobody* is trading any 1st round picks for CJ McCollum lol
Tobias Harris for CJ McCollum seems like the best trade for both teams.  Agree or Disagree?
Every CJ McCollum fake trade involves Portland trading him for a player who's better than him and younger than him it's kind of hilarious
"I HATE this narrative that Booker is just kind of along for the CP3 ride. He's finally getting a bit of shine after playing on terrible teams for his entire career, and now he's just the CJ McCollum of this team.  Shows how powerful narratives are I guess."
they're better off with TJ McConnell than they are with CJ McCollum
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.

Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams"
"Yeah I guess you have a point actually. 55/40/90 is a lot more exclusive than I would have thought. Literally the only members of that club is Kyrie Irving x1 and Stephen Curry x3.  On the flip side, setting it to just 50/40/90, but instead using 2P%, gives us the following:  Larry Bird x2  Mark Price x2  Reggie Miller x1  Chris Mullin x1  Peja Stojakovic x1  Steve Nash x4  Jose Calderon x1  Ray Allen x1 (I forgot to check minimums before saying he'd get like 4, my bad)  Kevin Durant x1  J.J. Redick x1  Stephen Curry x4  CJ McCollum x1  Kyrie Irving x2  Malcolm Brogdon x1  Khris Middleton x1  In retrospect and after remembering what the minimum makes are, I actually agree with you. I think this list covers it pretty well, with it being largely the same except for a couple newcomers, as well as Steph, Price, and Kyrie getting more of these seasons."
so ur telling me 21 points on 48 41 87 splits on top of pretty elite perimeter defense and good playmaking isn't worth a max contract when CJ McCollum and Porzingis could get max contracts?
He's an undersized 2 guard but he has to play point guard because of his defense.  Offensively he's very talented but he isn't a great passer.  He has a lot of CJ McCollum in him but we've seen how far that gets you.
"Not too late for them to get in on Dame either. And in both the Harden or Dame sweepstakes I wouldve/am still willing to offer Ingram.   There was just a level of [delusion back then](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/12/17/22178792/james-harden-trades-proposals-76ers-celtics-raptors-blazers-heat) with these Harden trade ideas that even for homer fans standards was absurd.   &gt;Framework of the deal: Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker + 3-4 first round picks to Houston for Harden.  And the Pelicans writer said no in response to this offer!   Heres another one   &gt;Framework of the deal: C.J. McCollum and Zach Collins + a couple first round picks to Houston for Harden.  &gt;""Giving up CJ McCollum, Zach Collins, and picks is a big ask from Portland’s perspective. As things stand, I wouldn’t give up a single player from the roster in exchange for Harden, let alone two key players and two first round picks""  Do people even hear themselves when they talk, this was an actual sentence someone said like 6 months ago."
"You are clueless if you think CJ Mccollum is only a ""slightly worse version of Beal"""
"Better Defender is the only thing that tracks there. Their career averages for 3pt% are nearly identical (CJ with a .398, Middleton .396), but CJ has higher volume (1 more attempt per game). McCollum also averages more assists on fewer turnovers. Middleton is better purely because he's a better defender. I mean, also because CJ's small, but I think those tie together."
"Don’t get your information from panel shows like Undisputed for First Take. I really enjoy Zach Lowe’s podcast “The Lowe Post”. Some active players have podcasts too like CJ McCollum and JJ Redick.   If you find a team you like, zero in and learn about the players. There’s a myriad of interesting guys in the league. It’s a fascinating time in the NBA. Might be some bad teams but I don’t think anyone is flat out boring.   NBA Twitter is also very entertaining. Follow Rob Perez if you don’t already (@WorldWideWob) and you’ll find a rabbit hole from there.   Besides that, enjoy Game 6 tomorrow and keep watching! Welcome to the community."
"Offense:   Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Carmelo Anthony, Jusuf Nurkic  Defense:   Norman Powell, Derrick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Jusuf Nurkic."
"Also the Kings drafting Bismack(traded for Jimmer) over Kemba and Klay, Thomas Robinson over Dame, Ben McLemore over CJ McCollum, Stauskas over LaVine, WCS over Turner and Booker and Chriss over Sabonis all in 6 years."
"If we're trying to win one game with the peak versions of the player during their tenure with the team (as opposed to ranking their whole careers), Portland is really sneaky good with a bunch of players whose careers were injury plagued.  Dame, Clyde Drexler, Brandon Roy, Lamarcus Aldridge, Bill Walton.  Bench: Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, Zach Randolph, Terry Porter, CJ McCollum, Cliff Robinson."
CJ? As in McCollum? He doesn't like Giannis?
Im suprised when i see players like CJ mccollum and dinwiddie who havent won anything hate on giannis.. like bruh you wasted dame's 55pt game and u are here hating on giannis..
Lot of players who live tweet games don't post about anything Giannis does and give a lot of credit to Middleton. Spenny and CJ McCollum gave him FMVP love last night.
"I don't think all this talk about non American is the reason. I think it's bc his game isn't skill based. Like if CJ McCollum had Giannis' body he'd average 60. If I had to rate Giannis' actual bball skills on a 1-10 rating: shooting 5, dribbling 5, footwork 7. I think players admire actual skill from other players."
CJ McCollum went after Giannis for his defense during the Nets series which is just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Clearly you have never watched CJ McCollum
NBA 2k22 gonna have to update his overall to actually be reflective of his ability. No more being worse than CJ McCollum.
"CJ McCollum size it please, I'm trying to watch my weight"
You want to Porzinghis size that or CJ McCollum size that?
"Trade CJ for TJ Warren and Myles Turner, idk how realistic that is, you might have to throw in some picks but TJ is expiring and Indy is always looking to lock up guys like McCollum on long term deals since no free agents ever go to the Pacers."
"I disagree with a few things: first, the Sixers should not want Lowry and McCollum for Dame. Secondly the Sixers should be and are under no pressure to trade Ben. They don't have to. Ben has not requested it, Embiid has not requested it. So the reason for trading Ben would be to make the Sixers better, not to get Ben off the team at all costs. Morey does not need to be concern with what a vocal minority of the fanbase wants, especially if they want Lowry and McCollum to try and win a title with. That team has maybe one year of relevance, and that's if Lowry hadn't already fallen off by the time the season starts. The Sixers don't have to trade Ben.   That's the situation the Blazers would be in if Dame requested a trade. They would be the ones that had to get younger players and picks and give up the better player (Dame) in the deal. That's the only way they entertain this imo, and with good reason.   I also don't think Morey has to play nice with the Blazers as it relates to the Blazers trying to upgrade from McCollum. If he wants Dame, then it makes much more sense to let them know that under no circumstances is he trading Ben for McCollum. If CJ plus stuff is worth Ben then how in the everloving hell is Ben plus stuff worth Dame? Makes no sense. Set the value for Ben as soon as they ask about him."
Beal doesn't make them a title contender but he's a significant upgrade over CJ McCollum.
"Beal would be simply a better version of CJ with some of the same issues- a Dame/Beal backcourt would struggle with defense.  We could make that trade work with picks probably, but I'm not sure it improves us THAT much.    Butler is an interesting option because he can play the 2 or the 3 and would drastically change our defense.  I'm not sure Miami would want to part with him depending on how they see their current prospects.  Might be hard for them to break through the BRK/MIL/PHI wall in the east and a bunch of Portland picks might be worth it to them.  This is totally dependent on whether MIA thinks they have a shot right now though.  They aren't moving Butler if they do.  PG is similar to Butler.  LAC isn't going to downgrade from PG to McCollum even with picks if they think they can win now.    Butler is probably the most likely of those 3."
"For a rebuilding team absolutely.  Now if they ship McCollum off, they can probably get more value then if they shipped off Wiseman, but a rebuilding team is not going to be interested in a package headlined by guys leaving their prime (CJ and Covington will both be 30 by October), which is all Portland can offer.  There are probably 5-6 teams that would destroy any offer Portland makes, which is why they won't be able to get an actual star.  They will have to overpay for a second rate player or trade Dame.  Or get a second rate player and then trade Dame when he realizes they still aren't contending."
"Lol that’s a terrible example, Gordon and McCollum are way different in terms of impact. You get that basketball is not just about money right? Like it’s a big factor in trades but if a team has cap room, a guy like CJ is an amazing player to be selling at a big discount. He isn’t even close to being on that list of big negative assets, I’d say he is neutral or positive still, the only reason not overwhelmingly positive of an asset because he is paid a lot. It is a hot take, sorry."
"And it was crazy because we really didn't have any other options.   Isaiah was the only player on our roster who could dribble **and** shoot at a decent level. Everyone else on the roster could only do one or the other.   Marcus could handle the ball but was having a historically bad shooting season, Avery could shoot but he's a 6'2 SG because he has zero handles, etc etc.  We had decent players, but there was no Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum or even a Lou Williams that Isaiah could share those late-game responsibilities with.  Plus he had a huge target on his back because of the KOT4 stuff.  So when the game slowed down in the clutch entire defenses would just zero in on Isaiah. Teams knew they only had to slow this one guy down for a short specific stretch.  He obliterated them game after game.   It was absurd how consistently he did it too, it was like clockwork. He would sub in with 8 minutes left and 12-15 points on the board, he'd finish the game with 30."
Who is a better deal? Not Dennis. Not CJ Mccollum. Not John Collins.  Who you want to sign?
"I wasn't high on either guy at the time (still am not)  &gt; DeRozan was straight off his second straight All NBA campaign playing Kawhi's exact position  He was also just coming off of being swept in the 2nd round to LeBron, getting benched in the 4th quarter of game 3, and then getting ejected in game 4. On top of that, this just perpetuated the narrative of him being a Playoff choker. He was better than McCollum, but his value had taken a dip  CJ was also younger by a couple years and was slightly below DeRozan's level as a scorer and as a playmaker with both being terrible on defense.   In the context of the package the Spurs received, I don't think it's inconceivable that the Blazers could've acquired Leonard with something like McCollum + Collins + 2 FRPS + a swap as an upside move that can also be a Playoff team potentially, or McCollum + Nurkic + 1 FRP + 1 swap for a full Playoff push. The problem has always been Olshey's propensity to be conservative"
"  Is it not better to get the surefire all star in Ben Simmons rather than hoping to get a decent prospect in the draft? The Blazers already have CJ McCollum, so I doubt they're gonna be in anything besides mediocrity unless they trade him too"
That is simultaneously a severe overvaluation of McCollum and a severe undervaluation of DeRozan. DeRozan was straight off his second straight All NBA campaign playing Kawhi's exact position. The trade was made as an attempt to continue to compete you cant plug and play CJ with the Spurs roster at that time like you could DeRozan.
"Eric Bledsoe, CJ McCollum, Aaron Gordon, Marvin Bagley, Andre Drummond"
Dame isn’t moving to Philadelphia for Ben Fucking Simmons. Just like Joel Embiid isn’t going to Portland for CJ Fucking McCollum.
"You have Norman Powell and CJ McCollum in case you are well defended, speaking of defense you have Zach Collins Robert Covington AND Derrick Jones Jr defending. And a great Center in Nurkic and an excellent rebounder in Enes the Big Penis Kanter."
S - CJ  A -   M - Mccollum  E-
"Sexton   CJ McCollum  MPJ  Porzingis  Whiteside  ""I'm just trying to get my 2k rating up."" -Hassan Whiteside"
"Good lord you are painful to read. You completely ignore valid arguments and just respond with cherry picked stats. Dude is about to try and get a max when he's another CJ McCollum. He's a terrible piece for any backcourt trying to contend. He's a 2 guard in a small ass point guard's body. Dude will be a solid offensive player on middle seeded teams for his career. Unless he lucks into a situation that can hide all his flaws with a point guard that can defend twos, but also take the ones if they don’t suck, can pass because Garland can't, but can also play off ball because Garland can't. Pretty much you need a Curry but with Klay's defense. Seems reasonable."
"where does Dennis Schroeder end up? (also, do the Blazers hold on to CJ McCollum or trade him &amp; his max away as well?)"
"I love seeing how bad the thinking skills are on this sub.  If the picks mean nothing to the Blazers, why is any team going to give up a great player for them and CJ McCollum lmao"
"It's absolutely fair. There's literally nothing more you could ask of a second option. There's guys being underpaid to be better but Khris has 100% earned his salary.   He's making around what Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Tobias Harris, and CJ McCollum are making, I'd put him at the same level as all of them."
"I wouldn't say that, if anything Portland is a bit notorious for not making moves.   They have most of their first round picks in coming years, CJ McCollum, and potentially a lot of cap starting in the 2022 season, especially if they trade CJ.  The Blazer's strategy reminds me too much of the early KD/Westbrook years in OKC where it was obvious that the team had talent, but Presti (probably due to ownership) wasn't willing to make big moves to push them to championship level."
"Correct me if I'm wrong here...  Dame implies that he is loyal to the Blazers but if they dont make any big moves to change the roster into a championsip level team - he is going to leave  And Blazers fans are happy?  Happy about what?  Olshey had 9 years to construct a team for him and now you expect him to do it in one summer?  And even if he wants to make big changes, what can he do? No assets, no cap and their 2nd best player is CJ Mccollum.  I'm confused"
"Which is completely fair, if true. Giving the Portland FO one last chance to surround him with someone other than CJ McCollum before packing his bags"
He’s also pretty quick to call people out on Twitter too…..  First team All Twitter CJ McCollum hasn’t said a world either lmao
Nevertheless that package was still superior to what the Blazers could offer. Teams aren’t lining up for an undersized and overpaid CJ McCollum.  That’s the part you’re not understanding.
"With all due respect to the Blazers, their backcourt was never capable of handling other back courts in the conference.      Steph / Klay   Paul / Booker   Parker / Ginobli   P George / K Leonard / P Bev   Conley / Mitchell       McCollum does not have the size and defensive capability required to handle most on this list, which really washes out his scoring abilities (as good as they are).       If I had to nail it down though, it really came down to Steph and Klay over all those years with Livingston off the bench that really prevented Portland from doing anything great in the playoffs for the time Dame and CJ have been together."
Best I can do is a CJ McCollum.
"Magic giving up 2 lottery picks for a late first, CJ McCollum and a man named Shake..."
"I feel like Khris is a 1.5 - He's definitely not in that KD/Kawhi realm where you can count on him playing well every single game, but I feel like he's a level above the traditional #2 like Tobias Harris or CJ McCollum. Guys like Jamal Murray, Booker, Westbrook, and *maybe* PG (who may be a legit #1 after this post-season) fall into  this category. I don't think any of these guys could be the #1 option on a championship team, but they're more valuable than a lot of the guys most often thought of as #2s"
"Never really looked into both their games that deep. Both great shot creating scorers, CJ has the upper hand in finishing for sure I would think. I assumed Khris wouldn’t have the best defense since the lack of athleticism out there on the wing, but know nothing about McCollum on D. How much better is Khris considered to be then him?"
"Both TJ Warren and Myles Turner are worth more than McCollum on their own, why in god's name would the Pacers overpay for CJ?"
"I did a write-up a while back about the opportunity of exploring a CJ trade because I do think that's a plausible idea for Indiana. This trade though is giving up way too much for CJ though.  Here is what I had:  Indiana gets: CJ McCollum, PJ Washington  Portland gets: Jerami Grant, Jeremy Lamb  Charlotte gets: Domantas Sabonis  Detroit gets: Zac Collins, 2021 and 2023 first round picks from Charlotte  https:/np.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/nxwkr5/oc_a_fourteam_trade_between_indiana_portland/"
"I don’t see him worth more than a first and maybe a B- / C+ young prospect. I’m bigger on Vucevic than McCollum and he got 2 unprotected firsts and Wendell Carter Jr. CJ is only a year younger and Vucevic is on a much better contract , both in length, annual cash amount and in the fact that it’s on a decreasing pay scale."
But CJ McCollum.
CJ McCollum mocked his defense tho
We probably can get equal actual value. The issue is people overrate Simmons' value. He is not more valuable than CJ McCollum for example especially in the playoffs.
Khris slander is no longer allowed.  CJ McCollum comparisons are no longer allowed.  Khris are ugly jokes still allowed.
CJ MCCOLLUM HAD THE AUDACITY TO TALK SHIT ABOUT THIS MAN'S DEFENSE
CJ MCCOLLUM HAD THE AUDACITY TO TALK SHIT ABOUT THIS MAN'S DEFENSE
 Devin Booker is a phenomenal player but his offensive game needs work. He is not yet a three level scorer. His ability to make a mid range jumper from anywhere definitely sets him apart but his lackluster finishing ability is a bit frustrating to witness. He tends to struggle finishing off straight line drives and even in moments where he is forced to adjust his body. He doesn’t have that silky smooth touch just yet like a CJ McCollum or even Paul George. That layup Booker missed at the rim in the final minute of the game is a great example of this. Once he advances his finishing ability he’s going to be unstoppable. I got suns in six still.
"Sixers fans: Ben Simmons is a negative on the court, he sucks and can’t shoot and is a pussy and he’s awful.  Someone else: ok how about CJ McCollum for him?  Sixers fans: Eh his defense isn’t the best…"
"*Agree*. If you're Portland in this scenario, you run a lineup of Maxey/McCollum/Covington/Simmons/Nurk, and that probably gets you the 7/8 seed. Your hope is that Maxey takes a big step forward and gets molded into that traditional PG blend with a 15/7 average as a starter and grows from there (which, tbh, isn't exactly the type of player I see him as -- I think he fits the ""hopes to be Beal"" mold the most). Aside from CJ, that's a strong defensive team that gives you a few pieces to deal with in the future (not just the players but the unprotected picks).   If you're Philly, thats what you want to do -- bank on the moment and not worry about the future. Lillard/Curry/Whoever/Harris/Embiid is a strong play. Philly still keeps 1 of the 3 players that has flashed potential with Paul Reed."
"it is looking more and more like the best player they can get for ben is CJ McCollum (although there has been no confirmation that portland is willing to trade him, but they should 100%)"
"*Kyrie Irving will win MVP*  Not really seeing it but because the MVP can be a popularity contest, who knows - maybe Kyrie hires a great promotional firm and can keep fooling people into thinking he's on the same level as Harden and KD.      *CJ McCollum will be an MVP candidate if he gets moved*  Has there ever been a player that's never made an all-star team and gets mentioned as an MVP candidate?      *Russ or Beal will not be wearing a Wizards uniform by the trade deadline*  I could see it      *Kyle Kuzma becomes a legit 3rd option in another team*  Is it a good team? I could see him playing well on a team like the Warriors or Nuggets where they've got some players already. But I don't know about 3rd option.      *Brandon Ingram will be in a Warriors uniform*  You've got me torn on this one. The scoring and the size would be nice but I'm not sure how they could convince NoLa to part with him. I like Wiggins but he doesn't really move the needle.      *Grayson Allen will be an All Star*  Well, it's always good to end with something memorable - like a punchline."
"yeah but its not like swapping simmons for malcom brogdon or CJ mccollum improves their title chances either  they were still the #1 seed this year adn their team as-constructed is a finals threat, they don't urgently need to make big moves like that  and if they make the wrong move then they would really screw themselves"
Okay there’s bold opinions but   “CJ McCollum will be an MVP candidate if he gets moved”  Cmon man
All this speculation for nothing. He is getting traded for CJ McCollum.
Is CJ McCollum still not good or did that rumor finally get dispelled?
Simmons has such a hard trade value to gauge I feel like. His skillset is interesting but I feel like the current player he is he’s only an attractive asset to rebuilding teams who think they can unlock something in him or think he can help them finally break a playoff drought. Unless Brooklyn is trading for him for free I really can’t see how he fits into a true contender and for the trade to make sense if the other team gives up an all star with a more complete skillset. I think Philly is more likely to get back like a cj mccollum level player
Eric Gordon is trash. Your fan base fucking hates him for a reason but you are clearly ignoring that to try and paint Ad in a worse light.   Mirotic is not great. He was a role player who was -30 for the bucks in his last playoff series in the nba.    You traded for half a season of cousins after wasting almost a decade of Ad. That’s a case of too little too late.  Why not list all the dumb shit free agents your team signed to “help AD”. Asik? Solomon hill? The list goes on with awful overpays for trash or mediocre players who handicapped your cap space     &gt;Portland is a consistent playoff team because of dame   Why not take a peek at who dame played with. CJ McCollum and LMA for example are better than 99% of the people AD had to share a court with.   The Pelicans front office was and still is trash. They’re already wasting zion as it is with dumb shit like extending Steven adams
They getting CJ McCollum at best 💀
"That really depends on what Wiz get on top of CJ. The current front office has made it well-known of their unwillingness to trade beal.   I really like McCollum and have for awhile but he’s coming off a poor playoff performance and with all due respect, is a complete downgrade from beal on all fronts."
"lmao   &gt; The entire series vs New Orleans  where cj went one on one with etwaun moore the entire series while dame was getting double and triple teamed by ad, jrue and rondo?  &gt; Denver ... then last year he scored only 10 points in a blowout win against Denver  denver? are we talking about the one two years ago? lol 25/6/5 vs. 26/6/3 who outplayed who? cause you cant be talking about this last one where dame massively outplayed him but i see you're caught up on the one game he scored 10 points and ignoring the others where he was dropping 30+  &gt; Golden State,  [damian lillard: 27/7/5 against  the warriors in the playoffs](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/damian-lillard-vs-golden-state-in-the-playoffs)  [cj mccollum: 22/4/3 against the warriors in the playoffs](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/cj-mcollum-vs-the-warriors-in-the-playoffs)"
"Bagley, Curry, and Picks won't get McCollum. Blazers are equally in win-now around Dame and are not looking to get picks and some bench players. CJ only leaves for a quality starter. Also, CJ is your PG. He's a point guard who only plays shooting guard because he is next to Dame."
The CJ McCollum comparisons are kind of accurate here
"Cj McCollum was an all star, Andre Drummond was an all star"
His trade value currently is someone in the CJ McCollum/Malcolm Brogdon/Buddy Hield/D'Angelo Russell category.  Not sure any of those guys put the Sixers over the top though.
Their starting lineup next season will be   PG - Ben Simmons   SG - CJ McCollum    SF - Carmelo Anthony   PF - Rondae Hollis Jefferson   C - Jusuf Nurkic
PG- Steph Curry SG- CJ McCollum SF- LeBron PF- Luke Kennard C- Larry Nance Jr
"There’s been nothing about CJ McCollum rumors, so I feel like he’s back. I think Nurkic is probably gone though"
Or CJ McCollum
you can get australian draymond for one cj mccollum
CJ McCollum for Simmons is the best trade
"so if i want a guy better than 30-year old CJ McCollum i’m automatically too high on Simmons?   i get he was playing super well in the first half but there’s simply no way that’s all Morey takes for Simmons. maybe if a good bit is added to CJ. but there’s no chance Simmons is dealt for CJ alone. he doesn’t move the needle hardly at all. regardless of where you think Ben’s value is, it’s higher than for CJM (again, straight up).   i’m as clueless as anyone about what Ben will fetch. it’s going to be very interesting. but i’m fairly certain the centerpiece will be younger than McCollum, especially if reports of a robust market are true."
I agree that at this point getting Dame seems pretty unlikely (think Beal is possible) but I'll just say that if we only get CJ McCollum as the main piece in return then that's lame as hell and I would 100% rather keep Ben
"Allow me to reexplain  I think no deal will occur with Portland, 95% chance. The other 4% chance is Dame coming back. 1% is CJ. Only way Portland trades Dame is if he wants to go, and he'd have to want to move east to play with Embiid. I can see that happening.   I'm not delusional and I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that if Ben is traded, the return will be much higher than CJ McCollum."
"DUDE LOL SO TRUE  I remember someone said that CJ McCollum gives zero effort on defense and I said that CJ is always trying and expends actually a lot of energy running around the court, he is just too small to make a difference. He clearly understands the limitations of younger players or guys like Melo/Katner so he always ends up out of position but he does TRY to get back and recover to his man,  he is just too small to contest"
"You’re not getting Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum, but have fun hypothesizing it and getting upvoted by people that are also clueless."
"there’s no way 30 YO CJ McCollum is the best Ben would get, so there’s no way that happens."
Because Ben Simmons has more trade value than CJ McCollum and the deal is lopsided if it’s straight up 1 for 1. Covington is probably the only other guy the sixers would want.
"&gt;imo it’s a 3 team trade to get whatever team is trading the non-simmons star more assets. not really to stack smaller assets for the sixers  Yeah I mean this is the dream scenario but the non Simmons star first has to be dealt to begin with.   The biggest issue here is unless you can trade for a disgruntled star like Dame Im not sure there's really an offer that will actually improve the Sixers. I agree CJ/Covington/pick isnt the Morey type of deal, but the biggest driving force behind this as much as anything is just the idea that Simmons probably shouldnt be back next yr for both sides its best. Too much scar tissue at this point. Which means the incentives and pressure to deal him go beyond trying to find a trade that makes you a better basketball team on paper which is usually his main goal.   Ordinarily Morey is the type to value things like future picks more than others. But I think he also knows the window is right now which is why he might feel more pressure to do something like trade for 30 yr old CJ McCollum which he otherwise wouldnt really want to do."
"I’ve been against it before, but CJ McCollum also has lower value than he should. Might be a good trade."
"All star caliber is CJ McCollum, dude was a 28 ppg scorer in the first half of this season"
"CJ McCollum is exactly the kind of guy who could be described as ""All-Star caliber"" when the Sixers are selling the trade package they get to their fans (even though he's never made the All-Star team)."
Fans really thought CJ McCollum would get it done.
Neil Olshey: CJ McCollum could be an All-Star if you squint *really hard*
He hasn't won a ring but he's been to the playoffs every year aside from his rookie year.   He's made a WCF appearance with the likes of Nurkic and CJ McCollum as his supporting cast.
Yea that game was amazing. Such a shame his team always lets him down. CJ McCollum reminds me of Khris Middleton minus the defense. Way too inconsistent.
"It would absolutely be an issue defensively. Curry's great off-ball, so on offense he'd be fine as a de facto SG, and Klay would be fine as well for the same reason as a SF due to his height. On defense, though, the other team would constantly hunt Curry or Lillard on switches until they got the mismatch, and your remaining 3 would have to put even more energy into defense.  &gt;Imagine if we reversed the situation and said ""The trailblazers are looking to trade for Steph Curry with a package centered around CJ McCollum,"" would anyone honestly think that the blazers would get worse?  Blazers already have a defensive problem and Curry is a lot better than McCollum, so no. But that's literally just because you'd have added scoring that CJ doesn't provide. The Warriors are much more balanced, so the question is different for them. Lillard would offer a lot of scoring help but would it be enough to offset the defensive woes?"
"Yea the Timberwolves are most likely not getting Ben Simmons, and we really shouldn't even be a main focus point of discussion. There are better trade scenarios that could be had without the Timberwolves being involved such as:     \-Malcom Brogdan  \-Kemba Walker  \-Lowry S&amp;T  \-CJ McCollum/Damien Lillard (unlikely)  \-Mike Conley S&amp;T  \-Collin Sexton     The only thing the Timberwolves truly have to offer is DLo, but even then I have a hard time figuring out why the 76ers would make that trade, unless they value the scoring aspects of DLo and are willing to look past his defensive struggles."
"I think the funniest part about this entire discussion is the idea that Dame and Steph's positional overlap would ever be an issue.  Imagine if we reversed the situation and said ""The trailblazers are looking to trade for Steph Curry with a package centered around CJ McCollum,"" would anyone honestly think that the blazers would get worse?"

"Do you get that a ceiling means he has to develop skills?  Why would ""doesn't have a good jumper or iso ability"" have anything to do with it...  He has the body and wingspan to guard 2-4, and if he gets exceptional defensively, maybe 1-5.  He moves smoothly going laterally--CJ McCollum could be critiqued as not being explosive, doesn't mean his movement isn't a huge part of his effectiveness.    His shot is pretty natural, if long way to go for consistency, but he should be able to get to 35%. he seems to have enough of a decent two way court awareness on his good nights that a fully mature version of him could be a stopper and creator.  So like iggy-ish?  French Iggy but thicker?  Like i dunno man, what else do you want from a modern prospect?  He's not athletically Kuminga, sure.  He flashes enough on his hot nights that he projects as a two way statsheet stuffer that any team would want, and in theory his fully fleshed out form would fit perfectly in the MotorCade."
"I wouldn't say Marcus Smart making All Defense is that outlandish.  I'm gonna go off the rails and list my hot prediction takes for next season.  - 50% chance Westbrook will get traded in a blockbuster at the deadline for a 3P shooter if they're struggling during the regular season.  - The other 50% chance being the Lakers get eliminated in quarter finals again due to a combination of injuries, LeBron getting older and their lack of shooters if Westbrook doesn't get traded.  - The Bulls will make a convincing playoff run and be on the verge of eliminating a contender team in the semis, only to be reverse eliminated due to a heart breaking injury to one of DeRozan or Lavine at the worst timing possible.  - SGA will make All NBA third team.  - Kuzma will change his reputation and breakout as Washington's no 1 option. However, Washington doesn't make the playoffs.  - Klay Thompson will suffer another debilitating injury when he comes back, this time will be career threatening.  - Isaiah Thomas will be signed to a 10 day contract late in the season from a team decimated by injuries and proceed to still do nothing noteworthy.  - Jalen Suggs will emerge as the ROTY. Cade will have played better, but is ineligible due to injuries keeping him out of too many games.  - A package surrounding Ben Simmons will be eventually traded for CJ McCollum midway through the season, despite both front offices vehemently denying they're shopping either of them the entire time up to the trade.  - Donovan Mitchell will request a trade by the end of the season if the Jazz don't make it to the WCF at minimum."
"Harden being down on Giannis was a thing, but also directly connected to Giannis winning MVP over him.  CJ McCollum and Draymond Green also tweeted some stuff about Giannis too 'not defending the best player' (*veryyyyy* funny hearing defense complaints coming from CJ,) and some of that is Giannis doesn't do all that banana boat stuff.  A lot of these guys don't like it when you don't suck up to them and do open runs with them in the summertime. BBall players are pretty big divas and there are plenty of cliques in the basketball world."
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
"Guard - CJ McCollum (creation/shooting/handles) and Tony Allen (defense, size, hustle, leadership). Easy 2-way all star, someone every team would want. CJ with TAs transition game would be fun to watch as well. Wing - Gerald Wallace (defense, athleticism, rebounding, hustle) and Rashard Lewis(shooting, size, handle). 2 of my favorites from the era, the combo can hit any shot at any time, absolute madman on D.  Center - Enes Kanter (rebounding, size, post, hands, hustle) and Nerlens Noel (lob threat, rim protection, length, mobility, defense in general) just a player I'd love to see. Probably puts up a 14/14 and is a beast on the paint on both ends."
CJ McCollum.  Can get a bucket but borderline forgettable also.
That's just not true. Look at your top 3 scorers that series.  |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MPG|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|CJ McCollum|.519|.423|.769|38.9|25.3|2.0|3.5|1.3|0.3| |2|Damian Lillard|.352|.300|.882|40.6|18.5|4.5|4.8|1.3|0.0| |3|Al-Farouq Aminu|.519|.433|1.000|32.7|17.3|9.0|1.3|1.0|0.5|  CJ and Aminu both shoot 50 from the field and 40+ from 3. Dame's taking almost as many shots as CJ and shooting 35/30.
"he was pretty awful, and it's about the opportunity cost.  The Clippers drafted Olowokandi over 3 no-doubt-about-it first ballot HoFers who are in the top 20 all time in scoring, and two of which are Finals MVPs (plus Dirk won regular season MVP in 2007).  You can say that the Cavs took Bennett instead of Giannis, which hurts, but the rest of that class was pretty weak.  2013 was a draft class without a consensus number 1 pick, whereas in 1998 Vince, Jamison, Paul Pierce &amp; Bibby were tearing it up at major NCAA schools &amp; had tons of visibility while Olowokandi was 23 when he got drafted &amp; went to University of the Pacific.  Call Giannis &amp; Dirk a wash as far as draft misses if you like, but the opportunity cost of not getting Vince or Paul Pierce vs. a CJ McCollum or Rudy Gobert is way worse to me."
Defensive stopper CJ McCollum
"I’m sorry dude but that’s just plain wrong.   ""Clutch time"" is defined as the last five minutes of a game in which the point differential is five or fewer. This season, Lillard leads the NBA in ""clutch time"" scoring, with 5.5 PPG on an otherworldly 63.2% shooting from the field, including 58.8% from beyond the arc and 100% from the charity stripe.”  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.foxsports.com/stories/nba/damian-lillard-clutch-michael-jordan-portland-trail-blazers-cj-mccollum"
"&gt;Dude they run the whole damn offence around jokic. He's offence in a can. You can't just neglect the gigantic difference in playmaking. It's like saying CJ McCollum and Chris Paul are similar level players because they both score approximately the same on similar efficiency.   The Wolves run a lot of their offence through KAT also, you should watch more of KAT if you think the comparison is CJ and CP3..."

"I would love to trade him to be honest. But his contract is too monstrous for other teams to take, and it will also be a bad look to trade away your loyal star who helped you to a dynasty.  If a Dray for Simmons/Beal/Dame trade was available, who wouldn't take it? I'd do it in a heartbeat. Hell I would even trade him for CJ McCollum"
Decent ceiling like CJ McCollum
mitchell is also 22 while cam is 19. Cam's scoring arsenal for his age is super advanced. I could see him definitely having a lou williams/cj mccollum type career. Maybe not as good as CJ but i think he will be able to score at the next level.

"For the Blazers, I would say it’s pretty accurate. We’ve had defensive issues for years, but I’m skeptical of a head coaching change and our current roster construction being enough to get the job done.   Much as I appreciate his work as a Blazer, it might be time to move CJ and shake up the Lillard-McCollum back court. And any improvement from Dame with help defense could really make important strides to get improve our ranking."
Might I interest you in this CJ McCollum and a bacon maple donut?
"It's pretty clear that Simmons will stay in Philly if those are the options though, aka what has happened so far. I'd rather trade Tobias Harris for CJ McCollum."
Someone like CJ McCollum is nowhere near as good as Ben or Dray.  It just depends how impactful the player is overall regardless if it’s on offense or defense.  It just depends on how good the players are.
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense— some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange— I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"
philly needs to accept the fact that they wont be able to get anyone better than either CJ McCollum or Malcom Brogdon this offseason for simmons. and the chances of them getting anyone better than those two in the regular season are slim
"God dammit Morey, you’ll take CJ McCollum for Simmons and you’ll LIKE IT"
"Literally any good-to-great scoring guard. CJ McCollum, D’Angelo Russell, Colin Sexton come to mind as realistic ones"
"This is a prerequisite extension.   The sign and trade for CJ McCollum (straight swap) is inevitable now. At least, that's what my sources are saying..."
Iverson. Inefficient as hell. Played a lot of minutes. His per 36 were like basic allstar numbers. Like deadass were comparable to like CJ McCollum and Jamal Murray
Lebron James and not the NBPA President CJ McCollum?  The only issue I would have is including teams so far behind.  The 9 and 10 could be like 5 games back from the 8 and they'd still get a shot which I'm not okay with.  If by 82 games you can't be closer than that you shouldn't be in.
"What i can think of right now...(this is just my opinion)  Overrated: Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe (I don't know why Clippers traded for him), Doc Rivers (I know it's about players but still...),  Underrated: CJ McCollum, TJ McConnell, Nikola Vucevic"
Siakam to Portland...he gets reunited with Norm Powell...I would do it especially if it means Siakam gets paired up with Dame  Toronto can build around CJ McCollum as its #1 option
"They are both young so they could be better but it’s highly unlikely. Sexton won’t be better than McCollum next year, there is a huge difference between putting up numbers versus meaningful numbers. CJ and Dame have been in the playoffs every year they’ve been together. Sexton and garland need to start making the playoffs not just put up numbers"
"I don’t see why he can’t be CJ McCollum or Brad Beal lite. I mean, I think people underrate how he is a generational scoring prospect, broke records wherever he went. Ofc, he needs to get better at playmaking and defending, but those can be taught and the arsenal and talent he has rn is matched by very few. We already have seen him develop each and every game this summer league. He’s probably a guy who was always the hardest worker and most talented player on any team he’s been on, so now being put in a situation where he meets three guys that might now challenge him in those areas can really take his play to the next level. If those other skills develop, he really can be a starter and possible second scorer on a championship team."
THJ and Brunson is a better fit than just CJ McCollum
Brunson/THJ is a better fit than just CJ McCollum
"Turner was in his 4th season. MCW was drafted in 2013 and Evan Turner was drafted in 2010.  It wasn't the strongest rookie class though. Oladipo, Giannis, Gobert, Porter Jr, CJ McCollum, Dennis Schröder, KCP, and Tim Hardaway Jr are the most well known players from the class."
definitely the answer is LaMarcus Aldridge   also CJ McCollum   De(Mar +Rozan)
"Carmelo won’t be forgotten I think because of his strong ties to LeBron and general memeability. And the fact that he played in a huge market.  I think the guys you mentioned and more so borderline/one time stars like Rudy Gay, Eric Gordon, DeAaron Fox if he stays in Sacramento, or CJ McCollum will be forgotten.  Also, this post is Roy Hibberts music"
"If we are going with Blazers, I would say CJ McCollum is already performing just a bit under that level, it just isn't recognized. He has been averaging over 20 points a game for six seasons. It is already borderline All-Star, and it would take a little boost in performance to get it into Superstar levels.     Also, he is the president of the player's union, so he is a smart guy and seen as a leader in the league as a whole."
"CJ McCollum. Dame won't be forgotten, but CJ will. Source: I had to look up his name when making this post."

"He doesn't need some type of cutoff, because it's an inherently terrible way to determine if someone is clutch   If you want clutch, look at their stats in the 4th quarter or the last 5 minutes or something.  Like Dame shot 3/17 from the field against Denver in game 7. And yet he was undeniably clutch. Why? Because 2 of those 3 makes were 3s that came late in the 4th quarter. He had a horrible game overall, but in the final moments, he made the ones we needed.   Or CJ McCollum in that 4OT game people hype up technically had a sub 50% TS%. Are you going to tell me he was unclutch that game?"

"And has won as many WCF games as AD has in NOLA.   He squeaked by the easiest bracket he could have, got outplayed by CJ McCollum half the time on the way there, and didn't even win a game in a series vs the same Warriors team that AD at least stole a game from.  Difference is, AD was unlucky to not have his team healthy when pushing for the playoffs, and had to run into the Warriors in the 2nd round, not WCF. Still, he stole a game from them when they had everyone healthy, while Dame played a Dubs team without KD (and got swept)."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"&gt;Does Harden make the playoffs with the Rosters Westbrook had in OKC? Even if he gets bounced out in the first round. I personally don't think he does.  When did you start watching Basketball? James Harden has made the playoffs with bad supporting casts in his career, this isn't anything new, he's known as the #2 best floor raiser in the league for a reason.  &gt;Same goes for Dame who took the Blazers to the WCFs with CJ McCollum as his 2nd best player...  In 2015, James Harden took the rockets to a 56-26 record, with his second-best player Dwight Howard playing only 41 games that season. He went on to take the Rockets to the WCF that series averaging 27/6/7 on 62TS% that playoffs. He averaged 28/8/6 on 63TS% in the WCF. Dame, who you're praising for reaching the WCF in 19', got swept by the KD-less Warriors, blowing multiple double-digit leads in the Second half, averaging 22/5/8 on 55TS%.  &gt;lol, with Chris Paul on his team.....Chris Paul, arguably one of the best PGs ever  Yes, to take the greatest team ever assembled to 7 games you'll definitely need help, regardless in 19', when he took them to 6 games, Chris paul averaged 17/7/6 on 57TS% while shooting 31% from three, Harden averaged 35/7/5 on 59TS%. LeBron James the greatest player of this generation never took them past 5 games, and that was with one of the best pg in Kyrie, he got swept the very next season without help.  &gt;Luka averaged more points and more rebounds with a better FG than Harden this season.     What cherry-picked stats to point out lol. I'll be using a 2-year sample since a one-year regular season/playoff stats don't prove all that much  Luka Doncic: 28/9/9 on 58TS% &amp; 54efg% with 4TO in the past 2 seasons  James Harden: 30/7/9 on 62TS% &amp; 54efg% with 4TO in the past 2 seasons.  Harden is drastically more efficient, a better scorer and both are great playmakers."
"&gt; Russel Westbrook as a first option has NEVER made it out of the first round.   Does Harden make the playoffs with the Rosters Westbrook had in OKC? Even if he gets bounced out in the first round. I personally don't think he does.   Same goes for Dame who took the Blazers to the WCFs with CJ McCollum as his 2nd best player...  &gt;James Harden took the KD Warriors to 7 games  lol, with Chris Paul on his team.....**Chris Paul**, arguably one of the best PGs ever which we saw how much he changed Phoenix this year.   &gt;Harden and Luka are pretty much the same players except Harden is better.  You keep saying that Harden is somehow better than Luka providing 0 reasons as to why. Luka averaged more points and more rebounds with a better FG than Harden this season."
Obviously it's a better option for top-tier players but college is still the best for under-the-radar players. You're not going to kill college basketball because the Morant Damian Lillard CJ McCollum always slip through. The G league ignite is not going to take 100 of the top 150 recruit.
It's okay now you can trade your 2nd option franchise player for CJ mccollum instead
"CJ McCollum is a glorified 6th man. Mostly due to his height for the SG position,lack of consistency, and poor defense."
IF he can fix his abilities...IF CJ McCollum can have have a repeat of his All Star calibre start to last year-he's a fair trade.
Any chance he turns into a CJ McCollum type of player?
"My issue with that is that CJ and Seth are a bit redundant (yes, I know they have been teammates before) and Seth was hugely important to 76ers last postseason, so the move doesn't really solve their postseason issues from last season.  I also think that pro-Simmons people, like I'm sure 76ers are, value Simmons over McCollum."
"FVV has the same type of value as Brogdan, Harrison Barnes, CJ McCollum"
“Nothing to show for it”? Those Pacers have been to 4 different ECFs and one NBA finals. 4 of the 5 were All-Stars and 3 made All-NBA  What the hell have CJ McCollum or Brandon Ingram done?
"&gt; It would be easy to think that the MIP award is worthless; however, other recent winners include: Giannis, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, and Dragic.  &gt; All-stars, champions, All-NBA players, etc.  cj mccollum has not been either an all star, all-nba, or a champion. why was he mentioned?  also why is merely being all-star or all-nba sufficient to say you ""have something to show for it""? if that's the case then considering four out of five of the named indiana players made all-star or all-nba (or both), that means they too have something to show for it"
"Also, pushing the idea that Simmons would be traded for a player of Dame's caliber rather than say De'aron Fox or CJ McCollum helps his perceived trade value."
CJ McCollum? What the fuck have the blazers achieved with CJ McCollum?  Add in Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram
You think he move the needle for you ? He give better defende than CJ and add some size but your offense was really iso dependent with McCollum and Dame taking turn so I wonder how it will work.
"CJ and Siakam's salaries are only 2.1m apart, they don't need DJJ for salary.  It would either be one of our young guys (Nassir Little more likely than Simons), or no salary filler.  Additionally, they have no need for CJ, so they likely require multiple more picks (like 2 picks 2 swaps, or 3FRP).  That is, unless a 3-team trade is found to take CJ for other stuff.  Blazers might view 3 picks as an overpay; Raptors likely won't consider less (if CJ McCollum is the contract they're trading for him)."

"Three-way trade is more likely. Who's the loser here:  Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Harrison Barnes  * Matisse Thybulle  * 3 Sixers 1sts  Kings get:   * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum  * Tyrese Maxey   Sixers get their all nba PG to pair with Embiid. Lillard/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid is filthy. Easy yes to go all in  Blazers actually improve, in my opinion. Fox/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk plus Thybulle as a young stud off the bench, plus future picks, is pretty damn good and isn't a three-undersized-guards lineup  Kings get players to make the playoffs with. Davion/Haliburton/McCollum/Simmons/Holmes with Maxey, Buddy, Bagley, TT off the bench is a playoff team  Point is, I think there's something here."
"Man what a trash ass offer for us. Why would any team give up two *elite* shooters *and* picks for Ben ""Everyone Else's Skills Have To Cater To Mine"" Simmons. All y'all uneducated, don't actually play basketball, haven't watched a Wolves game in your life /r/nba nephews come up with the most ass ideas. Y'all have these elaborate tiers of player value based on how you guys see other people discuss them rather than having actually watched these guys, making everyone agree simultaneously with Raptors fans that OG is untouchable, but DLO is a negative asset, and CJ McCollum is also ass compared to Ben Simmons (tag my post y'all wack ass 76er fans, y'all never getting Dame).   Nevermind the fact that D'Angelo Russell played good (not passable, good) defense after his return from surgery, nevermind that for some reason because KAT isn't a mistake eraser you supposedly have to surround him with all plus defenders despite Jokic playing the same position with guys like Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and MPJr surrounding him (successfully). Man, I just really hate y'all bum ass, can't hoop fools."
*path to CJ McCollum
Sources say Portland is holding onto CJ McCollum and see it as their path to Embiid.
I love how cj McCollum is apparently trash but is the centerpiece of any fan made trade package to gain a better second option

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
"So you think Siakam is THAT much better than Cj McCollum? I am curious, if rating the top players in the league, where would you rate Siakam (factoring contract in as well)?"
CJ McCollum  Ben Simmons  Pascal Siakim  Buddy Hield  Andrew Wiggins  Tingus Pingus
Yeah that would be a nice package for like CJ McCollum. Not up to par for Siakam.
John Wall or CJ McCollum seem possible.
If you think CJ McCollum is the problem with the Blazers I don’t know what to tell you  The only other consistently good player he’s played with since 2015 is not even close to the problem
I’m cheating a bit and using Canton/Akron but our starting 5 is pretty strong.  Steph Curry CJ McCollum Larry Nance Jr Lebron James Nate Thurmond
And Portland fans think they are going to get him for CJ McCollum hahaha
Portland centered around CJ McCollum
I don’t see either of those players in him   More like CJ McCollum or LaVine
"youd love the sixers to have all their money tied up in tobias and mccollum, two guys who havent proven they can be the third best on a championship team must less 2nd best to waste Embiids prime.  That is a total Elton Brand Move, hoping Ben improves (even if that chance is 1%) or that they can trade him for Dame or Beal in a package (even if that is 1% again) is better than getting CJ for him.  The guys they are talking about like CJ or Brogdon would be great additions if you could move tobias, not as replacements for Ben.  That genuinely makes you worse.  Too bad Tobias is unmovable."
"If anything Toronto won the trade. They got rid of a guy they weren’t going to resign for a 22 year old averaging 16 on a playoff team. You act like Powell is a great player. He’s a really good bench player on a championship team, as shown in 2019. I don’t know why Portland traded one of their few young players for a 6th man who has a similar playing style to CJ McCollum. Portland’s has a lot of these desperation moves, like trading a first round pick for Robert Covington. How’d that turn out for them?"

"Idk it's hard to say for Kidd. He was an elite playmaker and a solid shooter, and in his prime was also an elite defender (was still good defender even then). I'd say Rondo last year on the Lakers but while his numbers similar Rondo didn't help the Lakers as much as Kidd did the Mavericks at all.   For Terry, actually this years Jordan Clarkson is a great comparison numbers wise (Clarkson might be a better defender) but Terry's actual output in the Finals considering the game at the time was closer to like, CJ McCollum.  Third best player besides Dirk and Terry was Shawn Marion. He was a former all star caliber player but had also lost a step. Think like.. idk RoCo last year for the Rockets. Elite defensive stopper. Good for a few buckets and boards. He wasn't a shooter though."
"CJ McCollum isn't ""pennies on the dollar"" - it's as close to his exact value as you're going to find on the market. Thybulle and Simmons are not the world stoppers Sixers fans make them out to be. Simmons for CJ is absolutely a fair trade for both sides."
CJ McCollum? He’s good just inefficient at all the wrong times
The funniest thing about Blazers fans is when they joke about what Morey wants for Simmons……while thinking CJ McCollum will net them Pascal Siakam 😂
He makes up one half of what is probably my favorite NBA-adjacent photos of all time.   [CJ McCollum initiates the fast break](https://imgur.com/PPAQaWI)
CJ Mccollum
Doc Rivers is fired if the Sixers get embarrassed again in the second round.  CJ McCollum is traded by the trade deadline
Ben Simmons / Cj McCollum  &amp;#x200B;  pls
They put Beal at 11 and CJ McCollum over Zach Lavine and Jonas Valanciunas in the 90s. The list does not make sense
"I didnt blame him for it I just said you have to play well. He did play well amazing  versus the nuggets I watched all those games besides game 1 especially that ridiculous game 5 where CJ, and Roco sold so im not obviously putting that on him and ya mccollum was terrible that series beyond awful with his turnovers and missed shots but he was arguably portlands best playoff performer 2018-2020 those 3 postseasons (I especially think he was better than dame after that OKC series in that nuggets and warriors series even though both obviously werent great). Injuries or not in 2020 he didnt play well just making that a point.  But thats all irrelevant because he doesnt have the accolades to make the top 75 list potentially or if so barely. I can list the top guards lately who are top 40 players of all time Curry, Harden, Russ, CP3 these guys have accolades and have accomplished more counting RS and playoffs within there careers/primers then theres a huge cap Dame and Kyrie are there. When its all said and done I do think Dame will be top 75 maybe another year or two will etch him in but the lack of mvps, scoring titles, all defensive teams, championships, finals MVPs, assist titles, something really historic is separating from the others."
"I mean I just explained my mindset, you just don’t like it. I think he’s been way more loyal than you could ever expect him to be and the front office has failed. If he wants out after this season don’t blame him at all. It’s a tragedy his best teammate this whole time has been CJ McCollum"
"McCollum for Simmons, straight up or +1 future protected pick. No role players unless Philly throws in more to balance.  Simmons has leverage over Morey at this point, and so does the rest of league. Hard to see how waiting futher in to the season will add any value or power to Daryl's position... Admit ya lost this trade through bad handling of a star personality, cut bait and move forward with CJ McCollum spreading the floor for Embiid and setting up your corner shooters. Better balance for both teams"
"Well every season he’s played he has improved. Just the past season he went from 10.6 to 15.9 PPG. He went from 39.0% to 39.8% from 3 despite nearly doubling his number of attempts from 3.3 to 6.1. His finishing has also gotten stronger and he is starting to finish strong over defenders with dunks through contacts more frequently as well over the last season.   And most importantly, he’s only 23. And when you keep in mind that players like cj mccollum had huge leaps from 23 to 24 years old, i dont see how OG isnt capable of that."
The team that can get him for CJ McCollum.
"Just read more details about his contract on the latest ESPN story on their website ""everything we know and don't know about Ben Simmons"". Apparently he got a quarter of his pay already, is due another quarter on Oct 1, so after training camp, and then the other half is split into 12 installments starting on Nov 15.  So could be some fireworks in the next 8 days as the 6ers decide whether to withhold that $8 million on Oct 1.   Tricky thing here is that the team is totally within its rights to enforce the contract terms, however this is a star player backed by Klutch Sports, so they are in a very delicate position.   They could go into one extreme and try to placate Simmons by not suspending or even fining him for missing training camp, maybe make up an injury excuse or something, but if he doesn't report to actual games and the team doesn't do anything, that would piss off the NBA owners for a player essentially breaking his contract with impunity.  They could go the other extreme and suspend Ben the day he refuses to report to training camp, withhold that 8 million, and recoup the maximum amount from his contract, but that would burn all bridges with Simmons, and a suspension would pull the NBPA into the matter, now that a player isn't getting paid.  Ironically the NBPA is now headed by CJ McCollum!"
"Any chance philly can snag cj McCollum? I feel like he would be pretty good with embiid, since dame time obviously ain't happening."
We’ve got a perennial all star who’s also a 0 time all star for you Philly. CJ McCollum. Take him now or this will get a lot worse
Just trade him for CJ Mccollum and some other pieces or picks. It is their best option right now. Philly is getting too greedy.  They're gonna end up settling for a bad trade at this rate and it's going to be bad like what happened with George Hill.   Just get it over with Morey. The writing is on the wall.
"Honestly CJ McCollum could help them win.   No team in the league is giving Philly their best player for Simmons, which seems to be the flaw in Morey’s negotiating strategy."
I still think philly has cj McCollum for Ben in their back pocket and has been hoping for a better deal with that as a fallback. I don’t think they’ll be able to beat the fallback tho
Imo I don't think so. Trae young shot 39% and 32% from 3 that series.  Cj McCollum would get eaten base off the switches the hawks do. Their front court is 6'9 plus and their guard is 6'8. He did his part but somehow Tobias Harris shooting 38% game 7 and below 30% game 5 at home. Embid did great but 8tos in a crucial win or go home hurts too.
In my opinion I don't think embid is the main piece. It's really two co stars. The two most important awards mvp and defensive player they both finished in second. Joel embid is always hurt and simmons is 6'11 clamping up the best guards and forwards making their life harder.    Cj McCollum is going to have that defensive impact that put the 76ers in first place like last season?
I still think Simmons for CJ McCollum makes the most sense.  PDX needs to do something besides just running it back over and over again.
I mean sure. But there’s also a good chance his value depreciates by then and you have to include more of your other assets for said star. And at best it’s still gonna be a middling star.   For example you have no real shot at getting a Bradley Beal or a Damian Lillard. If those teams trade them they’ll want rebuilding packages and there are plenty of teams that could outbid Philly fairly easily.  In a best case scenerio it’s like a CJ McCollum or a Gordon Hayward
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"* Klay is as perfect a player that you can think off. Shot, defence, and off-ball movement.  * I also love to watch CJ McCollum on offence. With his limited athleticism, you can learn a lot on his techniques to get to his spots.  * From an IQ/ Playmaking standpoint, I would say LeBron, they way he thinks the game is so underappreciated. How he decides to move based on very subtle movements from defenders and the way he sees a play taking place to make the right passes. So good to see."
"Replies like this are so brain dead annoying. You're going to sit here and tell me that CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Jusuf Nurkic, Robert Covington and Larry Nance aren't assets that would return value in a trade?"
"CJ McCollum was pretty bad his first two seasons before breaking out in his third. Not sure if I'd say he's a ""star"", but going from averaging 5 and 7 ppg to 21 in his third season is a pretty huge change."
That's ridiculous. Teams have literally made offers for him. Just because they're way lower than what the Sixers want doesn't mean they're nothing.  Simmons could get traded for CJ McCollum. Wall could not be.
"Pg: Chris Paul (all-star)  Sg: CJ McCollum  Sf: Paul George (all-star)  Pf: Kevin Durant (superstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  Bench: Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Buddy Hield, Mikal Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Clint Capela,"
CJ McCollum.
"I wouldn’t even hate that. Not a huge fan of the years left on Harris’ deal but hey I think that still makes us better even though CJ is objectively a better player on a better contract. You might be able to argue Portland would even be better off without McCollum even if they didn’t get anything back for him lol.   The starting line up going from dame/cj/Powell/RoCo/Nurkic to dame/Powell/Harris/RoCo/Nurkic, is a massive upgrade imo. The defense gets exponentially better by removing cj and allowing norm to play his natural position of SG"
Just take Cj McCollum already and be thrilled about it
"PG: Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum. SG: D booker (All Star), James Harden (Super Star). SF: MPJ, Chris Middleton. PF: Giannis (Super Star), Sabonis (All Star). C: Nurkic, K Love.  I guess I don’t know who I would put as the last 2 spots. I also don’t really remember who was an all star this season so I might have accidentally picked 3."
"And they still kind of messed up drafting after he left and they sucked again. The only good pick they did was Kyrie and that was the easiest #1 pick in that era besides AD. In 2011 if they draft Kyrie &amp; Klay that’s amazing back court that would provide some of the most spacing ever and with Klay being the greatest off ball shooter he wouldn’t get in the way of Kyrie &amp; then eventually LeBron as well. In 2012 instead of drafting Dion Waiters, they should’ve drafted Harrison Barnes to have him play at the wing alongside Klay Thompson to make a very good defensive wing unit and keep LeBron at the 4 so the Cavs stay elite defensively and never have the drop off on the defensive end that they had in the 16-17 season. And with knowing how weak the 2013 NBA Draft is now, I think the Cavs should’ve traded the #1 pick to move down and get assets for future drafts. So in this scenario the Cavs draft CJ McCollum and have him be their 6th man off the bench with anywhere between the 5-10 pick if they traded down and instead of drafting Sergey with the 19th pick in the 2013 draft, they drafted Tony Snell who becomes another defensive wing off the bench that can shoot. Then the last move I would’ve made was trade some of those assets I got for trading the #1 pick to get Al Horford and have him play center so the team would’ve been ahead of the versatility bigs who can switch on the perimeter while stretching the floor. If the Cavs would’ve built their team like this, they could’ve been a 70 win+ team I truly believe and would’ve made those Heat teams look like amateurs."
"It's exactly how I take it yeah. Basketball is a low variance sport, and NBA teams are generally pretty even, so if you have a night where your team shoots 50% from 3 rather than 35%, you're probably winning the game regardless of what the other team does.  If you want to see a player use it in context, here's [CJ McCollum](https://www.nba.com/blazers/video/2021/4/20/cj-media) who I think is widely regarded as one of the most intelligent players in the league, skip ahead to 2:40 for the question and his comment. It's used to describe the difference in close games, which is usually one team makes their shots and the other doesn't."
you also have to build a good roster for that luck to actually pay off and then blazers haven't. No contending team can have cj McCollum be their second best player they just can't.
CJ McCollum in shambles
"STILL BLAZERS.   If they're willing to accept Beal, they should be looking at what CJ McCollum could bring to the roster. One of the few trades that legit helps balance both rosters!  Top-10 SG with an unstoppable midrange, deadly deep ball and playmaking skills to help spread the floor for Embiid &amp; get easier perimeter shots for roleplayers. Sure he doesn't bring defense, but Philly has plenty and they're short on shooting.  Philly was NEVER gonna get Dame, period. Get over it... but if they're serious about wanting value, McCollum is about the best player they're gonna get. Fwiw, Portland would also likely send a role player or 2 to make salaries match, plus they'll want to get under the luxury tax.   Best deal Sixers are gonna get 🤷‍♂️"
"How does losing a guy with ""no value"" cause a team to go from contender to not a threat? He's a bum right? He's basically worth CJ McCollum."
"We're not trading our 2nd best player from last season, 20/5/5 on great efficiency, for anyone from the 76ers (sans Embiid) or Portland (sans Dame) (I'm assuming CJ means McCollum)."
"SO the 6ers go from contender to not a threat by losing Simmons, who this sub thinks is worth a CJ McCollum type of player. SO the difference between a replacement player and CJ McCollum is Not a threat -&gt; Contender. WTF is going on here..."
"That’s not really how it’s gonna play out. McCollum will be a huge defensive liability against the nets and will be hunted whenever he’s on the floor. It’s entirely possible brook Lopez gets played off the floor with the big 3. We didn’t really get to see it because harden was hurt but brookbwas really bad defensively in the first few games when kyrie was there.   I think teams will get a better idea this year that you will have to play small to match the nets otherwise you’ll literally get blown off the court. The nets have an underrated small ball lineup for defense because Durant can be serviceable. Then offensively they will just blow you off the planet if you’re playing traditional bigs.   They broke the point per possession record against Boston in the first round. It was a weak team for sure but it still shows the offensive firepower of this twam.   They had the highest offensive rating in league history last year with everyone missing serious time. This is probably the best offensive team ever, only comparable with the warriors and they have better offensive role players while those teams had better defense.   Cj mccollum isn’t nearly as big of a difference maker in a playoff series as you’re making him out to be. There’s a reason the nets are massive betting favorites even with injury concerns"
"""ain't gonna be no more layups. not while i'm around"" -CJ McCollum"
CJ McCollum.  He's one of the best shooters in the league and an underrated play maker.  People in this sub treat him like he's some scrub.
what options were there ?  cj Mccollum and lots of picks for who? paul george? butler?
"&gt;The Sixers are much more okay with Ben missing some time than Ben is missing millions of dollars. If he sat out the whole season, that's the kind of thing that would actually frustrate the Sixers, but you're talking about giving up $33 million dollars, which Simmons definitely isn't going to do.   So you agree that the Sixers wouldn't let it come down to Ben riding the bench the whole season because it hurts them too much? Good. My point is that that isn't happening because neither side wants it to.  &gt;There's functionally no difference between a bad return now and a slightly worse return later. The Sixers are going for a Championship, splitting hairs between things that don't put them on a Championship path is irrelevant.  You're highlighting my point here. What is the point in keeping him longer if doing so is only gonna *decrease* his trade value?  &gt;Embiid is also under contract for the next 6 years, so he's probably on board with however they want to handle it, and even if he isn't, it doesn't really matter.  You're right, no star has ever forced a trade before. Especially from a dysfunctional organization.  &gt;And if they don't, then they'll keep him, it's that simple. He's the only piece they have that can get them to a Championship, whether it be as a trade piece or by his own improvement. If they have to wait him out to get to that point, so be it.  How?? If they keep him, he loses value and won't fetch as much in a trade. Hoping somehow everybody involved kisses and makes up is not a viable strategy. It's not happening. If he wasn't working on improving before, you can be damn certain he isn't gonna do it now in Philly.  &gt;The difference is irrelevant. They'll be a playoff team regardless, and neither of those packages makes them postseason-relevant. So no, big picture-wise, there's basically no difference.  I'm sorry but I just don't know what to tell you if you think those trade packages are roughly equal to Ben Simmons sitting on the bench. All of those players are good and help provide offense which Philly desperately needs. It's not a good idea to do nothing and possibly miss the playoffs just because you wanna get top dollar for Ben. Top dollar is not available, and neither is reconciliation. Contrary to popular belief, CJ McCollum is better than a max contract that doesn't play."
"&gt;Simmons loses money, and the Sixers have to deal with having a max contract riding the bench.  The Sixers are much more okay with Ben missing some time than Ben is missing millions of dollars. If he sat out the whole season, that's the kind of thing that would actually frustrate the Sixers, but you're talking about giving up $33 million dollars, which Simmons definitely isn't going to do.   &gt;If Ben is there on a max contract sitting on the bench/playing with no effort, then his trade value continues to decline and Embiid leaves.  There's functionally no difference between a bad return now and a slightly worse return later. The Sixers are going for a Championship, splitting hairs between things that don't put them on a Championship path is irrelevant.

The difference is irrelevant. They'll be a playoff team regardless, and neither of those packages makes them postseason-relevant. So no, big picture-wise, there's basically no difference."
"&gt;The Sixers have almost all of the leverage. Ben's only option is to cost himself ridiculous sums of money, which he is overwhelmingly probably not going to do, and which the NBAPA won't want him to.   What you're describing here is a lose-lose situation. Simmons loses money, and the Sixers have to deal with having a max contract riding the bench. You can bet your ass that isn't gonna sit well with Embiid who is gonna have more of his prime wasted. They can wait for a better return all they want, but Ben has zero motivation to help them, and honestly, what better deal do you see them getting for Ben? They put themselves in a difficult position by throwing Ben under the bus.  &gt;Ben can try to not put in effort, but Morey isn't trading him for anything less than a piece he sees as at least keeping them the same caliber of team or better, and Ben could be stuck there multiple years.   If Ben is there on a max contract sitting on the bench/playing with no effort, then his trade value continues to decline and Embiid leaves.  &gt;This isn't some situation that Ben can muscle his way out of. Ben is by far the Sixers most valuable trade piece, and they still won't be able to bottom out for high picks if he gets traded for scrap.  If he's so valuable, then why do you think he's only going for ""scrap""?  &gt;Morey's only option is to hold out for what he sees as a return equal or greater than the value that Simmons brought to the team.  That's simply not true lmfao. At this point I don't see any way that the Sixers actually get equal value for him. His value has been demolished by both his own performance, as well as the organization itself. How are they gonna improve his value when he has motivation to hurt his value?  &gt;The difference between Ben half-assing it for them and them getting a bad return for Ben is basically nothing to Morey, and trading Ben for some shitty return is permanent, whereas you still have the upside of him getting over it if he's there.  Every single part of this is dumb. You can't seriously believe Ben Simmons with 0 effort is better than something like CJ McCollum or Sexton+Hield? If Ben doesn't wanna play for Philly, he's gonna be actively hurting them every second he's on their roster. And there's absolutely nothing that suggests the relationship is salvageable. All signs point to the exact opposite. You think he's suddenly gonna decide that he wants to play there again after the whole fan base hates him and he was Doc's scapegoat?"
CJ McCollum
I think CJ McCollum would push them over the Nets as eastern conference Favorites. His scoring would be incredibly valuable and help them when giannis or Khris aren’t feeling it.
Isn't CJ McCollum the new president?
"&gt;Maybe the Blazers do ante up with a C.J. McCollum-led package. Maybe San Antonio or Toronto make a run. But if the market stays dry, that gives the Wolves a chance.   If I understood this correctly the Blazers haven't offered CJ to the 76ers in exchange for Simmons. That's really an offer that only people on social media are suggesting."

"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Most trades I've seen include CJ McCollum or De'Aaron Fox or Colin Sexton or D'Angelo Russell. All players that are starting guards....
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
"I’m under the impression the best possible offer Sixers have at this point is CJ McCollum (which I’m not even sure is happening). The best offer that can definitely happen is like Beasley + McDaniels + Beverley/Prince + picks, but I don’t see that being better than Wall + almost guaranteed top 5 pick + another unprotected pick."
"I disagree 100%. One of the reasons Dame and CJ never worked out is because one they're an undersized backcourt and two, they fucking suck on Defense.  Replacing McCollum with Simmons immediately boosts the teams Defense and can allow Dame to play off-ball."
CJ McCollum is the answer
CJ McCollum
"I mean, its been 8 years of CP to one month of CJ. Admittedly, I missed the transfer... my bad... but the culture of player empowerment had been established long before McCollum took over, lets be real"
cj mccollum&gt;&gt;&gt;
CJ McCollum
"Wordsworth  here never even bothered to see if Paul is the president, while writing this trash post.  He isnt. CJ Mccollum is.  And none of these other pontificators knew it either.  Consider this, the next time you bother debating people on this sub. They usually dont know what they are talking about."
"CP3 isnt the president anymore, its CJ McCollum now."
CJ McCollum is clearly better than Tobias Harris.  The argument for Tobias I always hear is; “a lot of teams would definitely rather have a PF that isn’t bad on defense and can score so they would take Tobias”....but I just don’t think they are close enough to justify it.  CJ can get taken off his game a bit in the playoffs but as a starter he’s putting up 22.5-4.5-3-1 on 45/40/77 shooting splits.  Tobias is 18-9-4-1 (with less blocks per game than CJ) but I see someone that takes him self out of games and disappears far too often as well as someone whose defense is overrated.  Edit: Tobias’ shooting splits: 45/33/86
"CJ McCollum has investigated himself, and found himself innocent"
CJ Mccollum got a big first day god damn
CJ McCollum
I’d probably agree. Could be like a CJ McCollum type who puts up great numbers but can’t break through to the actual ASG roster.
CJ McCollum had a really great postseason a few years ago and has been mediocre since
"CJ McCollum is a 30 year old poor defensive volume scorer.  His TS% the last 4 years (of his prime) was .536, .553, .541, .577.  His career TS% is .553.  He is being paid $33.33 mil in 22/23 and $35.8 mil in 2023/24.    Morey is a moneyball GM.  Why do people think Morey wants CJ?     Beasley + Beverly make less money combined than CJ does, and 24 year old Beasley has almost as much production on better efficiency BEFORE HIS PRIME.   CJ’s numbers are for his prime.   Do you want Beverly, a 40% 3-point 3&amp;D PG + a more efficient 20 PPG scorer who creates his shots off ball with motion in Beasley?  Or do you want the less efficient CJ McCollum who’s better at creating with the ball in his hands but is only a league average efficiency scorer?  I really think people are crazy here.   Dame is the guy carrying Portland, CJ is an overpaid volume scorer with poor defense.    Morey isn’t going that way."
CJ McCollum is my best for never to make the ASG.
"The league has plenty of players that out up similar numbers to BI: Gordon Haywood, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, caris lavert, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavigne, Tobais Harris..."
Before his value was fully tanked there was maybe an argument for McCollum for Simmons straight up in a trade that benefits both teams improving Portland’s defense and the 76ers offense. CJ’s age balanced out by the risk of Ben not improving on a longer contract.   The 76ers asking for Dame was never going to happen and now they’d be lucky if Portland accepted a trade for CJ including Ben + assets…
Bro that is honestly the best deal you can get because you are not getting CJ McCollum for a man that averaged single digits in a Conference Finals
"The reality is that Ben Simmons' true value has always been closer to CJ McCollum and Buddy Hield than it has been to Dame. If Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley plus a couple picks are available, they should just do it. Kings picks are only second in value to Timberwolves picks on average. It's very likely that Ben on a Kings roster would be a horrible fit too."
CJ McCollum bout to have to deal with this bullshit now lol
So you're saying Brogdon and whoever else they add is better than borderline all star CJ McCollum?
"He needs a sports psychologist and to get some ""Yes"" people away from him.  If we get him gone and someone like Buddy Hield, CJ McCollum, Andrew Wiggins, or D'Lo I'll be ecstatic."
You’re only looking at what CJ adds and not what he doesn’t.  4.7 assists is absolutely terrible.  The back court duo of him and Lillard routinely got into shootouts because of how bad they were on the defensive end. Pairing him with Seth Curry is just a terrible idea.   The Sixers aren’t sending Ben out for CJ when Brogdon is a better fit and comes with additional assets. This sub has an obsession over both the Sixers trading Ben and the Blazers trading CJ and desperately try to make a 30 year old CJ McCollum sound appealing.
"That's just incorrect, you have Danny Green who can make entry passes to the post.   You'd also get CJ McCollum who averages 4.7 assists alongside playing a main ball handler. If CJ is put in the point guard position, it's very likely that his assists would go up.  Again, the problem of sixers isn't distribution, once Ben gets across half court, he just passes it to Embiid or Tobias and goes standing in to the dunkers spot.  CJ on the hand can play off ball and run pick and rolls with Embiid or Tobias. Which is what the sixers need desperately."
If they trade him it’s not like there will be another 30-40m in the starting lineup. Unless it’s CJ McCollum you’re looking at prospects and salary filter. How is that any different than letting Ben sit when we have the ideal PG prospect right behind him in maxey?
"If you remove Ben from the equation, the Sixers absolutely have no distribution on the court. You go from having one of the best distributors in the league to CJ McCollum. We literally do not have a person on the roster capable of an entry pass outside of Ben."
"Once again, what player better than CJ McCollum do you think is going to be available in a trade for Simmons? Kings don’t even want to give up Fox or Haliburton. Wolves won’t give up DLO or ANT. Sixers simply don’t have the bargaining power that your fanbase thinks it has."
Where do you rank CJ McCollum in terms of PGs? Where does a combo guard with less than 40 games as the primary ball handler stack up against actual point guards?   Any team trotting out a combo guard with poor distributing skills like McCollum as their PG isn’t winning anything. Not to mention a backcourt of Curry and McCollum is fucking atrocious.
Nah. All of their young core are one dimensional. All Sexton can do at an (possibly) elite level is score. Garland’s ceiling is something like CJ McCollum. Okoro can’t shoot for shit but is a hella great defender. I would hold off any opinions on Mobley until the RS starts.
"Who runs the point for the Sixers? CJ is not a point guard, despite blazers fans saying he can run the point. No team with CJ McCollum as a pg is winning anything."
You just described cj McCollum lol
You just described cj McCollum lol
"How do people come up with these scenarios....  What's the better team?  Luke Ridnour, Aaron Afflalo, Tracy McGrady, Lamar Odom, Ronny Turiaf  Earl Boykins, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavine, Leon Powe, Enes Kanter"
I honestly think Simmons/Embiid could work if they had CJ McCollum at the SG and ideally another playmaker.
The CJ McCollum special.
"CJ McCollum is super underrated and can be the 2nd best player on a championship team, kinda like Khris Middleton"
"&gt;Defense is good, but fixing actual weaknesses is much better. If 76ers make any trade it should be with that in mind and not getting more defense.  Fixing weaknesses you say? Oh, well I wonder what their biggest weakness was.  Was it half court creation, gravity from a shot creator and 3 level scorer, and shooting from the backcourt? Oh, it was? Imagine the trade was centered around CJ McCollum....  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Not to mention Simmons isn't a defensive anchor, so while he's an elite defender, he's more similar defensively to players like Kawhi and Butler, than he is to the likes of Gobert, Draymond and Embiid.     Yeah."
I won't go so far as to say McCollum &gt; Simmons but CJ simply fits far better.
I'd like to experiment with trading CJ McCollum for someone who plays the 3. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
Cj McCollum+league average defense
"Obvious choices Simmons and Gobert. But I think Jokic came back to earth in the playoffs against the Suns and hasn't won anything significant.   CJ McCollum has come up small a lot, as well. Tobias Harris has to be up there.....essentially anyone involved in Simmons trade talks."
"Enjoy watching CJ “The Useful One” McCollum wasting any sort of option at contending your team has.   He’s trash and y’all know it, that’s why you are so desperate to trade him. He’s not useful short term for us because what he brings in offense isn’t even close to how much he’s destroy our defense."
"My idiot opinion is this. If a player wants a trade they should ask for it or wait out their contract and leave in free agency, but if they are asking for a trade just do it behind closed doors. Paul George did it twice and it worked out wonderful for him both times. It also worked out well for all the teams. No need for the extra drama when you strong arm the teams by using the media like AD did. This is not even to say AD didn't have a valid reason for a trade. He definitely did, but in retrospect he should've just gone to the Pels and said you guys need to trade me or I'm leaving in free agency next year. I want to go to the Lakers, so please try to trade me there.   However, with that said it is not one size fits all. The Ben Simmons situation is entirely Philly fault. They shouldn't have thrown him under the bus the way they did after the playoffs. Then the rumors trade offers Morrey was asking for just added fuel to the fire. They will be lucky to get a guy like CJ McCollum in return. To be honest they don't even deserve that for the way the have handled this. He should've been traded right after the playoffs because his value only keeps getting lower."
"Fred VanVleet, CJ McCollum, Andrew Wiggins, Tobias Harris"
CJ McCollum is the epitome of this lmao.
"KD &amp; Jokic have some of the deepest bags in the league.  I would also include Embiid, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, Luka Doncic and CJ McCollum on there as well.  LeBron also has a pretty excellent bag of tricks but it feels like he has relied so much on being bigger, stronger &amp; faster than everyone to get to his spots it's not as flashy as some of the other guys on this list."
"CJ McCollum can get to just about anywhere on the court and get a shot off, which is impressive given his size. He's never been an All Star (and tbh never deserving of a bid) so there may be people out there that don't really know his skillset."
"Exactly. I love this guy as a player (he’s on my “team”), but CJ McCollum is not a combo guard. He’s an undersized SG, and he’s really good at that."
suns use a variety of on and off ball screens to get favorable mismatches so there was no marquee iso matchup like donovan mitchell/dame lillard/cj mccollum  but they did try posting jae crowder on him lol

"Yes, noted dirty player CJ McCollum."
CJ McCollum is a pretty good basketball player
"Yep. McCollum on the Sixers is a guaranteed ECF appearance. The problem is CJ is playing too good right now. If he keeps it up, there’s no way the Blazers trade him. If the Sixers can’t end up getting someone at CJ’s level when all is said and done, Morey will have made the biggest mistake in his career. CJ for Simmons straight up was a fair trade, but Morey wanted three firsts and three swaps in addition to CJ. Ridunkulous!"
CJ McCollum being on the table is high ass trade value. It’s more than any team has gotten for a star in recent years. Especially considering they wanted someone who was already established to play with Embiid. His value would be lower now because now he’s caused 3 months of drama and has had tons of questions about his mental fortitude. Teams already rarely if ever give up even fringe AllStars in superstar trades and Ben isn’t a superstar.
"JJ Redick eventually becoming an analyst has gotten be the least surprising news in NBA history. The new Tim Legler.   Kyle Korver also has a job if he wants it. CJ McCollum has any NBA job he wants the day after he retires, same with Chris Paul (CP could do the Isiah Thomas thing and literally go into EVERY facet of basketball job)."
"Giannis is a tier above Embiid (healthier, for one, and just more dominant, for another). Giannis is at a Shaq level of interior dominance right now. On top of that, CJ is a little bit closer to empty stats than Khris. Portland fans can tell you that. That's why his name is in trade rumors, and why people have talked about moving him for a ""difference maker"". Because he can't get it done next to Dame, and Dame &gt;= Embiid, I think.  And besides, for Giannis's situation, the issue was never the ceiling. The regular season performance the bubble year proved that. They collapsed in the playoffs. As long as they didn't collapse, I think it was unrealistic to suggest they weren't a lock for the ECF. That was not a guarantee for the 76'ers. And about that ECF - to me the surprise was that the Nets collapsed beforehand, as they did. Nevertheless, in a world where KD+Harden+Kyrie *doesn't* collapse, it doesn't matter if you move McCollum for Simmons, or if you try to compare the 76'ers to the Bucks for hypothetical argument - that Nets team is still a surefire lock for the finals. And as such, worrying about the Nets is out of Morey's control. He should simply continue to play the best move he has and roll the dice on the odds."
"KD(Shaq), Draymond(Chuck) and CJ McCollum(Kenny), with CJ getting the Chuck ""rings"" treatment. Throw in JJ Reddick as the moderator or Ernie's head a la Futurama style."
"Renee Montgomery, Draymond Green, and CJ McCollum would make a great trio of color analysts to replace Chuck, Shaq, and Kenny in 10 years or so. Three entertaining, intelligent, well spoken people who have shown they have a natural gift for broadcasting, public speaking, and realtime NBA analysis when they've had an opportunity to do it. Plus you get coverage from a ballhandler, a wing, and a big. Draymond and Montgomery are also similarly accomplished to the current panelists, with multiple rings and personal accolades. Though CJ is not quite in that group. I dunno how much it matters. Getting the WNBA perspective from Renee would be interesting, but she is also more than qualified to analyze the NBA and has demonstrated that pretty thoroughly.  I don't know how you go about picking a replacement Ernie."
"CJ McCollum, Chris Bosh, D Wade, Giannis, Danny Green, Fred VanVleet, Draymond, Klay, Steph all have future/expanded roles in TV if they want it. All funny, accomplished, insightful and likeable players"
"Imagine saying no to CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons.  Like I get Morey wants to win every trade but is Simmons for CJ not a slight win for the 76ers?  And to the people saying CJ and Seth can’t play together, you realize a team can make more than 1 trade a season?  The 76ers have Seth Curry, Isiah Joe, Maxey, and a 1st that they could move to improve the roster and they still have nice depth even if they traded all 3 players for 1 player."
"Every day Simmons' value goes down. They scoffed at CJ McCollum for Simmons straight up, now I doubt the Blazers would go for that."
"If there were betting lines for which NBA players would end up working for ESPN/in sports media, Reddick would probably have some of the highest odds.  CJ McCollum also would be up there."
I just pick random players to hate on. I got banned on one of my old accounts for hating on CJ McCollum too much lol
"I mean Jaylen Brown and CJ McCollum are pretty far off from each other.  No one plays similar to Giannis, KD, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, to name a few.   The talent is just better now. To take a couple of your examples, there are more players like AI nowadays. A player with Tony Parker’s game wouldn’t be a good player in today’s NBA. To be honest TP would get smoked against today’s talent."
CJ McCollum runs a ton too. Westbrook and Harden run comparatively little.
"6ers should have taken the CJ mccollum trade, gotta be a rough feeling right now seeing CJ ball out"
"Trailblazers need to be sold if they want to ever win another championship.   When I say sold, that does not necessarily entail moving a team. They have a great fan base, located in a decent location along the west coast (better if Seattle or Vancouver had a team), and the business operations side of the team seems to be pretty successful.   On the other hand Jody Allen, Paul Allen’s sister and executor of his estate, is pretty apathetic when it comes to the team. It is a $1billion investment in a portfolio of $20+ billion. Paul was obsessed with the blazers and Seahawks and was at almost every game, Jody not so much.   She continues to rely on the GM Neil Olshey who has turned out some of the worst contracts in league history ($40mil to Meyers Leonard, $70mil to Evan turner, $40mil Allen crabbe, $8mil festus ezeli who never played a single second) and for a executive who lauds himself for draft prowess has so far only produced one good pick, CJ McCollum (What about Dame? Olshey showed up June 4th, Dame was drafted June 28th. That pick was already decided). He has also dug a whole of no money and no draft picks that has led the blazers to be a continual first round exit (2019 WCF run was cool, but a lot of lucky circumstances were involved.).   Dame is gonna be entering the tail end of his career when his contract expires and their second best player CJ, will be right there with him. The only young talent they have, anfernee simons and Nasir little have been riding the bench behind Terry stotts’s 7 man rotation for the last 3 years, so if they break out this year they will really be in their 4th to 6th year before really getting legit playing time.   The complacent attitudes of the organization lead me to believe that the only feasible option for the blazers to be competitive in the coming decades is for the team to be sold. There is never going to be a major shakeup without an outside influence tearing it down and building it back up, and the blazers are an organization held up by toothpicks right now and it’s just a matter of time before it all comes falling down."
"then who is the better option we should be listening to that has as wide a presence as Kanter???? Beggars can’t be choosers, if you care about the way people are being mistreated then you can’t be picky about the people drive the issue.   That’s like saying fuck what MLK said, let’s wait until we have someone who doesn’t cheat on their wife to spread the message of equality.   It’s not like there is  or some other high profile athlete that’s speaking out on China that we should be listening to instead. If somebody like CJ McCollum or Jayson Tatum or Jerami Grant started saying the exact same thing as Kanter, then that’d be great, but in the meantime, Kanter is the only one pushing back.  Is it unfortunate that Kanter may be colleagues with some of those people? Yes (but also wtf they’re only pictures, Kanter could’ve met those guys for like 2 minutes. Even Ali is pictured with guys Bush and Clinton, Jackie Robinson was “friends” with Nixon). Everybody fucking loved Obama even though he also killed thousands of innocent people with drone strikes.   If we start calling people guilty by association then every single notable person will be guilty. Like what the fuck are we doing.   Kanter being a Gulenist is atrocious, but we also haven’t heard him talk about that at all recently (or at least I haven’t, if you do know of any podcasts/articles/etc of him talking about Gulen I’d be interested to hear/read them)"
"Please tell me at the very least that's typo and you meant CJ McCollum? Terrible take though, Prime McGrady in Orlando is a top 5 SG of all time tbh."
CJ McCollum is overrated and only thrives because he plays next to dame

&gt; If Morey isn’t phased by the off court drama then I don’t see the point of rushing to make a deal for some okay players &amp; picks.

CJ McCollum is a stud from Mid Range
"The only time Simmons got shopped was last season when James Harden was on the market. And besides, even if he got shopped that doesn’t justify his behaviour, he’s not the first player to ever be shopped. Guys like CJ McCollum are in the trade rumours every 2 weeks but they still act professional and show up. Ben is acting like he’s the only player to have ever been shopped by their team in history"
I believe CJ McCollum is the players association President and Kyrie is Vice President. Not sure if Jaylen brown is involved but I wouldn’t be surprised considering how smart and outspoken Jaylen is
"Lol and by this logic, neither Joel Embiid, D'Angelo Russell, or CJ McCollum would be in the league"
That's a good point but you also have to consider Doncic doesn't have any reliable second options. If he had a Jamal Murray or CJ McCollum he might not gas so hard.
"CJ McCollum is as good or better than Simmons. Calling him ""scraps"" implies Ben is also ""scraps"", in which case why would you expect a return of ""not scraps"" for Simmons, AKA ""scraps""?"
"Well except the whole ""wasting a year of a generational star's prime for a dick measuring contest"". Embiid was complaining about sore knees after opening night lol. Everyone is saying ""Morey shouldn't trade ben for scraps"" but CJ McCollum is extremely fair value."
Cj McCollum

"wow imagine if philly had actually taken that CJ mccollum + picks trade, they'd be invincible"
"&gt; Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Austin Rivers is a better SG than CJ McCollum?  &gt; 18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further.  18-19 was also a year where Dame carried a series that, frankly, the Blazers *should* have won...and then the Blazers won a series that, frankly, Dame didn't carry.  And then they ran into a buzzsaw.  Hardly a case of Dame being let down by his roster.  And this is the limitation of only looking at   &gt; how we lost to better teams.  Because *of course* the conclusion of that assessment is that Dame is let down by his teams.  That's the only conclusion that *could* be reached from this sample other than ""Dame and the Blazers both deserved to lose every time they lost.""  Which is very unlikely and also a shitty-feeling conclusion to reach."
"&gt; When the players are the draw, why are owners and teams entitled to the lion’s share? Players put themselves on the line and are constantly at risk of injury. Makes sense they should get a significant percentage of the revenue.  Eh, real skeptical on everything you said. Look at the NFL. Tom Brady collects $25M a year on his salary, whereas CJ McCollum makes $29.5M.   There is no universe in which CJ McCollum is a bigger draw than Tom Brady.  In America at least, Tom is even more famous and prolific than Lebron and Steph.  There wouldn't be any games, any TV deals, any players getting paid at all, period, if there were no team owners/governors."
we dont have cj McCollum tho
"I think just because the name is “CJ McCollum” it seems that way but I think he could take off with Philly.  He’s always been a beast and next to a dominant big instead of backing up another lead guard he’d be like a 27+ PPG scorers, he’s showed stretches of it."
That's just his analytics-only galaxy brain take. It's why 20 years from now kids will be scrolling through Basketball Reference wondering why people claim AI was better than CJ McCollum despite having a lower TS%.
How is the conclusion you came to to trade Ben for whatever they could get because Joel banged knees a couple nights ago? Seriously where is the correlation? If Joel is hurt we need CJ McCollum to take us to the promised land?
I mean Cj McCollum carried Dame to his best playoff run lmao
"Jrue Holiday is a better player than CJ McCollum. Not sure what this discussion has turned into, this is a top 75 list not a 1-75 list and both of them made it."
"It's very weird that the tipping point for you boils largely down to team success, especially when Parker got to play with Duncan and Manu, while Dame got CJ McCollum and 3 seasons of LaMarcus Aldridge."
Sixers have no picks to trade. The protected 2025 1st they owe to OKC blocks any reasonable offer.  They are waiting on CJ McCollum not Dame.
CJ McCollum was an early-mid lottery guy in 2012 and opted to stay to finish his degree and attempt to make a deep run at Lehigh after torching Duke. He unfortunately suffered an injury early in the year. He was absolutely someone that scouts and GMs believed to have serious potential. I mean kind of funny how the Blazers hit on two older guards taken in the lottery. To say he wasn’t viewed as a great prospect is incorrect.
Problem with CJ McCollum is that means Seth Curry gets pushed out. They can’t be on the court at the same time because they are both defensive liabilities and we need a ball carrier that can distribute. That isn’t one of CJs strengths.
He’s ruined a lot of nights for me as a nuggets fan over the years.  Not like CJ McCollum has though.  *shudders*
"PG: Holiday  SG: CJ  SF: Bridges  Big: Bam Big: Jokic  Bam, Holiday and Bridges keep you in prison on D, and Jokic and McCollum run the show on O."
Lol man his team is trash. CJ McCollum fell off the earth in round 2. Carmelo wasn't even found last year.
Jrue Holiday  CJ McCollum  Mikal Bridges  Draymond Green  Nikola Jokic

&gt; If McCollum was still available morey would take it  Doubt. Constant leaks have said that blazers want simmons and would trade cj for simmons. How ever morey keeps asking for CJ+2 first rd picks+other role players which we obviously will not do.
"“Wait and see” what are you to expecting to receive for a player that looked awful in the playoffs and then gave up on his team? And, for as long as Morey keeps this up, will not have played for an extended period of time.  No GM is gonna wake up one day and think “I’m trading a star for Ben Simmons” just because Morey waited. The best possible trade is likely Simmons for CJ McCollum, which is a trade that they likely could have done the moment they wanted to trade him. Whatever trades that could have been done then are still the best ones now. If teams get more desperate for trade options, it’s not for Ben Simmons. Now I’m not even sure they can get some of those because of how they have tanked his value. And YES, it IS jeopardizing the team. They’re not winning the championship with just Embiid. They need a secondary star of some kind. Having a star’s worth of value just provide no value all season is a mind blowing waste, all because Morey is deluded to think he’ll eventually get a superstar, for some reason. Nobody owes him a better trade, and no one is going to get eager and pay up more to make sure they get Simmons when this dude literally just said he’ll be available for YEARS, and as far as they know Simmons will never play or improve in that time."
Exactly my point. Neither is CJ McCollum.
"But that’s my whole point - they aren’t being low balled. CJ McCollum isn’t as valuable as the idea of Ben Simmons, but that’s how Portland values him. Sac doesn’t think he’s worth Fox or Halliburton. Ninny doesn’t think he’s worth De’Angelo. You can’t tell me Ben Simmons is worth more because no one is willing to give up more. That’s how things derive value"
"Well if you were thinking klay, I have some more reasons to think klay:  [Klay Thompson Is The Most “Advantageous” Player](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qccf0h/klay_thompson_is_the_most_advantageous_player/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  Although it’s arguable he’s a superstar, so maybe someone like Cj McCollum?"
And then got gentleman swept by the greatest team of all time while dame got swept by the warriors without Durant and got outplayed by CJ McCollum in the nuggets series 2019.
What /r/nba needs to understand is that there’s no one available that Morey wants. There’s no reason to sell low when there’s nothing to buy. He loses nothing by waiting. Simmons has already hit rock bottom price and yet absolutely nothing has changes; the only available price from day 1 was cj McCollum or.. DLo? Like why commit to that trash.
CJ McCollum sucks.
"What people miss is that the 76ers are already, even without Ben Simmons, a quality playoff team.  Is CJ McCollum and two future first rounders going to tangibly change the championship prospects for this 76er team? Like what is that going to do for them?   Their 9 man rotation in the playoffs is, what, Embiid, Harris, Green, Thybulle, Curry, Maxey, Korkmaz, and I guess Drummond for 6 minutes?  Whoever they bring in has to steal enough minutes from those players to move the needle. Gonna bring in TJ Warren and Caris Lavert to take minutes from, I don't know, Thybulle and Korkmaz?  Like what's the practical difference between a 4/5 seed and potential first round exit and a 3 seed and a 2nd round exit?  From Morey, and I guess Embiid's, point of view, apparently none. This isn't like the AD/Pelicans situation (beyond the obvious elephant in the room, the contract length) where AD was the difference between relevance and blowing it up. When AD tapped out, the Pelicans had no choice.  The 76ers can just....be a 45-49 win 4th seed, which isn't that different from their 3rd seed team last year.  Until Ben Simmons is hurting team focus/morale, there's no point in moving him. Even if he has to sit the year."
Fair value is cj McCollum honestly. It’s not a difference maker at the level Philly is looking for
"well, as good as Simmons is in some areas there's a very strong argument to be made that a worse player might make the Sixers a better team.   Like, idk if it's ever been on the table but that team is 100% better with CJ McCollum than with Ben Simmons. CJ is a worse player but he makes it possible for you guys to have a functional half court offense."
"I have to think that some people are obsessed with talent, but fail to realize that he just doesn't have the mental make up to ever reach his full potential, aka Andrew Wiggins syndrome.    He's been in the league for what 5 years now?  He still hasn't worked on improving his game enough to at least attempt jump shots?    Morey my not want to trade him for someone like McCollum, but I think CJ is the best player he can possibly get for Simmons."
"idk about you, but when someone makes an insanely unreasonable offer on an item I'm selling, I tend to not trust that person again, and I'll completely wash my hands of ever doing business with them. If you're unsure of what I'm referring to, it's this:  &gt; The Sixers reportedly asked the Portland Trail Blazers for three first-round picks and three pick swaps in a package that would send guard CJ McCollum to Philly in exchange for Simmons, but Portland turned that proposal down, per Charania.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/trail-blazers-turned-down-sixers-trade-proposal-asking-for-three-first-round-picks-for-ben-simmons-per-report/"
"The other is willing to play for 29 teams. If the best the Blazers can do is CJ McCollum, they are not getting Ben Simmons."
Cj mccollum is more valuable in the playoffs than Simmons. I'd hardly call him shit.
"This is dumb as fuck. Cj McCollum and whoever they get makes them massively better than Ben sitting on the bench for 4 years does. If the goal is truly to capitalize on Joel’s prime, having 40 mil in dead space is the worst course of acrion"
"Ben is an All Star, All NBA, DPOY candidate. And yet the “best” player they can get for him is… CJ McCollum"
I don’t understand how holding onto a disgruntled player who obviously doesn’t want to engage in anything increases your playoff odds more-so than trading the disgruntled player for someone like a CJ McCollum.
"I think the answer is that the Sixers shouldn't have demanded a kings ransom and simultaneously torpedoed his value. I think they could have had someone like CJ McCollum and 1-2 picks at the beginning of the off-season.   If you're just going to hold him and not even trade him this season, I think they should have just traded him for picks."
"Isn’t Maxey the pg? McCollum seriously is the best fit and can create space on the floor for joel to cook. No idea if CJ is truly being offered or it’s a rumor, but if morey waits, that deal might go away and he’s stuck holding the bag."
"CJ mccollum?  otherwise its just wasted cap space for philly, maybe even worse than that since hes a distraction"
"I mean I don't know what the current offers on the table are, but I read people here talking about straight swaps for CJ McCollum, trading for young role players and like a couple protected picks from the Wolves and I don't know about you, but even with his massive shortcomings, Ben Simmons is worth a decent amount more than that.   He definitely needs to be in the right team for it, but he's certainly worth more than what his value appears to be at the moment. I believe watching him play again will make other teams more eager to take a bigger risk on him because as much as I get your point of ""they know what he is"", he's certainly added an extra layer of toxicity around himself this offseason. I can't say I'd be thrilled to make an offer for a player with so many on and off the court concerns.   But yeah, I feel the same way, I hope he gets dealt for a decent package because we're never getting equal return for sure. At least we might get a normal season after that because what a series of years we've had..."
"CJ McCollum is not scraps, brogdon and levert are not scraps. Maybe scraps if we were talking about ben Simmons a year ago, but we aren’t and that’s about where his value is now.   It’s funny how sixers fans call him a coward, say how he ruined their playoffs, etc etc but still expect a kings ransom for him. Funny how that works"
"McCollum. Y’all really think Simmons helped this team more last year than CJ would? You were the 1 seed with one of the most flawed players in the league. Go get CJ, trade someone like Seth for a better piece and move on. You’re not good enough to win a chip. You can’t just suddenly become a title favorite by trading Simmons 1-for-1 for another player."
"&gt;Do you really see this ending with a team offering a better deal than CJ McCollum?  Maybe not, but I think taking a chance at getting someone better than McCollum while knowing it might end up worse beats just taking McCollum (who might not be available anyway). Unless some guys have progressed significantly, I don't think this team with McCollum is a championship team."
"I'm more memeing and being flippant about it than anything. But honestly, it does seem a little bold to me because the Sixers don't really have any leverage at this point... How many teams are going to trade anything remotely close to fair value for Simmons knowing that the Sixers will likely have to accept pennies on the dollar for him so as to at least get something in return? I highly doubt Morey will genuinely let this situation play out for 4 years, as each season is another prime Embiid year lost.     I think ultimately, Morey probably should've accepted an offer earlier in the offseason (though I don't know which ones were legitimate), even if it was a lesser value than Simmons is actually worth, as this whole situation has gotten so toxic (in no small part due to Simmons, to be sure) and seems to be just a distraction. The Sixers entering the season with CJ McCollum or some combination of Brogdon and whomever else was offered seems preferable to this mess."
I mean CJ McCollum + Robert Convington isn't pennies
You honestly think CJ McCollum or Brogdon wouldn't make a difference on this team?
"Ok so I am sorry but Morey is a fucking idiot at this point. You had decent deals on the table earlier, you fucked up, those are long gone. So you say ok maybe he plays his shit out, nope that is NOT happening and if he doesn't do this, you guys have to deal with some annoying shit until he is traded. What are you waiting for at this point? Send him to the Kings or Wolves or take CJ McCollum and move on..."
Right now at best CJ McCollum but if this continues even that may be tough to see. If Simmons was vaccinated I would say kyrie
"I'm going to throw a few bullshit names at you, and out of curiosity, (ignoring contracts), who would you 1-for-1 Ben for?  Colin Sexton  Brandon Ingram  CJ McCollum  Jerami Grant  Demar Derozan  Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray  Malcom Brogdon  Domantas Sabonis  Chris Lavert  Fred Vanvleet  Kemba Walker"
"You know what also does nothing to help the sixers? Further destroying their asset's value, then trading him for an even worse offer. Do you really see this ending with a team offering a better deal than CJ McCollum?"
I'm talking about potential fit. I think Maxey has the potential to be a CJ McCollum tier player.
"&gt;Who is a good SF/SG who is low all star to could be all star level?  I hate to say it, but McCollum could have all-star potential in the East on this roster, though Tobias would likely have the edge and neither probably actually make it.  I've been against a CJ trade because I think he's a bit redundant with Seth (better but at a much higher cost), but if he's playing the 3 more that could change things, though he's a bit small for that."
"I have no idea why the hell the 76ers would not accept CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, and a first for Ben Simmons."

If CJ McCollum becomes available for trades the Sixers won't be the only team interested in him
People who knock CJ never took notice of the games where Dame was out injured in the past. McCollum playing the point and scoring 30 was normal. Philly should’ve made that trade. Now it’s too late
Blazers please do not trade CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons lol
"Trade suggestion:  * **PHI gets**: Damian Lillard * **LAL gets**: CJ McCollum, Norman Powell * **POR gets**: Russell Westbrook, Talen Horton-Tucker, Tyrese Maxey, Ben Simmons, 2022 FRP (via PHI), 2024 FRP (via PHI), 2026 FRP (via PHI), 2028 FRP (via PHI), 2025 FRP (via LAL)"
Before pre-season I would have said CJ McCollum. He would have been an all star last year if he hadn't broken his foot (thanks Clint Capela).  But the blazers look like traaaaash in pre-season so I'm not so sure now.
A 6 man of the year type guy. Cj mccollum is also an interesting undersized guy who can really score
cj mccollum if he was a good defender
"He's not the best, the Joker is. Curry is top 5 though. Curry also is 2nd off a screen, and 1st in attempts  *Note: using the points per possession metric.* He's the only PG in the top 20 besides Lamelo Ball. Everyone else is a forward or a shooting guard. If you switch to frequency Curry is 5th and he's still basically the only PG anywhere to be found there.  Curry is also first on catch and shoot (using PTs because this stat doesn't have a PPP count), and if you sort by FGA he's 6th, again surrounded by SGs and Forwards.   Over 60% of his 3s have been assisted this season, and 40% of his 2s. Compare that to Dame, 49% &amp; 19%, or CP3 27%, and 7%.   Now compare him to a SG: CJ McCollum 65% &amp; 27%, Booker: 68% &amp; 37%,. Beal: 71% &amp; 35%.    **TLDR:** Currys shot profile is much similar to a shooting guards than a point guards.

Drazen was more of a 3 level scorer. I’d give him CJ McCollum but better.
Gonna need some more scoring there. Probs drop Dort for like CJ McCollum and your set
"Steph is 21 on 42.3%. He's taken 248 3PA, the only other guy who's taken more than 200 is Buddy Hield who's shot 37.8% on 225. He's taken almost 8 more 3PA than the next 40%+ shooter in attempts which is CJ McCollum who's exactly 40% on 170 3PA.  Absolutely unreal.

I mean he's learning a brand new playbook along with half the Lakers new roster of course they are getting better. CJ McCollum talks about this on his podcast btw
Do you think a Ben Simmons and CJ McCollum swap would benefit your team?
"I agree that Jokic is with the others, and average on defense, but I just gotta say pointing out individual defensive metrics like rating and win shares are not good measurements of defense.   Advanced defense analytics are really outright terrible when it comes to judging a players’ defensive value. For example, D’angelo Russell leading guards in defensive rating.   Additionally, the way it’s calculated is by using possessions, and other integers that are much more indicative of the team’s defense than the player. If CJ McCollum were to fall asleep on defense and his defender runs around him while Dame is on the other side of the court, Dame’s defensive rating would fall just as much as CJ’s.   Tldr: Advanced defense metrics suck, unfortunately."
"Never, go watch Bryn Forbes and Derrick White looked like superstars vs Nuggets in SAS series, next round vs POR CJ McCollum channeled inner MJ closed game 7 for POR. Was like watching player drills around a chair in a gym over and over again."
I went and saw CJ McCollum play two G League games (he was coming off an injury as a rookie). He cooked those dudes so hard and this was before he ever saw a minute of an NBA game.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCJOaHIrSGw

"Even with refs help, on home court, with Embiid going crazy, fully healthy Sixers just lost to a NBA team called ""Minnesota Timberwolves"".   This wouldn't have occurred if Sixers had another scoring option who is not afraid to take a shot, someone like CJ MCCOLLUM."
"Embiid is insane. Sixers should get him some help, someone like CJ McCollum would suffice."
Remember the trade Khris Middleton for CJ  McCollum? xD
Damn could Sixers use one CJ McCollum right now.
"Nurk was feasting whenever Golden State committed to the 1/4 court trap, on defense, he actually did his job to rotate after the Blazers would trap but the backside guys(CJ and whoever pretended to be PF) WERE SLEEPING the entire game on that end. With Nurk in, Warriors had to run way more screens and split action to free someone up top and get downhill ---- but when Nance came in, Warriors actually had it easier on defense, they were able to run their base sets and use youth level 3 on 2's to get easy buckets at the rim  I dont get why Portland doesnt feed hot hands unless it's O or 3? And if those two are struggling, why do they not run some flex, some down screens, or use them as the screeners to get them open? They are such an average team and it feels like they've already peaked and are crashing down.  Warriors tried to go with bigger defenders on Dame but he was too fast. Props to Curry(and Payton playing Strong Safety not Free Safety) for keeping Dame from getting to his spots and when he couldnt, Dray was already there waiting to contest.  This is a game where I would bench McCollum and let Powell keep going to work in his natural position.   IDK what made the Warriors turn off in the 2nd half, but JTA is like a spike of that Peruvian. Wiggins man, I think what is being lost here is that Klay will take even more attention away from Wiggins on offense BUT Wiggins is going to pick up the more lethal swingman and allow Klay to get his defensive groove on 2nd and 3rd options."

Yeah I’m really not sure how you can argue anyone else this year.   Steph’s got 92 3PM on 42% shooting  Buddys got 81 3PM on 40%  Next up is Grayson Allen and CJ McCollum with 63  3PM on 42 &amp; 40% respectively.  Pretty big gap between the top two and the rest of the league
Yeah their color commentator. Someone else will have to tell you about the play by play because i could only stand him for like 2-3 games. I personally thought he was bad and hes more focused on sucking his team off about how good they are etc than the entire plays. Also thinks other teams injuries are fake or says wild shit like how he doesnt care if the other team players (Giddy/Cj McCollum) is injured as long as Embiid is okay. Also talked a lotta shit about Warriors in their game but to be fair i think it was to balance the dick sucking ESPN was doing about the Warriors.
"CJ McCollum and Draymond both said on their podcasts this week that they didn’t think it looked intentional, based on their experiences in the NBA. But what would they know about this sort of thing, right?"
"He didn’t “punch out”. Go listen to Lebron’s explanation from his last postgame interview and rewatch the clips. He basically explains that Stewart was shoving him with his arm and got Lebron off balance, so Lebron did a swim move to get Stewart’s arm off him. As he made that motion, Stewart’s head moved closer to Lebron and Lebron’s hand caught him in the face. Lebron realized it and immediately turned around to apologize.  I was listening to podcast by various NBA players this week and both CJ McCollum and Draymond said they didn’t think it was intentional.  Like it’s literally not that crazy except for Stewart’s reaction. Lebron caught an elbow his first game back against the pacers and got a small cut above his eye. No big deal. That shit happens all the time."
I'm looking at the box score and CJ McCollum is 3/4 from three.  Why doesn't it feel like that?

"Soon as this subreddit says a player is washed up, assume the opposite is going to happen just like with dame and CJ McCollum uptick in form recently"
"Vivek, needs to hire the best GMhe can, let the GM hire the coach, then make trades to change the roster.  Hield, Bagley, Fox? Trade chips. Ben Simmons? CJ McCollum? Maybe? Got to get the owner out of the way and talent in FO management."
"They were saying it in a the “Celtics would be better by bringing in a massive talent downgrade” kind of perspective lol. They swapped an AllNBA talent for a fringe allstar. Idc if Steph Curry decided tomorrow to steal every one of his teammates wives/gfs, trading him for CJ McCollum is going to make the team worse."
"CJ McCollum averaged 6.8ppg at 23, and Jimmy Butler averaged 8.6ppg at 23. He hasn't even played 20 games yet, let's give him some time."
"Homer take, but when CJ McCollum is *reallllly* feeling it, he's incredibly fun to watch--his bag is deep and he scores from all three levels, and he also gets this cocky look on his face that is simultaneously repulsive and magnetic."
"CJ McCollum, and that answer almost feels like cheating"
Small guys with a nice handle and score a lot = Lou Williams or CJ McCollum
Cj McCollum and Big Al Jefferson now that Conley made it
Cj mccollum
this sub when CJ McCollum gets minorly injured:  vs  this sub when markieff morris misses ten games and is taken off on a stretcher because Le EPIC EASTERN EUROPEAN TOTALLY OWNED HIM EPIC STYLE:
"Meh. I think it makes more sense just to cut it off at Superstars tbh. Also I'd add ""stars"" between role and all stars. A guy like CJ McCollum isn't an All Star..but he's certainly better than a role player. He's a star player."
"And CJ Elleby, not McCollum."
Can't wait to see future Sixers CJ McCollum.
Huh? We all know Poole is going to the bench for Klay. But the guy is 22 years old putting up better numbers than CJ McCollum did same age. 26+ year old Poole is going to be super dangerous
"Maybe.   Can you beat Brooklyn or Milwaukee or Miami with a starting backcourt of CJ McCollum+Tyrese Maxey?  I don't know. Maybe. He's 30, so he sort-of fits the timeline. I still don't know that I'd take a Philly team with McCollum to make the Conference Finals."
"Cj McCollum , some people say he was carrying Portland, he wasnt. Its easy to put up a decent statline when you ball hog with tunnel vison."
CJ McCollum says hi over his wine glass
Remember when people were comparing him to CJ McCollum?
That percentage puts him around CJ McCollum and Bradley Beal. His usage rate is the highest in the NBA so you would expect  lower true shooting percentage numbers.
I don’t think he wants teams to trade a major piece for him. He wants the sixers to get CJ McCollum and he wants to play with Dame. Not vice versa.  It’s half about fucking over the sixers and half about putting himself in a winning position. It’s the ultimate fuck you to the sixers organization.
"This is where I disagree the most with Sixers fans.   You guys are 7-2 when Embiid is healthy and act like adding CJ McCollum, a 20+ ppg player and good playmaker won't help your team. I completely understand being uninterested in the package of loose-ends the Timberwolves are offering, but if you can get CJ in return for a guy who is literally a non-factor - a guy who's not even going to suit up for you - I don't see how that anything other than a great deal.   CJ is really, really good and raises the ceiling imo. I don't see how wasting money, a roster spot, and potentially a year of Embiid's prime is better than trading for CJ"
Trading him for Malik Beasley or CJ McCollum does not increase their odds to win a title. So they’ll let him stew and keep fining him
"Sixers fans are not being anything. There's millions of us with wildly different opinions. If it were a poll I think we'd take some sort of CJ McCollum deal (if that ever even existed) but Morey isn't doing shit just because the media, fans, or this sub thinks he should."
"That's certainly a defensible approach. I'm not sure it's 100% confirmed that McCollum is even available but he's probably the best option out there right now.  However, to guess at what Philly is thinking -- there's more to facilitating than raw assist numbers. For example, last season Simmons had 12.7 potential assists/game while CJ had 8.6. Relatedly, Simmons created 6 more points per game through his assists. And that's with CJ having a much higher usage - 26.5% compared to Simmons' 20%.  That said, CJ is a much better scorer so it might balance out. But overall the 6ers just seem to want a PG or playmaking wing."
"&gt; Which non-playoff teams have players that the 76ers would accept for Simmons that would be reasonable in the eyes of the 76ers?  Harrison Barnes, D'Angelo Russell, Collin Sexton, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"
"Man if only you could combine the intangibles and mentality of Jimmy Butler with the physical gifts and skill-set of Anthony Davis, throw in some health and you got the best player in the league lol    But I'm going to choose Jimmy if the second-best player is a CJ McCollum equivalent"
"His value will continue to plummet. At the beginning of last season, he was the center piece in a potential Harden trade. At the end of last season, you could’ve gotten CJ McCollum and assets. By the middle of the offseason, it became Malcolm Brogdon and a pick. I haven’t heard any offers recently but I imagine it’s only gotten worse."
"The narrative you’re pushing needs to stop. CJ McCollum and Malcolm Brogdon(which were the initial people offered for Ben) are the exact kind of player you specified the Sixers need back yet the team turned their noses up at them and pretty much said “if he isn’t Dame we don’t want him”. The Sixers aren’t gonna get a Dame tier player by holding Ben hostage for the remainder of his contract. Ironically, not trading Ben now causes the same exact issue you claim the Sixers should be avoiding because without Ben Embiid has a bigger work load on offense and defense. The optimum trade package in this situation would be for the Sixers to get back a scoring guard that can facilitate, plus some role players, and a few first round picks too for insurance in case things go left."
"I wouldn't say I love it, but it is more sensible than most people seem willing to recognize.  Simmons' drama greatly detracts from his value, but at the end of the day when he's on the court he provides elite defense and can run a half-court offense capably enough to win a bunch of games in the regular season. It's that playmaking which the 6ers especially need to take the burden off of Embiid and let him coast more. That will help prevent injury and keep him more fresh for the playoffs.  As the article says, the 6ers are more than fine in terms of role player depth and outside shooting. So even a high-quality starter like CJ McCollum doesn't do much in terms of filling their biggest needs.  Basically: option 1 is trade for a true star; option 2 is convince Simmons to come back and play (he might relent as the fines stack up and/or the 6ers look like true title contenders); option 3 is trade for a package of role players. There's no reason to rush to option 3 with months to go before the trade deadline."
Yeah. I don't know how anyone looks at the current 6ers team and thinks that CJ McCollum or Malik Beasley is going to put them over the top. They kind of have to hold out for more or it's pointless.
"I could see that working the other way and inhibiting a deal.  Players that have been rumored to be offered for Simmons include CJ McCollum, Malik Beasley, Buddy Hield... those guys are good shooters and could help the 6ers in certain ways, but they aren't the type who can take over a game and relieve Embiid's playmaking/facilitating burden. Plus, unlike in previous years the 6ers seem fine with their outside shooting capabilities.  So far, teams don't seem to be interested in giving up true playmakers like Lillard, Fox, Beal, etc. Makes sense, as that's exactly the kind of player you need to pair with Simmons to make him most effective."
"I seriously have so little respect for all of KDs whining though. He's literally had Westbrook, Harden, Steph, Klay, Dray, Kyrie, Harden again as teammates. He has no room for excuses with those rosters. Dame has had LMA for a couple of years and CJ fuckin McCollum for help over his career. What other modern star has had comparable sidekicks to KD?"
But imagine if ya'll had CJ Mccollum rn. He's an instant huge upgrade over Curry and suddenly you have Curry lighting it up on 2nd units.
CJ McCollum is the king of pretending to attempt the heave but intentionally releasing it a second late.
"&gt;CJ McCollum and complemntary pieces to build around Embiid will definitely help the Sixers  Help the Sixers win a championship? Maybe, but I think it's highly unlikely he's that kind of a piece, and I'm guessing Morey feels the same way otherwise he would've made a deal like that  &gt;Not to mention the circus thsi creates in the locker room during prime Embiid years  Locker room seems totally fine from what I've seen, only issue is Ben and he's not in the locker room, and the team was doing pretty well before Embiid got covid"
"All Doc had to do was say “yes we believe in Ben” and then put him on the trade block and you’d have Dame or Kyrie by now. Instead he created a distressed asset and nobody will give the sixers more than a CJ McCollum/Malcolm Brogdon caliber player for Ben.  I’m a Doc hater so take it with a grain of salt, but I think hiring Doc ultimately ruined the process."
"CJ McCollum and complemntary pieces to build around Embiid will definitely help the Sixers, just cuz you won't get Dame out of the deal doesn't mean the deal is bad. Just means, you won't come out like bandits. Simmons is not worth another super star or a hull of assets like AD or PG. That wasn't a fair return BEFORE this fiasco, and the bar keeps going down. Not to mention the circus thsi creates in the locker room during prime Embiid years. Just terribly managed by Morey."
The only reason you think he's not a pg is that he's spent literally his entire career playing alongside a better pg.     https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/cj-mccollum-stats-without-damian-lilliard
CJ McCollum is actually a pretty good comparison
"CJ McCollum is on a 3/100 which is 3m less than Simmons per year and we are pretty sure he won't live up to that.  It's a low risk he won't show up to his new team.  Embiid's window isn't much smaller than Dame's if at all.  There's no extra leverage there.  There's no salary matching needed in a McCollum for Simmons trade, they can be traded straight up (which goes back to point A that McCollum is on an equally gross contract for the value he provides).  &amp;#x200B;  It's really not that reasonable that the Sixers would have to give up picks when they're both on pretty gross contracts and Simmons is both better and younger.  &amp;#x200B;  I also don't want to hear anyone saying McCollum would have made all-stars in the east.  Only one he'd have a shot of was 2019 to take Russell's spot when he was an injury replacement himself.  McCollum was not better than Brown, Lavine, Beal, Young, Lowry, Walker, Butler, Irving, Oladipo, Wall, Simmons, Derozan in their respective years as all-stars."
"There is, his name Is CJ McCollum, he'd instantly be the best guard you've had since Allen Iverson."
i think cj mccollum legitimately makes the sixers better. which is why i don't want it to happen. i like the sixers and ben stuck in purgatory. less compition in the east for the bucks lol.
Also good god a Seth Curry and CJ McCollum backcourt especially in crunch time is about the worst defensive duo a playoff team would ever form.
"i dont think so if your goal is to contend for championships  Tobias harris is already one of the most empty calorie players in the league and would still be your 2nd best player.  His only arguable above average skills compared to other wings is his mid range shooting and his post up game.  Basically the worst fit possible for Embiid because those are his two best skills.  He has proven throughout his career that he is not a needle mover and chas not proven he can be a third option much less a 2nd option.  He is on a max contract for the next 3 years  Now enter CJ McCollum.  Another similar type of impact player, he feels like the Tobias Harris of guards.  Another guy who has not proven to be a 2nd or 3rd option also on a near max contract for multiple years.  Once you make this deal you have both of these players that are slightly below all star level that do not move the needle and probably cannot be traded.  You are locked into this core of three guys.  I understand that as this situation deteriorates these deals start to look better but theres a reason this hasnt been done yet."
Either a cj McCollum level guy or a few mid tier guys. The only way they get a star is if dame or beal come out and say “I will only play for Philly”
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
I've seen CJ McCollum be the second best player on a conference finals team.   I agree Ben has more value that CJ straight up but for teams with deep playoff aspirations I think it's totally fair to say Ben hasn't had a ton of value because the only time he's been a useful playoff player was when he was the 4th best player on the team
"And why isn’t it? College is a program that is meant to prepare you with higher education in a particular field that you plan on entering the workforce for.  The NBA is a career for them, so if they’re going to a college for higher education, why wouldn’t college basketball be about teaching them what they need to know to enter the work force?  In fact, I think we should think about centering al their classes around it too. I mean, it’s pretty obvious most of them aren’t actually taking the education seriously and just see it as a means to play, with exceptions like CJ McCollum and Tim Duncan (maybe he didn’t want to but he did it). Guys like Kyrie sure as shit didn’t learn a lick at places like Duke.  Maybe they should have specific courses about finances and business for getting sponsored and rolling into becoming entrepreneurs. With the ability to have a double major or minor or whatever in case they have different interests like CJ and journalism."
i think their best case (realistic) scenario rn is CJ McCollum
&gt; I wouldn’t be expecting a superstar but a CJ Mccollum deal is a non-starter for me. I’d hold onto him and see if a better deal pops up  Good thing you're not a Sixers fan ;)
I wouldn’t be expecting a superstar but a CJ Mccollum deal is a non-starter for me. I’d hold onto him and see if a better deal pops up
"CJ has literally been one of the best 2nd options at guard in the league for the past 5 years. 76ers fans don’t understand that for most teams a 2nd option is not Anthony Davis or James Harden. For most teams the 2nd option is Bojan Bogdanovic, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Jamal Murray, or even Reggie Jackson or RJ Barrett. And out of all of those players CJ is the best scorer AND playmaker you can get."
"Cj Mccollum isnt winning anyone a ring. He would not turn the 6ers into a contender, it’s more likely he’d limit them to a 2nd round exit at best"
Why would he leave? You're saying he'd rather play with noone than CJ McCollum? Cmon lmao.
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"

Batum became really aloof at one point too, by the time he got traded to Charlotte, it was kind of for nothing (sorry, Noah Vonleh).

CJ McCollum and pre-injury Nurkic are better than any teammate KAT has played with (minus Jimothy) ever
"Is he worth 21.25mil per year?   That's basically the right hand man for the franchise player on that team (Lavine)  Lonzo makes decent assists, but isnt a  offensive threat like CJ McCollum"
Yeah because you would've been a 6th seed with:          - Mitchell (20) and Conley (20) being out a bunch.   - Murray (30) missing heaps of games.   - Kawhi (20) and PG (20) missing a lot of games.   - LeBron (30) and AD (40) missing a chunk of the season.  - CJ McCollum (25) missing heaps of time.   - Porzingis (30) missing a big part of the season.     The Warriors weren't the only team to have injury troubles.
"Yeah, Redditors get caught up with their emotions way too much.  He's an above average to good GM.  If Aldridge didn't leave, the Blazers would've had a Top 3 offense/10 defensive team that was on pace to win 60+ games.  And that was before CJ McCollum found his groove.  If you set aside your biases, it's all started when Aldridge left.  At that point, Portland got stuck in that ""too good to tank, not good enough to do anything significant"".  Also, all these complaints about how he can't do any trades....yeah, this guy traded for prime CP3 once upon a time.  Reality is that Portland just never really had assets since they were bare bones the entire time."
I sorta see CJ Mccollum filling that role nicely
"Cedric maxwell, cj McCollum, Ron Harper, jet, Odom, petrovic"
"I'm seeing a lot of clippers names, clip clips looking good. CJ McCollum on 11 attempts a game is wild, he's really killing it."
CJ McCollum
Add Monta Ellis to the list but it’s definitely CJ McCollum as number 1
1. I think the overall 3pt% improvement is due to players perceive the rim better with a static background behind it instead of a wave of fans.   2. The players on this this list with the highest % of 3 pointers -unassisted- are:  1. Zach Lavine (48.8% UA)  2. Mike Conley (41.7 UA) 3. CJ McCollum (39.7% 3PUA) 4. Kevin Durant (38.8% 3PUA) 5. Paul George (35.7% 3PUA)  Lavine really stands out here with almost half of his 3s coming unassisted. CJ’s larger volume also means he’s hitting a higher total amount of unassisted 3s in total (hitting 1.9 per game vs Lavine’s 1.7)  To me these are the most impressive shooters on the list. The ability to spot up from 3 unassisted is the most lethal skill out there and you can feel it when those players have the ball.
Give the Lakers Steph Curry After the LoveFest he and LeBron had at the All-Star Game            Give the Nets Deandre Ayton and CJ McCollum to come off the bench
"Yup, I also floated the idea of a CJ McCollum for Julius Randle trade one time and a bunch of knicks fans came at me saying Randle is ""far better than CJ"" and acting like I just suggested that they trade us their best player for a bench warmer.  It's almost impossible to get any unbiased analysis here"
"CJ McCollum is obviously a very talented basketball player, but a big part of his value is that he never stops running on the court - he often leads the league in miles ran per year (when hes not injured)"
Nephews cant differentiate between flashy ball handling and effective ball handling in the NBA.   Murray's TO rate speaks for itself compared to someone like CJ McCollum.
The same RPM that has CJ McCollum as #2?
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are my two freshly posted player profiles from this week:  Danilo Gallinari: [https://basketballbeacon.com/danilo-gallinari-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/danilo-gallinari-player-profile-stats/)  CJ McCollum: [https://basketballbeacon.com/cj-mccollum-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/cj-mccollum-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks."
&gt; **two** guys from Ohio   CJ Mccollum in shambles.
Cj McCollum is from the 330 as well. I'd definitely count him too.
"I think there are other guys 6'2 and under with good defensive instincts (CP, Brunson, Maxey, Conley, McConnell, Schroeder, etc.)  So while height is a factor in relation to shot contests, idk if it's the biggest factor on defence. In fact, shorter guys with lower centre of gravity may be better suited for on ball defence.   Regardless, as someone mentioned earlier Dame isn't a terrible defender either. But CJ McCollum is bad and it has nothing to do with height. I think the Blazers' success with Trent shows how good they can be with Dame and a plus defensive guard in the backcourt."
"He's also very very underpaid. People are going to be shocked at his contract because they're sleeping. He's not making less than $20 million per year on his next contract IMO, and it's going to shock the hell out of some fans.  Honestly thinking about it... who would I rather have than him at SG in the league? Klay obviously... Smart? Maybe. Luka, if you put him at SG. I dunno, the list is not very long. I would *almost* rather have him at SG than CJ McCollum."
"Michael Carter Williiams won rookie of the year and was drafted behind CJ McCollum. I dont think  half a season is no where close in having the ""information"" to determine who will be better."

"At the moment, he's in between:  Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  **WB**  SGA  Pascal Siakam"
Duncan has the ceiling of Prime Tim Duncan and David Robinson and Tyler is just CJ McCollum or best case a worse Booker
"McCollum is a really fair upside for Herro man, it’s not disrespectful at all.  Last year CJ scored 22 ppg on 54 TS% with 4.4 assists on 37 minutes per game.  This year, Herro’s averaging 16 ppg on ~54 TS% with 3.6 assists on 33 mpg.   That’s a pretty fair progression to expect."
CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum or Big Al Jefferson
"There was a story about it in The Athletic a couple days ago.  &gt; In May of 2020, he checked in on the Portland-area home of his cousin and personal chef, Brandon Johnson, and found him dead on the kitchen floor. Brandon, or Chef B as he was called, was 35. &gt;  &gt; “I stood over his body, man. Like, he was dead. Minutes. I’m standing over his body,” Lillard said. “People don’t know what type of trauma that is, and what that is to have somebody that close to you laid out and you stand over him. Like, I still struggle with that. You know what I mean? Like, I still struggle with that. That’s a battle for me.” &gt;  &gt; That morning, Lillard called teammate CJ McCollum, who was also close to Johnson, and when McCollum arrived, the two cried together in the kitchen.  [Link](https://theathletic.com/2424011/2021/03/03/portland-trailblazers-damian-lillard/)"
Not trying to be disrespectful but in what world is CJ McCollum a superstar? He's never even made an all-star team yet
"I think the rim avoidance thing Im referring to is more about this   2019: 25.2% of his shots at the rim  This year: 11.2%  It's a big drop off. Only a few guards I see who are lead ball handlers/initiators around that level. CJ McCollum, Chris Paul, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell. CP3 is a historic level outlier. CJ is dynamic off the ball as a weapon. Conley I think is a better floor general and passer out of the P/R we dont really think of him as a scoring guard per se. There just alot of plays with Kemba you see him drive and not taking the shot at the rim at the big. It just changes how dangerous a weapon he is and how difficult he is to defend, can focus alot more on just chasing him off the 3 point line. He's still a good weapon and important to that team. I just think the fit issues wouldnt as big a thing if this was the Kemba of 2-3 yrs ago, he would stress the defense in a way it would create alot for others even if its not through his assists per se."
"Argetinian CJ McCollum, don't @me"
"the point i was trying to make was that mccollum had a huge jump but that jump put him right next to his ceiling. as someone that doesn't watch knicks games, i was trying to ask if you thought randle might have an even higher level.   CJ maxed out sub all star, randle has already surprassed that, but can he jump into the fringe mvp tier?"

Literally none of the guys you listed have won rings without substantial help.   None of those guys are winning rings with their 2nd and 3rd best players being CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic.
Blazers fans only care about Dame. I have seen many times that they are disrespecting their own players by saying they are useless or inconsistent. They want to trade CJ McCollum because they think he is the reason of Dame's poor performance.
Someone needs to clip that highlight of Caleb Martin stealing from CJ McCollum and yamming it on him
Never gonna call them anything close to a contender as long as CJ McCollum is the second best player on the team.
Cj McCollum is overrated and Portland will not go anywhere with him as the second best player
That's not the point. I didn't say Steph wasn't an upgrade. I said he wasn't enough of an upgrade to make it worth it. Thompson vs McCollum is a completely different scenario. Klay is a better shooter and a significantly better defender than CJ on top of that.
"Maybe it counts, I agree that people should treat russ like CJ Mccollum"
Bradley Beal Stats: 31/5/5 on 59% TS%  CJ McCollum Stats: 23/4/5 on 57% TS%  The gap between them is pretty big. Saying he has CJ to bail him out doesn’t mean anything when Russ has Beal on his team.

"In a vacuum, Derozan &gt; McCollum, but Idc rather have CJ on my team for his spacing/shooting."
"For me, that award goes to 2016 CJ McCollum. Dude went from 6.8/1.5/1.0/0.7 on .436/.396/.699 shooting, to 20.8/3.2/4.3/1.2 on .448/.417/.827. His MPG more than doubled (15.7 to 34.8), but the jump in scoring volume, while also increasing efficiency, was astonishing.    That said, I get what you’re saying about the improvement Julius has made outside of the story told by the stat sheet. I agree: the jump he has made is remarkable."
"Herro, when he gets in the gym and gets buffer, he will average 22+ efficiently.    So, Herro has CJ McCollum potential, potentially speaking.    GTJ is good, but he is much closer to his ceiling"
"Ain’t gonna be no more layups, not when I’m around - Chris “CJ McCollum” Paul"
Cj McCollum did
"&gt;give Steph another crack at a title  this was a pipe dream the instant Klay's ACL tore...and a fairy tale when his Achilles tore. There's no chance at a title without Klay being the Klay of old. Darting around screens offball &amp; cutting backdoor to provide a top 3 offball threat in the league. Drawing the tougher guard matchup to hide Steph's defensive inadequacies. Having the size to slide up defensively in small ball configurations. Without Klay's athleticism, he can't be the irreplaceable cog in the small ball juggernaut that wins titles. Him and CJ McCollum led the league 1&amp;2 in average miles run per game for like 5 years pre-2019. If Klay can't fly around offball without his usual speed &amp; infinite stamina, do you really think the Warriors could ever challenge the title contenders offensively &amp; defensively? Any title contender would just abuse our backcourt. It's a fairy tale unless you got a senzu bean for Klay or you have a replacement for Klay, which MIN pick &amp; Wiseman could never appeal enough to other teams to give up a player of such talent."
Eventually it will get move to the best defender as a starting guard with the name CJ McCollum on the Portland TrailBlazers
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
Marcus Smart: *On your left*   CJ McCollum: Come on!
Blazers fans will still gonna argue that Dame has no good teammate. I even saw Blazers fans saying that they want the team to trade CJ McCollum because he is the reason of Dame's recent poor performance.
Portland so worried about their bigs getting injured before playoffs... they got CJ McCollum getting them oboards.
Portland so worried about their bigs getting injured before playoffs... they got CJ McCollum getting them oboards.
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"CJ ""Pascal Siakim"" McCollum"
"Cj McCollum: ""I'm a killer Fig."". White cops: ""Now hold on a second sir your license and registrations please"""
"I think CJ McCollum and Chris Paul are probably the two best players in the league at creating easy shots off the dribble. Throw Kawhi in there too, actually.   It’s such an incredibly unique and under appreciated skill in the NBA. To just walk your way into an uncontested 10 foot jump shot in that scenario is crazy. He does it all the time."
"based only on games played so far, i’ll go with   **EAST**   G1: Bradley Beal  G2: Zach Lavine  G3: Malcolm Brogdon  G4: Jaylen Brown  FC1: Joel Embiid  FC2: Giannis Antetokounmpo   FC3: Kevin Durant  FC4: Jayson Tatum  FC5: Domantas Sabonis  FC6: Khris Middleton  WC1: Julius Randle  WC2: Nikola Vucevic   **WEST**  G1: James Harden  G2: Stephen Curry  G3: Damian Lillard  G4: CJ McCollum  FC1: Nikola Jokic  FC2: LeBron James  FC3: Kawhi Leonard  FC4: Paul George  FC5: Anthony Davis   FC6: Brandon Ingram  WC1: Luka Doncic   WC2: DeMar DeRozan  honorable mentions for jerami grant, trae young, collin sexton, tobias harris, gordon hayward, bam adebayo, shai gilgeous-alexander, devin booker, and anyone i forgot"
Never seen CJ McCollum spelled that way before 🤔
"Can't hate, he played a hell of a game tonight and left it all on the floor  I'm disappointed but happier with final shot tonight than the spin fade 18 foot jumper he did yesterday   Good effort, and props to Portland and especially cj McCollum, definitely an all star this year  So clutch"
CJ McCollum is my god
"Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Enes Kanter.  That's half their rotation that are limited to seriously awful defenders.  Hard to get stops with those guys at the point of attack &amp; guarding the rim."
"Does MIP count?   Since Danny Granger won MIP in 2009 every player selected for that award has become an all star except Ryan Anderson, Aaron Brooks and CJ McCollum. I think Aaron Brooks is my pick."
"Hi Duncan, Huge huge fan, as you can tell from my username im also a huge fan of Blazers shooting guard CJ Mccollum who is absolutely crushing it from three this season. As you being the leagues best catch and shoot shooter and one of the best three point shooters in the league, who would you say are the top 5 three point shooters in the league? Not necessarily just spot up but overall ability to make a shot behind the arc whether it be C&amp;S, stepback, side step, wide open, any scenario, just curious on your opinion on this."
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2738681-cj-mccollum-suspended-1-game-for-leaving-bench-in-altercation-vs-suns  This is closer to what AD did in my opinion, and he didn't even walk as far as AD. I don't see how they could reason the 2 should be treated differently."
"While I'm at it, here's who I think for the West:  * Nikola Jokic * Paul George * CJ McCollum * LeBron James * Brandon Ingram * Mikal Bridges * Anthony Davis * DeMar DeRozan * James Harden * Luka Doncic * Steph Curry * Kawhi Leonard"
"People have pretty mixed definitions of the word superstar so before condemning this opinion ill ask;  Giannis level superstar, or CJ McCollum  ""super""star?  Top how much are we talking"
"CJ McCollum  is averaging 28/4/5  while shooting 44% on 11 3PA and this dude has De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and frickin Shai Alexander above him on his list."
"Definitely an interesting question. McCollum looks freaking awesome this season, but Young has the higher ceiling. CJ is currently out scoring Dame, I really don’t see that being the case at the end of the season. Maybe sell CJ high and buy Trae low at this point just based on value"
"Question, based on their performances so far, who would you pick in Fantasy: CJ McCollum or Trae Young?"

"Last season had a lot of players make it for the first time, it seems unlikely to have a bunch more again  But actually projecting, not just based on season so far  West:   Projected: None  Contenders: CJ McCollum, Zion, Murray, Wood  CJ has been playing really well, but I'm not highly confident that at 29 he'll suddenly maintain the kind of shooting he's had so far. Zion has been playing well, but will need to be even better to have a chance, especially with Ingram on his team. Murray has also been playing really well, but guards have a lot of competition and I'm just not sure if it's enough, especially with another better all-star player on his team. Wood has the numbers, and if Harden leaves he has a good chance, but if he's still there I wouldn't bet on it   East:   Projected: Jaylen Brown, Malcolm Brogdon  Jaylen is playing fantastically, and without Kemba I think he'll get a lot of credit. Brogdon is also playing very well on the new Pacers, who are also playing very well. Jaylen is a much more clear pick than Brogdon  Contenders: Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant  I think all three (especially Randle) are playing above their weight at the moment, the Knicks won't maintain anything like the 6th seed, and the Pistons suck. But it is the east and there seem like clear spots to be won, and they all have great 3 number splits so I could easily see at least one of them getting a spot"
"1st off, I'm not someone who is angry at you having an opinion. I'm genuinely interested in your reasoning.   &gt; He and Westbrook are really the only two players I stand up against. They seem to be immune to statistical analysis  And the specific argument I'm taking on is   &gt;He's been a negative asset for over a decade. It's an enormous sample size. It's pretty irrefutable.   I'll be taking the last 7 years including this one.    **Lebron**  Per36--26/8/8  on  52/35/70.   Per100 possessions--116 Offensive Rating   106 Defensive Rating. TS%: 60%.

CJ McCollum for two time most improved player. But Seth Curry should be in the convo for MIP.
"I concur, but have you considered the counterpoint of CJ McCollum?"
CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum
CJ Mccollum if there are injuries ahead of him. He's playing lights out this season.
Like CJ McCollum meets Jordan Clarkson vibes.
Wendell Carter looks like a much uglier CJ McCollum
Lmao imagine thinking a team with CJ mccollum is comparable to a team where the 2nd best playoff scorer is Andre fucking Roberson
By Current Skill 1. Chris Paul 2. Kyle Lowry 3. Kemba Walker 4. Jrue Holiday 5. CJ McCollum  By Contract / Asset Value 1. CJ McCollum 2. Jrue Holiday 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kemba Walker 5. Chris Paul
1. CP3   2. Lowry   3. Kemba   4. Jrue   5. CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum had to change his form too
"Contextually, Rockets were missing half of their team for the first two games and only lost by a couple of points in OT to the Blazers.   CJ McCollum torched the team. Then the team's front court with skinny Wood got manhandled by Jokic.   They beat the Kings twice at home with Harden sitting out the second game after stepping on Wall's foot on an inbounds play.  They lost to the Mavs. Tim Hardaway Jr. torched the team with nine threes.  Harden looked a bit off with his ankle.  Against the Pacers, Brogdan had a career game and the Rockets couldn't play Christian Wood (bruised knee from bumping it in the Mavs game) or House (back spasms).  5 different starting line-ups in 6 games so the teams working out kinks."
"Better,  Are you equally upset with the other players who had “education reform” on their jerseys?  Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum, Marcus Morris, Solomon Hill,  Kent Bazemore, Demar Derozan, Ed Davis, Georges Niang"
"Dolla Dame: You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Karl Anthony Towns and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go five on five with another basketball team, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add CJ McCollum to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 pointer, at 35 feet out, you got a 13 1/3chance of making, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Dlo KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!  So Karl Anthony towns, you take your 13 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning this basketball game. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at this game. See Karl, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you on the court."
"CJ "" My beard looks like Jamals pubes"" McCollum"
He shot a ton of 3s for the era. At his peak he was shooting roughly as many threes a game as CJ McCollum has over his career as a starter.   It’s part of what made Pierce more efficient than a lot of other players at the time. He was also great at the stripe and got there a lot.
Kevin Martin would be like cj McCollum/Collin sexton and Michael redd would be tj warren/Gordon Hayward
"Blazers definitely need to make a big move of some sort... they are the DeRozan Raptors of the west.   Warriors with CJ McCollum (in my opinion the only person GSW should accept from Portland unless they want to tank and take picks) would be better than they are now, although a future lineup with Steph, Klay, and CJ might be a bit overcrowded for guards."
Michael Redd would be right there with Beal/Booker imo. Beal/Booker are probably a bit better than peak Redd but not by a lot.  Martin probably a tier behind them with like CJ McCollum
"I’m from a Muslim country too and alcohol is not as much of a taboo as eating pork, so that doesn’t surprise me.

"Kyrie also has a tendency to avoid contact more often than other point guards.   Drawing fouls is a skill, and something that a player like CJ McCollum has said he was trying to improve at because not being able to draw fouls hurt his overall game"
Yeah so my point is if they are a great midrange shooter say around 48% (which is what CJ Mccollum/Kd is) why can't they be successful without a 3 ball.

"Dame, cj mccollum, nurk, Gary Trent jr, DJJ, roco.  Toss up between Collins, hood and ant.  Can make a case for choosing Collins for the size depth. Choosing Ant for G back role Choosing Hood for his overall ability, but we would have a jam in 2-3."
"He said he models his game on CJ McCollum and Lou Will, and I kinda see it. A bit more size than Lou but CJ is a lofty projection."
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
A CJ McCollum 3 pointer *has gone in more frequently than* a Nurkic free throw. Says nothing about likelihood or probability.  Just nitpicking :)
CJ McCollum is the most underrated bad shot god in tbe modern NBA
"Its been Lowry for a long time for me. Glad he got one. CJ McCollum, ironically Kawhi and George but before same team, Westbrook, Harden, CP3, and Butler. I just realized its funny how many famous players that elite obvious for a lot that I listed, but it made me realize how much of a hater I am to much of the league as well."
"I'm so happy that the Knicks are doing so well right now.  I think we're one of the more 'slept-on' teams for good reason as everyone thinks we're going to be pretty bad but with the way Thibs has been handling everyone, transforming the Knicks into a top defensive team, how he's gotten Julius Randle into doing more than just barreling into offenses and gotten Mitch to control his fouls, RJ slowly blossoming into the Star we all envision.   I'm pretty happy with where the Knicks are at right now.   I'm mostly intrigued at what Immanuel Quickley can be for us. He's picking up fouls and shooting 3s WELL, and when he is on the court, he looks like a great PG akin to a CJ McCollum.   Obi needs to see more on-court action but I like what I see so far and Knox has been steadily improving his shot and defense."
"I'm sorry harden does not have an arguement to being better than curry. Statistically speaking curry is better at everything than harden except assisting and rebounding. And I would say curry is both a better passer and actually a better rebounder. I suppose harden is better at drawing fouls but then those dry up in the playoffs and don't affect curry as badly.   For rebounding Harden often gets the board where his bigs have boxed out and leave it for him like steven Adams did for russ. In terms of gathering loose balls/long rebounds curry is among the best in the league and averages like 7-8 rebounds in the last few finals.   And with passing if harden passes there is generally only enough time left to shoot which means harden is going to have loads of assists. But in terms of passing curry is clearly among the best in the league. His first all-star year he had 8.8 assists and the reason why that went down is because Draymond suddenly became the primary ball handler in the warriors system. It is likely if curry was the primary ball handler on a team with as much spacing as the rockets had curry would average at least 10 assists a game if not more.  In terms of dribbling I think curry's handles are as good as irvings they aren't as flashy but are just as if not more effective. 2016 finals not withstanding due to a knee issue.  In terms of finishing curry I think has the highest percentage at the rim among guards. Harden is a very good finisher just isn't curry.   Midrange shooting has so much variance but curry generally shoots anywhere between 45 and 60% on it harden can't even take a midrange shot.  3pt shooting harden has greater volume and a better stepback but curry has greater efficiency by a mile and it doesn't drop precipitously in the playoffs whether that is due to overall load or tighter and more solid schemes being more effective against harden.  Defensively harden is better on the interior but curry is a much better perimeter defender holding harden to under 40% Fg percentage in the 7 game conference finals. Curry is also a much better off ball defender and is very good at disrupting the passing lanes.  Harden is a great player but he isn't in that tier 1/2 of players. Depending on whether you count lebron as his own tier.  I.e Lebron (Tier 1 guy in terms of winning basketball)   KD, Kawhi, Steph (Number one option on championship team)   Harden, Giannis etc. (Number one option on very good teams - perennial mvp candidates)   Dame, Kyrie etc. (Number 2 option on championship teams, all-nba candidate serious exploitable flaws or no top tier talent in one area maybe just great at lots of things not elite at anything Pandemic P might be a good example although his defence is borderline elite)  From their it is a 2/3 guy with elite D with flaws then borderline all-stars then high end role players (maybe more tiers in between to separate players like wiggins out from CJ Mccollum with CJ being a true bordline all-star and Wiggins being better than a role player)  Some players are awkward to add. Specifically someone like AD who clearly has the talent to be in those top 3 categories but his teams don't really win (lebron not withstanding) he is probably a borderline tier 3/4 guy for me just because his teams haven't really had that much success with him being that guy."

"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
CJ McCollum
"That quote is gonna be like that CJ McCollum ""no more layup"" quote where mfs gonna be pulling it up after every game lol"
You're right. There's a lotta dudes in this league that end up like CJ McCollum where they've got the bag but today's talent is too much.  Shit 30/4/6 didnt get Beal into it last year
How’s Garland can he create more for others? Maybe it can work if Sexton is more of a shooter like CJ McCollum while Garland does more as a passer
"TJ Warren has expanded his game (good call!) but he's a terrific mid-range shooter.  Chris Paul is one of the greatest mid-range shooters I've ever seen.  CJ McCollum, of course, is superb in that range."
Khris Middleton is THE MOST underrated shooter in the NBA and I will die on that hill forever.     EDIT: CJ McCollum is also criminally underrated and always has been.
"I automatically think of CJ McCollum, Demar, Aldridge, and Melo. Prime Melo was probably the best mid range scorer of all time imo"
I single out Luke Walton because he is one of the worst when it comes to this and was very publicly (and rightly) called out by CJ McCollum for it but he’s definitely not alone. It seems counterproductive for coaches/players on the bench to be “wearing masks” throughout the game but constantly letting them slip/pulling them down to have conversations.   Find masks that fit! They make lots that strap over the head so they don’t slip and have supports that allow space between the cloth and your mouth that make it so your speech is easier to understand. But this current practice is sending the wrong message during the literal worst time of the pandemic by some of the most viewed people in the US.

CJ McCollum looks like 2016 Steph right now(obviously won’t last)
"All of those players have either an extra year of experience under their belt, or is Ayton who Collins is just straight up better than. We should be able to tell after this season whether Collins will end up a perennial all-star type player or a CJ McCollum/Mike Conley type of player"
Probably CJ McCollum trade value.
How can Klay Thompson be better than CJ McCollum when he had three players on the team better than himself?
Everyone wanted to see Curry and Lillard duel but this is the CJ McCollum show goddamn
"CJ ""Damian Lillard"" McCollum"
"GM's still haven't learned that lesson either.  Take a look at Brandon Clarke, who fell to #21 last year and then got traded for the #23 pick+a 2nd rounder.  **Brandon Clarke Senior Year Stats** (Technically Junior Redshirt year)  * **Offense**    * 16.9 PPG       * 69.3 eFG%       * 69.9 TS%    * 3.1 ORPG    * 1.5 TO/g * **Defense**    * 3.2 BPG    * 1.2 SPG    * 5.5 DRPG * **Advanced**    * .337 WS/40    * 16.3 BPM    * Fun Fact: As many Blocks as Misses (117 Total)  And when he came to the NBA, he proved that he could take it to the next level.  Last year, Brandon Clarke lead all rookies in WS with 5.0.  His OWS put him in the range of CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Brandon Ingram.  His True Shooting% of 66.3% in his **fucking rookie season** lands him at #5 in the NBA between Jarrett Allen and John Collins.  He's struggling this year, but he'll pick it back up.  I am curious though on when GM's will learn that a college senior does not mean they are weak prospects."
No... A lot of non-point guards score in a very on-ball manner. KD is one such player. Grab the ball at the top of the 3pt line and let him cook. CJ McCollum is another example. Tyler Herro isn't like that. He catches the ball and makes his attack immediately upon the catch or he passes it off. He needs the ball delivered to him in spots he's comfortable playmaking from.
"McCollum is one of the best guys in the NBA at creating his own shot from good fundamentals and shiftiness. He has a much better handle than NAW right now, who can score, but can't really ISO his man into submission like CJ can.  NAW is easily the better defender though"
"For what it's worth Brown was among the next two players I would have listed. Frankly if you believe that Siakam's bad spell of form is more than that you can even put him on the back-end of the top 30.  As mentioned in another reply Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry and CJ McCollum would be included in my 30-40 range. range."
"I never subscribed to this claim. Sabonis was a deserved all-star last season. That being said he's got to keep on performing to really establish himself in the top30. There's some big names in the top 30-40 range.  Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum and others."
I'm surprised more people arent saying CJ Mccollum
CJ McCollum
"Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum, Jordan Clarkson, and Aaron Gordon"
Klay was a top 3 SG for a whole 5 years…he definitely fits under the star category if we’d consider someone like CJ McCollum to be the bar for that
I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
CJ McCollum
"Only realistic players I'm accepting are Fox, CJ McCollum, or Haliburton. Otherwise the trade market will be much more robust during the trade deadline"
"You might call me crazy, but honestly I think this team would be much better off with DeRozan on the bench and McCollum with the starters.    Draymond and Nurkic both are nonshooters, but both are very much plus passers- Draymond just led the league in assists, and Nurkic is top 10 in ast% for bigs, he’s very much a playmaker on the short roll with Dame and him having the best PnR PPP.  Both Lillard and Beal are elite shot creators and ball dominant offensive weapons and facilitators, so they want to have shooters to pass to and spread the floor for them to operate and go to work cooking the defense.    McCollum led the league in 3s before his injury last year, canning 11.7 a game for a while good for 27/6/4 on elite efficiency.  He’s led the league in miles run in several years, which is because he fully embraces his role as the moon to Lillard’s heliocentric sun, and CJ runs and shoots offball to make his star look all the brighter.   Finally, DeRozan has lost a step and is a full time 4 not 3 now, he is no longer a wing but instead a big- if you’re going to lose on defense anyway, which you will tasking DeRozan to chase a wing around, you might as well run triple guard to spread the floor and make up the difference on the offensive end.  Plus with DeRozan off the bench, he’s a playmaker and offensive facilitator at a high level so he can run things off the bench and guys like Simons and Collins will run to the corners while DeRozan facilitates out of the post- he continues the Draymond role very well and lets you continue to have a point forward for the full 48."
"CJ McCollum would make them more serious contenders in the East. They struggle with scoring in crucial situations, especially when Embiid gets doubled. He can get them tough buckets. His defensive liability can be hidden by their other strong defenders."
Philadelphia also understand that D’Angelo Russell and CJ McCollum are not moving the needle at all for their win now window so they need insane picks to justify it.
Gonna feel so good watching Philly get Buddy shield or CJ McCollum 🤤
"On any given play a player could be anyone of the three,also this pretty much only happens during half court situations,because positions definitely don’t matter during transition.  If Jokic sets up in the high post,he’s a post player at that point in time,if he gets a rebound and brings it down the court,he’s a ball handler(I’ll add that ball handler isn’t a great term,because if the reasons you pointed out,a better term would be initiator). If Jokic for some reason spots up in the corner,like if a transition opportunity breaks down and if he finds himself open in the corner,he would be a wing. Also most of the time Jokic operates in the post,whether that’s the high post or out of a screen and move set.  Other examples of players that fit into all three are KD,LeBron,Kobe,and a lot of others.  Many of the all time greats can do all of them,because that’s what makes them all time greats.  Also an easy way of finding out what they would be referred to as(like if it were to replace the 1-5 classifications) in my weird way of positions:  Point Guard:99% of the time would be a ball handler/initiator  Shooting Guard:either a ball handler or a wing. James Harden and CJ McCollum are ball handlers,Klay Thompson is a wing  Small Forward:Could feasibly be all of them,like KD and LeBron  Power forward:Wing or post,Marcus Morris is a wing,Anthony Davis is a post player  Center:99% of the time would be classified as a post player"
Yes you would be insane to think that. No one is trading a 25 dpoy all star for CJ McCollum because he had one bad playoffs
Terry Porter   CJ McCollum   Brandon Roy   LaMarcus Aldridge   Rasheed Wallace
Current- Cj McCollum Past- Lamarcus Aldridge Injured/incomplete- Brandon Roy
"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"
"Yea no shit. Westbrook looked better in Houston cause he was playing next to a better player and a legit #1 option in Harden.  All you’ve said is siakam plays in the paint, as if that  alone means it’s a horrible trade for them. Siakam is still a star that can create his own shot. He’s still a great 2 way player. He’s not just a paint player, that’s just his strength. Simmons was a star next to embiid and he has no range at all outside of the paint. Siakam can still make threes, he has a couple seasons shooting over 36%.   The only good argument you have is that Siakam cannot pass as well Simmons. But I don’t agree at all that Siakam can’t be a better #2 to embiid, especially over Simmons. That’s ridiculous. Siakam is a great 2 way player, and can be efficient again and have more open jump shots next to embiid.   You’re also ignoring all the context of the situation for them. The main thing is they have no leverage and have a star that wants out and only wants to go to Cali.   No shit they’d like a star guard but it’s unlikely for them to get someone way better than Siakam like Beal or lillard. Unless you think even CJ McCollum type is better than Siakam, which is a joke."
CJ McCollum is not a one trick pony
"'When talking to CJ McCollum about winning a championship alongside Kawhi, Lowry responded by saying that Kawhi often rubs people the wrong way because of the way he operates. He will demand the ball in certain situations and go get a bucket, even if other players feel that they were open. While Lowry said this approach rubs some people the wrong way, he implied that there was a level of understanding on that Raptors team that Kawhi was the best player, and they would live and die with the shots he takes. As Lowry put it, ""Big dog gotta eat.""'"
CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum and Nassir Little for Ben Simmons
"CJ McCollum is starting to get forgotten now, I doubt people will remember him in the future"
What does letting him rot prove other than you’d rather be petty than prudent? What return do you get after 4 years of fucking each other over? Hint: it isn’t close to CJ McCollum.
"1) We don't really know what the asking price is.  Everything reported has been conjecture.  2) This team lives and dies through Embiid, not Simmons.  3) At the end of the day Ben is a very positive asset on this team **in the regular season**.  Amazing defender, amazing in transition, amazing playmaker.  He makes everyone around him better and it's not until you play a 7-game series that his flaws get majorly exposed.  Based on that, Morey has an asking price because going below it makes the team worse.  Simmons for CJ McCollum, for example, does not make the 76ers a better team.  So why make that trade?"
"Honestly man. The Simmons fiasco is one that I really don’t have an answer to. And I’m not convinced by any answer I’ve seen, whether from pro analysts or fellow nephews on here.   There’s almost not a single trade that makes sense. The only one I can think of that is somewhat okay is Ben for Dame. Works for both teams. Sixers would have to add more or get a third team in. But it just doesn’t seem doable.   Ben for CJ McCollum doesn’t really help because Dame and Ben as team mates just is no good. Cos Simmons playing off ball….. literally a poor mans Andre Roberson on offense without the ball.   Ben to Wolves. In theory is cool but they wanna keep their current 3 stars together. Which isn’t possible. You’re not getting Ben Simmons for a couple of role players and a pick. Especially for a team in a title window.   Sacramento apparently (I forgot the source so it could be wrong) has a deal for the Sixers possibly round Hield, Halliburton and a role player I’m not sure of. For the Sixers. That’s a “fuck yes” deal you’d jump At. But if Hield is traded and you’ve got Simmons going to Sac town. Who is gonna shoot jumpers on that team. From floor to ceiling, without Buddy there’s no shooting.   Ben to Raps, just seems not doable. They drafted Barnes for a reason and def wouldn’t throw Siakam to Philly even though that’s prob be awesome for Embiid.   Three or four team deal surely has to be done. But with money and draft capital etc. I just don’t see a team bar OKC being able to facilitate something that helps Philly get their guys and the other team get Ben whilst OKC just met all the picks and expiring role players"
Kawhi better passing  Brook Lopez perimeter defense  Morant and Fox 3 point shooting  CJ McCollum perimeter defense
"CJ McCollum has averaged 28.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.0 rebounds in 33 games without Damian Lillard in his career."
This should all end with a swap for CJ McCollum and like a second round pick.  PDX and Philly are the two teams that really shouldn't just run it back next season.
CJ McCollum say he tryin Jennifer!!
"Kuzma, Bertans, KCP, and picks might be better than the Timberwolves' offer. It's a shit offer for Simmons, but it's three real players who can all shoot on good looks. KCP and Kuzma defend well. Bertans and KCP shoot really well. The ball-handling would be lacking, but it's always going to be if you aren't trading Simmons for another star. The problem with this idea is that McCollum is a better option for the 76ers and I doubt the Blazers turn down CJ plus stuff for Simmons."
"Well then the trade won’t happen because you don’t see teams like the Timberwolves offering multiple first rounders and good young players for CJ Mccollum… if you want Ben and Dame, you’re giving up picks or other players with CJ."
"What do the blazers think theyre going to do regardless? Another first round exit? This is the type of move you make after countless playoff failures because of your defense (main culprits dame, mccollum, etc...) and also your inconsistent offense in playoff series (dame, mccollum, again). Dame is gone next year regardless if theres not a steep improvement so idk whats stopping both teams from making the ben for cj move."
For as much shit as CJ gets he immediately makes Philly better. A guard rotation of Maxey/McCollum/Curry/Green plus maybe Nas Little if Portland includes him in the package is a pretty damn good amount of shooting
"Words matter. A source stating that Simmons doesn’t want to play in Portland is different than Simmons or Rich Paul stating it themselves.   The Sixers aren’t begging for CJ McCollum. They arguably have a better deal available in Malcom Brogdon anyways since he is a much more capable PG than CJ is.   I’m not acting like Portland is begging for Ben Simmons right now, I’m acting like CJ McCollum doesnt move the needle for the Sixers and I could make the argument that it makes them significantly worse defensively and marginally better offensively. CJ is a significantly better offensive player than Ben but is a significantly worse distributor. Any additional offense you might get from him over Ben is negated by a Seth Curry, CJ McCollum backcourt. If Dame and CJ got torched as often as they did, Seth and CJ are gonna be COOKED."
What they don’t realize if they keep this up they might only be getting CJ Elleby and not McCollum.
"CJ, Wiggins, or Hield are the best realistic centerpieces out there. You can’t just get back some developing guys and some picks if you’re trying to win now.  And I know that, in a vacuum, none of those guys are improvements on Simmons, but they’re definitely better fits and way more useful in the playoffs. I’d give an Embiid/Harris/Green/Curry/McCollum lineup at least even odds against any lineup in the East, especially when you’d have Shake, Maxey, and Thybulle on the bench."
CJ MCcollum
Would they really rather have that package over a CJ McCollum in the middle of his prime? Lmao they need to win now
"The point is that the Dame/CJ/Powell trio being outscored and bad in the playoffs is false, and in general, the starting unit graded out very well.    Powell and McCollum have bad net ratings in part because Dame was attached at the hip to Nurkic in his minutes generally whereas when Dame sat, McCollum and Powell were expected to run the bench offense and they were with Melo/Kanter units which sunk the defense, as well as guys like Simons who was somewhat of a turnstile.    If you look at the series overall, the starters look good together while the bench looks bad, I’m not saying McCollum and Powell played great, obviously they played down from their abilities and diminished performances whereas Dame elevated, but overall the trio of guards generates elite offense and can indeed be part of a solid defense."
Keeping Simmons on the roster is a better option than trading him for CJ McCollum.
"Best they can get for him is probably CJ McCollum. A few years ago that would have been preposterous, considering what people thought was simmon’s “potential”."
"CJ McCollum for sure. With Embiid as the centerpiece, give me all of the lights out 3 point shooters I can get."
"He might not even be on the table for you guys, so there's that. Neil Olshey loves him some CJ McCollum. I'm not sure who else you can go for at this point, but I guess enjoy waiting on Beal and Dame to request trades to Philly?"
If there is no better talent/fit than CJ fucking McCollum then there is absolutely no reason for the Sixers to trade Ben.
"That would be CJ, no?   [A 28/5/6 line without Dame warrants he can play point just fine] (https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/cj-mccollum-stats-without-damian-lilliard)."
It doesn’t matter. r/nba thinks CJ is a better offensive player than Simmons and the money can work so they are going to say he can run the point when asked but everyone knows a team that has McCollum as their starting PG isn’t any better than running back the core Sixers roster from last year.
Ben Simmons if he performs like last you is a down grade from cj McCollum
"Keeping Ben would kill their entire season, and it could get so bad that their thirst for Dame ends their whole franchise like Dame ended OKC. The curse of Hinkie ain’t going away until they sacrifice Ben Simmons, for their savior, CJ McCollum."
"My problem with acquiring Ben Simmons is that due to spacing you really don’t want Simmons and Nurkic to share the floor, and Nurkic is sneakily great value for his contract and how readily he’s accepted his role in Portland.    Specifically, PDX was atop the league in pick and roll efficiency, in part because of the two man game with Dame and Nurkic.  Not only that, but Nurkic as a defensive anchor transforms the Blazers from bottom of the league to above average, his impact his massive and would be a causality of the acquisition because Dame needs a spread PnR system and Simmons as a non shooter will clog the lane and cause Dame to be trapped and doubled even more aggressively than he already is, unless Simmons plays the role of small ball 5- which unfortunately he hasn’t shown a willingness to be that Draymond type, no matter how much in theory his skillset might suit such a role.    As a Blazers fan, I’d rather hope CJ can return to his pre-injury form and we get more out of Nurkic, with a significantly improved bench and some continuity with Powell et al fully incorporated into our system.    The Blazers starters were a top 5 offense and a top 10 defense with Nurkic, the problem was our horrendous defense off the bench with Melo and Kanter- and due to injury they saw a lot of minutes and cratered the defense.    Powell/RoCo/Nurkic is a solidly respectable defensive frontcourt, with Snell/Nance/Zeller providing a more stout bench defense that can fill the rotation minutes and stop the sieve of leaking points.    Afernee Simons and Nas Little are both promising young players as well, Simons became a deadly sniper with work, and Little flashed versatile wing potential, so the question is if they can take that next step into difference makers.    Do I expect Simmons to get over his yips and suddenly start shooting?   Not really, and his at the line percentages aren’t indicative that even if he did start taking looks he’d convert them at a desirable rate.    Do I expect McCollum to continue the evolution of his game moving his shot diet beyond the arc when he was leading the league with 14 threes a game and putting up 27/6/4?   He might not do it on such incredible efficiency but the intentional changes to his playstyle should persist."
CJ McCollum maybe? Averaged a cool 4.7 assists and only 1.4 turnovers a game but people always complain about his ball hogging.
"Lonzo  CJ McCollum  LeBron  Covington   Clint Capela   Bench: PatBev, Huerter, Ibaka"
you gotta throw a cj mccollum on the o team or something
"Timberwolves fans got this. Warriors got Draymond so no, now Kings saying no. Unless the Blazers leak a crazy CJ McCollum  training video where he can dunk from the logo, this man is headed to Minnesota."
"&gt;Whether or not the trade should be made is based almost entirely on whether the team construct makes sense after the trade goes through.  That's not true? There are a ton of trades that make sense team construct-wise that don't make sense from a value perspective.   CJ McCollum for Simmons makes sense for Philly from a team construct perspective, but it's a bad trade."
"4 Team Trade  Minnesota Out: Malik Beasley, Beverley, McDaniels, three 1st round picks  Minnesota In: Ben Simmons   Sixers Out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: CJ McCollum, McDaniels, 1x Timberwolves 1st round pick  Blazers Out: CJ McCollum  Blazers In: Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons Out: Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons In: Patrick Beverley, 2x Timberwolves first round picks"
Tbf Dame had to beat the 73-9 and KD Warriors in 16/17 with only the real help of CJ McCollum. There was no chance
&gt;Fultz always seemed like a premium version of CJ McCollum  I don’t agree with that simply because Fultz was projected to have a lot of defensive upside coming out of the draft. 6’5 point guard with a 6’11 wingspan who had lots of highlight defensive plays.   CJ’s biggest problem is that he isn’t a good enough playmaker to be a point guard but he isn’t big enough to play shooting guard. Fultz didn’t have either of those issues
"These are the two things I've gathered.  * Fultz was apparently involved in a motorcycle accident that resulted in nerve damage. This is almost certainly a contract clause, and it makes everything appear worse.  * He was never as good of a shooter as advertised and simply had a good shooting year  at Washington.  Even without the yips, I don't think there's a scenario where he's better than Tatum. Fultz always seemed like a premium version of CJ McCollum."
Terrance Mann and Marqueese Morris  OR  Hield. Barnes and two unprotected 1s  OR  CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum is probably your best deal to target. Simmons then has to commit to being the Clippers Blake Griffin-Esque PF for the Blazers. Cos a starting lineup of Dame/Powell/Covington/Ben/Nurk with Simons and Nance off the pine really ain’t half bad
I think it’ll be one of these three.   CJ McCollum   Tyrese Halliburton and Buddy Heild   DLo Russell   And Maxey and Simmons back at the best.
They have no other options. CJ McCollum? LOL.
Huge overpay by Washington if they do this. Beal is on another level. Simmons for CJ McCollum (or a player of his caliber) seems very fair.
"&gt; Like if the best we could get is Bagley, Hield and picks  it's not; his return is probably higher than what reddit thinks, but lower than what morey wants. i'm a portland fan so obviously take this with a grain of salt, but you could literally get cj mccollum, another player or two plus however many picks  we can trade (which can also be flipped) to improve. cj as an actual lead guard (point guard) can give you most likely a consistent 23/3/5. i think even minnesota can attach multiple picks alone with guys like bev (once he reaches his tradeable date) and beasley?  &gt;  I would be fine letting it drag out and not paying him.   so you want to show to embiid (who just locked down long-term guaranteed money aka he's comfortable) an unwillingness to compete to spite ben simmons for a year or two? again, look at ben simmons/anthony davis/paul george/ any other max star that wanted to be traded, etc. we've seen how insignificant signing these deals are to them to reaching that goal if they want out? i get he's been playing tennis with morey, but i've also watched dame spit ""loyalty"" for nine years just to have this off-season come about.  &gt; We’re a first or second round exit either way   your ceiling sans simmons is a first round exit max, not sure why second round is added lol you lack a significant primary ball hander if he decides to not actually suit up unless tyrese maxey turns into an league leading assist leader.  the same 6ers fans that are saying ""let ben sit and fine him"" are the ones who are saying portland would be idiotic to do the exact same thign with dame.  &gt; I’m fine giving Nerlens lawyers more evidence to use against Rich Paul.  also wouldn't do shit. one person is saying ""he didn't have my best interest in mind"" while other top nba talents (lavine) continue to sign to him lol"
"I actually do think Blazers take Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, 2 1sts for CJ McCollum, CJ's overpaid because he's forced to take a reduced role and they paid him for his talent level, which is greater than his role. Malik does 80% of CJ at 50% of the cost, for two more years then a team option, off ball. Taurean Prince is a feasibly switchable rotation player who gives you mildly efficient but not super productive play on both sides of the ball.   If you throw Naz Reid into the mix then you have a super young but productive backup big who is on a &lt;1st Round contract."
But will Neil fucking Olshey part with CJ McCollum. Please Neil. Do it.
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
"&gt; CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Bruh. Wat. No. We would never do this. If anything, CJ straight up, but even then, we shouldn't. Young Socialite doesn't want to play here. He isn't worth the bad chemistry."
So... Brogdon and a 1st? CJ McCollum? I'm good with rejecting those offers.
"Its very possible Simmons is better than any pieces they get back.  Do you think trading Simmons for CJ McCollum is better ""for Embiids prime""?  CJ would be such a massive downgrade on defense the team would be worse come playoff time."
Then Philly can expect a CJ McCollum or Brogdon type player as their best potential return for Simmons’ straight up
Y’all aren’t getting dame or fox at this point   If you want a guard CJ McCollum is the best you’re gonna get
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I’m still acting as if he’s a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
"Ben was never getting dealt for a superstar after last year’s playoffs, it wasn’t going to matter how well he came out and played in the regular season.   Morey was always going to either settle for CJ McCollum or as many picks as he can get from some team desperate to squeeze into the playoffs. This request really doesn’t change anything"
"&gt;  &gt; Sources: Ben Simmons tells team brass he no longer wants to be a Sixer and does not intend to report to training camp &gt;  &gt; Keith Pompey August 31, 2021 &gt;  &gt; Ben Simmons let it be known that he wants out. &gt;  &gt; In a meeting with the 76ers last week in Los Angeles, Simmons told team co-managing partner Josh Harris, president of basketball operations Daryl Morey, general manager Elton Brand and coach Doc Rivers that he no longer wants to remain a Sixer, according to multiple sources. &gt;  &gt; Sources said the three-time All-Star also does not intend to report to training camp. &gt;  &gt; For the second time since December, the Sixers are unsuccessfully trying to trade Simmons, whose trade value has diminished. At the beginning of this past season, they tried to send him to the Houston Rockets in exchange for James Harden. The Rockets ultimately traded Harden to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 11. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers are having a tough time finding a team to meet their lofty trade demands. &gt;  &gt; The organization does not want to trade Simmons for less than what it believes is fair market value. The four told Simmons they wanted him to report to the start of training camp on Sept. 28 and be a part of the team. &gt;  &gt; The source said, however, the Sixers’ inability to get fair market value isn’t Simmons’ fault. &gt;  &gt; Another source said there’s no shortage of teams still interested, but the problem is Morey is demanding a king’s ransom. &gt;  &gt; Simmons is fully aware the Sixers can fine him for holding out and failing to show up to training camp. But a source said money will not play a role in the decision-making for Simmons, who has four years and $147 million remaining on his deal. &gt;  &gt; Plus, fining Simmons could strain the Sixers’ relationship with his super agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. Paul has a who’s who of clients — players the Sixers might be interested in pursuing down the road in free agency. &gt;  &gt; When asked specifically whether he thought Simmons would come back at all, a source responded “no,” resolutely. &gt;  &gt; None of this should come as a surprise. &gt;  &gt; As The Inquirer noted on July 26, if Simmons really wants out, he could opt to be disruptive or not show up for training camp. The tactic has worked for many elite professional athletes across sports who want to be traded. &gt;  &gt; On Aug. 9, ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins said Simmons is willing to hold out of training camp as long as it takes to get traded. &gt;  &gt; Time will tell if the 25-year-old reports and/or if the team avoids what is bound to be a circus-like atmosphere by trading him in the weeks leading up to camp. &gt;  &gt; The belief around the league is the Sixers have been holding out for six-time All-NBA point guard Damian Lillard to request a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. But Lillard said, “I’m not leaving [Portland] — not right now at least” on Wednesday during an Instagram Live stream. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers’ best consolation could be circling back to the Blazers for a potential deal involving shooting guard CJ McCollum before the start of training camp. That trade would make sense for both teams. &gt;  &gt; In addition to fulfilling needs, the players have similar salaries. Simmons will make $33 million next season, while McCollum will receive $30.8 million. &gt;  &gt; The problem is both teams might think they should get more in return. &gt;  &gt; McCollum, 29, has averaged 18.9 points while shooting 38.9% on 3-pointers in 528 career games with 431 starts. However, the eight-year veteran out of Lehigh is not an All-Star after years of playing in the tough Western Conference. &gt;  &gt; Even still, he could be the best option and a good pickup right before training camp with all things considered. &gt;  &gt; League sources believe the Sixers will have a tough time getting what they perceive as fair market value under the circumstances. &gt;  &gt; “Think about three months ago when the Sixers are willing to give up Ben Simmons. You are like, ‘Let’s see what we have to do to get him,’” said a Western Conference executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Now, the difference is Ben Simmons says he refuses to play for the Sixers. He wants to go to three California teams. There’s so much bad blood between him and the team.” &gt;  &gt; The executive said teams are not willing to give in to the Sixers’ steep asking price knowing they have to move Simmons. &gt;  &gt; “The kid said he’s not going back,” the executive said. “I’m not giving you what you’re demanding. They really messed this up.” &gt;  &gt; A source believes the devaluing of Simmons began with Rivers’ postgame comments following the Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals on June 20. &gt;  &gt; That’s when the coach, who has been one of Simmons’ biggest supporters and defenders, was asked by The Inquirer’s David Murphy if the standout is still capable of being a point guard on a championship-caliber team. &gt;  &gt; “I don’t know the answer to that right now,” Rivers responded on a night when Simmons finished with five points, 13 assists, eight rebounds and was sidelined the final 40 seconds of the 103-96 loss. &gt;  &gt; He attempted just four shots, making two. For the fourth straight game, Simmons did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter. He played timid, appearing fearful to go to the foul line. &gt;  &gt; That became apparent with 3 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and the Sixers trailing, 88-86. He drove to the basket past Danilo Gallinari, but passed up an open dunk underneath the basket, dishing the ball to Matisse Thybulle, who was fouled by John Collins. Thybulle made one of two free throws. &gt;  &gt; The day after wavering, Rivers did say that Simmons is salvageable. He said the Sixers would put together the right type of offseason workout plan to help correct Simmons’ shooting deficiencies. But a source said Simmons has not participated in a Sixers offseason workout plan. &gt;  &gt; The source believes it will be tough for Simmons to have a working relationship with the team moving forward. At the same time, the team isn’t trying to let their multifaceted player go for little in return. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers would definitely have a lot of holes to fill by getting rid of Simmons. &gt;  &gt; In addition to being the point guard, Simmons is a two-time NBA All-Defensive player, a third-team All-NBA selection, a small-ball center and reserve power forward. &gt;  &gt; Can one envision Simmons returning to the Sixers for two months just to raise his trade value? And with all the heat he’ll likely receive from Sixers fans, he might benefit from a change of scenery."
"So from what I gather. 43% outside the paint for a center who was only just allowed to take jump shots this season, is not good to you. That’s already better than the majority of centers in the nba now. The problem is your comparing it Cj McCollum or curry levels of mid range efficiency. He’s a center."
Or how slow our pace was...  I'm still surprised it's not CJ McCollum.  I've never thought of Durant as a Griz Killer.
cj mccollum can get hot randomly. he can put up a 30 ball when he wants. klay thompson can put up ridiculous scoring games. does that mean that dame and steph aren’t the #1 options?  kd is better. he gets the best defender put on him.
"Of course, that’s because Portland has way better shot makers. The warriors generated high quality shots consistently, role players just couldn’t capitalize and that’s something that steph curry cant control. Blazers on the other have had CJ Mccollum, GTJ, Melo, Powell etc.   The Warriors had Andrew Wiggins as the second best 3 point shooter and scorer on the team. I like Wiggins but that ain’t gonna work  While the defense was very good, you cant have that bad of an offense in the modern NBA. Hell if it wasn’t for Curry, the warriors might be one of the worst offensive teams of the last two seasons"
"Maybe so, but he’s got 3 years of rookie contract left and the team doesn’t plan on winning in the next couple of years. Much better to keep the young guy with solid potential when adding cj would only lead them to being maybe fighting for a play in spot. If anything and they felt they needed to move sexton I don’t think they would trade for someone like McCollum I think they would go after a young piece and 1st rounder(s)"
"I also  don't think they will, and this is why a Ben trade will be nearly impossible to conclude. On his own, maybe a straight swap Ben for CJ makes sense, but I'm 100% sure Morey will ask for more. Asking for more than a #2 will require one of the two, which he won't allow. The other party will hardly be tempted to add another role player with just Ben going, and, if anything, I think Morey would ask for a FRP AND Nance as well as McCollum.  Ben for CJ makes sense for both teams in my head. If Morey wants to add another piece that will help them on 20mpg basis, one of the two should go. Ben for Beal makes no sense. Ben for Dame, unless he is bribing a 3rd team to throw in FRPs and players for nothing in return, also makes no sense."
"I honestly think the best package for both parties would be CJ McCollum and Nance for Simmons and Thybulle/Maxey. It would be bittersweet for both teams, but this is the closest of a middle ground that I can think for any team in the NBA. Portland gets a lockdown defender (which he is. Simmons is a perennial DPOY candidate) 1-4 and a prospect, Philly gets an all-around shooter and a plug and play PF.   Morey won't be able to trade him for Dame or Beal, but he should not accept a package around Cam Reddish."
How has no one said CJ McCollum
"If I'm Cleveland, I'm looking to do what the Lakers did a few years ago with Mozgov but with KLove and packaging him with Sexton or Garland for CJ McCollum. You may ask why Portland would do that, but it's only a matter of time before Lillard asks out and this would start the rebuild.  For Cleveland, they get an established guard in McCollum and clear up their logjam with bigs."
"Bradley Beal, in my opinion, should be lower. Putting him at No. 2 because he scores 30 / night seems unfair to guys that actually impact winning, consistently   1. Harden 2. Mitchell 3. George (technically a 3, but plays 2 next to Leonard) 4. Brown 5. Booker 6. Beal 7. Lavine 8. McCollum (I want CJ to be higher but I feel like he is carried a bit by Dame)  If Klay was healthy I'd have him above Beal"
"Domantas Sabonis went to HS with my sisters, so I got to meet him and his dad Arvydas.  Really quiet but nice, I’m happy to see him succeed.     Allen Crabbe would get his nails done with his GF, super laid back and friendly guy who didn’t mind chatting and shooting the shit talking ball.    Noah Vonleh was really bashful and didn’t mind talking but you could tell he was not a people person haha, came off just kind of shy.    CJ McCollum is really friendly and always has time for anyone, I met him a few times and even though I was the “help” he was always so nice and made me laugh.    Terry Stotts is also super nice, I remember one time he and CJ were watching an ESPN segment at the practice facility that started commenting on the Blazers about how Dame said this or that, which had Stotts and CJ laughing because it was clearly false.    My favorite though was waiting in the Atlanta airport when suddenly I hear in a booming Cookie Monster voice “I HAVE ARRIVED!” and turning around I realize it’s Dikembe Mutumbo at the ticket counter, announcing his presence with a beaming grin on his face.  It was hilarious, and it started a trend in my family where we would imitate that dramatic entrance- there is something incredible about announcing yourself when you walk into a room haha!"
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum
cj mccollum is not and has never been better than klay thompson
"You’re missing the point. This man could have obviously flourished if he was a second or third scoring option on any team, and he could hit clutch buckets as well as anybody in the league at the time. He was a primetime player that had his knees cut out from under him because of my main point: being Asian.   When another guard like Patty Mills or CJ McCollum get hot, they are given the green light to take over when the first options aren’t scoring. When Lin got hot, he was criticized for stepping up beyond the fad of “who is this Asian American player knocking down big time shots and scoring for four straight possessions in a stagnant offense?”   At the very least he should have received the respect that he could knock down tough shots when the offense wasn’t clicking. Instead he was relegated to garbage time where he made the most of his opportunities and was criticized as someone who couldn’t accept a traditional defend/pass-first/spot up 3 point guard role despite his (proven) ability to penetrate as well as anybody in the league at the time as well as knock down jumpers."
"PG: Alex Caruso ($1)  SG: CJ McCollum ($3)  SF: Pippen ($3)  PF: Dennis Rodman ($3)  C: AD ($5)  &amp;#x200B;  You got 3 guys who can act as a playmaker, the primary scorer in CJ and AD, an insane defensive team with AD/Rodman/Pippen/Caruso, solid outside shooting with Rodman as the only clear negative on shooting. Incredible rebounding, just winning with defense."
"Simmons, CJ McCollum, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, Andre Drummond is a great line up for philly, good trade.  We can make up dumb trash ass trades too."
That series was the epitome of schadenfreude. Blazzers talked shit and then proceeded to get their ass swept by a lower seed. How CJ McCollum was able to show his face after that I don't know.
"I think the Warriors should try to avoid this risk all-together by packaging Klay in a trade for Dame or Beal. Or if those two don’t work, CJ McCollum. Just too many variables right now around Klay but he does still have some trade value right now."
McCollum has pretty much always been one of the blazers weak links on defense.  You’re right Middleton shouldn’t be in the conversation for all defense but just being above average on defense which I think khris is is enough to be significantly better than Cj on defense.  Add on khris scores as well as cj by volume even though Cj puts up 22ppg to khris 20 as Cj plays 35mpg+ some years while bud load manages his guys a lot.  Cj has never come close to khris’ efficiency last year and was average efficiency wise til this season where he missed half the year(means we’re not confident he can keep it up next year)
Actually they are as close to even as you can get based on career numbers and that INCLUDES the playoffs.   [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/middlkh01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/middlkh01.html)  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html)  Obviously there is recency bias from everyone.   CJ dropped 37 in the biggest game for Blazer this century to get them to WCF 2019 while Dame was going 3-18 but that is now lost to everyone memory. McCollum can ball out.
I mean Larry nance is solid but there’s no way it would take CJ McCollum to get him
"“I broke my back,Spinal” - CJ McCollum quoting Mike Tyson"
"Lankier, athletic version of CJ McCollum.  Legit 3 level scorer with a propensity for tunnel vision."
That guy isn't the longterm solution. Monte Ellis/ CJ McCollum 2 guards aren't to built around.
This opens the way for a Philli Portland deal. Simmons for CJ McCollum and Larry Nance Jr
Curry and CJ McCollum typically are league leaders in most miles run per game. CJ has led it three different times. Guarding him and Curry must be exhausting. They never stop moving.
"You could probably get Wiseman, Wiggins and a first out of him  maybe Ben Simmons   D Lo and two firsts   Buddy Hield and a few firsts   CJ McCollum and a few firsts"
Roy/CJ McCollum
I really want CJ McCollum to not be the 2nd best player Dame has played with in his career
"Trying it right now, right off the top of the head  Dallas: Luka; Denver: Jokic: Houston: Harden: Clippers: Blake Griffin; Lakers: LeBron; Memphis: Ja Morant; Minnesota: KAT; New Orleans: Anthony Davis; OKC: Kevin Durant; Phoenix: Devin Booker; Portland; CJ McCollum; Sacramento: DeMarcus Cousins; Spurs: Tim Duncan; Utah: Donovan Mitchell  Atlanta: Trae Young; Boston: Jayson Tatum; Brooklyn: Kyrie Irving; Charlotte: Gordon Hayward; Chicago: Derrick Rose; Cleveland: LeBron James; Detroit: Ben Gordon; Indiana: CJ Miles; Miami: LeBron James; Milwaukee: Giannis Antetokounmpo; New York: Carmelo Anthiny; Orlando: Mo Bamba; Philadelphia: Ben Simmons; Toronto: Kyle Lowry: Washington: John Wall"
He'll get traded to a decent tier playoff team probably. The Portland Traiblazers for CJ McCollum and first round picks. The Mavs for Porzingis and picks. Those are two teams that need his skillset
"Facu also nutmeggs players, ask CJ Mccollum 😂"
CJ McCollum
RIP cj mccollum
"Yeah, maybe a flagrant was too much but CJ clearly tried to hit him with his shoulders.  Overall stupid decision by McCollum."
CJ McCollum got a flagrant for that soft ass shove
if cj mccollum was on the heat people would call for his head for pushing
CJ McCollum scored the quietest 21 points and shot the quietest 75% FG percentage I’ve ever seen
"""CJ McCollum was on twitter saying Draymond gonna be traded to the Blazers not knowing he's gonna be part of the package deal."" lmfao"
future 6moty cj mccollum fuckin up rn
this lineup for portland simply has no hope defensively. CJ mccollum might be the best defender out there right now for portland
CJ McCollum is just D1 Jaleel White
"woooo, let’s go Norman Powell and CJ McCollum. they coming in clutch for us rn"
"Oh yeah CJ McCollum is playing tonight, I almost forgot."
"I don’t like the KCP on Booker matchup honestly. I’d rather have Caruso on him. KCP’s best used on off-ball guys who catch and shoot off screens. In iso he’s meh, especially against stronger dudes. Caruso won’t guard Booker 37 minutes a game so KCP on Booker is inevitable but I don’t love the matchup. I’d almost rather see Kuz on him. Kuz was awesome on CJ McCollum last year for 4/5 games. He’s vulnerable to speed but Booker isn’t a blow-by guy and Kuz could bother his shots."
Lou Will and CJ McCollum are his favorite players
we'll give you cj mccollum
"Never forget cj McCollum got benched for a regular season game after taking a step into the court during a preseason game, but LeBron violated covid protocol and didn't get suspended then went full blown drama queen"
"A couple years ago in the Blazers 4 OT game against Denver CJ McCollum had 41 points on 39 shots and everyone that watched that game knew the Blazers needed him pumping up those shots. Playoff defense is so tight and guys were so tired to just have a guy that can continue to pump up quality looks was absolutely vital.  Obviously that type of efficiency every game wouldn't be good, but playoff games can turn into such a grind you can't really just look at the shooting stats in the same lens as a regular season game"
"Am I the only one that feels like the Blazers may be seriously underrated? I know they have had defensive issues, but Dame is a top 8 player in the world and the most clutch player in the NBA, CJ McCollum is a top 30 player, RoCo is one of the best team defender 3 and D guys around, and Nurk will forever be underrated. Plus Simons hitting 3s, Norman Powell being efficient as a scorer and Carmelo creating shots and roasting bench players. Plus a ton of playoff experience and solid coaching. I really like this team...."
CJ McCollum is so fucking Garbage defensively
First technical odds:  +120 CJ McCollum +130 Carmelo Anthony +200 Campazzo +250 Jusuf Nurkic +320 Paul Millsap +400 Nikola Jokic
"Am I the only one who thinks CJ McCollum looks like he could fit in perfectly in a TV show like Fresh prince or Thats so Raven, etc? He just has that face for it."
Jokic is just absolute barbecue chicken on defence anytime he steps foot out of the paint. It was almost comical how easily CJ McCollum blew by him.
"McCollum is a bad defender, the only benefit to the Bucks would be that CJ is a competent to good ball handler and distributor, especially from the 2 spot. And you would be able to hide him being undersized with Giannis. CJ also has a much better handle than Middleton IMo. But Middleton next to Dane would probably bring down his defensive ability. Giannis makes everyone a better defender."
"I don't watch the Blazers, but I feel like Middleton is simply a better McCollum. Khris is a plus defender, CJ is more iffy, I feel like Middleton is consistently an All-Star (or at that level), and would've made third team All-NBA if he hadn't split votes between G and F last year."
Bigger CJ McCollum
they need to give up something. warriors would probably hang up the phone unless the deal includes cj mccollum.
Chef Curry breaking his ass trying to catch Beal in the playoffs LOL No excuses Allen Iverson beat the Raptors in the ECF with a broken ass and then he went on to play all games in the finals. Hell even CJ Mccollum was playing with a hurt ass last year. No excuses for Curry LMAO Bazemore trying to save Curry's legacy hahaha
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
"Although to me it's weird to say that about a team with CJ McCollum.  He can figure out one of the wings, at least"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"We are relatively healthy and appear to be peaking at the right time, which is different from many previous years. We've settled on a three-guard lineup and a solid eight-man rotation. It would be nice to have a taller, reliable SF in the group, but this is what we have. We are known for good player leadership and chemistry.   Having a fit Nurkic is going to make a difference in the playoffs. He has turned us from a poor defensive team to an adequate-to-good one. He will split time with Kanter, who, despite his defensive limitations, is a rebounding machine with an excellent touch around the basket. We like to bring them out high to run the pick and roll.  Each player (except the centers) in the rotation is a high-volume three-point threat. Three of them, Lillard, McCollum, and Anthony, are superb in isolation plays. I know it's not fashionable to say so, but when you absolutely, positively need someone to put the ball in the basket, it's nice to know at least two of these players will be on the court.  It's been a year of ups and downs. Lacking Nurk and CJ for much of the year, having Dame playing with nagging injuries, and the late addition of Norm Powell means we don't really know how good we can be. We certainly deserve to be in the playoffs, but who knows how far we will go? Lately, we have been blowing out poor teams and playing close or winning with good ones. But we haven't had many signature wins. Still, we could surprise people."
&gt; CJ “zig zag vertebrae” McCollum  oh shit I'm dying 😂
Tobias Harris  dude is 28 and been a liability every playoff series he’s been in but people on this sub act like he’s better than CJ McCollum because Tobias is taller lol
Tbh I think he is honestly hyping them up because he wants a good series with no bad blood  Last year he had to deal with the league Chihuahua Patrick Beverley being all sorts of annoying + playing with CJ “zig zag vertebrae” McCollum and Nurkic was still getting back to form  This year it seems like all the teams are genuinely excited for normal playoffs to be back and the Blazers are healthy and didn’t have to fight tooth and nail for 8th seed
You gotta pull up to his Pull Up Podcast to pull up the most recent quotes on what CJ McCollum has to say about pulling up the most recent news on the NBA.
Not biased but Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum
"Yeah fucking fat ass CJ McCollum, dudes prolly never even played pickup ball at the Y. Damn nephews."
You should ask CJ McCollum how he would've reacted too.
"CJ McCollum just tweeted ""Actor of the Year"""
Eh maybe the Nuggets will learn from 2019 decide to not ignore Cj McCollum in favor of guarding Dame this playoffs
Draymond is my favorite player in the NBA not named CJ McCollum or Carmelo Anthony
I mean he's basically their Cj McCollum
"Yeah, it’s CJ McCollum who always gives us trouble. He’s the main reason we lost two years ago to the Blazers."
I’ve seen him defend well and play off the bell when wall was the main ball handler...now as the main option he’s been able to maintain his efficiency while also upping his volume...he’s the perfect two guard to plug and play in any system and defensively is solid when he doesn’t have to carry a shit roster...he’s a bigger more defensively versatile cj mccollum really...and a better passer
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
"If Powell is on MPJ, because Covington is on Jokic; then CJ McCollum is covering Aaron Gordon"
"The sunk cost of acquiring PG won't be a factor in this hypothetical scenario though. In 2019 they didn't look at it like ""would we rather have 7 picks, Gallo and SGA or PG"", they looked at it like ""even though we're giving up literally everything, we'll get PG and Kawhi."" If Kawhi says ""trade PG or I walk"" then they'll be looking at it like ""would we rather have Kawhi plus whatever we can get for PG, or just PG by himself?"" That's an easy decision. So even if all they can get is Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook or CJ McCollum or something, one of those guys paired with Kawhi is still better than just having PG by himself."
If Ben Simmons has another not great post season him getting moved seems likely. Maybe for CJ McCollum or Paul George if the Blazers or Clippers want to change things up.
Then Ben McLemore over CJ McCollum
"You can have a lightly used Cj McCollum for the price of Ben Simmons, if you'd like."

CJ McCollum
"PG13  Kyrie  Curry  KD  Harden (when not trying to draw fouls, see 2015-16)  Clippers CP3  Jordan  Hakeem  Carmelo  Joe Johnson  (I’ll name more as I remember them)  Edit: CJ McCollum how could I forget you man.  Klay Thompson"
CJ McCollum
I mean look at the Kings who passed on Dame for Thomas Robinson and [then the very next year passed on CJ to draft Ben Mclemore despite promising CJ they'd draft him.](https://sports.yahoo.com/c-j-mccollum-kings-promised-170042877.html)
"CJ who? CJ McCollum? B/c Harden, MPJ and Ingles are def better shooters than him lol."
"a meme, with cj mccollum and some warrior fan named jennifer"
"I think that Julius Randle has a great shot at winning it this season, and his numbers haven’t jumped that significantly either. At least compared to previous winners like Pascal Siakam or CJ McCollum."
When did we trade for CJ McCollum?
"CJ McCollum is in that class too, but yeah, 2013 was a weak draft."
"Unfortunately they lost to the 82-0 Blazers in the finals 10 times in an row, Damian Lillard is 45 and has just won his 6 straight mvp alongside Bron Jr, Nassir, Anfernee Simons and Luka Doncic, etc. Simons is best 3pt shooter ever, Luka is still great even though he is very old. Blazers Are coached by Brandon Roy and Aldridge, Cj McCollum is the owner of the blazer after retiring in 2029."
CJ McCollum STOLE the election!
This will all boil down to CJ McCollum and a future protected 1st
Not the CJ McCollum news I was hoping for…
The only thing they can do is trade McCollum. But at this point they have zero leverage and the defense will never get any better with dame cj
"They're about 5 years too late.   McCollum should've been traded in 2015-2016. His value was never higher and it was clear as Steph was ascending that a Dame-CJ foundation could not win a title. They weren't good enough to win, and they weren't bad enough to get a top lottery pick.   Dame digging into his ""I'm loyal, I'm from Oakland"" shit allowed the Blazers front office to stay complacent."
CJ McCollum is a fringe all star  Simmons is a fringe All NBA player and 5 years younger.  Not even comparable
"Warriors could offer Wiseman (depends how high you are on him still). DLo. CJ McCollum. Or something centered around Ben Simmons.    Personally I'd prefer Haliburton, but those are other names I've heard that are on a similar tier."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.foxsports.com/stories/nba/damian-lillard-clutch-michael-jordan-portland-trail-blazers-cj-mccollum   “He has made 25 game-tying or go-ahead shots in the final 20 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. That's more than anyone else since he entered the NBA in 2012-13. “  Quoted from the article
"Which is absolutely the right take. Does CJ McCollum or Malcom Brogdon really elevate the Sixers? I don’t think so. Even if Ben plays his usual limited offensive game in the playoffs and doesn’t have a complete meltdown mentally, the Sixers are going head to head with the Bucks in the ECF. I think Morey understands that his best play is bringing Simmons back and hoping he gets regular season Ben in the playoffs instead of whatever the fuck he got out of him last year. If Dame or Lavine or Beal become available in the season or next offseason, you have one of the best assets in the league to send out"
"Homer take, but I still think CJ McCollum, Nassir Little, and a first seems like a fair swap for Simmons (even though he's rumored to not want to play in Portland). CJ and Simmons would each be a much better fit on the opposite team. I don't think it'll happen, or if it does, it'll be closer to the trade deadline. I'm sure Morey knows that CJ would be a great fit with Embiid and Harris, but he's holding out hope that Dame will want out eventually. It's like he and Neil Olshey are playing a game of chicken. Which GM will get more desperate and blink first?"
"&gt; This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making. Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Wiggins I get and CJ I could sort of be talked into, but are you really suggesting there’s a world where David Griffin could offer Brandon Ingram for KP straight up and the Mavs would say *no*?  We’re talking about the same KP who looks like he can barely move his knee anymore, right?"
Good call. In that case CJ McCollum. All-around better scorer anyway.
"You have to be a nephew to think KP has no value. This is a world where Andrew Wiggins, CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram are making about what he's making.  Nobody sane would give up KP for any of those guys.  Let's not even get into about 10 guy that have straight toxic deals like John Wall, Tobias Harris, (formerly) Kemba or Simmons.  THJ, especially on the new deal, and Kleber have more value than DFS."
"Not my team, but CJ McCollum, 2 FRP"
"Blazers fans have convinced themselves of 2 things: 1) Zeller/Snell are upgrades over Carmelo/Kanter, and 2) CJ McCollum is going to net them some big return like Ben Simmons (Not happening)"
😂 when CJ McCollum broke that out last year I was dying
"Jamal Murray, CJ McCollum, OG Annoby, MPJ, Ayton"
* LaMelo Ball * CJ McCollum * MPJ * Sabonis * Ayton
"That’s gonna be rough for high to mid level guys who have huge endorsements with these companies. The first couple that come to mind is DLo,Klay, Jimmy butler, and I think  CJ McCollum"
"Cj McCollum, KD, Kawhi, Derozen, possibly Tatum"
us neither lmao id rather have the wonderful human being that is CJ McCollum and be on the cusp than someone with a shitty attitude
Yea don’t trade him to the blazers I’d rather die than have cj McCollum
"So... fellow non young socialite city fan, how do you feel about CJ McCollum...?"
Hope the sixers are ready for some hot n spicy CJ McCollum and future 2nds
I point this out about Tobias Harris when people say he’s better than CJ McCollum and nobody wants to hear it lol.
CJ Mccollum
"Damn, you're right   2012 Pick 6 Damian Lillard - Home run pick  Pick 11 Meyers Leonard (career backup and heated gamer)  Pick 40 Will Barton (traded third year with others for 35 year old Marcus Camby)  Pick 41 Tyshawn Taylor (traded)  2013 Pick 10 CJ McCollum - another good one  Pick 39 Jeff Withey (traded)  Pick 40 Grant Jerrett (traded)  Pick 45 Marko Todorovic (traded)  2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace  2015 Pick 23 Rondae Hollis Jefferson (traded to Brooklyn)  2016 (first round pick traded year before for Arron Afflalo who left at season’s end)  2017 Pick 15 Justin Jackson (traded)  Pick 20 Harry Giles (traded)  Pick 26 Caleb Swanigan (traded halfway through season)  2018 Pick 24 Anfernee Simons (honestly, doing fine for being the 24th pick)  2019 Pick 25 Nassir Little  2020 Pick 16 Isaiah Stewart (traded)  Pick 46 CJ Elleby"
"Oh for sure. I’m not saying it wasn’t mutually beneficial, just that he is getting his player option money regardless of any moves by OKC. You don’t give back 40mil. I’m just super tired of hearing this garbage take.   CJ McCollum explained the situation perfectly.  https://twitter.com/cjmccollum/status/1420386672068501504?s=21"
"What is he supposed to say? Dame is right and our roster is ass come GMs we're blowing it up   Especially when their hands are tied, they can't really make moves and have no great assets, their best asset is CJ McCollum"
Can I interest you in one CJ McCollum?
I get that somewhat but it's like worst on the team bad. Very comparable to CJ McCollum who I think is super overrated.
"Dennis Schroder and Ben Simmons are two little off-season storylines I'm honestly fascinated by. I am extremely compelled by the idea that before the start of the season Dennis Schroder has two offers on long MLEs, and 76ers best offer for Simmons is two first rounders and CJ McCollum."
"It’s gonna be rough this year. Lots of teams upgraded and made huge moves. Portland didn’t do shit, they still have McCollum AND Powell when they should’ve just traded CJ and moved Powell to the 2 spot and gotten some solid wing defenders. Danny Green is still available, they definitely could use his defense and vet presence.   Then again, can’t blame teams for not wanting to go to a big question mark in Portland and it’s not a wanted FA destination. New coach, bad GM, Dame might leave, and weak roster in a meh location."
"Why do you think they are even considered dark horses? It's the playoff Dame factor. His team is CJ McCollum then Enes Kanter.   Again, you're a clown."
I don’t understand what people think the appeal is of adding CJ McCollum to philly pairing him with Seth Curry in a small horrible defensive backcourt. Then in this one you add another 6’3 wing as well.   I actually believe in Simmons perhaps working it out at some stage on another team and think this is kind of a win for Portland depending on what picks they give up but it’s still an overpay considering Simmons lack of value right now.
TJ McConnell looks too much like CJ McCollum at first glance
"Eh I mean you can see my flair so obviously know my bias here, but Simmons is the best on ball defender in the league. He's big and an amazing athlete. He's only 25. He was second in DPOY voting. He's a three time all star already. Not every all star has the same trade value. Obviously nobody is going to be able to trade for LeBron or Durant unless they request out, but Simmons is certainly a better asset than like Conley or Westbrook or Vucevic or something. I like Conley a lot but he's small and old and had injury issues last season. I love Westbrook, but he has plenty of issues of his own. I know Vucevic is good but I can't say I've watched him much. But he's five years older with fewer all star appearances.  I don't think it's crazy to think there's a coach or GM who has seen Simmons at his best -- which is incredible -- and feel that they have the tools to bring that out of him more consistently. I don't think too many people get to NBA coaching or front office level without thinking they could be the best in the world at what they do.   All that being said, I agree the leaked trade requests have been outlandish. I just don't agree that an all star plus other assets is necessarily crazy. And I think Morey is asking for the world right now bc he doesn't feel a great sense of urgency. I think he's perfectly willing to go into the season with Simmons, but if someone bites on one of these insane proposals he still wins. And as a Sixers fan, I'm happy about that. If Elton Brand were still the main guy we probably would've given up Simmons and four picks for CJ McCollum by now."
"The entire post you've crafted here is unfortunately invalid with the hit-job you just did on CJ McCollum. If he played in the East he'd absolutely be a multiple time AllStar by now. The only reason he isn't is the stacked G lineup in the West: Curry, Klay, Dame, CP3, Westbrook, Mitchell etc.   CJ's last full year as an an example, I don't have the mid season numbers but the point is the same:  **2020 East All Star Kemba**: 20.4 ppg on 42% shooting  **2020 East All Star Lowry**: 19.4 ppg on 41% shooting  **2020 West All Star Mitchell**: 24ppg on 45% shooting  **2020 McCollum**: 22.2 ppg on 45% shooting  In what freakin' world is that not sniffing All Star level. What planet are you on? Dame hasn't been by himself.   He had Cj and Nurk in 2018 and got swept while shooting 35%. You pretend like he was just passing to a wide open CJ all series (while being 3x teamed) but he only had 19ast vs CJ's 14ast for the entire series. Talk about creating a narrative out of thin air.   I never said Steph hasn't been helped by great teammates, but the ""Dame carries a team with metrics I can't source, just trust me"" take just isn't true. Steph smokes him by just about any metric I've seen...if you have a statistical metric that you can rely on to say otherwise let me know. Better players carry their team more than players even slightly worse, I guess that's news for you."
"Alot of Blazers fans genuinely want him for a CJ McCollum package... its not just trying to cop him for the low, it would theoretically improve the balance and competitiveness for BOTH rosters.  Big question is if Portland's idiot GM will make an attempt at doing his job, or if he's content getting 1 more year of paychecks before being chased out of town"
To make it more palatable when he ends up getting traded for cj mccollum and two frps
"It must really value offensive boards,  because Kanter has a higher rating than CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell, and Jayson Tatum, amongst others!"
Trade him and salary filler for CJ McCollum. I think that's a good trade for everyone
"I don't think this is accurate. It would probably be more accurate to say the Blazers intend to keep McCollum if the right trade can't be found. Per Fisher the other day, Blazers/Raps had at least broached the subject of CJ for Siakam and I doubt Toronto initiated that conversation.  They'll move him for the right piece, but not just to unload him. Beyond that, say what you want about Olshey, but he runs a tight ship when it comes to leaks. Just because we haven't heard anything about moving CJ, doesn't mean the FO is hellbent on keeping him."
"Ok but compare the 2020-21 warriors roster to the 2019-2020 Blazers roster and it’s not even close. Draymond, Wiggins, and Oubre vs CJ McCollum, Hassan Whiteside, and Melo. The Blazers played Mario Hezonja and Anthony Tolliver substantial minutes all year due to injuries to Nurkic and Collins. Yet despite all of this, the blazers still made the playoffs by beating the same Grizzlies team that the Warriors lost to in the 2021 play-in. Dame 2020 carry job &gt;&gt;&gt; Steph 2021 carry job. And I know I’ll get downvoted because warriors fans can’t take anything that even remotely criticizes Curry, but I don’t care because I said nothing but facts. Check the rosters that both players dealt with and you’ll see."
I disagree on the needle mover. I dont see why McCollum wouldn't be an enticing piece in a blockbuster. There's gonna be some risk involved but if CJ is on the market hes a huge target for a number of teams
Was CJ McCollum there too?
CJ McCollum gets traded. To what team? I don’t really know. It seems like there’s no smoke currently but I won’t be surprised if it happens.
"Yea true, but the sim is arguably worse  One time, CJ McCollum was the leading scorer on the Blazers, 32.5ppg vs 22.1ppg from Dame, and they had 85 and 92 overalls respectively, coaching had picked Dame as the main option, and still was like that for an entire season  In 2K17 btw, I use modded rosters cause I don't wanna buy the new game, only got it for myleague anyway"
"I think Reddish can improve. I've not dismissed it at all. It is just irrelevant to cite CJ McCollum as a reason this improvement will happen. CJ McCollum grew 2 inches, developed in college, and improved his shooting. Because of this, Cam Reddish, a 6'8"", top prospect, that has been terrible offensively in college and in the pros, will improve? See the false equivalence? I just don't get it, but anyway, I appreciate the discussion!"
* Remaining major trades: Siakam to the Warriors and Ben Simmons &lt;--&gt; CJ McCollum  * Pistons make the playoffs without even needing to win a play-in game  * De'Aaron Fox gets traded mid-season  * Paul George wins MVP  * Nets win the Finals (cold take)
"It's pretty damned that Cam was a top prospect, bigger, stronger, and more athletic than the vast majority of college players, surrounded by NBA talent and an all-time great coach, and still shot 35% at Duke. I don't think it is appropriate to compare CJ McCollum, a low ranked and undersized 2 guard that needed time to develop at Lehigh, to Cam Reddish. CJ wa 6'1, 155 when he entered college. Cam was supposed to be NBA ready since high school."
"There are countless examples of guys with bad shooting splits who end up really good after they need an adjustment period to the NBA.  For example as a Blazers fan you should know that when CJ McCollum was Cam's age, he was shooting 44% at Lehigh University."
"Yeah Portland fans felt like he was good at the time but we had Wes Mathews, CJ McCollum, for sure ahead of him and we also had Allen Crabbe who was shooting &lt;40% from 3.  Was good but just couldn't crack the rotation."
"CJ and Gary Trent know each other, it might be good for both of those players. Plus we don't really know what McCollum is like without Lillard. Or even in a different system."
Rondo And Holiday were the reason they won that series. They shut down Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.
Its CJ McCollum trade rumor szn officially
"&gt;The Blazers and Raptors have had early discussions about a trade involving CJ McCollum and Pascal Siakam, per Jake Fisher of Bleacher Report.  This is a report on his report.  Not validation of it."
"Terrible take.  The two teams are different based of roster construction, fit, quality players on either team and the level of desperation.. Blazers are much more desperate, with lower quality ceiling even as of right now based on current roster between the two teams.  There are also no available trade to make and contracts to make sense for the Warriors fit.. Warriors not gonna ship Wiggins and all their assets for a guy like Ben Simmons and Pascal Siakam..   Meanwhile Portland has CJ McCollum to swing for a Siakam or Ben Simmons that prob yield better fit and make sense for both teams in trade."
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
"Damian Lillard texted CJ McCollum after the third or fourth brick with,""Jennifer"" Then, after the ninth brick, Lilliard texted McCollum: ""Philly""After the Trailblazers sent McCollum to the 76ers, Lilliard texted a Watch emoji."
He play more like cj McCollum with better defense than Mitchell imo
"I've seen him play twice. He played in the same league as CJ McCollum, so very low level of competition. But he's a big man with a really impressive offensive game. Good shooter, face up, a bit of back to the basket"
"CJ McCollum is in that center part of the ven diagram where he’s a nice player, but probably impossible to get his worth back in a trade, especially if the blazers are trying to get enough assets to pair Dame with someone."
"Man y’all about to be the most hated fanbase in the league. The bucks just won a chip. The Nets potentially all-time caliber bog 3 is gonna be healthy. The Hawks are absolutely loaded. Yet you turn your nose up at Colin Sexton, like y’all *deserve* better in return for a player who’s honestly a liability   Man y’all better make that trade and bank on his upside. Bc there are no players available that have the potential to lift you past those other teams. CJ McCollum maybe"
"Dame isn't leaving Portland kids, get over it. Make this deal for CJ CJ McCollum and other Blazers' pieces or move the hell on"
Is Daryl just enjoying the mindfuckery of it all before he just swaps Ben for CJ McCollum
"“I think probably one of the things we were a little too conservative with this offseason and at the trade deadline was, we were probably far too protective of our ~~draft pick~~ CJ McCollum and our trade exceptions and the tools we had to continue to build the roster long term and maybe lost sight of the fact that the first round was going to be more competitive that we expected.”"
They’ll take CJ McCollum and like it!
"I mean I'd be fine with CJ + filler, but Philly is setting their bar pretty high to drop all the way to that, even if some of what they're doing is positioning.   As for Dame + Simmons, not sure what there is not to like... Plenty of shooting on Portland's roster to make up for him, but they lack defense, and lack playmaking when Dame rests. Simmons brings All NBA Defense, top tier playmaking. Blazers problem has been a small backcourt with redundant skills that can't defend bigger opponents, this potentially clears up all of it.  Honestly even Philly should be happy... they want shooting, floor stretching and SOME playmaking but not enough to take it away from Embiid. McCollum checks those boxes, and can run the show when Embiid is out. This really should happen for both sides to improve"
CJ McCollum and a 1st probably and maybe some bench piece
One Cj McCollum
They’ll take CJ McCollum and they’ll like it
All this hype just to get traded for cj McCollum and two firsts
A staples center usher told be I look like CJ McCollum
Got any CJ McCollum news? Would the Sixers try to look at moving Harris if they can’t get what they want out of Simmons?
"It depends on how bad Simmons' relationship is with the Sixers right now. If it's as bad as has been rumored, I think swapping him for CJ + some combination of picks and/or a young prospect is a no-brainer. An Embiid-Harris-McCollum trio is nice, and Tyrese Maxey should only get better. My gut tells me that either this trade happens, or he stays put. Depends on how dire the situation is, and no one really knows that for sure right now."
They should just take CJ McCollum and thank the blazers for being generous at this point 😂😂😂. But hey they’re gonna get dame right 😭😭😭
"1) There have been wide disparities in people's opinions on Ben Simmons' trade value, from aging veteran scorers like CJ McCollum or Kyle Lowry, to young all stars. How do you think the league views his trade value?  2) Do you expect there to be any trades in the top half of tonight's draft?"
"CJ McCollum, straight up."
  * A good starter like CJ McCollum and a 1st  * A bench player/role-player and two firsts
CJ McCollum and picks
Cj McCollum and a lottery protected 1st
"*Sixers*, I repeat, how about one slightly used Cj McCollum?"
Theyd still fail in the playoffs with any of these proposed offers the sixers received anyway tho. CJ McCollum or Brogdon aren't raising the Sixers ceiling higher than it is rn
"You’ll get one CJ McCollum, and you’ll like it."
Chris Paul - Allstate Insurance Producer   CJ McCollum - Basketball play-by-play radio broadcaster  Dame - Watch repair staff
"Honestly. Perhaps at the beginning of last year they may have gotten a nice return on him but right now, the best player I think they could get for him is a Pascal Siakam, CJ McCollum (hard maybe) or a top 10 pick."
"He also takes tough shots which is why his 3 pt % is low, but he is one of the best shot creaters in the draft and plays like CJ McCollum/Jordan Clarkson"
CJ McCollum tier player and 2 picks
"Bones Hyland for sure. I think his floor will be a good 6th man, but his ceiling will be a CJ McCollum or maybe Sexton.   For a guy being projected as a late 1st to early 2nd red pick, getting a good who will probably be in your playoff rotation is super valuable."
"Honestly the biggest issue with Simmons is probably his contract. The folks treating him like a complete bum are being hyperbolic, but it’s difficult to imagine building a real contender with him taking an all-NBA max slot.   For perspective, another contract many have deemed “bad” for many years is Wiggins contract. Wiggins earns 33M in his last year (22-23) while Simmons earns 40M in his last year (24-25).  Trading Simmons isn’t as simple as a talent swap - it’s trading salary flexibility for the next 4 years in exchange for a currently very flawed player. IMO Simmons’ value is another good player on a questionable contract - like CJ McCollum + filler/picks."
"Cj McCollum, Derrick Jones Jr + 2 future picks"
"This benefits Portland, Philly can get a better deal than CJ McCollum. Portland would have to offer much more for Simmons than just CJ.   And you keep saying all star in the east. He didnt even beat out Mike Conley as a reserve in the west. How is he going to beat out Harden, Kyrie, Butler, Beal, Westbrook,  Lavine, Trae Young, and I'll stop at Jrue Holiday. And those are just the guards in the east bro. 8 that you can put before CJ. That doesn't even include Simmons who is better than CJ and is listed as a Guard/Forward."
CJ McCollum and a pick or 2
"CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic and 2023 top 5 protected first."
"Say Simmons ends up going to Portland for CJ McCollum and, I don't know, two firsts?   Philly them have those two picks, their own 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 first round picks (2025 to OKC), and young pieces in Thybulle, Maxey and Milton, along with salary matcher in Tobias Harris, to send to, for example, Washington to get Beal.  CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal and Joel Embiid is probably a better championship base than Simmons, Harris and Embiid."
CJ McCollum is way more popular than his Basketball abillity suggests
I don’t think CJ McCollum needs any of our sympathy 😂
"Low VORP, especially considering usage; negative RPM on defense and, surprisingly, offense. PER is just ok. OBPM just ok. Raptor has him as a slight positive on offense, huge negative on defense.   only TS% is good. It could be great if he extends his range.   I find him to be a relatively low bball IQ player for his position, who doubles as awful on defense. While it's possible that he's able to extend his range and improve his play making, bball IQ, and defense, I don't know if all of these things can be done. He's certainly an intelligent guy and a hardworking guy. So, it's possible.   Nevertheless, if it were remotely close in what my assessment is, then everyone would scoff at the notion of trading him. I.e., he's a long way away from being CJ McCollum and is definitely not Dame at the moment.   Boom or an awesome third guard IMO. If he were in this draft, he'd be the 5-6th pick. Except for this pick, you have to pay him 25+ million starting next year. Not so palatable for most in team construction, especially when he dominates the ball and has the uncertainties outlined above."
"CJ McCollum rocking back and forth. Booker's ability to stop on a dime and go up for a jumper, picture perfect and under control. Bradley Beal somehow going from standing still to casually attacking the rim in a blink. Joe Ingles catch and shoot three while never bringing the ball down. These are a few of my favorite things."
Kyrie is weird but my god his game is beautiful. I also love watching  Real Deal Beal and even some CJ McCollum
"There’s a few players from most draft classes that make huge strides, I would bet on Garland making a few All-Star appearances or being a better passing CJ McCollum."
"i'd personally take Bam above like 20 guys on this list. And there's 0 shot im taking Anthony Edwards, Lamelo, John Collins, D'angelo Russell, CJ McCollum over Bam."
CJ McCollum but shorter and even worse defender
"Sir, no. You are forgetting Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Fred VanVleet, Donovan Mitchell, Shia Gilgeous-Alexander, CJ McCollum and Terry Rozier who could arguably be better than him. Booker, Brown, Mitchell and George are all definitely better."
Depends on how much they value THT. He could be the perfect pairing with CJ McCollum
"Just curious for people that will shit on us from the philly side, what are the better deals they could pursue? Is a cj mccollum deal better than this?"
Duncan Robinson and CJ McCollum
"There aren’t better players than Duncan Robinson, CJ McCollum, Tobias Harris getting cut from this league?"
"That's what happens when you play on teams tanking for a top pick lol.  The only season his team wasn't tanking he played 81.  I don't know what trade value you think Ben Simmkns has, but it ain't that high. Dlo + young player + pick is a very realistic trade at the moment unless you're into CJ McCollum."
He's an above average defender and good playmaker. He can run an offense as the primary ball handler. Like you said career high 5.4apg shows he is a good playmaker.   He's just a good all around player and has zero major weaknesses. He's closer to a Jimmy Butler archetype than he is to a CJ Mccollum.
Saying Middleton is the CJ of SFs is a horrible comparison. Middleton is a great all around player and was almost a 50/40/90 shooter last year. CJ Mccollum is a glorified role player.
For real if I was the Bucks I’d look at big moves this off-season. I’d honestly ask about Westbrook / McCollum and see what’s a possible idea. I really think Portland would consider a one for one with Kris for CJ and maybe Washington would consider Russ for Jrue or Russ for Kris. But they need to be aggressive in finding someone who shows intensity and can go get buckets. Jrue has this weird thing where he just seems like he doesn’t care or is deflated and I feel Kris also is like that.
and then there is CJ McCollum who is worse and older
"They've toned down on the literal interpretation of the rule since I think when CJ McCollum got suspended for taking 1-2 steps on the court a few years ago. It's no longer step on the court, get suspended. You've gotta make some effort to get into the fray."
CJ McCollum for Middleton. Middleton running point forward half the time is not working against a good team.
 Eastern conference CJ McCollum
Middleton should be getting the CJ McCollum treatment right now. Dude has to go immediately.
"Dudes be saying ""Lillard and picks"" for Simmons, it is straight up embarrassing. Maybe McCollum but idk why Portland would want a 34% ft shooter over CJ lol. Let alone Booker, who could arguably win Finals MVP if the Suns win it all  Stay off drugs people"
"Kuzma, Caruso, 1 FRP swap and 1 SRP for CJ McCollum?"
"How does that tweet contradict what /u/lakerswiz said about LeBron giving his opinion? And LeBron isn't a vice president of the NBAPA (his term expired 2.5 years ago). [Here's the player leadership:](https://nbpa.com/leadership)  * Chris Paul, President * Andre Iguodala, First VP * Harrison Barnes, Secretary-Treasurer * Bismack Biyombo, VP * Malcolm Brogdon, VP * Jaylen Brown, VP * Kyrie Irving, VP * CJ McCollum, VP * Garrett Temple, VP  LeBron isn't even the Lakers' rep (that's Jared Dudley, with Alex Caruso as alternate)."
"Since you’re open to understanding, they’re not technically Depreciating the assets which are tangible but actually Amortizing the intangible TV deals and player contracts. This is a normal and perfectly reasonable business idea. If you buy a lawn mower for $100 and it has a 10 year life then it loses $10 per year through operations. The lawn mower accrues wear and tear through use that makes it lose value.  The player contract is something similar where a $40MM contract for 4 years will lose $10MM a year because the wear and tear on the player. After a year the player is “worth” only $30MM accounting wise. It does make sense that players lose value over time.  This makes logical sense, something that you’re using loses value as you’re using it. One of the issues is that there’s a disconnect between Tax Accounting and GAAP accounting. The same lawnmower that you used for 5 years is now worth $50 but you could sell it for $70. The values don’t align.  This gets complicated with athlete contracts because there’s no easy way to evaluate the value. A year ago Ben Simmons and some picks would get you James Harden and now Ben Simmons value is like CJ McCollum. Ben Simmons is on a max contract and people are now doubting how valid that is. Just like LeBron is worth more than his contract but with salary caps it can’t go higher. So the principle is good but complicated in real world applications.  This is also just a simple amortization method to illustrate the examples. They could be more aggressive and say a player loses 90% of their value in 1 year to capture the savings right away. This would represent a “loss” potentially if you could do that for all the contracts in a year even if they make money.   This is what the BlueJays guy was talking about. They could have $4MM in cash flow to their bank accounts but under accounting it’s a $2MM loss. It’s a unique feature of sports financing due to the player contracts and TV deals.  The simple answer is amortization is like the 3 point shot. It’s perfectly valid and reasonable. A shot from further gets more reward. Sports teams are basically spamming the corner 3 to abuse that efficiency. So if you want to change it either make the corner 3 worth less points or curve that line instead of making it flat."
As a lakers fan I think a guy who could score and shoot at an elite level would help us more than anything so maybe buddy hield or Cj McCollum   I don't know though
CJ McCollum. Can't win with 3 guards starting and Portland knows it
"Would a Browns fan come because if so, CJ McCollum might be attracted."
"And you must be missing the point that a backcourt of CJ and Seth is not going to work and that’s ignoring the fact that CJ is older than Ben, isn’t a point guard, and doesn’t make the Sixers any better.   I guarantee you that if a McCollum for Simmons trade package was available, it’s not one that fits Morey’s philosophy. [He’s not going to go from thinking Simmons is a Superstar just 7 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/k28pil/hi_rsixers_this_is_daryl_morey_i_am_excited_to_do/gdt3hxu/) to trading him for CJ McCollum lol."
"If he went to the Warriors, Curry probably ends up being CJ McCollum, Klay glorified Danny Green. Draymond a Ben Simmons who shoots"
Danny Green or CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum already spends a ton of time commenting on games he's not playing in.
"Cj McCollum,  shoe deal and popular on Twitter but no all stars"
"CJ McCollum would be such a drastic downgrade, not sure why people still overrating CJ - he's been bad for 2 years, getting older/worse, and overpaid."
There are still delusional people in our fanbase that cant accept that Ben Simmons is useless in the playoffs outside the first round.   We would be lucky to get CJ McCollum (who has better or comparable adavanced stats this season to Beal and Lavine) for a bum taking up 28% of our cap.   What these fans fail to realize is that Simmons is only useful as a center in the half court. If he isnt playing center (which he wont in Philly rightfully so) his value will continue to go down.
Trade him for CJ McCollum

CJ McCollum
Ever heard of CJ McCollum?
Drafted :  Dame Lillard Meyers Leonard  Will Barton CJ McCollum Rondae Hollis-Jefferson Justin Jackson Harry Giles Caleb Swanigan Anfernee Simon Traded for the pick for Gary Trent  That’s not poor drafting if you ask me
"It looks like money wise this works:  Philly gets: CJ McCollum  Indy gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Domantas Sabonis, Justin Holiday"
"Brogdon is worse on defense than CJ McCollum and only a year younger, not sure why they'd take it when theres a better offer continually floated in the media and pressure on the Blazers to trade CJ"
Aka CJ McCollum
&gt;CJ McCollum or DLo would be a substantially better offer than Brogdan and the pick because I would assume that’s the type of return they’ll be getting.  He has significantly more value than them.  Morey will field better offers than that
I guess it just depends on whether or not you think CJ McCollum or DLo would be a substantially better offer than Brogdan and the pick because I would assume that’s the type of return they’ll be getting. Sixers need to do whatever they can to hit in Embiid’s window and it’s fairly clear it won’t happen with Simmons.
A Seth Curry and CJ McCollum back court would get absolutely torched on the defensive end and neither of those guys are true point guards.
Can we interest you in a CJ McCollum?
It’s still a bad return CJ reports around the league are is viewed as a slight negative asset which sounds about right. He just gets held to lower standards than Simmons so he gets overrated by people put him in Philly they’ll get annoyed with him within 2 years. This is still selling low and this doesn’t improve the sixers chances of winning a title. You don’t improve your outlook trading a 24 year old who was an all nba player 1 year ago for 30 year old CJ McCollum and aging Covington.   It’s just…sometimes there’s a distinction between desirable and necessary. And that’s the case here
I live in Sacramento where we had Vlade Divac draft Marvin Bagley over Luca Doncic who came from Real Madrid which he used to be the head of operations for.   A couple years before that the Kings had Geoff Petrie who picked Ben Mclemore before CJ McCollum and Giannis. The year before that he took Thomas Robinson with the pick immediately before Damien Lillard who is from Northern California.  I wish the Kings had a GM that bad
Best I can do is CJ McCollum
&gt;or do you not even know that Butler played 1 game post All-Star break that season.  He played 59 games that regular season lmao. You're acting like he missed most of it. That's more games than CJ McCollum played this year and Portland still managed the 6th seed and were the same record as the 5 seed. Injuries happen to everyone.
"Well nobody wants CJ McCollum so, I guess he’ll be left there and dame asks out anyway lmao"
"Rest of NBA be like: ""Best we can do is CJ McCollum"""
CJ McCollum in Rip City
"Let's look at this. Game 6, elimination game, versus Denver. Dame plays 43 minutes with shooting splits of 40/27/100, has 5 turnovers, and the 2nd worst plus minus on the team. Pretty bum ass performance for a superstar.  Also, when Austin Rivers was guarded by [Dame](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=SECONDS&amp;dir=1) he shot 54% from the field and 50% from 3.   When Austin Rivers was guarded by [CJ McCollum](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203468/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs) he shot 42% from the field (-12% vs. Dame) and 46% from 3 (-4% from Dame)  Needless to say, Austin Rivers cooked tf out of Dame even worse than he did to CJ.  Also, Dame's defensive rating was 120.5 in the playoffs this year which is putrid."
He's obviously gonna adjust his style. You can't play the same way next to Cj McCollum (or whoever the blazers leftovers will be) that you will next to Embiid
I'll take a 3 and a 6 for CJ McCollum happily but only if Neil Olshey goes too because he'd find a way to screw those picks up somehow.
"Package CJ and as many picks as needed for WHOM?!  CJ is probably the best non-all star 2 guard in the league… what is the upgrade there, and what team would simultaneously value BOTH a 30 year old CJ McCollum **and** a bunch of draft picks…"
"Middleton should age decently and can take over playoff games. I think he should be good to compete for the next 4 years or so.  Bucks need to explore using Holiday to upgrade the roster. Not sure what type of trade they can get, maybe something to swindle the Blazers out of CJ McCollum, but Jrue doesn't look like a great playoff player."
"I'm in favor of a hard cap plus a ""Superstar exception"" contract that doesn't count against the cap. However, all Superstar Exceptions are the same cash per year (maybe whatever 40% of the hard cap is) and players on Superstar Exceptions can only be included in a trade if the return includes another player on a Superstar Exception.   Teams can choose to convert a Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract, but only if they have the cap space to take the contract on (e.g., they need 35% of their cap space available to convert their Superstar Exception contract to a normal contract).   You may be wondering why a player would sign a Superstar Exception when they could take 50% of the cap. But I think a team with 50% of the money going to one player is never going to be a contender, especially against a team with one dude not counting against the cap at all, letting them spend literally twice as much to build out the roster. And so no smart team would offer that kind of money, and if they did, they wouldn't win anything.  It would be like having Lebron on 50% of the cap, AD on a Superstar Exception, and absolute scrubs vs Steph on a Superstar Exception and a good roster. Like it would be something like Grant Williams / Ben McLemore / Lebron / AD / Aaron Baynes vs Steph / CJ McCollum / OG Anunoby / Draymond / Christian Wood. Spending huge on two stars may look good, but the rest of the team will be so bad, the better constructed team with just one dude on the Superstar Exception (and no guy on 50% of the cap) gives you a better team."
&gt; Blazers can elevate to championship contender status by trading CJ McCollum  settle down lol nobody's said that in a couple years
As a Cavs fan people keep telling us that you can’t play with Collin Sexton and Darius Garland together on the same team cause it might be like CJ McCollum and Dame.  ...how fuckin cool would it be for our young guys we develop to be as good as CJ and Dame???  That would be AWESOME
No but if you've been injured the entire year and haven't done jack so far in your career it looks funny. It's the same reason CJ McCollum told Festus Ezeli to shut up that one time except Collins has done even less
Man you guys are so weird with all the Lakers flair bs. You call us delusional but somehow think the Blazers can elevate to championship contender status by trading CJ McCollum? Explain to me how the Blazers realistically can improve to the level Lillard wants.
"To do what exactly? Flip CJ McCollum for Tobias Harris at best? Blazers will only get a similar piece back for whoever they trade. They just lost to an injured Nuggets team in the first round, the writings on the wall."
"I’d go with basketball podcast to get a deeper look… Knucklesheads with QRich and DMiles, The Old Man &amp; The Three by JJ Reddick, Pull Up with CJ McCollum, No Chill Gil, and All The Smoke.."
Khris Middleton? CJ McCollum?  PG is supposed to be the best out of these guys too.
" &gt;getting put to toast by CJ McCollum, Damian Lillard  When did he play those guys in the playoffs exactly?   &gt;James Harden was obviously more impressive than Drummond and Whiteside. Definitely budd  Yeah lots of players have been more productive while getting burnt by Harden. He's one of the greatest offensive players of all time, he kills almost everyone. Hell he was scoring on a first team all defensive player with 1 working leg this season.  &gt;completely see where you're going with this.  I don't think you're seeing anything clearly."
"Oh yes bricks all over the floor, turnover troubles and getting put to toast by CJ McCollum, Damian Lillard and James Harden was obviously more impressive than Drummond and Whiteside. Definitely buddy, completely see where you're going with this."
That dude in the stands looked like the Spanish version of CJ McCollum
"I agree, he really balled out a couple years ago. I doubt he'd ever become a star but I can see him becoming a CJ McCollum-level player"
"Dame won’t be looking at it through that point of view, he wants to win a championship right now. He’s gonna want to play with somebody that knows what it takes to win in the playoffs, not hope and pray randle shows up in the playoffs next year, that’s wishful thinking. He already went through this with CJ McCollum.. he’s not gonna go through it again with randle at this stage of his career."
I think Kuzma is an interesting paradigm in the league right now. Most people either think he’s outright Venezuelan league terrible or he can be traded for Damian Lillard straight up.  I’m more in the middle. He hasn’t quite developed as hoped for but he’s only two years removed from averaging 18PPG on a bad team. He’s basically been asked to just “fit in” with no real defined role on a championship team so it’s obvious he just enters games with no idea what he’s trying to do besides “play hard”. On a different team with less expectations and more offensive freedom? He can still be a good player. Remember he has excellent size for the “position-less NBA” culture shift and generally has a versatile offensive game. He’s on a very team friendly $13M/YR contract that would be attractive to a wide-array of teams.  He and a S+T of Schroder and a couple first round picks could net the Lakers a “second tier” star player. It’s not gonna get you Damian Lillard but could possibly net you someone like CJ McCollum if teams are desperate enough to blow it up.
"[First off, you added 2 assists per game](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/cj-mccollum-stats-without-damian-lilliard )  He averages a little over 6 assists per game when Dame has been out but virtually none of those assists come from initiating the offense/running plays and are more so a result of him being the number 1 option when Dame isn’t on the floor"
"Fan vote is for the starters. The coaches and media aren't picking him for reserves either. I've never seen an article talking about how CJ McCollum was an all star snub.   You're correct , it is my opinion at the end of the day. Do you really think late career Kobe was a top 10 defender when he's making those teams?  I really don't think Marcus Smart , Klay Thompson, and Eric Bledsoe are top 10 defenders either. As well, you're discounting that all defence is a regular season award. That raptors team was built for the highest levels of playoff defence which is almost a completely different game. E.g. DPOY Gobert is not holding up in that series."
"Realistically, what trade does that though? I cant think of a team that would be interested that has what philly wants. Maybe Portland for CJ mccollum?"
I typically don't like doing the retrospective draft game because so many great players fall when they shouldn't. But man the Kings took Bagley and Robinson over Doncic and Dame. That's pretty surreal. The other years there were good players taken after their picks but they were a bit more like unpredictable like Ben Mclemore over CJ McCollum or Stauskas over Lavine.
"Julius Randle, Ben Simmons, CJ McCollum, Nurkic also imo. I expected more outta him."
"See casuals, this is why you don't trade Middleton for CJ McCollum..."
"It is astonishing to me that Olshey may be the last person standing in Portland. He handed Stotts and Lillard flawed roster after flawed roster. After drafting McCollum in 2013, he has subsequently failed to draft a single starting caliber NBA player since. He spent all that money on bench-caliber players in the 2016 offseason, somehow gave up Will Barton AND a first round pick for Arron Afflalo, and has a weird fetish for forwards who can't create or shoot, having spent a considerable amount of resources to draft or sign several.   He also had a team that was clearly in NBA purgatory for the last five or six years, with a team good enough to make the playoffs but not good quite there to truly contend. Instead of tearing it down and rebuilding around Dame to get strong again during his prime, they now have screwed that timeline up. Also, the team doesn't have any resources to rebuild with. The only real chip is CJ, a good player who just doesn't make sense as the second best player on a team next to Dame, but it'll be hard to get enough value in return to not get worse, I suspect.   I hope it's true that Dame didn't know about Billups past, but it should have never come to that. Stotts taking the fall for nearly a decade of Olshey's inadequate work means the real issue is Jodi Allen perhaps not wanting to interfere too much."
"It's ironic all the hate a guy like CJ McCollum gets, but anyone with even the tiniest bit of grounding in reality knows he is a way better player than Becky or any other WNBA player. If we're going purely by athletic achievement, there is just no comparison.  If you really want to stan Becky, you need to highlight her coaching experience as an assistant to Pop. Not her playing career. And I say that as someone that would have hired Becky if I was in charge of the Blazers. I'm just not going to pretend she has a better player career than Billups, because then I'd be an absolute fool with zero credibility."
Expectation: get rid of CJ McCollum   Reality: trade Damian Lillard  😂😂😂
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
God dammit no we don’t want cj McCollum he sucks
"It's because this isn't the first time Dame got his guy, but it'd be the first time it goes well. Other guys he's wanted / asked to keep: Neil Olshey, Terry Stotts, CJ McCollum. We've put his fucking cousin on the roster. We call him Big Nepotism. And now he's getting his coach he didn't think much about, didn't know much about, evidently hired him without addressing the elephant in the room... and now he wants to approach it by saying he didn't know *when he first heard the list*. Bro you HIRED the guy, that's what's mad."
"Sixers fans immediately after they lost to the Hawks - ""all we need is a league average point guard to replace Simmons!""                                     One, Simmons helps you win in the regular season, that's already proven. High seeding helps you avoid difficult matchups in the post season. Simply removing Simmons from the equation won't change anything, you're being ousted in the first round....you know, like what happened last season when Ben missed the playoffs entirely even though Joel averaged 30+ for the series....the team still got swept. As much as the Simmons hate commentary will get you karma, it still misses the point of his value.                  You need to get something much more than a league average point guard. Who is that anyway? Schroeder? Would he move the needle enough to get the team a championship? No a chance in hell. What they're also ignoring and what is truly the elephant in the room for the franchise, something none of their fans want to admit, is Embiid's long and constant injury history. What happens when he's on the bench recovering from his latest ailment? Who is going to step up? You think Tobi + 'league average PG' is going to get you wins when Joel isn't playing? Again, no chance in hell.             What they really need is another superstar to help take the load off Embiid and carry the team when he's off the floor, because he's going to be off the floor *a lot,* as he has been his entire career. So the least you want is Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum aint gonna be that guy, but in reality you're looking for another top ten player and the only way you're getting that is if someone demands a trade because after the Hawks series nobody is going to consider a Simmons centric trade for their franchise player. They will hang up very quickly but not before laughing very loudly in your ear.             Going back to Beal, you honestly thing the Wizards are going to want to pair Simmons with Westbrook? That could be the most ill fitting All Star pairing in the entire league. Washington are going to want a lot more than just Ben, they will demand young talent in the form of a Maxey or Thybulle. Sixers will balk at that. But at least an Embiid-Beal pairing would give them a much better chance of competing for championships though would you even put them above the Bucks? A healthy Nets team is going to obliterate them....and that's without knowing what changes the Nets will be making next season, what holes they are going to try and fill. Honestly, this was *the* best chance for the Sixers to go all the way, it's almost comical how many obstacles were removed from their path - Lakers and Nets being the biggest ones, both taken out of the equation...but they blew it and may never have a chance again given the Nets might just be at the beginning of a multi year dynasty."
the entire sub is about CJ McCollum what're you talking about
(A) those are not mutually exclusive so im not sure why you think that matters lol  (B) yes it is. players that lack the ability to consistently get to the free throw line are inherently less efficient scorers. cj mccollum comes to mind
CJ McCollum gotta be top 5
CJ McCollum is the trade
"Gonna be contrarian and say this is smart on the Cavs’ part. Not sure why they even drafted him in the first pkace because he’s 100% not a bust, but he’s a small guard that doesnt playmake. Like a CJ McCollum, just look at Blazers fans ready to move on from CJ. Would extend Allen over Sexton, but if they could pull a sign and trade with Sexton that would be dope."
""" The gang trades CJ McCollum"""

"Smart for CJ doesn’t make sense for us right now. A backcourt of Pritchard and McCollum? We’re getting cooked for 150 a night, just like Portland does now.  I don’t see how we even have the assets to get McCollum or Lillard and get better. It’s lateral at best because the questionable fit unless you’re swapping Lillard and Brown, but I think we’re trying to keep both Jays and bring in a 3rd star through a trade, which would be hard to do this year.  Smart just simply doesn’t get that done. The interesting thing about Smart is he’s maddening to watch on offense and you see him as a 4th-6th man type of guy in terms of skill, but all the teams with star PG’s who have questionable defense (Luka, Trae, Lillard) I’m sure they would love to have him paired with those guys. I don’t really know what his real value is or how much other teams want him"
CJ McCollum was barely breathing hard after 4OT in 2018
"You can't just snap your fingers and get another superstar if you're Portland.  Also for a few years in a row Portland had injuries to key players in the playoffs.  This year they were finally healthy sans Collins and it still didn't go well so they decided to make the coaching change finally.  &gt;  And now reports are CJ Mccollum has been told he's not being traded this offseason.  These reports are nonsense.  They might not trade him, but if they get a deal they like they will.  People who ""heard rumors"" are just saying whatever they want because it's their job."
"read the full article before jumping to conclusions about these pulled quotes. j quick is throwing out a name he thought would be a good addition if boston and portland were trade partners, not someone the blazers would think is a 1 for 1 swap for McCollum. obviously you’d need a larger return for CJ, it’s just a musing"

"Statistically, they're not far apart. Keep in mind CJ is the secondary/tertiary playmaker on the team and his assist numbers would likely go up as the primary ballhandler.

"Anytime an article implies Lillard wants to get rid of McCollum, I call BS. They're literally best friends. I very much doubt Dame would ok a trade for CJ unless it makes the Blazers much much better. Like all the chatter about Ben Simmons for CJ?? Might as well wave goodbye to Lillard if you make that trade."
"I dont think it is  If they could unload tobias harris for CJ mccollum then we are cooking, but that seems less likely"
"Agree or disagree, Kemba is a negative asset that took the #16 to get rid of. You are totally disrespecting the value of Ben Simmons. If you can get CJ McCollum+ for Simmons, why the hell would you take Kemba instead, who is more injured and less skilled.   Rockets basically got the same haul for Robert Covington, and they didn't have to take on an awful max contract, they got an expiring Trevor Ariza"
"His contract is astronomical compared to his production, he’s dangerously close to moving into Al Horford territory where he cant be moved without throwing some incentives into the deal. You cant look at a player like Simmons without factoring in his pay, if he were making 20 million a year you happily pay that for a guy who can primarily contribute only on one end of the court, but for the 33 million he’s going to be making next year I think most teams take a pass unless they’re also looking to move guys on an overpay like CJ McCollum. We don’t have any horrible contracts on the books so it’s unlikely we want to take one on especially when it’s a player who addresses none of our immediate needs"
"&gt; PHI receives: CJ McCollum, Robert Covington POR receives: Ben Simmons, Seth Curry  I pitched this trade like a week and a half ago and Sixers fans destroyed me for suggesting it."
"Ain’t winning anything with CJ McCollum, dude disappears everytime in the playoffs and we keep giving him a pass for no reason."
Paul George said Dames deep game winner over him was a bad shot. I believe the person replying to you though you were talking about that and mixed up CJ McCollum with Dame.
CJ McCollum ;)
CJ Mccollum is way worse than both of them
"My favorite recently was CJ McCollum tweeting out hate for him because he didn't guard KD.  Yeah, that's right, noted defensive expert CJ McCollum."
Prolly could get a guy like CJ McCollum or Malcom Brogdan
John Wall  Eric Gordon  Kevin Love  CJ McCollum
&gt; Y'all can't just trash the guy calling him a garbage and useless player then just expect to trade him for one of the best point guards in the NBA lmao  Cavs fan here inquiring as to your interest in a Kevin Love for Dame Lillard &amp; CJ McCollum swap /s
"Of course not, Draymond fills our needs better. But a team that needs defense, rebounding, and playmaking would trade for him, regardless of contract. You go get the best players you can when you’re trying to contend; salaries don’t matter as much as putting together the best possible team.   If trading CJ McCollum for Ben makes you better, which it does, you do it. Doesn’t matter that he’s overpaid since you’re trying to win and he makes you better."
Definitely trade him. Got a real sinking feeling he's about to get traded for CJ McCollum.....
"I think they trade him for sure.   76ers star player criticized him, their coach criticized him, and he doesn’t really fit their GMs historical mould.   Sometimes relationships just get severed, and you need to do something to switch it up. However I think Simmons trade value is higher than CJ McCollum 1 for 1."
"I've been seeing a disturbing amount of Sixers fans online ask if a Lillard-Simmons trade would be possible.     To answer your question, no, absolutely not. That would be like if we offered you CJ McCollum for Joel Embiid.      Y'all can't just trash the guy calling him a garbage and useless player then just expect to trade him for one of the best point guards in the NBA lmao."
"He’s staying, we are not trading him for dog shit even worse like CJ McCollum or DLO lmao"
76ers fans talking about their wet dreams.   They’ll be lucky to get CJ McCollum.

"De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray"
Best burn to come out of this game so far.  Much respect to CJ McCollum for speaking truth!
CJ McCollum feels attacked right now…
I feel like Garland has the potential to be a CJ McCollum type of player.
"In terms of decision making and controlling the pace, yeah. Being a microwave scorer isn't a knock on him, but he's more of Lou Will/Jordan Clarkson type than say a CJ McCollum (without the stupid foot), who can make sound decisions even if he's not hitting shots. I feel he contributes his best value as a high burst scoring 6th man. Stats really are half of the story in players like him, he's really really good at getting the energy up with scoring, but he doesn't have a size advantage against anyone, doesn't really know how to play with pace too well, so putting him in the starting lineup is not good, especially in a playoff setting."

"Because there’s still people that think he can be useful. If some people in r/nyknicks had their way we’d be sending RJ and Mitch to Philly  When that fire isn’t fueled under his ass, then his value will tank even more. From being able to get maybe CJ McCollum to maybe being able to trade for Kevin Knox"
"CJ McCollum is this authors best trade, lmfao."
Everyone and their mother has been saying CJ McCollum and maybe 1-2 1sts
"Do you think McCollum for Simmons makes sense, and does it have a chance of actually happening? Perhaps with draft compensation included with CJ?"
"if they sell on ben now best theyre getting is like CJ McCollum+ picks. They'd be dumb to trade him for whatever return package theyre going to get this season, even if they want to get out of ben and trade him for a star scorer they should let him pick his value up and then flip him. In a sense it is also risky to keep ben if he is going to sink further but if you're trading for CJ you're not winning a ring, if you keep slumping ben you're not winning a ring, so i dont see the difference."
Ben Simmons and shake Milton for CJ McCollum and RoCo
"Check out our sub.   ""Simmons is literally the worst basketball player on earth and we'd be lucky to get a 2nd round pick for him.""  ""Ok, what if we could get CJ McCollum for him?""  ""No, CJ's defense is bad."""
You really think the wizards don't take a shot with like Beal to grab a guy who could potential fit their timeline better? Or something similar to that effect? I still think Ben can get a Decent return for a bottom end team looking to age down and get value from a star. CJ McCollum maybe on the table too. Ben helps a lot with their defensive shortcomings and wouldn't actually be asked to score much at all for instance.
"Thybulle doesn’t keep them honest though. He only shoots wide open shots and he shoots around 30%. Saying he keeps the defence honest shows that you don’t understand how Thybulle gets his shots throughout the flow of a game.   And KD is a lot better at shooting mid range than CJ. He is also better from just about everyone in the court.    Trailblazers have a good offence so it’s easy to get assists on their team. It’s like how 3 guys average 20 points and 5 assists with another guard also averaging 6.6 assist on top of it. Your listing something that isn’t uncommon in today’s league, and multiple teams surpass that mark.   Booker also played as the primary playmaker before and he averaged 6.8 assists in a season with little offensive help. He did it for a bigger sample size than 30 games.   Funny, the reason why McCollum isn’t a good play maker is because he doesn’t create good looks for teammates very often, and frequently goes for a bad shot instead. Listing guys that aren’t primary playmakers as reasons why CJ should be considered a good playmaker is a weird take.   It’s almost as if CJ isn’t as good of a playmaker as Lillard (who isn’t even as good as elite playmakers).   30 game sample size is a lot less than the 500 game sample size indicating CJ isn’t a great playmaker.   Kyrie is also a lot better playmaker than CJ and playmaking is kindof a knock on his game.   And yeah you repeated yourself a lot! It’s almost like you have 2 statistics!  Thanks for playing though, you were proven wrong again!"
"He literally had dudes that were saying they wouldn't want to trade him for James Harden, now a lot of those guys would be happy if he was traded for CJ McCollum"
"If we didn’t have Nurkic, KP might make sense for us to take a flyer on. But since we already have Nurk, I just don’t think you can play him and KP much in games together in today’s NBA where every team is going small (too slow defensively). I also am not sure if KP would be much of an upgrade over Nurkic as our starting 5 (particularly defensively which is what we have to upgrade in the offseason), certainly not enough to where I think it would be worth giving up McCollum.  The biggest need for us right now is definitely a lockdown perimeter on ball defender, so Simmons would significantly help us from that standpoint. Obviously, it is not totally clear what anyone is getting from Simmons on the offensive end. However, I’d try to trade CJ for him straight up and see what type of offense you can build around him with Dame. B/c of Dame’s incredible shooting, it makes sense that Simmons would fit much better next to him than he does with Embiid."
Simmons CJ McCollum Duncan Robinson OG Anunoby  Brook Lopez
"So what teams makes sense logically to trade simmons to? I still nominate the blazers. Lets be honest, theyre gonna have to go into a rebuild mode unless they can magically grab a star player to pair with Dame. I would never trade Dame from 5 years ago. But dame at his age right now for Simmons at his age and maximum amount of picks allowed in a trade and maybe a Shake Milton or Maxey as a throw in sounds good.  Why sixers do it: Dame is 30 years old. while hes starting to get up there in age, you still have 4 or 5 years of him in his prime. Hes got a killer instinct and knows how to take over a game. Also has knocked down some big time shots. Basically provides the offensive punch that ben couldnt provide. Hes the star that Embiid neees to play besides.  Why Blazers do it: right now, Dame is the far superior player. But as stated above, you only have 4-5 years of his prime left. This is more about securing all the picks you can get for a eventual rebuild while still fielding a somewhat competitve team right now. As bad as Ben was offensively, he still is a 6'10 pg that can dish dimes, rebound, and play defense. And hes only 24 years old. The plan should be to surround him with as many shooters as you can and maybe one star player that can do the main scoring. For the time being you can use bens ability to pass to build inflated value on cj mccollum. Having a milton or maxey will also help with bench production.   Cap wise the money should be close.  Whats everyone elses nomination for a destination? Im a knicks fan so this isnt me trying to dream up a way to get dame or simmons on my team."
"I think it depends. I think the Sixers try to play hardball with his value and pretended the playoffs don't exist and see if anyone bites in regards to some of the more coveted stars on the market. I think they come back realizing they're not going to get Bradley Beal without giving up pics and other young players. They could probably get CJ McCollum I would imagine so it comes down to does demarre even want to go to Philadelphia oh, and who would the Sixers prefer of those  two mid-tier Stars. I definitely think the Spurs would do that in a heartbeat"
All I’ve got is CJ McCollum.
"I think the ideal play would be to try to convince Damar to do a sign-and-trade and attach some low-level pick compensation. I think the Sixers are going to try to snag someone like beal and find the amount of resources they will need to give up unpalatable. When that happens someone like CJ McCollum are DeMar would probably be their best bet. Despite his poor outside shooting I actually think Damar would be the better fit as a primary ball-handler and secondary score who would still be able to get the Sixers shooters open locks and provide a nice secondary option off of embiid double teams. As a Spurs fan Murray being traded would be heartbreaking for me. He's such a big part of the Spurs maintaining their culture post Big Three, and a lot of the league is sleeping on the fact that he has improved immensely the last 12 months. I think the Spurs with likely consider it however."
I think y’all should trade him for CJ McCollum.  Both teams improve instantly
"It would be interesting to see what Toronto's coaching &amp; development staff could do with Simmons, and maybe teach him to shoot (and get him to actually do it).  But I don't think the basic math of it works, because it's a bad contract that Toronto doesn't need.  Simmons is due to make:  $31,590,000  $33,930,000 	  $36,270,000 	  $38,610,000  ...over the next 4 years.   He's simply not worth that salary.  And Toronto doesn't need to take-on that salary. --  In contrast, a team like Portland has CJ McCollum who isn't a good fit next to Damian Lillard, and McCollum has a big salary too.  So Portland does need to do something with that salary, and Simmons is a better fit than McCollum.  Philly and Portland are both stuck paying those high salaries, so they may as well do the swap.  But Toronto doesn't need to take on a bad contract."
I'll trade you one 30 year old lightly used CJ McCollum for a 24 year old Ben Simmons straight up.
"hot take but simmons is not statistically bad, his deeper advanced numbers show that. does he get inflated assist numbers....yes. so does everyone these days. but we have been shown that what works in the reg season does not work in the playoffs where it counts. also the data set is much smaller in the playoffs for some of these guys.   all in all, i think ben can work on some teams and right now he might be a pretty good bargain. i actually don't think cj mccollum is worth ben simmons or even lonzo ball...if we were trading in a vacuum. But as the teams stand both those players seem more worthwhile than ben for the 76'ers"
"I love CJ, but he’s already hit his ceiling and I don’t think they’re contenders with just McCollum and Embiid. They lack a ton of depth outside of Embiid asset wise so they’d be trading away their future on the limb that CJ is enough. I’d rather keep Simmons and hope he develops personally"
"No, I get it. Hypothetically, the best case scenario is a 14 point, 7 rebounding PF (Turners best season) and a Ben Simmons that’s stat stuffing, but is an offensive liability in the post season.  Worst case scenario is Ben with the yips and an okay-ish Myles Turner that’s giving you slightly more than what Portland already has.  Is that worth a CJ McCollum is the question. For me, I don’t think so, but I could understand how the best case scenario would be enticing."
McCollum for Ben makes too much sense  Blazers have to try something new and replace CJ. He’s a great player but he and Dame have peaked as a duo.   Having Simmons with Powell and Dame would be a good fit IMO. And CJ would be amazing on the Sixers.

"CJ was out a huge chunk of this season and offense didn’t suffer any noticeable drop off. That’s what having offensive depth means. Sacrificing the offense of ONE player doesn’t mean a net subtraction of team points scored. Meanwhile, they would gain a facilitator, big-bodied player who can defend multiple positions, which McCollum absolutely cannot."
"It absolutely makes more sense. With Ben gone, the 76ers will need a new primary playmaker. Despite Simmons' limitations in that department, he's still their best playmaker. CJ McCollum may offer valuable off-the-dribble scoring, but he certainly isn't plugging the playmaking hole. Buddy Hield offers nothing over Simmons besides a willingness to shoot it and the ability to hit free throws. Hayward would be a decent fit on the 76ers, but he's not a primary playmaker in the way Lowry is, and I don't see the Hornets giving up Hayward for a player who is far, far more limited when Hayward's do-everything ability is one of the keys to our system. Lowry is already on his way out the door; this gives the 76ers an opportunity to get a playmaker they can't afford in their current cap predicament, Lowry a chance to get a final payday and help his hometown get a ring, and the rebuilding Raptors a chance to Sam Presti a player whose stock is currently at its lowest while giving up a guy they were going to lose for nothing."
"at the time, yes, that was laughable because his stock was so high while mcCollum was still injured. Context matters and in this one, Simmons' stock is at an all time low now, while CJ played pretty well so the trade would make sense now, even if a few months removed. Shit, two weeks ago, that trade would've been laughed at. Timing is everything. That's why people buy stock when it's low."
Idk a CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons trade sounds kinda nice for both teams right now
I thought about this trade but it doesn't make sense for the Blazers. McCollum is the next option on offense so without him they have literally no one capable of scoring 20-25 a night to help Dame. I wouldn't do this trade if I was the Blazers. CJ has a big contract and not sure if he is that much better than Seth. The Trade just doesn't seem to make that sense for either team's needs.
I’ll go against the grain.  They shouldn’t trade him.  More like they can’t trade him.  The only way they contend is if they get a top 10-15 player in return.  Everyone likes to say CJ McCollum but they aren’t going to win with him.  He’s just basically a slightly better Seth Curry.  Maybe a Beal sign and trade?  No idea what amount of assets the Sixers would have to package to entice Washington if Beal even agrees to do a sign and trade
"There’s a zero percent chance a team with CJ McCollum as their 2 option and Nurkic who’s a solid center needed to be dragged and were a bad supporting cast. That’s insane revisionist history. They also had Ariza and Carmelo who are solid role players. That team pushed the Nuggets to 7, dragged them my ass. The Mavs that year were worse and still made the playoffs."
"Seriously, why would Portland execs want to make Dame’s job even harder than it is? At least CJ can help out when Dame has an off night.   Portland is better off hoping Embiid demands a trade. Embiid/Hill for salary reasons for McCollum/Nurkic/four future picks could possibly do it…if Embiid pulls a Harden."
CJ McCollum when he goes to Philly
&gt;he’d fit perfectly into the Blazers with McCollum.  Yeah because the Blazers are just salivating at massively overpaying for Simmons with Dame and teaming him up with CJ. This delusion is exactly why I want the Sixers to suffer ten times more from the Ben fiasco.
Low key CJ McCollum would be better for them
"CJ McCollum is not a thing. You talk about poise, I think Simmons would be more likely to give a fuck 👿"
"Not trading an all star, DPOY candidate who’s literally on his first year of a max contract for 31yo streaky scorer black hole on defense CJ McCollum = handling the situation badly.   Awful take, sorry you’ve been misled by this sub into thinking a team should automatically comply with whatever a player wants even if it means trading stars for role players."
"The NBA and Blazers content I have consumed seems to indicate restructuring is a possibility... there has clearly been some discussion of Simmons to POR. Doesn't mean it is likely to happen, but it is a realistic possibility.   https://ripcityproject.com/2021/09/22/portland-trail-blazers-rumors-ben-simmons-cj-mccollum/  ""In the last 24 hours, controversial talking head Stephen A. Smith added his two cents, saying that sources had informed him of a potential Portland Trail Blazers package involving CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, and picks.      Stephen A clearly isn’t a reputable source for information around whether certain trades work under the league’s CBA rules, but he is likely to have league sources who have given him this info.      There have been multiple reports though that confirm this, from sources such as Woj, and ESPN’s Zach Lowe.      This package may be slightly inflated as a starting point, as Covington is worth one or two first-round picks on his own, so there is no way Neil Olshey sends multiple picks as per the report from Stephen A. The likely deal would be Covington and McCollum and a pick, and then the Sixers send one player back make the salaries match, and then even up the deal."""
Nwora gonna have a 2016 mip cj mccollum kinda year
If you’re saying “nothing including Ben Simmons” vs “CJ McCollum” for Joel Embiid’s prime I think you’re wrong
Acquiring Malcolm brogdon or CJ McCollum is not maximizing Embiid’s prime.
It does make sense for the Wizards if Beal forces their hand and wants a trade to a contending team.    What is a better offer than Ben Simmons and role players? Why would another team give a better offer?     The Blazers already offered McCollum and we said no we want DAME. So your argument of Dame needs the ball in his hand doesn’t make sense. We would get Dame from the trade not CJ
"Simmons wasted it, not Morey. Tell me the deal that was actually on the table in the last 6 months that would have salvaged this season for the 76ers. Trading Simmons and bench guys for CJ McCollum isn't helping Embiid beat the Nets."
"He went way too high with the price. He could have milked a bit more out of some of the teams. Thing is, CJ McCollum and like 3 picks would have been so much better than this"
&gt;Don't forget this insane man wanted 3 firsts and 3 swaps and CJ McCollum. That's delusional...  Probably but if Portland implodes they can get a lot closer to that than they can now.
"Naw man, people don't understand this for some reason. They don't want picks, they want an all-star for allstar replacement. I guarantee you our buddy, Bagley, and 1 or 2 firsts is still available. Don't forget this insane man wanted 3 firsts and 3 swaps and CJ McCollum. That's delusional..."
Like a CJ McCollum or Nikola Vucevic
CJ McCollum has bizarrely become the most underrated player on this while subreddit just due to this whole saga lol
"Problem is that they will get worse by trading him. A Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum trade (or something similar) makes the Sixers worse.   They really should have traded him a year or two ago, though that would have required a level of foresight that is very rare. Even those who thought Simmons would need to be traded eventually because of his fit with Embiid weren't predicting his trade value would collapse if the Sixers waited."
&gt; Brogdon and LeVert or CJ McCollum and picks would have been fantastic returns for Simmons this off-season  Brogdon and LeVert are perpetually hurt and no team using CJ McCollum as their primary PG is going to win anything.   &gt; Don't expect other fanbases to abide by your GM's batshit crazy asks and come up with ways for you guys to come away with a top 25 player in return for Ben Simmons.  I dont think I have ever asked that of other fanbases.   &gt; Do you genuinely think the offers will get better?  I don’t think the Sixers viewed any of the offers that were available as packages that would keep Joel and Tobias in contention.
"C. J. McCollum. For the love of God, please trade us Ben for CJ. I would rather Portland chooses any direction than running back some failed retread team with no chance this year."
"Possibly be realistic and not expect a top 25 player for a locker room cancer who's an AWOL risk?  Brogdon and LeVert or CJ McCollum and picks would have been fantastic returns for Simmons this off-season  Don't expect other fanbases to abide by your GM's batshit crazy asks and come up with ways for you guys to come away with a top 25 player in return for Ben Simmons. It's not realistic and stopped being realistic as soon as training camp started, maybe earlier.  Do you genuinely think the offers will get better?"
"At some point, we need to put a little more thought into this than: IM MAD. CULTURE CULTURE CHEMISTRY CULTURE.  The Sixers can trade for CJ McCollum any time they want and guarantee themselves 2nd round exits for the next 3 years.  That is on the table.  The reason they're not doing that is they want more than 2nd round exits for the next few years.  Simmons is their best asset for getting another star.  Morey is not going to trade him because a Knicks fan is personally offended."
His value's probably around a CJ McCollum level of player but he's tanked it so much that it's hard to see it being that high now. I thought the brogdon+Levert deal floated around was pretty acceptable.
Yup which is why his trade value is not good. No one wants to give up anything of value for Simmons  CJ McCollum and roco is probably the best they can do for Simmons right now
CJ McCollum is not a bad trade.
No it really isn’t. We know the sixers aren’t resolving this situation and we know he can’t play in big games. His trade value right now is probably CJ McCollum honestly
Do you see the Portland roster ? I much rather think he’d join Embiid and Tobias Harris than cj mccollum and nurk
"&gt;Exactly it's not that these players are getting overpaid it's that the best players of the league get way underpaid because their actual value is astronomical.  I actually think it's both.  Obviously guys like Steph and LeBron are WAY underpaid. But the number of guys with Messi-like value is TINY.   And my guess is that someone like Klay (healthy) is probably pretty close to properly valued.   But Tobias Harris, Andrew Wiggins, Kristaps, CJ McCollum etc are overpaid. The Mavs overpaid Harrison Barnes when they signed him from the Warriors. And you look at those guys, and, generally, their contact is set by (or relative to) the max.   One point of reference might be shoe deals. There are three players with shoe deals worth over $20m annually: LeBron, KD, and Steph. (Steph was over $30m, but I saw something that suggests it's only $20m now.) Nobody else is over $15m."
"I mean they both have punchable faces. But if you want me to list non-white guys, I’d punch CJ McCollum, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Chris Paul"
"Agree/disagree is not a good way to approach it, as there are many nuances to any potential deal, and other factors that come into play as to why the blazers are so disappointing in the post season.  Regarding a Simmons trade, you have to consider what Daryl's asking price is. The only public report we have of Morey wanting CJ was Portland rejecting an asking price of McCollum, 3 first round picks, and 3 pick swaps - fuck that.  Our GM Neil Olshey blamed coaching, which was a problem (not the biggest problem imo) so we got a new coach - we will see if that helps.  Our bench gave up alot of points last season with a Kanter/Melo front court, and nobody but mccollum to generate an offense, we addressed that by replacing Kanter with Zeller, and Melo with Nance. We will once again see if that helps.  CJ and Dame are a liability on defense, but they are the biggest contributors for our offense. In theory, a backcourt of Dame and Norm Powell should be just as productive, but bringing Ben Simmons into the fold with Nurkic then creates spacing issues in the front court.  I support a move for Simmons, but I don't want to give up 3 picks for it, and if Daryl keeps shopping Simmons at that price then I'm more content just keeping CJ or finding a deal for a different wing."
"#Rotation  **PG:** Lillard (35 min); Simons (13 min)  **SG:** McCollum (35 min); Simons (13 min)  **SF:** Powell (32 min); Snell (16 min)  **PF:** Covington (28 min); Nance (20 min)  **C:** Nurkic (28 min); Zeller (15 min); Nance (5 min)   #Expanded Rotation  These aren't exact, but it gives a fairly decent idea of what our rotation might look like. One thing to notice is that there is almost always at least two high end defenders on the court at a time (Nurk, RoCo, Nance). Also, there are never more than two truly negative defenders (Dame, CJ, Simons).  Note: in reality the 2nd and 4th quarters wouldn't be exactly the same. Starters would get a couple more minutes in the 4th.     1st/3rd Quarter| 0-3 | 3-6 | 6-9 | 9-12  ---|---|----|----|----|---- PG | Lillard| Lillard | Lillard | Lillard  SG| McCollum| McCollum | Powell | Simons  SF| Powell  | Powell | Snell | Snell  PF| Covington | Covington | Covington | Nance  C| Nurkic | Nurkic  | Zeller | Zeller    2nd/4th Quarter| 0-3 | 3-6 | 6-9 | 9-12  ---|---|----|----|----|---- PG | Simons| Simons | Lillard | Lillard  SG| McCollum| McCollum | Simons | McCollum   SF| Snell  | Powell | Powell  | Powell   PF| Nance | Nance| Covington | Covington C| Zeller | Zeller   | Nance | Nurkic   #Minute distribution  - Lillard (35 min)  - McCollum (35 min)  - Powell (32 min)  - Nurkic (28 min)  - Covington (28 min)  - Simons (26 min)  - Nance (25 min)  - Snell (16 min)  - Zeller (15 min)"
"I’m not comparing him to the rest of the league though, such as big men, I’m comparing him to SGs as his contributions to Boston can be compared with other guard’s contributions to their teams.  He’s the 10th highest paid SG, 26th highest paid Guard going into 2021-22 and performing with the aforementioned stats. He’s paid accurately, not overpaid, not underpaid. Only guards that are making more than him and aren’t better are De’Aaron Fox ($28M), D’Angelo Russell ($30M), CJ McCollum ($30.8M), Ben Simmons ($33M), John Wall ($44.3M) - those guys are probably overpaid, even if it is slightly. Maybe throw Klay Thompson ($37.9M) because we haven’t seen him in 2 years, and Westbrook at $44.2M. I wouldn’t say he should be paid at their levels because those guys are overpaid, hence Brown is paid accurately for his contributions."
Poole reminds me of a young CJ McCollum and I think he could end up being a similar kind of player down the road. And most of the time CJ's offense makes up for his bad defense.

CJ Mccollum 2.0
"This sub is just so salty the Sixers don’t want to trade all their teams an All-NBA, All-Defense point guard for literally nothing.   Not trading Ben right now is easily the right move. His value and the Sixers leverage is at its all time low right now. There is quite literally no downside in waiting. They aren’t a championship contender without Ben and they’re not a championship contender by getting a shitty trade package like CJ McCollum and a pick.  The shitty trade packages are going to almost always be there there’s no point in not waiting especially if Embiid is on board."
"&gt;But what if I think a trade like Simmons for McCollum and a pick + pick swap does move the needle for them?  There's no indication that has been offered by the Blazers or that CJ is actually even available. And if Morey tries to push for that deal rather than letting something like that come to him, it could hurt his negotiations with other teams."
CJ McCollum is not a mid-level roleplayer ffs. If CJ was in the East he'd be like a 3 time all-star.
"I really agree with you here. BUT, Mccollum is an undersized shooting guard who would not make it easy to construct the rest of the roster around. Curry and Thybulle are great role players but it would be almost impossible to play CJ and Curry together. I’m not sure what curry trades are out there that make sense to complement that team better. CJ/Thybulle/Green/Harris/Embiid lineups sound great but not sure if they’d be a true contender"

But Poole becoming a slightly more athletic CJ McCollum makes them title contenders which is huge.
Probably not. Poole's ceiling is basically a slightly more athletic CJ McCollum in a bigger market and that's not a superstar level player.
The best team considering fit is probably:  Shai Gilegous Alexander  CJ McCollum  OG Anunoby  Tobias Harris  Clint Capela  6: De'aron Fox  7: Ayton  8: Morant  9: MPJ  10: Sexton  11: Wood  12: Isaac
"Ben is way, way over rated. I seriously hope he goes to Sacramento. Cuz no contender is gona give up an actually valuable asset for him.   Im not a fan of CJ McCollum, but I absolutly would NOT trade him for Ben. If Ben was 27 or 28 this wouldn't even be a discussion. His value is in his age.   He can play defense, but he's an offensive liability. He's a max player, who can't play on the 4th quarter. Well he can't play in the last 4 min at least.    Would you trade Marcus Smart for Ben Simmons right now? FUCK NO. Truth is the fact you'd have to think about that is sad.   Ben's getting paid like KD, Steph, AD, Dame, etc., but he's no where near those guys in actual ability and skill level.   The fact he's doing this, cuz he's in his feelings, is crazy to me. I know it's not easy to handle being in Philly, but that's why he gets paid more than God. I'm not saying the money makes it ok to treat him like shit, but no one has said or done anything crazy in reality. No one has openly disrespected or called him names, in public or in the media.   Everybody's walking on egg shells and he's somehow still offended. It surprised the fuck out of me.   Joel didn't go Gilbert Arenas and pull a gun on him, Doc didn't go Mike Singeltary and call him a loser, Jimmy didn't say anything bad about Ben on his way out. I mean Morrey and Doc, but more so Brand and Brown before that, have built the team around him. They've done everything possible to put him a position to be successful.   He chokes it away, every year, and blames everyone but himself. Like dude you can go thru, and watch his performance in last year's playoffs.   He choked in the 4th quarter of EVERY.SINGLE.GAME vs ATL. He was fucking terrible. I think he had 4 points total for the 4th quarter in that series, and it went like 5 or 6 games, I'm not sure.  Doc and Joel haven't handled this the best, but at the same time, it's no where near as bad as some other coaches, GM's and/or reporters and fans, have been towards other players. And he's in Philly, they fucking boo'd Santa.   I swear this situation is so fucking bizarre. They hurt his feelings cuz he's, single handedly, cost them 2 playoff series' in 3 years now.   You can say the bubble fucked every one up, but last year, without a doubt is on him.   You can argue that if he was a halfway decent offensive player, Philly beats Toronto in '19, and that series doesn't come down to Khawi's buzzer beater.   He's a Tier 2 player, being paid Tier 1A money.   I bet he ends up back in Philly cuz aight no one giving up shit for a point guard, who's owed $150,000,000, and can't shoot. Lmfao he's the most expensive ""hustle and heart"" guy ever. Funny thing is, between last year's playoffs and this off-season, he's proven he has neither.    But what I wana see is how he's gona respond now that it's clear no other GM, or team in general, believes he has any real value. I mean fucking John Wall is on the trading block and Houston isn't willing to part with the corpse of Wall for Simmons. No one masse a real offer for you, and that's gotta hurt a lil.    If I'm Ben, I feel worse now than I did before. But I'll dry my tears with my super max bonus I guess..."
"says they want a 3 team trade for an all star caliber player  theoretical trade:  Sexton, 2023 first round pick, 2025 second round pick for CJ Mccollum  CJ Rubio and 2024 2025 1st round picks for Simmons"
Look I think the CJ McCollum trade rumor was ridiculous as well but he also has never been an all-star. Hell I don't think he's ever been a top snub either and he is going to be 30 this year. The trade should've been CJ and a first (and maaaaybe a swap too) for Ben. Ben is a better asset than CJ but not 3 1sts better.
It's like CJ McCollum said. Gotta have that irrational confidence until you get there
"This is the only reason that Im holding back from going full anti Simmons. Yes, he's not nearly as good as he thinks. Yes, it's his fault that he hasn't even touched his potential. Yes, he's been Uber coddled by the organization. But... Morey is being ridiculous in this. He doesn't fit the team and they will be a better team with a CJ McCollum or other not-quite-all-star. This is why Morey is the most overrated GM on the NBA. He never looks at fit or team building. All he cares about is having a stars."
Afraid of getting hurt. Just ask CJ McCollum when Clint Caplea stepped on &amp; broke his foot last season. It can be pretty dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Please let’s just stop the madness. Either trade Simmons for Irving or trade Irving or Simmons for CJ McCollum or M. Brogdon and let’s move along.
"I had a dream before that I was CJ McCollum in an NBA game and was so bad I was getting booed.  Such a weird dream why the fuck was I CJ McCollum(not that I dislike CJ, it was just random as hell)."
"Zions also no Giannis, really the Pels should trade him for a solid guard like CJ McCollum"
"If I could use a relative comparison-scale with Steve Kerr at 1; Derek fisher at 5; Kyle Lowry at 10... Kenny would sit somewhere around say 6.  At his best, he was a respectable 3rd option of a 90's championship team and made a living at hitting open threes at the grace of Hakeem's gravity.   Objectively, having those nerves to hit big shots when it mattered could be Kenny's greatest quality - as you could imagine as a common characteristic with those comparisons I've listed.  I believe Kenny thinks of himself as someone as good or even better than a Kyle Lowry or CJ McCollum but the reality is he's a few notches below that caliber....and it's hilarious that both Shaq and Charles have had no problems reminding him of that haha."
Comparing CJ McCollum to Dean Malinko is why Lowe gets the big bucks
"It's in his best interest if he wants to actually get traded lol. Philly ain't gonna trade him for peanuts, they need to actually get something they want or they just ain't gonna deal. Now obviously they are asking for too much, but someone like CJ McCollum imo would be a pretty good return."
"Moreys deadline is one of the following -  A) the trade deadline B) sooner if it appears the Sixers could miss the playoffs and a trade would help  B is unlikely and waiting til the trade deadline doesn’t waste Embiids time.   Embiid is smart enough to know the same thing Lebron, Kawhi and Giannis know…the regular season doesn’t mean shit at their level.   This is unlikely but the example I use: would you rather have CJ McCollum now or wait three months and get Dame Lilliard."
"I predicted that multiple redshirt sixers simply would destroy their future and team building stock, and I feel like it has. They've been unable to field a really organized (read: championship level) team for so long at this point that I'm afraid Embiid's window is going to close before they get the chance again, and it will be because Ben never developed. Ben would have been a great asset to try to trade for DeMar, Lavine, CJ McCollum, etc, that caliber of player would have been perfect around a year ago.  I also predicted that James Harden and the Rockets would never actually win a championship in that solo-focus system they were running, and they never did. Harden is obviously great but I remember making that prediction during / after the series against the Warriors where they should've had it, and I got blasted for it lol"
CJ McCollum in the playoffs or Dame really will ask out
"Traded to the Warriors once Morey accepts he’s not going to trade him for a superstar, or pillage the Blazers of the next 7 years of draft picks alongside CJ McCollum,"
In all seriousness i see a CJ Mccollum type
No. His ceiling is a slightly bigger CJ McCollum.
"Because all star teams are popularity contests? And there are plenty of people that make all nba/all star teams because of defense, for example Gobert last year. Or like Ben Simmons, who averages like a 15/7/7. Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green are all guys that have gotten all nba honors based off of their defense.   Guys like Thybulle and Roberson don't get on their because there are players like them that are also better on offense, i.e. Kawhi/PG13/Butler/CP3. Same reason that guys like Rudy Gay or CJ McCollum or Malcolm Brogdon aren't making it despite having 20+ppg scoring. There are players that do what they do better plus other stuff better"
"I still think they should trade CJ to a team to get a better wing defender who doesn’t need the ball in his hand so much, and then have Powell as the second option on the team.  I actually think pretty highly of McCollum, especially compared to this sub at times, but I just think it would be a better fit for what Portland needs.  But, if it’s a roster construction issue, one thing we can say for certain is that Olshey will fuck it up and then try to pass the blame on to someone else."
"Can I ask you something? So in 2019, the Sixers were extremely close to the ECF, correct? The Kawhi shot that barely went in was the deciding factor? And it seems like the prevalent opinion is that Ben is complete cheeks in the playoffs, right?  So ig my question is how a return for Simmons in the order of CJ McCollum and another piece like Covington isn't even worth trying? Like yeah, maybe it's not quite a fair value, but it's something. You get both quality offense and defense from those two, you end up with more spacing, and you get to try for what you already almost achieved with the shit performances of Ben Simmons."
"According to reports he's already being offered Brogdan, Levert and a first from the Pacers. And if Stephen A is to be believed then the Blazers [offered](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10012982-stephen-a-ben-simmons-trade-for-mccollum-covington-picks-discussed-by-blazers) CJ, Covington, and Picks. Those are far from horrible trades. If he's not taking that deal immediately then he must be extremely sure that an even greater deal is on the horizon, and he knows more than us."
I think he will be on par with CJ McCollum this season. His scoring won't be as high since he won't get enough attempts but overall he will be on that level.
The next CJ McCollum.
"man if jordan poole continues taking leaps in his game and can eventually become a cj mccollum like player, lord have mercy lmao."
I did not see them adding a CJ McCollum type player to their team…
CJ McCollum and 1 frp
I’m not saying this is a super reasonable offer but this thread is massively overrating CJ McCollum in pursuit of dunking on Ben Simmons and Morey
"3 first, 3 swaps, AND CJ McCollum.  Philly would be fortunate if portland accepted a straight CJ for Ben swap at this point."
"CJ McCollum + 1 1st round picks + 1-2 1st round swaps feels like a good trade for both teams, as good as PHI is likely to get."
"It would be a steal for Portland if CJ Elleby is traded for Ben Simmons.    But seriously, a straight up swap is the ideal transaction. Morey is just asking for too much. CJ McCollum would be fantastic for the 76ers. He would do 99% of what Lillard could do for them. Ben would finally fill the hole in the wing that the blazers needed since Batum left."
fair trade would be CJ McCollum for simmons
Blazers swap their best player of all time and CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons and Harrison Barnes 😂😂
"ah yes, just what utah wants. getting rid of their two all-stars that they drafted, for ben simmons, who utah fans hate, and cj mccollum, who no one cares about"
Better option than what? CJ McCollum? Yea. How long will Embiid stick around for a team left with literally 0 avenues to improve? They have to get this right and they’re better off waiting for something to change than trading just to trade. Not sure why this is so hard for everyone to understand.
To me his trade value is now like a Malcolm brogdon and a pick or Cj McCollum To me ideal scenario for the sixers jow is to add assets with ben and get an allstar calibre perimeter creator..Ben and a pick for someone like DeAaron Fox .or if finally Beal or lillard ask lut him and other assets for them..I dont see them getting anywhere close to his own value at this rate..  To me the kings solution or a swap for Diangelo russell is the most exciting.. obviously because of how both teams require a defensive anchor and have shooters to surround him with
"Morey: ""Hey Bob, I've got the Blazers ready to give me 3 firsts, 3 swaps, and CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons.  But you guys can have him with this special limited time offer for Klay Thompson, 4 firsts, and 3 swaps!  Whatdyasay Bob? We gotta deal?"""
"You think ""rock-bottom"" is 3 1sts, 3 swaps &amp; CJ McCollum, and that his value can only go up from that?"
"CJ McCollum and 2 firsts (one protected) is good for both sides. As much as we are ragging on Philly, Portland is even more desperate for a great wing imo."
"&gt; I don't think it's true that every team would max him  Name a team that wouldn't give him the max. One of the best defenders in the NBA at the most important position in the NBA who has created more open and made 3 point shots than any other player in the NBA over the last four years and raises his teams shooting percentage by nearly double digits every time he's on the floor compared to off is getting the max no matter how poor his playoff showing just was.   &gt; He's certainly been better than CJ  I'm confused how you can admit this then contest the fact that the guy above you said Simmons is worth more, which is undeniably true. Simmons' value hasn't been tanked anywhere close to CJ market levels.  &gt; Ben for CJ straight-up isn't the current discussion, so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  It's not, the discussion is whether Ben is worth more than CJ, which you've already seemingly admitted despite objecting one comment earlier. I'm not really sure what point *you're* trying to make which is why I commented in the first place. Seems like you're just arguing a point for the sake of criticizing Simmons even though the guy you replied to thinks the exact same thing as you. It's obvious his market value is lower because of his actions, it's even more obvious that he's still going to command more than just CJ McCollum which was the initial point."
Morey is getting way too much heat for the Simmons negotiations. yes his asking price is a joke but there's no point in trading for something that doesn't move the needle for them. CJ McCollum would just put the Sixers in 1st/2nd round hell for the next 5 years. Doesn't hurt to wait throughout the season and see if anything better comes out from desperate teams.
"That's not really what he said though.  ""The Blazers and Pacers have lead guards in CJ McCollum and Malcolm Brogdon who could entice the 76ers in a potential package but neither has gained traction for Philadelphia""  \---Video Cuts---  ""The 76ers I'm told asked the Trail Blazers for three 1st round picks and three draft swaps as part of a potential package but Portland reject that proposal""  That's exactly what he said at 1:41, the first comment is more of a general comment while the second is actual news and doesn't mention CJ."
I cant believe they have CJ Mccollum and Vucevic as the same odds as OG  Not saying OG will win it but why are 2 30 year old all star level players higher than OG
"Morey doesn’t have to justify shit to Ben/Rich Paul. They are the ones who are not meeting their end of the bargain by not showing up.   This is simply his price. He wants Dame or Beal, or a pile of assets that will get him Dame or Beal later. There is no scenario where the Sixers blow their last asset to trade for CJ McCollum straight up."
"Since this isn;t the Sixers sub where all of this has been discussed endlessly here, a couple points to throw out to let you know where I am coming from here:   1.  Joel Embiid is a MUCH better OFFENSIVE player with Ben Simmons on the court vs without him.  More efficient, better shooting percentages, better advanced stats.   2.  Sixers starting lineup with Ben Simmons is +15.9, and was statistiaclly top 3 in the league amongst starting lineups OFFENSIVELY.  Without Ben Simmons on the floor, the Sixers had one of the worst Offensive ratings   3.  The Sixers have no financial flexibility.  Approx 24 million over cap so no signings of deep meaning will happen, Tobias Harris is an above average player but is a negative trade asset and is under contract for years.  This contract is a huge limiting factor, so one of our 3 max guys would cost us more to move him.   4.  Ben Simmons is the only playmaker / primary ball handler on the roster.  Even if Ben was playing, about 10-15 minutes a game a 30% shooter in Maxey (who is more of a 2 guard then playmaker anyways) or Shake Milton would be the backup and would again cause our offense to tank without Simmons, and in 2021-2022 we now have 48 minutes a game of no PG to look forward to at this point.   5.  Biggest need for the team was a shot creator to play alongside Ben.  If Ben is traded, our biggest need becomes a primary ball handler.  Spacing around Joel is not the biggest need (see the Sixers offensively with an on shooter in Simmons).  Perfect world we trade Tobias for a guy like CJ Mccollum and Ben suits up.  That would provide a bigger then 0% chance to advance and improve upon our squad from last year.  Unfortunately this ship has sailed and has no shot of happening, Ben is never going to see the court for us again.   6.  To address your comment about Embiid...If Ben Simmons is traded for peanuts, then yes Morey will trade Embiid in the next few years, and will trade Danny Green, Seth Curry, and other role players this year most likely.  It is definitely rebuild time.  Luckily for us Ben Simmons is under contract for 4 years, so there is no panic."
"&gt; The Portland Trail Blazers’ C.J. McCollum is a better player than Brogdon and LeVert.   Bwahahaha!  They're going to trade Simmons for Brogdon, and throw in Caris because trading Simmons for Brogdon instead of CJ is laughable on its face!      &gt; He just doesn’t fill the bill at the point guard spot like Brogdon.  Yeah, Jordan just didn't fit the bill like Sam Bowie either."
"&gt;If Simmons had value someone would've already traded for him.  Are you unfamiliar with the Simmons situation? The reason he hasn't been traded isn't because he has no value. It's because nobody wants to offer a package that actually meets his value. He's worth more than a CJ McCollum or a Colin Sexton.  &gt;Teams have probably been laughing the Sixers off the phone all offseason.  They've been getting laughed off the phone because Morey is an idiot asking way too much. There's a middle ground between ""Dame and picks"" vs ""No value"".  &gt;Even if you are a good player if the other teams think you have no value, then you dont have value.  Teams know he has value, that's why teams like Minny and Indiana want him super badly."
CJ McCollum would be an awesome analyst IMO.  I think also Andre Iguodala would be interesting as an occasional contributor.
"Cj has averaged over 20 ppg for the past 5 consecutive seasons playing behind Dame, while also being a decent playmaker. Brogdon had a great season, but McCollum is better player imo.   And with Levert it’s not as close as it is with Brogdon. He’s not efficient and is a tier below Cj. But Leverts best years are probably still to come"
"Brogdon is probably the best overall player right now, but CJ is a more gifted scorer, and Sexton probably has the highest ceiling. Specifically if I were the Sixers, I'd prioritize them at:  1. Brogdon 2. McCollum 3. Russell 4. Sexton"
Brogdon is the obvious pick imo he's still a great defender and playmaker. Then between cj and sexton yea I'd take sexton over McCollum just because he's younger and has potential to develop into a better playmaker. D'Angelo Russell is pretty clearly the worst option here to me
The best offer right now is what CJ McCollum? Oh good they get to the second round of playoffs instead of the first...
Another one I thought of:  Lonzo Ball  CJ McCollum   Andrew Wiggins   Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid
"Steph Curry, Giannis, KAT, Embiid, Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Mike Conley, Malcolm Brogdon…tons of really intelligent and thoughtful people excel in this league. The Kyrie Irvings of the world are just always louder.  I really wanted to put the Lopez twins in there too but the list can’t be all Bucks lol"
"My bid for a future lineup. RJ, Draymond, Durant, and CJ McCollum as the moderator/Ernie role."
"Their goal is to contend for a championship, the season is obviously a wash if they can't get someone like Beal or Dame because there is no way in hell they're realistically competing for a championship with anything less.   They're not beating the Bucks, Nets, Lakers, etc with CJ McCollum or whatever is on the table from the Wolves or Pacers. If they can't flip Simmons for a win-now package, their only choice will be to flip him for assets they can use in a future trade next off-season to bring in a Dame/Beal-type player. And if they accept that package this season, then it is with the understanding that this season will be a wash because unless the Sixers massively overperform and get super lucky with opposing injuries, they're just not in a position to win."
We’ll touch that contract and give them one CJ McCollum
what's the CJ McCollum syndrome?
"Hey Milwaukee, y'all suffering from cj mccollum sydrome?"
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."
Middleton is nowhere near those players in terms of value.  Middleton is a hell of a lot closer to get a CJ McCollum than a Zach LaVine (though Middleton is ultimately better than CJ).
everyone is trying to trade their trash for cj mccollum now
Middleton playing like CJ Mccollum this series.
"CJ McCollum for Oubre and #14?  Dame/Norm/Oubre/RoCo/Nurk actually has defense, vs three-guard Dame/CJ/Norm/RoCo/Nurk"
You’re telling me you wouldn’t trade CJ McCollum for Obi Toppin and both NY firsts?
Can I interest you in a CJ McCollum?
"NYK gets: CJ McCollum  DET gets: Two FRPs from NYK, Zac Collins  POR gets: Jerami Grant"
I absolutely hate watching CJ McCollum play
Cj McCollum passes up open threes or passes to wide open shooters for contested middies and floaters
"Write a 500 word essay on how you'll fix a defense with Kanter, Anfernee Simons, CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard"
"Him and CJ McCollum are in very similar situations. They aren't cutting it as a second option, are poor defensively, and have contracts that teams don't really want to touch.  In both cases, you're selling low on them by trying to trade right now. Hopefully they both gain some value back by the trade deadline."
CJ McCollum for KP?
KP for cj mccollum
"He moves off ball as much as someone like Cj McCollum, MPJ, or Khris Middleton do."
"Since his greatest offensive weapon is his passing, I think he'd need to be able to shoot off the dribble. Maybe like a CJ McCollum level shooting ability."
"Trade this Tall Latvian to Portland for McCollum.  CJ has been doing wonders revitalizing former Knicks players.  Kanter, Melo, Zinger?"
This guy is a worse #2 than CJ McCollum.
"Realistically, would a cj for kp be okay? McCollum would be the 2nd ball handler. Umm other than that I am imagining giannis on the team"
KP for cj mccollum
Andrew Wiggins and CJ McCollum make basically the same money. Which of these players would any fan of another team want first knowing the contracts are all at least 3 years guaranteed depending on player option.  Who is the most tradable?
CJ McCollum for KP. Both have negative trade values right now and both could use a change of scenery… who says no?
"Does anyone thin CJ McCollum would work? He's not getting it done with Dame in Portland, feel be would be an upgrade over THJ but not sure how he fits with Luka."
"Larry nance, Jarrett Allen and a frp pick swap for Cj mccollum."
Just thinking out loud. Would a kp for cj McCollum trade be a good trade for Dallas and maybe Portland? Both players get a fresh start in a new place? Cj could be a good number 2 for Luka?? But the defense still won’t be good.
"I think there’s some mutually improved fit going on in a Simmons/Dame swap.  Portland has never had a problem generating offfense, they even have a guy who bailed dame out in the series against Denver back in 19 with McCollum, but they were always a little too average on defense to really do anything or take a punch in the playoffs. At worst Simmons/CJ is everything you get out of the Simmons/Seth backcourt.   Philly gets a perimeter creator that can legitimately fill it up and open the floor for embiid in the paint and the midrange for Tobias. And anytime the Sixers have Embiid and Thybulle at the same time their defense is disruptive enough to not demand a lot of Lillard on the perimeter.  I just wonder who is giving who draft capital in this move"
"Nope, they're talking about CJ fucking McCollum, which is a horrible idea lol"
"Who is going to take on that contract?   Two players on the trading block matching in salaries are CJ McCollum, and the don’t want Porzingis, and Andrew Wiggins, who is more intriguing as a swap in terms of how GS play."
3 way trade:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler   Mavs get:   * CJ McCollum   Heat get:   * KP   * Anfernee Simons  * 1 Mavericks 1st   * 2 Blazers 1sts
we’ll give you slightly gently used CJ Mccollum and Robert Covington for Benny.
Enjoy CJ McCollum
This is where you could use someone like CJ McCollum. These Mavs cant do shit without Luka.
CJ McCollum...
"Is it?      Blazers get younger and have an All-Star in Pingus Tingus. They also get a FRP and a decent player in THJ. Plus, they offload on Covington.      People critized CJ McCollum and Dame Lillard for being too ball-dominant, and have argued trading away McCollum for years. Mavs ain't going to trade for McCollum just to have that same issue with Luka. But with Dame, they might as Dame is ridiculously talented.   Portland's new roster sets up Pingus Tingus for success. He's critized for not being aggressive and not good at off-ball, but he plays above average defense and can shoot the lights out. Can fit in with Portland's roster.   Even if you're insanely high on Dame (which is reasonable), there's no way to tell that it's a garbage trade a few years from now.      Similar to Kawhi + Danny Green for Poeltl, Derozan, + FRP (Keldon Johnson). Looked bad at the time, but both teams benefitted greatly. Kawhi won a ring in Toronto, and Keldon Johnson and Poeltl are starters for the Spurs.     Similar to Oladipo and Sabonis for Paul George. Heavily critized at the time, but Oladipo and Sabonis ended up becoming all-stars. Pacers flipped Oladipo for LaVert, and now have a young core on Lavert and Sabonis. OKC had a perennial MVP candidate in George, who they flipped for Shai + 5 FRP."
The CJ Mccollum special.
"Porzingis, Simmons, CJ McCollum will probably be moved this off season if their teams get eliminated (Portland is already out, so)."
mavs going after cj mccollum wouldn't be the worst idea in the world
"That is not a tough shot for NBA players that actually take floaters (Rose, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum etc)"
CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons. Who says no?
Hey Philly you need shooting we have this nice guy named Cj McCollum we can give you for Simmons
Ok I like that. Welcome home cj McCollum
Can I interest you in trading for a CJ McCollum?
Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum
"Same thing with CJ McCollum. They're good but really super stars. With a healthy Harden it's even more of a contrast, but damn Blake just stepped up and reminded people he was a star once too, and can do that sometimes.   Did Jrue get injured or something? I can't even remember him doing anything."
Middleton is the eastern conference CJ McCollum
Middleton is giving his best CJ McCollum impression.
So... does CJ McCollum for Khris Middleton work for both sides or?
He's probably on that Kemba Walker level.  At least he's young.  Kemba looks like degenerative injuries for an old guy.  Maaaaaybe CJ McCollum if the Mavs throw in something else.
"Sorts has/had the active longest playoff streak in the NBA with 8 straight years and he did it with no more than one All-Star on the roster in any given season. It’s not his fault the roster wasn’t good enough and that Olshey and Dame couldn’t see how CJ was a liability next to Dame because they are so similar yet on different levels as players.  What more could Stotts have done? I do think it’s time to move from him, but the roster needs an overhaul and moving McCollum for a real wing should be priority one."
"thats great, cj mccollum averaged 23ppg this season and shot 40% from 3"
he's a power forward on the hawks bench who averaged 4.6 ppg this season  do you know who CJ mccollum is?  lol
"If that’s the case then no way that’s the best offer they get for cj. Gallo, cam,huerter, and a 2nd might land you a decent starter but McCollum is worth much more than a decent starter. He’s just below an all star and would probably have one if he was in the east"
"thing is, if he has this much say in hiring a coach then i imagine the blazers wouldn’t trade CJ without Dame’s blessing. McCollum knows this so it might be kind of awkward if / when they do trade him."
"Hindsight is 20/20. You can say the same thing about Boston. CJ looked better than Lillard in the first 20 games of this season before he got hurt. No one counts on injuries. And if you're going to trade Damian Lillard's best friend, CJ McCollum, you better replace him with someone much better on the court or Dame will easily want to leave Portland. CJ has more value than just on the court."
CJ McCollum for KP?
although as a Dame fan I will say he's too much of a concern and the clippers should totally trade him for Cj McCollum beacuse why not hahaha /s
"Simmons for McCollum is horrible value for us. Simmons may not be the best scorer, but he’s so good at everything else and his value as a player is much higher than that of CJ."
"That's fine, but they can bring in prime Phil Jackson, Pat Riley and Pop and it's not going to make that roster win.   They need to blow up the roster to get Dame help or Dame is going to leave anyway.       Objectively speaking, I'm not sure it wouldn't be in the best interest of the franchise to do both (blow up the ""others"" on the roster and facilitate Dame going to a different franchise.) His salary is so high that it would be difficult for the franchise to really get him the help he needs. He's 31 next month. CJ McCollum is owed major money the next few years. CJ is not a #2 on a title contender. Dame himself may only be a #2 on a legit title contender. And keep in mind they had the same record as the #7 seed Lakers (who were missing their two best players for large chunks of the season.) Not like they are an up and coming team with young talent."
"**Change for change's sake.**   Management: ""Hey, coach. You're fired.""  Coach: ""Why?""  M:  ""You have had to compete against better teams, and while doing so, you lost.""  C: ""But...""  M: ""Look, I'm sorry, but how did you not beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the champion Lakers last year? You have Dame Lillard and CJ McCollum.""  C: ""Umm... they had LeBron and AD. They were the champs.""  M: ""And then you lose to the Nuggets this year?""  C: ""You mean the team with the league MVP.""  M: ""Yeah. And don't even get us start about how you lost to the Golden State Warrior in the conference finals after upsetting the Nuggets.""  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: The Blazers aren't that good and they won't be any better next year without a player upgrade, but they just fired their coach to make it look like they are doing something productive."
"This sub takes the size of contracts personally, and conflates the number with the actual skill level of the player. It's like they can't hold two opposing thoughts in their collective head. A player can be very good and also get paid too much for some cap situations. John Wall and CJ McCollum are both very very good basketball players, even by NBA standards."
"Some fairly straightforward moves to make.  Strongly suggest for Trez to opt out of his player option using the Klutch + Rich Paul family connection. Let Drummond, Marc Gasol, and Morris walk.  Resign THT and Caruso long term for hopefully under $15mil/YR combined. Resign Wes and Benny Mac to another veteran’s minimum.  Re-do the entire front court. Look to sign two defensive minded PF/C that can rebound, rim protect, and not ask for post touches. Nerlen’s Noel and Richaun Holmes both could be affordable and available. Dwight Howard coming back would be fine as well.  See what’s available on the trade market. If POR is down to blow it up and sell off CJ McCollum I would resign Schroder and package him in a S+T with Kuzma and a 2022 FRP to acquire CJ.  If no trade partners are available I’d let Schroder walk and see if I can coax Kyle Lowry to signing a 2+1 deal for $20-$25mil/yr.  That’s about as good as you can do honestly."
Perhaps CJ McCollum
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It’s not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
Lol you dumb mother fuckers you could be playing Terry Stotts and CJ McCollum right now.
Dame and CJ give me Steph and Monta vibes.  CJ McCollum have it all
CJ McCollum 100% has decent trade value   Idk about the rest
"what about CJ McCollum, Derrick Jones Jr. &amp; Anfernee Simons to the Pelicans for Brandon Ingram &amp; Eric Bledsoe's terrible contract?  Maybe some draft compensation has to also go to the Pelicans in this scenario?"
I would love a Jimmy butler for CJ McCollum trade
[CJ McCollum] “/u/LebronJamesBurnerAcc is a god damned liar”   True story
"I think they do    Sign and trade Kawhi, trade PG, bring in bad contracts like CJ Mccollum/Steven Adams in exchange for picks or young players. You can rebuild pretty fast and have a playoff team in time to open the new stadium."
"Okay, well he was not objectively the worst player on the floor dude. Way to say you didn't watch the game. Only guy on the squad that played better than him that game was Powell.  There's a reason Dame lead us in +/- that game.  He was getting doubled all game long and set guys up efficiently while playing great defense.  I can fault it on one factor - CJ McCollum being statistically the most negative player in the entire playoffs."
* Pacers get CJ McCollum  * Blazers get Marcus Smart  * Celtics get Malcolm Brogdon  Add in whatever draft picks and filler players you need to make everything balanced. Who says no?
Right now it’s probably CJ McCollum. Saw more than one person say he’s no better than Kyle Kuzma.
If you’re going to blow it up then why the f*ck would you trade for CJ McCollum
Maybe it's a coaching change. There's a lot more people more knowledgeable on the Blazers situation than me. At this point you may have to lean more on addition by subtraction with trading McCollum. Bringing in more defense and running a more balanced attack possibly. But CJ should definitely be packing bags.
I agree but who do you think that could be? And with what? Get rid of McCollum or just keep dameand cj and pull a Brooklyn and throw away all ur picks
ill give you one andre drummond for one cj mccollum TY
"It did work though. Just only when Nurkic was on the court.   If anyone other than Dame had stepped up anyways, the series would be pretty different. Like everyone but Dame just flat out played terribly for the majority of the series.   Monte Morris was out here outplaying CJ McCollum, with the majority of his shots being self created"
"&gt; I think they convince him to stay…again…by firing Stotts and trading away McCollum.   If they can get an all-star wing for CJ + picks and upgrade from Stotts I think they're borderline contenders next year.  Dame / Nurk / Powell / RoCo plus someone like Kawhi (the dream, obviously) or Butler would be very very good."
I’m not sure either team says yes in a Spurs trade. Spurs are way too crowded backcourt wise to take McCollum and I’m not sure what derozan would provide the Blazers that’s an upgrade for CJ. And dejountae + Poeltl is certainly no go
Beal is like 15-20% better than CJ McCollum with the EXACT same deficiencies and an added one in that Beal is a below average 3 point shooter. That is not a contender.
Of course a title in Portland would be worth more but they’ve been trying and failing to build around him for years. CJ McCollum needs to go immediately and start fresh.
"Yeah bro it was totally Brooker, the same guy who was so bad his entire career that the Suns had a top-5 pick every year for half a decade. It was CP3 who turned a lottery team into a playoff team. Replace Booker with CJ McCollum and the Suns do just as well. Replace CP3 with Dennis Schröder and the Suns don't make the playoffs."
shit we'd take cj mccollum
This is a shot at our front office/ownership to fix this shit.  I'm not sure how the hell we can do that without either: massively overpaying players in free agency or trading like 5 picks for a borderline all-star that might not even be much better than CJ McCollum.
You cannot question this man's loyalty. He's had CJ McCollum as his sidekick for years while you got LeBron and KD playing with superstars the whole time.
Ah the classic “CJ Mccollum” play
CJ McCollum could never have such maturity
"AD for CJ McCollum and 5 first rounders, fixes both franchises issues, don't @ me"
Would you like a slightly used CJ McCollum?
"Russ has literally teamed with Harden, KD(At the same time and at both of their mvp levels), Beal, and Paul George. The best player Dame played with was CJ McCollum"
naw he gives you way more than kevin love does  kevin is probably the actual worst contract in the league  I'd say he's more in the CJ mccollum teir of overpaid but still a useful contributor
true but CJ McCollum gave them all-star level performance
"tbh kp has lost his shine the last few years. the reason dallas would say no is that they dont need kemba when they're already putting the ball in luka's hands every possesion  now, CJ McCollum.."
CJ McCollum as his #2 man all these years is a crime against humanity.
Man I like CJ McCollum. I just kinda wish he was better.
"Shoutout to the MVP of the series, CJ Mccollum of the denver nuggets"
"Not saying he's totally without blame, but that nuggets team did have the league MVP. McCollum is really not that great as far as putting together a truly great team either.  Also you ignore the nuggets still had MPJ who scored basically the same as CJ on way better efficiency in that series"
"That’s debatable if that’s true or not. Regardless, dame’s best teammate is CJ McCollum. Ask yourself, out of the top teams in the west, who has a side kick that is worse than CJ? Lebron has AD, kawhi has PG, Mitchell has Gobert and Jokic has Murray (at least as good as CJ if not better). Supporting cast and the rest of the team matters, but this league is ultimately a star driven league and if you don’t have at least 2 top tier guys in the playoffs, your going nowhere. It sounds like your just a hater talking out of your ass."
"He's played in a league where teams like Curry/Klay/Durant, Lebron/AD, Lebron/kyrie/love, Durant/Kyrie/harden, harden/cp3 existed.  CJ mcCollum and norman powell is hardly enough to claim he has no excuses"
"&gt; You’re right in saying that his value is higher than most people think but it’s also far lower than what Sixers fans believe it is.  “Sixers fans” aren’t some hive mind where everyone has the exact same opinion. I’m capable of having a productive conversation about Simmons’ value. I’ve actually specifically said he’s not a player you want to build around, but I’m not going to say that’s “definitely true” because I don’t know if it’s “definitely true” or not — we’ve never seen what a team built around Ben could do so any opinion we have on the matter is just that: an opinion. You’re right in saying that some Sixers fans have his value is higher than most people think but it’s also far higher than people on this sub give him credit for. Acting like swapping out Simmons for CJ McCollum or Buddy Hield makes the Sixers better is just laughable."
&gt; straight up   CJ McCollum in my opinion.
"At this point I don't know if there is one. Philly shouldn't have thrown him under the bus the way they did. Everyone knows that just like Harden last summer Philly does not have a ton of leverage. Philly can say, ""he will play here and we will work it out."" But we all know they are shopping him and we know that Embiid and Rivers threw him under the bus, so unless they all really make up and move on (based on all reports we've heard it does not seem like this has happened) then Philly is in trouble.   They are not going to get a big return on him. At this point they will be lucky to get CJ McCollum. I hate to say it because I actually think Simmons is good and is worth more than what Philly will eventually get. I just think the situation has been mismanaged."
&gt; He went number 1 bc the draft was weak.  lmao this is the same draft that Giannis and CJ McCollum were in. the fact of the matter is that the scouts were fucking awful at their jobs that year.
CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum if he plays like last season and about 4 injuries happen.
Collin Sexton  Terry Rozier  CJ McCollum
"CJ McCollum or a player of his caliber is very fair. Anything more is an overpay. Shoot they asked for . Andrew Wiggins, 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman, Golden State’s 2021 No. 7 and No. 14 picks and two future firsts which is insane."
"CJ McCollum, bonus is that opens them up to using Seth Curry in trade."
"This seems fun I want to try Tyler Herro, CJ McCollum and Devin Booker"
“The Sixers should trade Ben Simmons straight up for CJ McCollum”
Again Simmons for anything other than CJ McCollum (or player on that caliber) is an overpay for Simmons.
I'll try to use non-superstar examples  PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - CJ McCollum  SF - Khris Middleton  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Jonas Valanciunas
"DeMar DeRozan, Karl Anthony Towns, CJ McCollum, Donovan Mitchell"
"&gt; You seem to have lost track of the discussion in that case, your initial comments towards me were directly about Jokic and Harden's defensive comparison.  Not really, I responded to you discussing all areas of their games and how they stack up in all categories..you only seemed to hyper focus on the defense portion though..so thats all you. You take shots at Jokic, but Harden was on the most stacked team in the league and lost..thats way more telling than Jokic trying to carry his team single handedly against a much better Suns team.   And as I have pointed out many times, Jokic's impact overall and efficiency was way higher than Harden's this year, so if you strictly want to view this as through the lens of on the court play this year...the debate of who is better between the two is already over, its Jokic.  &gt;his PnR defense is the same reason why guards like Dame, CJ, Booker, CP3, and Donovan have career series against the Nuggets.  Thats cute, it surely is a factor but I've never heard of someone trying to pin the blame for the strong performances of opposing guards on the other team's center instead of say...the guard defenders lol most of those players go off via 3 point shooting, not driving on pick and rolls.   I'll even give you a counter example, who is the best big defender in the league, Gobert right? Well if you look at how Paul George played in each series this year, would you guess which team he scored the most against? You guessed it, the Jazz. He did pretty damn well against Ayton too. Its a weak argument you're trying to spin, doesn't hold up.  Mitchell scored nearly 40% of his points from 3 that series, McCollum had a below average FG% on 2 point shots that playoff run and shot the same % of 3 point attempts he always does, Booker had his lowest scoring series against the Nuggets compared to any of the other 3 series, and Dame scored over 50% of his points from 3....so honestly it seems like you're just throwing shit at the wall and actually have no idea what you're talking about.   If you think Jokic is a bad defensive center because he can't defend the pick and roll, can't switch and can't play above the rim, then surely you can't say Gasol at that point in his career was a good defender.  We are talking about centers here, not power forwards, the Warriors had a rotation of role players at center.  Same with the Heat, they had guys like Eddy Curry playing center for them that year. On that Mavs team, Chandler is solid overall but he didn't play well defensively that playoff run, no one on that team averaged more than 1 block per game  There is no trend, there is no correlation...generally speaking, better teams overall end up being better defensive teams, but again, you're just trying to throw shit against the wall."
CJ McCollum.
"The Kings were never going to trade Fox for Simmons, just like the Blazers were never going to trade Dame for him. As the season approaches Morey is going to have to come off of this. After last year’s playoffs no team is going to pay his desired price for Simmons because he plays well in the regular season.   These reports are going to slowly stop popping up between now and October and he’ll end up taking CJ McCollum or another similarly skilled guard (Malcolm Brogdon?) before the season begins."
Monta is mad overrated. An ineffecient mid-range volume shooter who people think is an all-star caliber guy in his prime. Best I can compare him to is Jamal Crawford or CJ McCollum (for the current player comparison). Just good at 1 thing on the court which is a good player but not as good as you think.
Sixers are trading him for CJ McCollum and they’re gonna like it
"I can’t believe you think they don’t need Dray, I’ve watched the Warriors a long time and Dray is super critical to them. If you watched that postseason series against the Trail Blazers that one season it tells you everything they need to know. It was pre-KD, Dame played as well as Steph that series and both teams even defended the other’s PG the same way-threw committed doubles to take the ball out of their hands. Well Dame is out there passing to Mason Plumlee on the high screen and roll, and Steph is out there passing to Dray. Everything else was exactly the same, CJ McCollum is a great shooter. But that, along with Dray’s defense, was basically the difference in the series. And the series wasn’t that close."
"one of Warren &amp; Brogdon along with Lamb is probably about right, if the Blazers want both they likely need to include picks + Anfernee Simons.  I actually think that LeVert + CJ would be fine together in the back-court. LeVert has good size, both of them can create their own shot and Sabonis still does so much of the play-making for the Pacers it wouldn't hurt too badly to be without a ""traditional"" PG.  Also McCollum is under contract which is something the Pacers value since it's about as hard to draw free-agents to Indiana as it is to get them to come to Portland.  On the flip-side, pairing Dame with TJ Warren would be great, the Blazers have always needed a wing that can get their own shot and a back-court pairing with Brogdon would be a nice fit as well since Malcolm plays good defense and can ease the play-making load for Dame."
how about a CJ McCollum for Lamb &amp; TJ Warren/Brogdon swap?
"Between Brogdon, LeVert and Sabonis we basically do point guard by committee. Any of those guys are good for 5 assists per night. TJ off of our bench helps keep the second unit afloat.  Our FO loves combo guards, and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if we tried to take a whack at getting CJ McCollum at the future. A lot of Pacers fans want to keep Brogdon at the 2 and even though CJ is a combo guard, I like the fit of him next to Brogdon."
"Joe Ingles Jalen Brunson CJ McCollum Poetl   Brogdon is a really good player, but he’s more a Tobias Harris than anything: Really good player who isn’t near elite"
Nah worth like 1 CJ McCollum…pls?   But seriously I think he’s pretty much invaluable to the warriors. On both sides of the ball too considering how Steph works
"CJ  ""Randy Lenz"" McCollum"
&gt;McCollum helps you significantly. Hield helps you significantly.  0 indication CJ has been offered  Hield doesnt help significantly. id rather have Seth

ESPN: “Anthony Davis says teammate Russell Westbrook acts without ‘conscience’ and tends to ‘miss 20 in a row’…”  SAS: “It’s time to face facts: the Lakers have to trade AD for CJ McCollum and accept that this season is for the Warriors to win.”
That's basically a pre-growth spurt CJ Mccollum.
"I get what you're saying for sure, but if Morey wants to leave Philly, all he has to do is resign and he's out. That's what he did in Houston. If Ben wants to leave Philly there's only two options; he retires, or gets traded.    Clearly he's not going to retire, so trading is the only outcome, and Morey seems to have been overplaying his hand at every stage in the process. If offers for CJ McCollum or Brogdon were actually on the table and he didn't take them, that's a mistake on his part.   Keeping your players happy is a part of the job of a GM, and if the situation gets to the point where it's this messy and public, the value is going to be low. Just because a player is an all-star doesn't mean you're going to get that level of return back, look at the return for Vince Carter or the return for James Harden.   I don't think it's reasonable to expect Ben to have returned to play this year, and while the whole injury/mental health  battles aren't ideal, it's really all just posturing and positioning for a trade.   And I think it's a little odd how people won't hesitate to say Ben is 'broken' and 'mentally weak', but the second mental health is brought into the conversation it's an 'excuse'. But that's neither here nor there...."
"Draymond is not good enough to be the best player on a championship contender. Only like 10ish guys meet that description.  He could be the best player on a solid team though if the 2nd best player lead the offense, someone like CJ McCollum who is just not as impactful as a player as Draymond.  More importantly being the #1 option is not the only thing that matters. Draymond brings more to a contender than a ton of guys who would be better options to lead a team.  His inability to score is a problem if you don't take care of that somewhere else on your roster. Just like Dame and Trae's defense is a problem if you don't address it elsewhere in your roster."
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum maybe
I was reading the sixers sub oh the joy it brought me you’ll never touch Brown enjoy CJ McCollum 🤣
"If Wood for Rozier was available to us from the Houston side, I'd just take that and hold onto Hayward rather than swap him for McCollum.   Would make us losing Graham/Monk hurt more due to lack of guards, but I wouldn't trade Hayward for CJ just to correct that."
"You’d be lucky to get CJ McCollum for Simmons, if you wouldn’t trade all that for Brown you’re massively overestimating Simmons worth and you’re gonna be even more disappointed when he gets traded for role players this off season."
"This trade is probably exactly what the Celtics need right now. They have their own players complaining about their stars not passing. Celtics have scorers. Simmons is a great passer and a great defender.  However, making the Celtics better would be less than ideal for the Sixers. I don't really want to see Simmons locking down Curry or Tobias in the playoffs. And Sixers fans surely enjoy watching the Celtics lose almost as much as watching the Sixers win. Also this doesn't fix the Sixers need for playmaking. Is Jaylen Brown much better than CJ McCollum, who we apparently don't want?"
"hayward actually would be a positive addition to their team, he contributes on the floor.  he might be the best they can get for simmons.   they aren't getting KAT, they aren't getting CJ McCollum  if philly wants to get anything at all for this 35m of deadweight they have sitting on their roster and against their cap, hayward might actually be the most realistic target that would move the needle for them"
"He asked for 4 picks with CJ McCollum, please tell me you don't believe that's playing ball? Lmao Playing ball means a deals done already.   How is his baggage sixers centric for sure? kyries literally not playing because of a govt mandate. Simmons passed up  an open dunk in a game 7. You're underselling why teams would be reluctant to engage on a trade for Him.     Morey has said he wants a star in return, if he was serious like you are assuming then why has a deal not been completed? You don't seem to understand the reason Morey is holding out in the first place"
"They absolutely need someone who can iso effectively on the perimeter.  I still think CJ Mccollum would work, assuming Philly can't get Lillard."
Ben Simmons value is plummeting rn. Might be best to just move him for a shit ton of three and D guys and an extra ball handler. Sooooo Cj McCollum lol
"it’s wild to think that morey could snap his fingers and add cj mccollum to this squad, but refuses to do so. that offer might not exist any more. every sixers win further drops simmons’ value."
Wait .. what.... Doc has his fair share of the blame but Simmons as you pointed out has been a dick. Also Morey takes some blame because he should have traded him for cj mccollum a long time ago... Doc's schemes are pretty bad but simmons lack of free throw shooting is the exact reason he passed up the dunk.
We should've traded for CJ McCollum instead imo
Now trade Simmons for CJ McCollum or Terry Rozier... imagine
"One of those fringe kinda guys. Could be like CJ McCollum. Talented 20+ ppg scorer, solid playmaker, but cheeks on D and probably never makes an all-star team."
"Ben Simmons does not have this level of trade value regardless of whether he returns as himself or not. This drama wasn’t present last season when the Rockets decided picks were worth more than a package based around Simmons. We’ve had two playoffs where his obvious weaknesses have held his team back. Short of becoming a different player, he can’t change that by having another solid regular season. He’s already been doing that. Teams know this.   He’s still valuable for some teams, if this was just about trading Simmons straight up for what he’s really worth, some CJ McCollum type deal would already have been completed. That’s what his real value is. As funny as it sounds, this Simmons deal holdup has almost nothing to do with his holdout. Star trades are generally about that star deciding he wants out. Dame and Beal haven’t done this thing which is the key to actually being traded. The Sixers have also not accepted trading Simmons for his true value. Those are the things keeping Simmons on the Sixers.   What will progress this situation is the Sixers coming back down to Earth, stars requesting out and more players coming available in December.   I really think part of this “Simmons needs to play well” stuff is pushed by the team to win the media battle."
CJ McCollum traded    Luka wins a playoff series    Lakers since LeBron traded his whole ass team before in 2018
"I doubt it, I think his peak is somewhere between Jamal Crawford and CJ McCollum"
Dont you think filling that 35 million of cap space with (just throwing out names here that were rumored to be on the table) CJ Mccollum or Brogdon + Caris or Buddy Hield + would boost the sixers championship odds?
"for sure. sixers have been impressive without simmons. or maybe it’s more impressive how they’ve been playing with the simmons drama. if morey wasn’t so stubborn, they could have cj mccollum right now too."

Poole is starting to look like CJ McCollum to me.
Frank Kaminsky / Danny Green / CJ McCollum
I was listening to Ryen Russillo podcast recently and he referred to Seth Curry as a “CJ McCollum lite” because he’s more than a shooter now and can occasionally take guys off the dribble.
"CJ McCollum exists, matches salaries with Simmons, and is putting up 9.6 3s a game at 43%. Can't believe this trade hasn't happened yet."
"Honestly so tired of this dude. We’re in a super team era. If you wanna win, you gotta join one. It is what it is. You’re not winning alone and you’re def not winning with CJ Fucking McCollum"
"I guess, if a 30 year old guard who’s never made an all star team suddenly becomes a superstar then I wouldn’t trade him for Ben either but I’d take those odds if I was morey. Also, if cj McCollum is the best defensive player on the blazers then they really do need Ben Simmons"
"The star player, hopefully. I’ve been saying this since the beginning: the ceiling is CJ McCollum. Not an All-Star, but on the fringes, and can provide skills Embiid needs to succeed, like spacing and distributing the ball.   Ideally, you find a team that’s about to rebuild and looking to trade away an established veteran for young talent. It’s the only realistic way to make this a win-win trade. No contender is going to trade for him, and no one in the basement of the league has a good enough player they’re willing to part with. At this point, the Sixers may have to include a draft pick to sweeten the deal, and I think that’s totally acceptable."
If this keeps going it will probably be CJ Elleby and picks. lol   Norman Powell or CJ McCollum is too good for just Ben Simmons at this point in time. Philly will have to throw in a pick or two if they want CJ McCollum.
"“Teams” includes the Sixers, who are just as likely to get more desperate as any other team. CJ McCollum being the best player they can get for Ben, could easily turn into Norman Powell being the best player they can get for Ben. Morey isn’t doing anything other than gambling, he could luck out and look smart, or he could end up looking like a complete fool."
CJ McCollum is a bit more than a role player

"That game reminded me of when Blazers 2nd and 3rd string won against a great team and I just looked it up and it happened to be versus the 76ers on February 4th lol. Damian, McCollum, Zach Collins and Nurkic were all hurt. We had CJ Elleby (not McCollum) on the floor for 31 minutes. I guess ya'll got your revenge"
"Herro is so fucking good. Fuck /r/NBA and everyone who said otherwise.   That kind of shot making and playmaking is rare. In his prime he’ll essentially be a bigger CJ-McCollum, and on a complete roster like we have right now- that’s all we need."
"reminder that Trey Burke was a lottery pick taken ahead of: Giannis, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert, Tim Hardaway JR, Dennis Shroder and never averaged more than 12 PPG, with 6.6 PPG and 5.3 PPG in the last 2 seasons."
You don’t know about the absolute plethora of 3 and D small forwards that match the salary and value of CJ McCollum? Casual.
i want CJ mccollum in or around my mouth
*Dame Lillard and CJ McCollum
They'll have 2: Jayson Tatum and CJ McCollum
"Harden and Westbrook are far from egalitarian players and have, in fact, both been fairly routinely maligned as ball hogs and/or stat chasers.    If we’re poking holes in each other’s arguments, are you saying CJ McCollum, who peaked at a 20% AST rate over a full season is in any way a great playmaker and/or comparable to Harden and Russ who have both lead the league in assists and have had multiple full seasons with a 40+, 45+, and 50+ AST%?   As I hinted at in my original comment, assists per possession is far from the be-all-end-all, but let’s just be real that Dame couldn’t do what Harden or Westbrook did. He’s not nearly the same level of passer just from a creativity standpoint or from the attention he draws. Dame is generally more stoppable. Russ is stoppable too, but he does have a significant athletic advantage over Dame (or had). And tbh Russ has basically never been the focus of a very good offense."
"CJ ""Lillard at home"" McCollum"
"What CJ is really trying to say  &gt;CJ McCollum, the president of the NBPA, suggested **Damian Lillard** is still adjusting to the new Wilson basketball. Says he will discuss it with players this week to “get feedback.”"

"As an outsider that has no dog in the race and has watched a lot of both I really don't see them as similar at all other than they can put up good scoring with sub par defense, even size wise McCollum is 2-3 inches taller. McCollum is capable of running the offense, he's a better passer than Sexton, he's a better 3 pt shooter than Sexton (floor spacing matters for the rest of your team not just TS% which Sexton is superior), Sexton is more explosive, better from 2 and younger. I think any team trying to win now would rather have CJ, rebuild you take Sexton."
"Being the PG doesn't mean shit lol. Do you think Beal got less touches or TOP than Ish Smith in 2020? Do you think Beal getting an outsized number of touches? He's an undersized SG. He's dwarfed his PG in terms of touches and TOP.  The reality is, the best offensive player on your team is the best option. Sexton is panning out far more like a star, STARTING SGs than a 6th man lol. Here's a million comps from last year.

Dame came into the league after longer in college. He came in with a developed game and played on a better team.

Sexton was averaging 25 ppg until the last game of the season when he got pulled after 20 minutes. It wasn't until Dame's 6 season that he surpassed Sexton's efficiency.

I'm just saying thinking he pans out as a 6 man is absurd. He's also a better defender than any of those guys were in their 3rd year. He might be 6'2 but he's got a 6'6 wingspan and he's got 10x the motor of any of those guys on defense."
"CP3 is not the defender he was a few years ago, please.  Also, CP3 also has higher defensive IQ and is stronger than McCollum. He isn't an easy target for a switch.  Make no mistake, the *main* difference between CP3 and CJ is NOT effort and if you think so, you just regurgitate whatever crazy shit is said on this board."
10 minutes later: CJ McCollum has been traded to the Philadelphia 76ers.
Wtf TIL CJ McCollum is 6'3.  I honestly thought he'd be like 6'6-6'7.
"CJ is probably the best guard in the league that hasn't had the opportunity to run an offense full time. In the super small sample size when Lillard hasn't played, McCollum put up numbers comparable to any star guard. If he can keep up the defense for the whole season, or even to the all star break, the national media will flip and start calling him the most underrated player in the game."
Soooo…. CJ McCollum? Lol
"Ah yes, PJ Tucker and Aaron Gordon have the same roles.  Just as Steph Curry and CJ McCollum have the same role, to score a basket.   Quality analysis"
"Yup, the coach is the difference ... Exactly like I said.  ""This year is starting is DIFFERENT due to McCollum making that effort. He’s leading the team with 1.8 steals and 1.6 blocks (both career-highs). He’s making an effort to not only stay in front of his man, but use active hands to get his deflections and steals. He’s also playing in help mode, watching the weak side to obtain steals in the passing lanes and blocks. As stated above, the Blazers have the sixth best defensive rating and are holding opponents to 43.3% shooting overall and 40.9% in their last three. McCollum’s defensive efforts have been very instrumental for the success in that department.""  https://www.blazersedge.com/2021/10/30/22753926/cj-mccollum-portland-trail-blazers-2021-22-stats-chauncey-billups-highlights-video"
Jokic and CJ McCollum in a tight race for defensive player of the year
AD wanna be a 6'10 CJ McCollum so bad
"Sexton was bad tonight, no denying that. There's a bit of a diminished role thing happening because we're actually trying to pass the ball more. That means more and more of the offense is being run through Garland and Rubio, and less through Sexton. Sexton has proved that he can create efficient offense at the NBA level, it just isn't always pretty. Cavs fans have wanted him to be a more willing passer, and that'll help, but I don't think that's the answer.   If he's going to play at a high level on this team, I think he needs to find his game away from the ball. Constantly moving, working off screens, taking catch and shoot threes. It's not sexy, but I think he needs to find more balance in his game, kind of like CJ McCollum. CJ is great both on and off the ball, and he shoots threes at a high volume. If Sexton can play more into that role, I think he can find success in this offense."
"Harden, van vleet, cj mccollum have said something about the reffing being different than what they were told.. the few I remember off the top of my head that were on the front page. I'm sure there's been many others."
"At best for that package, you’re getting like a Tobias Harris or CJ Mccollum level player. Why in the world would the Mavs trade all their picks for that? Their picks are literally the only way they can add talent now because no one signs in Dallas. If your long term goal for Luka is to win a championship rather than get to the second round this year, it’s a bad trade idea."
"Yeah exactly. People on here keep talking about ""wasting Embiid's prime"" (like they give a shit all of a sudden) like he's 33 or some shit. I know he's been injury prone, but his major injuries are more or less behind him. If he has a mid to major injury CJ McCollum isn't helping us anyway.   If Ben comes back, we could be better. There's no reason we can't. This sub just like to pretend they know what will happen so they say Ben can't win a title with Joel. Even though they've only been to the playoffs three times together. They were saying the Bucks were a regular season team last year and that the coach needed to be fired.   Sometimes staying the course is the best option."
"CJ McCollum barely even more impactful than Lonzo for lot of teams. Would easily take Lonzo, Bridges, Brook Lopez."
"3 good starters is very valuable, but it really depends on what you already have. In a vacuum maybe cj McCollum or jimmy Butler, gobert as well. I think anything better than that you better keep your guy."
"sure, but klay isn't curry or durant, the clear 1/2. those last few blazers teams were dame, cj mccollum and... a bunch of dudes who could be sagged off of"
CJ McCollum? Brandon Ingram?
"Crazy three team Simmons trade goes down at the deadline.  Portland Receives: Simmons and Josh Hart  Philadelphia Receives: Ingram   New Orleans Receives: CJ McCollum and RoCo, Philadelphia FRP"
"Offer 1: Damian Lillard   Offer 2: CJ McCollum, Robert Covington and 3 1sts   Offer 3: CJ McCollum and Robert Covington   Offer 4: CJ McCollum and a 1st   Offer 5: CJ McCollum   Offer 6: Robert Covington and a 1st  Offer 7: Robert Covington"
CJ McCollum and two first round picks?
I like how you think your biggest issue right now is trading CJ McCollum.
"I stand by that the best they can get for Simmons is CJ McCollum or a player on that level. Beal and Lillard are ungettable without gutting the roster to the point that it’d be a lateral move at best. I know it’s not Morey’s fault, but this trade is at least a year overdue, back when Simmons’ value wasn’t knee deep in the shitter."
My Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum fantasy is inching closer to reality
"Plan A is definitely 3 team trade where Beal or Dame comes back. This it seems like is plan B. Which you are weighing this vs doing something like trading Ben for CJ McCollum/Covington. Which the picks have more value in a vacuum that's fine, but it requires the right circumstances, fortune, timing etc to be able to actually make the superstar trade its always easier said than done. And as you wait on that opportunity the win now window clock keeps ticking.   In the end though I might roll the dice like this because I dont buy CJ McCollum actually brings you closer to a title. But it is a gamble and Embiid is a FA in 2 yrs."
"Skill wise of course. Half court playmaking wise lonzo isn't even on the same planet. As far as PGs go, I'd pick those two over lonzo any day of the week. But I can see how a team with a certain roster construction might prefer lonzo.    Namely, any young team whose primary ball handler isn't a traditional pg like Dallas or Chicago.    This is turning into a rant but if I were the pels I would match lonzo and trade for CJ McCollum."
"Honestly? Nah he’s not. The idea is that the Warriors overpay based on need. Otherwise 7 and 14 in a loaded draft are fantastic assets no team would even consider trading them unless they were in ultimate win now mode. But Warriors could get that trade done without one of the picks honestly, either Wiseman or 14 off the table.  Beal in a vacuum is probably worth that kind of haul, but his value is mostly scoring. He has a huge usage rate on Washington that will likely decline playing alongside Curry and Klay. Simply put he’s not putting up 30+ with them, likely he gets put in a CJ McCollum type of role. He is also a defensive target even on the best lineups, let along a tiny lineup with Klay Beal Curry and Draymond at the 5 presumably.  Like no doubt they would still be really good, I’d just argue Siakam is the better fit."
"We need to marry someone like Bol Bol to a Italian girl or something. We need a C so badly! Also, CJ McCollum, come play for us, your wife is Italo-American and you love wine and Tuscany!"
"so Richmond's best year was when they won 45 games with him as the third best player... Why not put CJ McCollum in the hall of fame?  you are trying your best to justify what you originally said, but it's clear to me you never actually watched him play. Richmond had actual NBA players on his Kings team too, every year in fact, Brian Grant, Chris Jackson..."
"If these rumors turn out to be true, it might mean that OKC has doubts on how good SGA can become and would like to shoot for someone with MVP potential.  You're probably not going to win with CJ McCollum as your #1 option or even #2 option, but you might with Dame."
"I could believe both scenarios where Detroit leaked this to raise the value of the pick, but also OKC offering and DET turning them down.   SGA is great, but he's up for a probable max extension. You lock yourself in with him and move up your timeline to compete. If you don't think SGA could turn into a superstar, I'd rather go with Cade. It could be the difference between having Damian Lillard or CJ McCollum. Both very good players on max contracts, but one is a All NBA vs an All-Star."
"CJ McCollum has averaged over 20 ppg for 6 straight seasons and not yet made an All-Star team. That's the most in the history of the NBA. I'm not sure what the 2nd most is, but it's probably 3 seasons (Monta Ellis, but maybe someone went 4 seasons?). A big part of that is how high scoring has gotten lately though."
"Lmao I'd give up Fred Boucher and pick at most. OG,Siakam, #4 off the table. Obviously you don't take that so enjoy CJ McCollum"
"CJ McCollum wasn’t apart of the 2012 draft. Notable player that were drafted after Waiters in the top 10 that are better then Waiter were, Lillard, Barnes, Ross, Drummond"
I pour wine for CJ McCollum and Melo quite often and have their phone numbers too
i’d rather take cade and regret it later than see him be good somewhere else.  please. i’ve watched us fumble pick after pick. we coulda had giannis one year but he was such a project and from another country im not going to include him.  recently   2013 we took kcp and coulda had CJ Mccollum  2014 no pick  2015 stanley johnson over myles turner and booker  2016 ellenson. coulda had lavert but this is outside the lottery so im not trippin  2017 this is the one that makes me want to blow my brains out. luke fucking kennard over donovan mitchell. (also coulda got bam)  2018 no pick  2019 dekou he’s a bust but was outside the lottery and no other pick was really worthwhile after besides thybulle and kpj.  please for the love of god just take cade.
Ben Simmons just averaged 9-6-6 on 33% fucking shooting from the FREE THROW LINE and passing up open dunks and they think they’re getting a haul for him? The best player they are getting is CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum?
I've been saying that the Sixers would be lucky to get someone as good as CJ McCollum for a while and all I've heard is people saying the Blazers would have to add something or that they're going to get Dame with Simmons. They shoulda taken CJ cause now the best they're getting is a Brogdon type player; obvious upside but plenty of glaring holes too.
Blazers have now amended their offer from CJ McCollum and 3 firsts for Simmons to CJ Elleby and a protected 2nd.
"While not a star, CJ McCollum is sort of the perfect fit next to Luka. He’s very productive playing off ball and can create his own shot when needed. McCollum is undersized for my liking at 2, but he’s also an underrated facilitator, and with Luka’s size and skill there’s enough flexibility with those two to run many different lineups (small ball, or contrast that with spurts of CJ at 1 and playing big)."
CJ McCollum is a better scorer and defender
"They easily beat the hawks if their star was not injured AGAIN and clearly couldn't play well the 4th quarters of any game...  They probably would have beat the hawks easily if that same star had played on block instead of trying to be Kobe Bryant and had 7 turn overs a game.   The sixers didn't lose because of Bens free throws.  They lost because they got severely out coached and the guys that supposed to be the guy they built the team around yet again hurt himself trying to play like a guard and wasn't effective in the 4th quarters of games and was clearly limited on defense and rebounding the whole series.    The easy ESPN narrative that's it's Bens fault is rediculous.  The idea that guy who really looks good because he plays with gravity god would have changed that series. Is ignorant.  You should be ashamed of yourself.   Now I know they have same rating in 2k and that's probably 90 % of your basketball knowledge but in the real Ben Simmons is 100 times valuable to winning than cj McCollum. Its really not close.   McCollum is an ok player that looks a lot better because he plays next dame.  Take that away and McCollum will struggle. On the sixers he's probably an 18 point a night guy who plays horrible defense. You would never be able to play him and curry at the same time. You probably can't even play him and Maxey at the same time.    I'm so sick of the McCollum v Ben swap take.  Its most rediculous trade idea in the world.  Ben is better, younger, and under contract longer.   Anyone pushing this is a blazers fan which makes sense (I totally get why you guys would push it. Respect) or a casual that gets 90% of their knowledge of the players from video game. Period."
Especially if they're going down in talent in order to get rid of Simmons. There isn't anyone that's available with his talent and the team is willing to take him. If they're just going to get a cj McCollum type then they're better off keeping Simmons
"The sad thing is how y'all can still get some really good, border line all star players for Ben, but the majority of the fanbase seems to think that players like CJ McCollum, Brogdon, etc. are beneath consideration"
It Mitchell was solely off ball he'd be a better CJ McCollum.
"It sounds like you’d be swapping liabilities? I’d need more context on that. But in general, I wouldn’t want CJ McCollum. He isn’t worth $100 mil over the next 3 years, especially the last 2.   NBA teams will do whatever they want, but I would be surprised if teams give up assets to get him. I believe it’s significantly more likely that teams either swap negatives (i.e. KP or Simmons for CJ) or it’s CJ + picks for an upgrade (i.e. Eric Bledsoe + picks for Holiday).   Doesn’t mean it won’t happen. As I said, NBA teams do whatever they want. But I personally wouldn’t be interested in giving up trade chips to bring in CJ. At that point just try and go all in for Dame."
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
lol this was CJ McCollum best season ever.
29 teams in NBA : I will trade you mason plumlee and Jeff green for Dame.   29 teams: yes that’s fine  Lakers: I will trade you all of our picks and 6 players for Cj McCollum   29 other teams: hmm idk I don’t think that’s enough might need more here
"You keep him and you’re wasting Embiid’s prime. Get CJ McCollum Atleast. Simmons is not good, it’s not news. His playoff performance was some of the worst show of playoff basketball ever. Wait a little too long and Embiid will ask for a trade. 76ers NEED to move Simmons. And just to top it off, their competition window is closing. Idk why you think keeping him for another season will workout."
"&gt; He was playing at an All-Star level in the West last season before he got injured.  He was playing at a borderline superstar level, but given how hard his regression was and his general level of play, it was probably a fluke.  CJ McCollum looks like a borderline all-star from a distance, but when you look at him closer as a passer, defender, and off-ball player, it becomes clear why his impact on the Blazers hasn't matched his numbers."
I think he does. In hope that he can look like an all star and raise his trade value.  But its a risk. Not impossible that the team chemistry suffers and that Simmons ends up looking like his playoffs version.  But honestly if the alternatives are Cj McCollum or Brogdon ir might be worth the risk
What does Beal do that CJ doesn't do? To me Beal for McCollum is a lateral move. Trading a score first SG that Dame is friends with for another.     Like someone else said hope Jimmy Butler gets into a conniption in Miami but with him you have 1 year until he goes toxic
"1. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both go to the Lakers 2. Chris Paul wants to go to the Lakers only to be turned down because of the salary cap issue and stays with the Suns instead 3. Lillard doesn't stay in Portland, but gets surprisingly traded to the Nets in exchange for Kyrie Irving and Bruce Brown 4. Spencer Dinwiddle goes to the Clippers 5. The 76ers trade Ben Simmons to the OKC thunder in exchange for Kemba and 2 first round picks and flip Tobias and those picks to the Blazers for CJ McCollum, Simons and Covington 6. Lonzo goes to the Bulls 7. Kawhi Leonard stays with the Clippers"
Well would they like a CJ McCollum package? 😂
I was just in a thread that said the best they can do is CJ McCollum and it was unanimously agrreed with
"That dude is a rare breed, it's highly unlikely.  Just realize if Philly runs it back and you guys lose again, we are all going to laugh our asses off.  If I was a Philly fan I'd take my chances with CJ McCollum (and a pick), who is a much better fit with Embiid.  And frankly, Simmons might be a better fit with Dame in PDX."
CJ McCollum took a charge from Zion earlier this year. I didn’t think he was going to get up lol
"Sixers don't trade Ben simmons, but instead move Tobias Harris for CJ MCCollum, and make McCollum the starting PG and move Ben to PF and treat him like a point forward.   McCollum fits way better with Embiid and Simmons (compared to harris), and this is the team's final hurrah in making the Simmons/Embiid pairing work.   Creates a big question mark at SG for the sixers, as they can't responsibly start mccollum and curry together as the backcourt, but i could see this being the move and gives them a point guard that can shoot the 3 ball, spread the floor, and create for others.  For, the blazers, it gives Dame a skilled forward to work with (harris excels at scoring in the paint - where the sixers already have embiid and simmons who both score in the paint), allows them to pay Norman Powell and slot him in at SG. Harris is also a pretty solid rebounder.   Harris/McCollum are both fringe all stars that are similarly overpaid and a swap could benefit sixers and blazers (potentially).     The real hot take here is that the sixers don't trade simmons, but this is the rationale around it."
Potential future All-Star CJ McCollum
Throwing Simmons and Nurkic out there is a death sentence. Simmons could not help Portland more than Lillard can. They're better off looking for more younger pieces + picks than just Simmons. Simmons gets them stuck in the middle. Do you think Simmons or CJ McCollum could be the best player on a championship team? Absolutely not.
"Now I'm thinking of the Nathan For You sketch where he pays someone to change their name to Michael Richards so they can leave a giant tip and make a restaurant famous.  Just gotta do this for CJ McCollum or something. Offer him $1,001"
"So is the consensus in Philly now that Ben Simmons is too good to be traded for CJ McCollum? Because as a neutral observer, that is the best deal they can get for Ben, and CJ would be a great addition to the roster."
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"I'm a Kings fan, our lottery luck is terrible, but we picked Tyreek Evans over Steph, DMC over PG13, Jimmer Ferdette over Klay, Thomas Roberson over Lillard, McLemore over CJ McCollum, Nik Stauskas over Lavine, WCS over Booker, Georgios Papagiannis over Pascal Siakam, (I'm fine with Fox over Mitchell in 17), Bagley over Luka, and I'm happy with Haliburton in 2020.  In 11 drafts we picked the wrong player every time but 2 (maybe 3 depending on how you feel about Boogie vs PG13, but I hated Boogie by the end of his Kings run, so I think it was the wrong pick just because the guy was a cancer).  So, we can't really blame bad lottery luck, the warriors built a dynasty on picks taken after the Kings picks."
"Ehhh it’s an ugly draft but not the worst. Produced a true superstar in Giannis, all star and possible HOF talent in Gobert. Fringer all stars in Oladipo and CJ McCollum, plus some decent depth guys in Steven Adams, Schoeder, and Olynyk. By no means a great draft but pretty decent in depth at least"
"CJ ""Why doesn't Giannis cover KD?"" McCollum? Nah"
"Because he had achieved nothing alone. CJ McCollum has better numbers without Dame than with Dame. I don't see that as any argument for why CJ should be higher on top x lists. Players naturally have a numerical increase. Kobe being more efficient just seems ridiculous to me, and what's even more ridiculous is you attempting to dismiss context as narratives. Of course Kobe was more efficient, he was on possibly the greatest team of all time with Shaq, arguably the most dominant player ever, who's gravity drew in entire teams to stop him. Kobe also had the triangle. Kobe was ""the better playmaker"" but it seems unfair when AI literally had nothing to playmake for, his team was designed around ""Defend and let AI chuck a shot."" AI taking a game off of the Lakers might be the most impressive thing to happen that season bar Shaq's performance."

CJ McCollum is pretty good
"I mean the ideal scenario for the Blazers is switch McCollum for a similar caliber wing player but the issue is who wants to pay CJ 3 years 100 million.   Your best bet I guess is trading him for Hayward (similar caliber player similar contract) though you would probably have to throw in a couple picks/prospects to incentivize the Hornets to make the swap or a sign and trade for DeRozan though you would need a third team to take CJ (maybe Pelicans if they strike out on Lowry) and send something to the Spurs.  A Dame, Powell, Hayward/Derozan, Cov, Nurkic lineup is probably better (albeit not by a huge amount) but more importantly it might convey to Dame that you're trying to actively improve the team and convince him to stay.  The other option I guess is to hope the Sixers Simmons relationship turns toxic enough that they accept a package built around CJ but I don't see Morey doing that."
"It was a really bad draft. I remember there was no consensus #1. In the top 10, only 2 players amounted to anything Oladipo and CJ McCollum. They probably couldn't get much for trading back since no one had a desire to move up."
Pray that someone is really high on cj mccollum and hope the guys you sign off the street can have a Bobby portis-esque renaissance. Besides dame obviously they don’t have much that other teams want besides their picks
CJ McCollum would be up there
No  They don’t even have a bench if it’s just CJ McCollum by himself.
"LOL who is offering first round picks for $30M CJ McCollum? the clippers/lakers  with Kuzma/THT/frp , Bev/Kennard/frp probably which is worse than CJ"
His ceiling isn’t CJ. He can be better than what CJ is now. The year Sexton just had this year would be a top 3 McCollum season. He already surpassed McCollum career high in less shot attempts and better efficiency  And if you wanna compare them at the same age it isn’t even remotely close.
Maybe Trade CJ McCollum

Lakers get CJ McCollum and help send Dame to NY. Shitpost.
Underrated shooter: CJ McCollum. He shoots 40% from three pretty consistently. He was incredibly close to having a 50/40/90 season back in 2016-17. He was 48/42/91.
Yes but league efficiency at that volume for a 22 year old is great to borderline elite that is only trounced by what all nba players or legit all multi time all stars. Yeah that means teams do not want what CJ McCollum oh wait he got maxed or how about Tobias Harris oh wait he got maxed as well. To say teams do not want scorers unless they are steph curry level efficient  or good is dumb there will always be a hole for efficient scorers like Sexton to get maxed or near maxed it’s just how the league works. Plus yeah if league average  efficiency isn’t good enough that’s the same as saying Donovan Mitchell isn’t a good enough scorer.
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
"No, those guys would obviously be off the table. But if you're the Suns and you have worries about going all in with 36 year old Chris Paul going forward when the rest of your team is so young, then it's possible they might want to move him now while his value is high. Could they get a legit young star for him? I doubt it, given his age. But like, could they get Ben Simmons or CJ McCollum for him? My guess is no, but maybe I'm wrong.   So if you want to cash in on him now and you can't get a star, then getting a group of young role players and picks is probably the way to go. Maybe the Lakers could throw in Kuzma and the 22nd pick in the draft and then also explore sign and trade deals for Talen Horton-Tucker or Dennis Schroder, with them going to other teams and pieces going back to the Suns in return in a 3-way deal.  Like I said, I think the odds are overwhelmingly that the Suns just re-sign CP3, so this is probably just a moot exercise. But if the Suns did want to go in a different direction or if CP3 really wanted to go to the Lakers, there's always ways to make that stuff happen."
Fun fact… Kosta Koufos played high school ball with CJ McCollum.
He's more consistent and way better at defense than McCollum is. Plus he's bigger and more athletic. More experience. Just a much better player. I love CJ but he's just not what we need for his price.
"IFFFF either gets traded soon, it would have to be Bradley Beal.  Washington has been tense for Beal a bit longer than the Dame rumors have had any real substance to them, plus Lillard has spent years building his brand on the specific idea of staying loyal to the team that drafted him, and wanting to have 1 team his entire career.   Not saying Beal doesn't say the same when its brought up, but it's a foundational block of who Dame markets himself to be, on a different level than almost any other modern NBA star. From the player perspective, Lillard requesting a trade would be a relatively heavier decision than it would for Beal simply because it would be a more drastic change in narrative and branding.   There's also a bit of a difference in their weight to each small-market franchise... besides the fact that starting PGs are going to be generally harder to replace than SGs, Lillard is perceived as just being a notch higher up the totem pole of NBA stardom.   Between the 2 teams, Beal's perceived value would be more closely comparable to CJ McCollum, not Lillard. Only one of these players (Beal or Lillard) has spent any time in their NBA career as a Robin to someone else's Batman, and that's going to put them in different classes when it comes to the team evaluating a potential trade package.   So the pressure on the player to make the decision, as well as the pressure/stakes for the franchise to be picky about getting the right deal, are just gonna be more difficult with Lillard.   That said, it's still most likely neither gets moved before the season begins."
"2014 - 15, we were battered with injuries to our major stars. Fuck CJ McCollum and Green. Warriors had it in the bag."
CJ McCollum and Kendrick Perkins in shambles
"Whoever downvoted my comment does not watch the bucks or know anything about them. If you seriously think that  the bucks would have traded Middleton for someone like cj McCollum, a smaller less proficient scorer because they lost to the nets is plain dumb.  It’s an absurd suggestion.  One, mccolllum is not at the level of khris and two, khris and too close for management to trade him without Giannis’s consent."
I wouldn’t call CJ McCollum no help
CJ McCollum used to be about the same talent level as Middleton now.  They’ve needed to get a solid 2-3 bench players and a two way wing.
Stop overpaying for slightly above average players like CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum for one
"No! He was too good through the entirety of the playoffs and was Giannis’s co-star on the team that has played with him from the beginning.  Giannis would have not been okay with trading him under any circumstance, but it wouldnt have gotten to that anyway.  He means to much to the bucks to trade him for someone like cj mccollum. Unless you get a superstar for khris and another buck, they would not trade him."
CJ McCollum punching the air rn
How can people honestly believe that and know CJ McCollum exists
"He said Willie Cauley-Stein could be a superstar on the CJ McCollum podcast, also told McCollum he'd be a perfect 6th on a championship team lol"
-CJ McCollum
Cj McCollum in shambles rn
CJ McCollum looking real stupid right now
"Doubt it, Kawhi should have gotten but someone said fred, some idiot will say Khris, and that idiot is CJ McCollum."
CJ McCollum take my 50 pts and Finals MVP and championship to the Bank
I wonder if at any point watching this game CJ McCollum has realized he’s an idiot with his Giannis slander.
Giannis: Literally has 50/15/5 blocks  CJ McCollum: Khris got better teeth though
“What about them Portis FMVP votes?”  -CJ McCollum probably
CJ McCollum looking real stupid right now for his MVP take
CJ McCollum punching the air rn
"Nba media and American players are super resistant to international players being the face/best players. I could be wrong but shit like CJ McCollum always hating on Giannis, Nba media wanting anyone OTHER than Jokic to win MVP, everyone’s hate towards Gobert (somewhat understandable I think he’s little overrated) and countless other examples. Idk I might be wrong but these guys are kinda dicks to them it seems. Giannis is the shit, the league should be happy a guy like him could be the face of the league."
"I’m well aware of how terrible Simmons was vs Atlanta, but I’m honestly in disbelief it’s now controversial that Simmons isn’t as good as McCollum. Did we watch the entire season? Did we watch Washington? I mean I’d like CJ but he does not give this team any better chance of winning if we do a straight up trade. Even mentioning that as a possibility isn’t going to happen because of that. We’ll either run it back or get a star."
"Who says someone else should get FMVP? If you're referring to CJ McCollum, that's not what he said--all he said was that Middleton should receive some FMVP votes, not that he should win, and in fact, he later clarified that Giannis should be FMVP.  Is there some Discourse out there I'm missing, or are you tilting at windmills made of straw?"
Portland also draft CJ McCollum over Giannis
"Rudy Gobert, Cj McCollum, Anthony Davis.  That last one is salt. The real answer is Jayson Tatum."
I'm seeing a lot of Simmons for CJ McCollum posts in various threads. Are people in the Trailblazers front office this morning really going to think that a trade like that is going to put them over Clippers/Lakers/Nuggets/Jazz/Suns?

"Is there any evidence that stotts is a better offensive coach than Clifford? Or did he just have dame lillard and cj mccollum? Obviously the blazers offense has been great and the magic pathetic, but the difference in talent is unbelievably large. When Clifford had Kemba in Charlotte he produced average and above average offenses regularly."
"They are not losing Dame, he is the offense not McCollum. Whatever CJ is giving on offensive he is giving up on the other side. Simmons would give the Blazers some balance."
"CJ McCollum is a low iq guard who can’t defend. The CJ for Simmons rumors need to die, as currently constructed the Seth curry + CJ backcourt would  be hilariously bad"
3-team trade  CJ McCollum to Toronto Simmons to Portland Lowry to Philly  Get it done!
The 76ers would for sure trade Ben for CJ McCollum before Kemba Walker.
"The point of trading McCollum isn't that he wasn't scoring -- the dude has straight carried us in past playoffs on his own -- it's that he and Dame don't fit together well stylistically. They both need the ball to thrive, they both need a lot of shots to get into a rhythm, and they're both not very good defenders.      The ideal piece to trade CJ for would be someone who plays great defense to cover Dame's weaknesses and who could be a playmaker when Dame is resting. Simmons theoretically fits that bill. A lineup of Dame - Powell - RoCo - Simmons - Nurk looks pretty good on paper, albeit with poor spacing."
"Of all the players being talked about, DeMar is the best option. He's a clear level above a guy like CJ McCollum"
Trade Simmons for CJ McCollum. Tell me this doesn’t improve both sides immediately.
"You're overlooking how much offense McCollum generates... and how we just watched Ben be a negative in the areas that matter most in a playoff game (scoring, free throws, and offensive rebounds.) You're suggesting trading a guy that could carry you on points some for a guy you can't have on the floor in a close game. Makes no sense.   Ben for McCollum is a terrible trade especially with his 33M + contract. Portland is going to be objectively worse trading CJ for Ben. Ben is not worth the asking price of CJ"
&gt;McCollum for Simmons makes the most sense  portland:  https://media1.tenor.com/images/b8b8589f09e11d3707bd14d5cc4579ff/tenor.gif?itemid=5588639  and lowry is better than CJ
"Imagine being a star player on another team, let’s say Damian Lillard for example. I’m sure he’s thinking “keep that motherfucker away from me” as all the analysts suggest trading him for CJ MCCollum. I can’t imagine any player on any team wants their owner to trade for Ben right now."
"Ya, a perennial NBA All Star on a team that doesn't fit for him or have veterans to help his atrocious mental game. A playmaking All-NBA defensive player is the thing Dame needs, and we aren't getting Kawhi. We wanted Draymond, but we now have a good chance at getting a much younger player that does similar (not the same) things.     I'm not sure what people expect to be able to get out of a CJ McCollum trade piece if not for Simmons. If you think CJ and Simmons are comparable in skill, then the trade still benefits Blazers (unless we overpay when matching contracts) because of fit."
"I can't believe the conclusion of 'Trust The Process 'will be a team with CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Tobias Harris."
"I think people here are going to be surprised at how much Simmons' value recovers simply by people getting over how reactionary they are right now.  Even after this series, he's still basically who we all knew he was this whole time.  It's not like he magically went from an elite shooter to a nothing shot.  With all his deficiencies, he's still a 3x all-star, 3rd team all-NBA, 2x 1st team all defense, 2nd in DPOY, steals leader.  CJ McCollum is none of that.  And he's 5 years older.  McCollum's good, but he's still not as good as Simmons, even if Simmons can't shoot."
There were saying CJ McCollum on local radio here but I'm not sure Portland would make that trade and there is NO way they'd trade Dame.  Wizards fans on another forum I visit were suggesting some kind of Simmons for Westbrook trade. That would intrigue me but I don't know if either side would really want that.
yes let's have a backcourt of Seth Curry and CJ McCollum
&gt; who is obviously unplayable in the playoffs and can't be on a contending team?  That's CJ McCollum.
"At this point, what is the best package anyone could get for Simmons?  Even at his peak, they were never getting Harden.  With the teams that are out now, who would want him?    Gobert-Kristaps-Simmons/Harris-CJ McCollum, Tyler Herro are the players that may be shipped off."
"I’m thinking our best path forward is swapping CJ for Ben and then bringing in Lowry in a S+T.   I’ve been thinking of a three-team deal centered around Ben, McCollum, Lowry, and Nurkic. Even after last night I still see Ben’s value as just a tad hire then CJs but maybe I’m a delusional fan."
Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum makes a lot of sense for both teams.
CJ MCcollum and picks  for Ben simmons
Can I offer 1 CJ McCollum??
"What about a trade for CJ McCollum? Portland gets defense and playmaking, Sixers get shooting. The 76ers would obviusly have to send something else, though, considering current market value, but it could work"
"McCollum for Simmons makes the most sense for me. Simmons gets to play big (screen &amp; rolls, high post initiator) with Lillard. CJ is also a perfect fit for Embiid, in the same way JJ &amp; Seth do. Maybe even more so since CJ can create his own shot.   I’d say Beal is a good fit too, but not way in hell will Washington agree to it."
Why would Indy give up those two for CJ McCollum? The dude isn’t an all star...
I mean Simmons for CJ McCollum works straight up on the trade machine. Not sure if either team would do it but a 1 for 1 is possible.
"So let me get this straight, we give up our starting 2, our starting 4, and our starting 5.  Instead, we get a 6'10 point guard who averaged under 10ppg in a 5-seed over 1-seed upset, with 0 made 3s and the worst free throw shooting in playoff history, and a shooting guard who I'm not convinced is a better 3pt shooter than CJ McCollum, and also lacks every other one of CJ's skills.  No thanks fam"
CJ McCollum has entered the chat
CJ McCollum does make more sense with Embiid but Simmons and Dame…NO! 😂
"Crazy to think that in that span 76ers hit big on Embiied and missed with Michael Carter/Nerlens Noel in the 2013 draft (could have had CJ Mccolllum, Giannis, Gobert), Elfrid Payton in the 2014 Draft (could have had Lavine or TJ Warren), Jhalil Okafor in the 2015 Draft (could have had Kristaps or Booker), Simmons in 2016 Draft (this may not be fair yet but could have had Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray) and finally Fultz in the 2017 Draft (could have had Tatum or Fox).     Really is not fair to do that, because hindisght is 20:20 and at the time a lot of those picks lined up with conesensus expectations.  I also like to exclude Giannis because over half the nba passed on him but it's crazy to think Philly could trot out a starting 5 of:   PG: McCollum/Murray  SG:Booker  SF:Tatum  PF: Warren  C: Embiid"
"Simmons plays like a bench role player picked in the second round, funny to watch. Need a team with Simmons, Joe Harris, Porzingis, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert call it the all-exposed team"
Stephen A Smith is all: “you can trade Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum or Bradley Beal!” —only if those GMs never want another job in the Nba.
Playoffs.  Playoffs is where your strengths and flaws are exposed.  Ben Simmons after this playoff series is now potentially on the trade block and might be considered a distressed asset.  CJ McCollum is considered a negative asset right now and would not bring back a true number 2 because of his playoff performance these past couple of seasons.  Are either of these players bad no.  The issue is with poor playoff performances is the perception of these players is negative because of their flaws.  It becomes very difficult and expensive to move them for an upgrade.
people have been saying cj mccollum for ben simmons. idk about it tho
Ben for CJ McCollum. Both get to restart. Ben in Utah would also make sense to me
CJ McCollum?
"Nah not overreaction. Cant pay a guy 35million a year who literally cant touch the ball in the 4th and is a ends up a complete nonfactor every year in the playoffs. First it was boston in 17-18, then raps series in 18-19, and now this. Theres very few teams where he can even fit and we will be lucky to get back a  cj mccollum level player for him at this point"
"Rough trade outline (we can quibble about number of picks or adding some young players):  Sixers receive: Bradley Beal   Blazers receive: Ben Simmons  Wizards receive: CJ McCollum + 2 Portland FRPs and 2 Sixers FRPs   Lillard and Simmons do their best Curry-Draymond impression. Sixers get a great scorer. Wizards either come to terms with the reality, start a rebuild and trade CJ for more picks OR they do the usual and fight for the play-in."
Because you want to trade Ben for the opposite reason we want to trade McCollum. Ben plays defense but doesn't shoot enough. CJ doesn't play defense and shoots too much.   Neither fanbase likes their players skillset. And I think that's because they're a bit of a scapegoat. You're not wrong to think that Ben or CJ aren't good enough. But I still think most people in both fanbases underrate their guy.
"Sign and trade for Kyle Lowry, trade Ben for CJ, roll out an Embiid, Harris, McCollum, Lowry starting five plus somebody (Danny Green?). With that backcourt honestly Seth Curry needs to go, he is just too bad defensively and you can get something decent for him."
CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons. Let’s do it!
"We might get worse offensively, but we get better defensively and we have someone that can legitimately run the offense when Dame is out of the game. Right now we have MeJ running the offense, and during our peak selfish play before McCollum and Nurk got hurt, I nearly gave up on the team because I couldn't stand watching the second unit of MeJ, Trent, Melo and Kanter. We would go almost the entire quarter without passing. It would be one guy coming down the floor and jacking up a shot time and time again. Totally selfish basketball. I can't stand it. The sad thing is that CJ could be so much better. He's so skilled and he's so smart, but he's so selfish on offense. Sure, he gets assists, but the guy drives me up the wall with his over dribbling and extremely tough shots."
"1. Chill, just asked you a question politely.  2. I know exactly who you’re implying the trade involves. CJ McCollum correct? Philly fans have been pushing that one hard.  3. It’s an opinion, you’re allowed to have one just like anyone else. People are allowed to disagree with you."
"Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum? Simmons trade stock is low. Both on huge, expensive contracts. CJ gives Philly a guy that can just flat out score in iso and has defenders to cover his defensive liability, could totally be an all-star on another team out of Dame's shadow. Simmons gives Portland (the worse defense in the league) a great defender to pair with Dame, and maybe Dame is the leader Simmons needs. Both teams need to switch it up or try something new. It could help both teams?"
"Lowry, cj McCollum, maybe hield (or Bagley if you trust maxey to run point)"
"They didn’t ask could he be on the team, they said could he be the PG.  let’s say you get a scoring PG like a CJ MCCollum and have Ben Simmons play the Draymond role for this team, that could work.  Have be the 4 so it makes sense when’s he in the dunker spot all game but he’s not the primary ball handler."
The best one i've heard so far is for CJ McCollum
I don't see the pacers doing that trade. Ben for CJ McCollum is the trade that makes the most sense for everyone involved imo. Dame gets the Draymond to his Steph while the Sixers get their scorer. Only other trades I could see happening would be Ben for Lavine assuming the Bulls blow it up and tank. Ben to the Wolves. Or Ben for picks/role players then the sixers flip those picks+Tobi for a scorer/PG.
&gt; There was a post a while back about the most average #1 overall pick and it concluded that an average #1 overall pick is a fringe all star. Like a Mike Conley CJ McCollum type.   Kenyon Martin
"I'm going to bet you end up with CJ McCollum and Dennis Schroeder, remember this"
"I saw some nephews saying that the Sixers would have to give up a first to trade him.  Ben's trade value is no longer enough to trade for a superstar, but he's not a negative asset lol. He's like D'Lo or CJ McCollum plus a 2nd round pick and trash players to match salary level of value now. That's still a pretty big fall from grace."
I think it’s fair to call him a bust seeing as he never even sniffed an all star team.  There was a post a while back about the most average #1 overall pick and it concluded that an average #1 overall pick is a fringe all star. Like a Mike Conley CJ McCollum type.   So I would classify Wiggins as a bust because of the expectations for his draft position.
CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons would solve a couple different problems for both the Blazers and 76ers.
CJ McCollum for Simmons lets go
Went from Harden centerpiece to CJ McCollum centerpiece
CJ McCollum makes the most sense to me. Helps both squads. It's a gamble for the Blazer but a safe bet for solid offensive production for the sixers. I actually like it for the Blazers. Only way I see them getting a chip is Ben Simmons clamping the opposing teams best player keeping games close and letting Dame win it at the end 4 times in a series.
"Ben Simmons, Kristaps Porzingis, and CJ McCollum Shanghai Sharks big three"
CJ McCollum straight up
"Hi we also have a negative asset we’d like to trade can I interest you in a slightly used CJ McCollum (I love CJ and he’d kill it in Philly, he’s just a negative asset in Portland)"
Or swap him for CJ McCollum straight up.
CJ McCollum
Simmons for CJ McCollum straight up.
"Simmons for CJ McCollum, honestly Portland would prob say no at this point"
"Simmons for CJ McCollum, who says no?"
Soooooo.  How much could Philly have used a player like CJ McCollum this series?
"The Simmons project is a failure to the Sixers. This guy needs to be traded for Beal / CJ McCollum.  Simmons can't shoot, poor on free throw, a liability on offence."
Anyone ever suggest a CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons trade? Seems like a perfect match for each team.
"I wonder what Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum are doing?  Oh yeah, pelting bananas at their TV this entire game."
A player who can play in the 4th quarter   CJ MCCollum or D’lo is most likely
"They could have gotten guys like CP3, Bogdan, Rozier, hell bring back Brogdon, all for much less. Or maybe even bring in a combination of them.         Maybe try to go for someone like CJ McCollum in a 3 team deal if you want to use up all the picks in one offseason."
"Did you just call CJ McCollum a 3 and D player? He is all about offense, you could call him Dame lite, not 3 and D lmao."
Fuck CJ McCollum
"Wait until the CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons trade and then Portland plays Simmons at the 5, where he should be playing."
"McCollum have always been the second best player on his team in every series since becoming a starter, with a couple of series where he was their best. Ben’s usually the 3rd or 4th best player on his in team in most of the series he’s played in.  It’s more likely Embiid forces a trade to Portland for McCollum than a Ben-CJ trade."
Would you trade Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum?
Mike Breen also did Game 7 vs Denver when CJ blocked Murray. He said “BLOCKED BY- OH MCCOLLUM WITH THE BLOCK”. I’m 100% sure he was gonna say “BLOCKED BY JAMES” before he stopped himself.
"I agree with that. The one thing to add with this series is that Mitchell has just played out of his mind these past 2 playoffs. If he played close to this in the regular season, I don't think there'd be any disputing that he's on top. He was clearly the best player in the playoffs.  He goes from CJ McCollum in the regular season to Steph Curry in the playoffs."
"It’s sad to see Embiid’s generational talent kinda being wasted with an overrated fuck like Ben. Replace him with CP3, Dame, heck, even CJ McCollum, and the Sixers evolve. Yeah I get he has great D and such, but imagine Joel with fucking shot makers and gritty, go at it guys like Terrence Mann, not with lazy dudes like Simmons. That’s a chip for Philly there."
"This, hes giving you absolutely nothing offensively and trae is still dropping 30 on his head every night, earlier this year we were talking about trading him for James harden, now they'd be lucky to get cj McCollum"
"The narrative?  No.  Did it change his trade value? Absolutely, earlier this year they were talking about trading him for James harden, now you'd be lucky to get cj McCollum"
"&gt;  I still believe that if Morey attaches enough picks to Ben, the Sixers can get someone decent in return, like CJ McCollum  Reported"
The problem is CJ Mccollum isn’t good at basketball
We can offer 1 CJ McCollum.
"I don't know, they got shooters and CJ McCollum wouldn't be overmatched by big guards on defense. Ben Simmons needs a very specific kind of team built around him and I think Portland might work."
Cj McCollum. Both sides win win. Portland will add picks or one more asset. You get a closer
"A CJ McCollum tier player is the absolute most Simmons will get traded for, and tbh Portland would be idiotic to do that."
"Meh, we can at least get a better guard like CJ McCollum for Simmons"
"How is Butler a bad fit with Embiid? He was a bad fit with Simmons because Simmons because Simmons has little offensive skill in playoff ball.   Building a team around Butler and Embiid isn't complicated, you just put a bunch of shooting around them and the offense will be a top of the league offense. Trying to fit Simmons in with those two is where the complications happens, but keeping Butler would have opened up possibilities, such as trading Simmons for CJ McCollum and a draft pick to get a roster that works better around those guys."
"This super long, sorry but I had a lot of feelings. I had so much joy watching Tyrese light it up in the first half while Ben sat on the bench.    Earlier this season when he dropped 39 points against the Nuggets, I posted this: Tyrese Maxey isn't an unearthed precious mineral recovered from the depths of the earth, needing hours and hours of intense labor and hundreds of degree of heat to take form and value. He is a cracked-screen industry-setting next generation phone released 5 years early, akin to an iPhone 6 in 2011. The shards have their bite and it's uncomfortable to use but the daybreak of a new era is only a tempered sheet of glass away. That screen, that window or barrier to the greatest works of humanities brightest minds is a corrected hip sway. It throws his jumper off and leads to inefficient numbers. Once that's resolved, defenses will respect him as a shooter and passing lanes will open up for him in a new way.     This season has proven it's Joel's team, and I think if they don't win a chip this season, it's going to come down to what Joel wants. Tyrese is cheap and he **is** better than Ben but will he be a championship caliber point guard in his second year that can find Joel and Seth in their spots, shoot to keep defenses honest and not lose his cool when the defense focuses on him?    Obvious he's incredible but if the Sixers want someone like Damian Lillard, they'll probably have to trade him to make it work. But I still believe that if Morey attaches enough picks to Ben, the Sixers can get someone decent in return, like CJ McCollum who can be an explosive scorer but isn't a great defender and has injury concerns.    But it comes down to Joel because this is all on his timeline. Does he want to take the risk of having an immature/not-ready PG next year while he's trying to go for a championship or does he want to risk cratering the cap and missing out on playing with a guy who could fulfill all their needs next year. It's a thinker    My goodness! Tyrese! He's been incredible but he used up all of my surprise when I watched him play for Kentucky :)"
Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum who's in
Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum who's in
Dude in the Wingstop commercial reminds me of CJ McCollum
Ben Simmons for cj McCollum
"&gt;McCollum is easily an all-star in the east  Yeah maybe he's but I don't think an Embiid-CJ duo is winning a championship.  &gt;And also, who should the 76er's trade who's better than Simmons?  As I replied to another comment below, rn there's no one available but if a star asks out then  they should try to trade for him and if this doesn't happen they should stay with Simmons"
NOLA needs to sign Daniel Theis and trade Bledsoe and picks for an actual shooting guard. They’re close to the playoffs. Maybe a three team trade where they get CJ McCollum.   Lonzo/CJ/Ingram/Zion/Theis is solid
"McCollum for Simmons because Dame is the franchise in Portland  I love CJ and I think he is a great player, but the sixers would be selling low on Simmons to trade for CJ. Yea, I know CJ is a 24 ppg scorer in the regular season and a 22ppg scorer in the postseason but he’s never made an all star team, never made an all nba team and I know Simmons cannot shoot but he’s a 3x all star, 2x all defense selection and an all rookie guy. He has value to your team and trading him for less than a star or a player on the cusp of becoming a star might not be the best move.  If the sixers did that trade, I believe Ben would be great in Portland. He would allow dame to float around more on offense and not create for just himself. Simmons would also take on the best wings players defensively in the west and contribute on that end while lillard did his thing on offense. It might be the fresh change Simmons needs"
You are definitely right about one thing. Cj for McCollum doesn't make any sense.
Maybe paired with... joel embiid... might change things.  Cj McCollum is a *strict* upgrade to ben simmons in everything but defense.
"Because Lillard is a significantly better offensive player than McCollum… what you lose in defense trading Ben, you gain in offense with Lillard. Plus he’s an actual PG, unlike CJ who is more of a combo guard.   Trading Ben for CJ just swaps out one problem — half court scoring — for a multitude of others — backcourt defense, primary ball handling duties, etc."
That's CJ McCollum
james harden  damian lillard  brad beal  kyle lowry  cj mccollum   .  .   .   caris lavert &lt;——— you are now here
Pacers get:  * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum   Blazers get:   * Tobias Harris  Sixers get:   * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris Levert   * Malcom Brogdon
I’d say CJ McCollum is his ceiling.
CJ McCollum with better passing
"What I don’t understand about the Ben Simmons defenders who try and justify his current behaviour is how they say “well they betrayed him by offering him for James Harden”, like so what??? You guys act like he’s the first player to ever be shopped around lol imagine if every player acted like that. CJ McCollum is in trade rumours every season but he doesn’t do this"

"&gt;Portland Trail Blazers: The whole Dame saga  If we're talking about the perspective of Blazers fans (not national media or general NBA fans), I'd argue that there was far more concern and discussion over the controversial hiring process for their new HC, Chauncey Billups, than any 'Dame Saga' that ESPN talking heads were pedaling.  Fans here have known the whole time that Dame didn't want out, he was just pissed at Olshey's lack of team building (it's been a repeating message for several seasons). Lillard practically said as much before and after the coaching change (didn't believe that changing HC was enough to fix the roster shortcomings), and then still flat out denied Henry Abbott's report that he was gonna ask for a trade... just like how over the years he's flat out denied every rumor that some national pundit tries to start about his future not being in Portland.  Truthfully, there's even been considerably more debate about the ""can we get Simmons"" scenario than anything about Dame leaving... because, again, Blazers fans have known the whole time that a Dame-for-Ben swap was NEVER on the table, it's always just been about when Philly will lose patience and accept a trade around CJ McCollum.  I like what you did with the list, but when it comes to the Blazers, there simply has never BEEN a ""whole Dame saga"" at least as far as any trade concerns... it's just something that the national media likes to stir up every other year or so. It's not real."
"What's funny is the 10th had a stretch where it wildly outperformed as well.  Paul Pierce, Joe Johnson, Caron Butler, Paul George, CJ McCollum were all drafted with the 10th pick."
Not shitting on him! Just saying that comparing him to CJ McCollum is pretty ridiculous
"This is pretty wild      The 10th overall pick from those years for comparison     CJ McCollum, Elfrid Payton, Thon Maker, Zach Collins, Justise Winslow, Mikal Bridges.     I would take team 27th in a heartbeat.    What's wilder is that I had to go all the way down to the 5th overall pick to find a group I would take above them (Trae+Fox), which even then is less consistent overall."
"My current nba conspiracy theory is that lebron ( and also Chris Paul and cj McCollum, as heads of the nbpa) chose not to speak out about it because if the warriors don’t have Wiggins , denver doesn’t have mpj, it weakens the west slightly and makes it easier for them to win games"
"CJ McCollum is ""maybe"" the only person I would give a pass for not having a strong view on this because he's supposed to support the players. And that might mean supporting different opinions. Even if they're wrong."
"CJ McCollum is the president of NBAPA and while it was pretty mild call of action, he very clearly supported players getting the vaccine. Lillard and KAT are also team leaders who have been very vocal in support of the vaccine (both flat out insulting the unvaccinated)."
"I think CJ is a terrible way to go.  Let me go on a side tangent.    Everyone wants to shit on the Wolves players, but CJ (age 30) is in the same tier as Beasley (age 24 1/2).  CJ is one of the worst defenders in the league, and he’s not getting any better.  He has a career .553 TS% after his prime, his last 4 years McCollum has a .549 TS%.  He simply isn’t a high efficiency volume scorer.  Beasley has a career .567 TS% and a .574 TS% the last 3 years.  You expect him to be slightly better in his prime.  Beasley is a top 5 player at creating his own shot off ball with movement and a quick release.  He’s been an efficient 20 PPG scorer on Minnesota the last 2 years.    CJ’s big advantage is he can create shots with the ball in his hand at a much higher level.  For their own individual scoring, that doesn’t matter as much.  But if you think he can run point, his lower efficiency volume scoring is less of an issue.  He will shoot less and pass more and PGs are historically less efficient.   But the Wolves offer is likely Beasley + Beverly + picks, and Beverly can run point ok and defend PGs at an elite level.  Beasley’s value will go up and adding 2 40% 3 point shooters will open the floor up for Embiid more than just CJ will.  Unless he becomes an all star PG, I just don’t see it."
Westbrook: has to prove he can extend his range  Simmons: has to prove he's playable in 4th quarters  Zach Collins: Has to prove whatever potential we saw is still there  CJ McCollum: Has to prove he's good enough to be the second best player on a contender  Porzingis: Has to prove he's good enough to be a second best player on a contender  Rudy Gobert: Has to prove he can abuse mismatches  Zach Lavine: Has to show why he wants to be 'respected' by the Bulls  LeBron James: has to prove he wakes up before Skip Bayless to work out /S.  Check Skip's insta posts of about 3 weeks ago
"Big named centers not named Anthony Davis(Jokic, Kat, Embiid, Bam), Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Westbrook, and CJ McCollum  Center position is just a valuable position anymore. The rest are just players I don't think do well in playoff series on a championship team."
"How on earth have we gotten to “Ben Simmons doesn’t put in effort”? The guy has one of the highest motors in the league. Whatever his issues are with not shooting long range shots or really anything outside of 10 feet, it’s not “effort”. And the Blazers were horrific defensively last year. They could completely revamp the roster and still only be average there. It’s patently insane to think that Ben Simmons in place of, say, CJ McCollum wouldn’t be a massive defensive upgrade."
That team is not winning a title. Makes no sense to do the trade. CJ McCollum is an overpaid role player.
"Ok, at the risk of being downvoted into oblivion …  The one thing that I agree with Ben Simmons and Rich Paul’s camp with is that Morey deserves at least some of the blame for how much this situation has deteriorated.  Simmons’ strengths and weakness, as you pointed out, have been glaringly obvious for years now; to the media and other teams. People have been talking about how bad a fit Simmons and Embiid for at least three seasons. It was so apparent, one of the first things that Morey did was try and trade Simmons off the team.  What Rich Paul is pointed out is that nothing has been stopping the Sixers from trading Simmons, other than Morey trying to save face and have it both ways. There have probably been plenty of offers for Simmons; but Morey and the Sixers fans seem to expect superstar value in return for Simmons, when he clearly isn’t one, at least on this team.  You can’t bash a guy for not playing up to his potential the past four years, and be shocked that the best offer for him is CJ McCollum.  It’s it Simmons fault he’s not a superstar? Sure, and he should own that — but it’s not like he hasn’t been trying in spite of himself. You don’t become a DPOY candidate by not giving a shit. The dude just has a mental block he can’t break through.  Do I think Simmons is acting like a diva? Yes. But you know who else is being a diva? Daryl Morey. It’s not Ben Simmons fault that Morey burned his bridge with the Rockets, signing with the Sixers two weeks after he claimed he was leaving the Rockets to spend more time with his family. It’s not Simmons fault that Morey thought he could paper over the flaws of the Sixers roster with George Hill.  Listen, I really feel bad for Sixers fans, and I don’t blame them for being pissed. Sixer fans are the true victims here, they deserve a team with way less drama and bullshit. But they should be equally frustrated with the team’s front office since they pushed Hinkie out.   What Rich Paul’s camp is getting at in this article is that the Sixers pretty much picked Embiid over Simmons years ago, and the opportunity to truly maximize Simmons trade value was probably then. The Sixers trying to make a roster sort of work with both of them was probably a mistake, which Simmons has now come to terms with. Doc Rivers basically said aloud what everyone was thinking in that post game interview is probably what sealed the deal. In Simmons mind, he knows the franchise and the fans want to move on as well; and is balking at the request that he pretend that everything is hunky dory just so Morey can"
CJ McCollum
"Show me where I'm wrong lol. Simmons has the leverage here even if sixers fans don't want to admit it. So if yall keep waiting, ur gonna go from maybe cj mccollum to like, buddy hield"
"It is not CP3, It is CJ McCollum now."
"What trades were available earlier this offseason lol? The only thing Philly needs is a guard and name one top guard that was available at any point this offseason. The best guy reasonably on the market is CJ McCollum, who's no scrub, but I'm not upset at all with Morey trying to get someone better."
"&gt;	You have to trade back someone similar or a ton of junk.  Seems like players like CJ McCollum and Brogdon were offered to Sixers. We have reports from every team interested saying that Sixers asking price is absurd and we have Sixers reporters saying Morey only wants Beal, Dame or player of that caliber.          Seems to me like Sixers are the issue in negotiations.             &gt;	Philly has no obligation to trade him or plunge into a rebuild because ben got his feelings hurt.   So what are they going to do? They can’t waste a season because Ben doesn’t want to play for them either.            This situation **has to** be resolved by the trade deadline, and I don’t see how anything other than a trade is going to fix this.             If not, a lot of players on that organization are going to ask out and Morey’s own job would be in jeopardy."
Yea true  I also think Shaq &gt; CJ McCollum tho I understand if that’s also an unpopular opinion
"I mean I wouldn't call CJ McCollum a bad package. It's one of those situations where this is going to play out and I feel that barring something like Dame Lillard asking out (which there's no guarantee that the Sixers would even get him).      This is only going to get drawn out and again, a Sixers team with only Embiid is an injury away from being a lottery team. If the goal is to ""win now,"" which due to Embiid it is, letting this go on is defeating the purpose."
Just trade him for Cj McCollum and some draft picks and be done with it
CJ McCollum is now the President instead of CP3 so who knows
"In that first clip, I hate that they included that CJ McCollum clip as an example of something that is still a defensive foul. Way to muddy the waters, NBA officials.  IMO that clip is not really much better than the other two shots. CJ sorta swivels his torso directly into Zubac's path and goes up only to try to draw contact. If you get the defender off his feet, then drive by him and force the defense to rotate; that should be enough reward on its own. We don't need to reward the offense extra by giving them cheap fouls. If you pulled this in a pickup game, you'd get clowned on"
"Exactly. I think this is just a byproduct of the Simmons’ situation. 76ers want to show that Simmons is worth a return like Kyrie, instead of CJ McCollum."
"Because we ain’t beating the Nets or Bucks this year anyways.  If they were one CJ McCollum away then fine, but they’re not.  They only have one chance to get this right."
"Morey turned Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry.  Simmons going full bitch mode obviously isnt great but trading him for CJ McCollum gets the team nowhere for Embiids entire prime.  Rather wait and see what else is out there or take back a package with picks and prospects easily.  Look where the Sixers were last year as a 6 seed locked into that horford deal.  You are being way over dramatic, it is not his fault Ben decided to burn this shit to the ground"
"Throw in some draft picks (that can be kept or sent to a third team) and it's solidly better than he's gonna get at this point.   I've been all about a CJ McCollum for Simmons trade, but I'm not sure I'd do it at this point. Right now, I'd expect the Sixers to sweeten the pot in that deal.   I'd rather see what we got right now rather than make a big shakeup trade during camp when we're already installing a new offense and defense. I think most teams are in the same boat.   Simmons is a MASSIVE gamble for any team trading for him, both that he'll be good on the court, but also that he'll be happy and not just immediately ask for a trade again. That has to get factored into Simmons value, and I don't think Morey or Sixers fans are acknowledging this truth. And that isn't something that is going to change until long after a deal is done."
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
"&gt;CJ is worth more than Simmons. I’ll die on that hill.  I'm not a fan of either team but if someone as respectable as McCollum is seriously available right in the midst of all this, that is a miracle."
"Thybulle fills a similar role to Simmons: elite wing defender who's not a shooting threat. Simmons is a superior player, but Thybulle demands the ball less and needs at least some attention off ball. Thybulle's role will increase because he'll be relied upon to defend the opposing team's best perimeter player, an assignment Simmons often took, and the coaching staff won't need to worry about the spacing problems a Simmons+Thybulle line up has.  Green is similar to Thybulle with a shot, he fits in pretty much any lineup that involves a playmaker, he's not losing minutes. Especially if the Sixers replace an All-Defence guard with CJ McCollum, they won't want less defence next to CJ."
"Why in the world would that be the case?  They don't play the same position at all, Ben being there has no effect on his role.  Matter of fact, Ben being traded for someone like CJ Mccollum might actually cause Green to lose minutes,"
CJ McCollum tweets “I think it’s important we don’t lose sight of the fact that 90% of the league dislikes pineapple on pizza. Happy Monday.”
"Objectively true (Simmons is a multiple time all-star, CJ has never made it), but McCollum would be a better player *for the Sixers.*"
"Not the person you're responding to, but I'll answer:  Because I like good basketball.  I want to watch Embiid paired with a high level perimeter shot creator, which he's never had.  I want to see Dame on a team with vastly improved defense and secondary playmaking.  I want to see Simmons able to constantly attack 4v3 downhill when he gets the outlet from a PG you have to double 30 ft out.  I want to see CJ as the the primary facilitator on a team with an MVP-level big man.  ...  Simmons for McCollum is good for both teams, good for all 4 stars, and good for basketball. It makes way too much sense. That's why it makes some of us irrationally angry that it hasn't happened yet."
"Starting 5 of Maxey, McCollum, Green, Harris and Embiid, with CJ getting the best perimeter defender isn’t great on offensive and not good on defense.   Phili should take whatever they can get, but like you say Embiids time is ticking away and CJ doesn’t help that"
CJ McCollum
Cj McCollum isnt a scrub..he helps the sixers and frankly they should take what they can get. Moreys pride preventing him from settling on a deal
"I'm sure CJ McCollum is having an awful week, s/o to him, hope he's well. First 90 days on the job as NBPA President.  A guy like Kyrie, however, being in a very similar position, I can't imagine how much NBPA fuckery he's going to try to pull now that the money is officially on the table."
"Ben easily.  The Sixers have nothing to lose at this point thanks to Ben tanking his value.  Trading him for peanuts isn't gonna put this team over the top.  Embiid isn't an idiot, he isn't gonna be mad he isn't playing with CJ McCollum or Malik Beasily."
Your putting words in our mouth.  There’s a place in between “we need someone better than CJ McCollum to be competitive” and “Dame and Beal are our only targets”
"Kinda missing CJ McCollum, MPJ, and KMid there but i’d take team 2. Dame already suffered against Jrue. Giannis would feast against the forwards of team 1."
"&gt;t’s not at all lol. Your second sentence is true but Morey isn’t the cause of the toxicity, it’s 100% Simmons that’s the root. Embiid’s name is also not being dragged through the mud whatsoever.   It's on Morey - Simmons is happy to literally go anywhere now. He dropped the request for California. Send him to Cleveland send him anywhere. Clearly there is no path forward. Saying shit like ""this is like Aaron Rodgers"" and we are working on it is just going to make it worse. It's mgmt 101.   &gt;As any competent GM should be. If he wasn’t interested in that he shouldn’t be in his position.    His job is to build a championship winning team not win trades for the internet to cream themselves over. Pacers traded PG for Dipo and Sabonis, everyone thought it was an awful package at the time but both became allstars. Good GM can spot talent.     &gt;They’re holding him for a package to become available that they think is fair value for a player of his caliber. They’re not obligated to trade Simmons for what a random redditor deems fair value.    They are waiting for a reddit level deal lol rather than finding decent players like McCollum, Sexton etc who could actually help them win more than Simmons does.   &gt;They very publicly tried to trade him due to his defensive short comings. Terry Stotts didn’t utter the words “I don’t know if we can win a championship with CJ” but them trying to trade him **says that indirectly.**   Again - this is nuance. It's about knowing who you're speaking about. Don't show your cards and then act surprised when no one is going all in on your bluff. [You think this is the same as Doc saying he doesn't know if Simmons is a championship level pg? lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cfrg9qWgzU)   Simmons is a diva no doubt about it but Morey is trying to treat him like a superstar and a trash diva at the same time. It's not helping the sixers to hold him. They are better off selling him to the highest bidder."
"CJ McCollum is president now btw, CP3’s term ended about 8 weeks ago."
"I personally think AD is more parallel to KG. Both are versatile defenders. Great face up and midrange game. Better 2nd options than 1st options. Both have the same build and doesn’t necessarily dominate physically. To me, Giannis reminds me of a taller Charles Barkley/Tim Duncan hybrid.  unstoppable in transition, dominates you in the post, questionable shooting excellent help defender. Also, I think Luka is more like Bird because they aren’t necessarily the best athletes but controls the game in every aspect with a sweet shooting touch.   I would like to add that Hakeem and Embiid have similar playstyles.   De’Aaron Fox = John Wall  Jrue Holiday = GP  Prime Rajon Rondo = JKidd  CJ McCollum = Monta Ellis  Before anyone downvotes me, I am not saying they are at their levels. I am just saying they have similar play styles in my eyes. Feel free to disagree."
CJ McCollum was also very outspoken about COVID and the importance of taking it seriously and listening to science.
"Tbf, Sacramento had the franchise changer Luka in their hands and sold HARD (could've even traded down and got Trae like Atlanta did).   Minnesota had Steph Curry and passed him up not once, but TWICE and both players played the same position he did. The next year they passed on Cousins by one pick (PG was also 6 picks after theirs). The next year Klay and Kawhi were taken 9 and 13 picks below them (Kyrie was clear #1, could've traded down). Two years later CJ McCollum was taken right after them and Giannis 6 picks after. This goes on and on...  Orlando hasn't truly bottomed out since the Dwight trade which is partially why they've been stuck in purgatory since 2012. Basically what the Wizards are/have been since Wall started falling apart or what Charlotte was for years.  Tanking/blowing it up may not result in ending long rebuilds, but it definitely puts you in position to get the best young talent. Having terrible management is what makes these rebuilds not work though."
He's in that CJ McCollum tier. He's a fine player.  He's also not unplayable in the playoffs. He's unplayable in the playoffs on a team with Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris. There's a huge difference between those two statements.
"CJ McCollum. He can be an elite scorer, but his D is cheeks and he makes boneheaded plays often."
"I don’t know if that’s on the table, Blazer adding Larry Nance Jr makes their need for Simmons much less pressing.  Maybe the Blazers move LNJ+CJ for Simmons or something like that but losing McCollum does take away a lot of scoring that they can’t make up."
Cj McCollum had better advance stats than Ben Simmons did this year lol
sounds like CJ McCollum to me
"&gt;Literally the only way all of this is worth it for the organization is if they get a dame or Beal out of it.  No, his advanced metrics put his value around a few points a game, which many players around the league match, including CJ McCollum."
"I don't blame Ben. The coach and Joel Embiid dumped on him, then the whole media world and 76ers fanbase dumped on him, no one defended him. If he was my star player, I would not do that. 76ers organization have no one to blame but themselves for this unfortunate situation. Just salvage what trade value he has left, get CJ McCollum or Ty Haliburton and Buddy Hield for him."
"Joel’s championship window is unfortunately already gone. The best player Ben could possibly go for at this point is McCollum. Replacing Ben with CJ doesn’t take us to the next level, and trading Simmons for picks doesn’t fit Embiid’s timeline.  The best hope for Joel was for Ben to make a big step forward in his game. That didn’t happen, so now the situation is fucked."
Sexton putting up CJ Mccollum numbers while being even smaller is a good sell high opportunity to get more assets or a better piece to build around.
colangelo would have already dealt him for some bs like cj McCollum and a 1st. Morey is doing as well as he can with this situation.
"I’d say Hayward and McCollum are on the same tier/level of player, and Philly has already shown they aren’t willing to let Ben go for that kind of trade.  Plus I think CJ is a better fit for Philly. For all these years Philly has never had a good consistent scorer out of the PnR. The closest they got was with Jimmy."
"I look forward to an off-season filled with speculation about CJ McCollum trades, nothing happening, and the Blazers being a 1st round exit next season.   But for real, it’s time to shake up this core right ??"
HEY  HO  CJ MCCOLLUM HAS GOT TO GO
Monte Morris &gt; CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum is so overrated
"This is a CJ McCollum hate account   God dammit man, this guys is just not it"
CJ McCollum is ass
I’ve never seen a player die on screens like CJ McCollum
Monte Morris &gt; CJ McCollum
"If Portland offered CJ McCollum, a 2nd round pick and a 2m dollar trade exception right now to the Nuggets and asked only that that they guaranteed him 30 minutes per game the remainder of the series, would the Nuggets take it?"
"Cj McCollum on MPJ: ""Bro... he was not missing for shit. 1 hand in his face, 2 hands in his face. I'm like tf is this. Banking threes and shit. In all seriousness it's really fun to guard him. He's as tough as they come. No lie."""
CJ McCollum look like Stefan but he playing like Urkel.
CJ McCollum needs to just head to the exit at this point
CJ McCollum bounce back game
"Lakers: missed LeBron, AD, and Shroder for significant time.  Clippers: missed PG and Kawhi for a combined 38 games, before including 31 missed from Ibaka, 35 from Pat Bev, 15 from Marcus Morris Sr. etc.  Nuggets: Murray missed 24 games, Monte Morris missed 25, Dozier missed 22, Millsap missed 15, MPJ missed 11.  The only guys who DIDNT miss double digit games are Jokic.  Lastly, Blazers: Nurk missed 35 games, CJ McCollum missed 25.  Besides Dame, those are practically their only relevant players.  Glad you can talk shit in a 5+ month old deleted thread, when you didn't even comment on it initially.  Real impressive"
CJ McCollum would like to have a word
CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum and whatever else it takes.
"None, no one else's number two but the actual fucking fact of the matter is that in Dallas we have missed so hard on any actual good free agents for god knows whatever reason. I would have loved to have had PG, AD, Conley, CP3, Murray or MPJ, or CJ MCcollum to list the west's #2 guys but the reality is that right now THJ is our #2 and KP is underperforming his contract. That is fine to me because we just wouldn't be able to utilize our cap in any way that would benefit us better. We saved space because we were dumb enough to think we had a chance at giannis. I honestly wouldn't mind moving on from KP but also I am just fine with him being overpaid for what he gives us at times because we have proven that we can't get a player with a production of about 20 ppg, which is what KP is at..., for any less than a max apparently."
"Everyone saying Randle wasn't that good when the guy was taking and making CJ McCollum type shots all year. If the Knicks are truly back, they're back because of Julius Randle and Derrick Rose."
He isn't special at all. He should be traded for Cj McCollum because both are on bad contracts. I'm not biased or desperate at all
CJ McCollum?
CJ McCollum
"Kristaps ""CJ McCollum"" Porzingis"
CJ McCollum should be available not a superstar but he can shoot which is what u guys need
Nerlens “CJ McCollum” Noel
What would a Knicks trade for Cj McCollum look like?
The fact that Steph fans consider Andrew Wiggins a scrub that doesn't help with spacing. While also saying CJ McCollum and the corpse of Carmelo Anthony are world beaters giving Dame tons of help is more delusional but you do you.  I don't think Dames better I just put them in the same tier btw.
Not OP but the point isn’t terrible. Even though his skill set hasn’t diminished his contract isn’t really worth what you’re getting coupled with what you’d “have” to give up.  What team would trade a lottery pick for him? No one.  What team would trade a CJ McCollum caliber player for him? No one.  So then...what do you get for this guy?  It’s all fine and well to say he still has value but you gotta say what the value is.
CJ McCollum would like to have a word with ya!  Just kidding. Hope yesterday was just an off night for him.
Don’t know what the fuck that long ass acronym means but I’m not going anywhere. We’ve completely failed to ever but a contending team around him and the dude deserves to go somewhere he has a chance.   The fact he’s went through his prime with CJ McCollum as his best teammate is pathetic. There’s literally not a top 15 guy in the nba that’s had less help
"Gary Trent isn't replacing CJ McCollum at all.  Look at them compared at per 100 possessions...  [https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm\_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player\_id1=trentga02&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player\_id2=mccolcj01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=trentga02&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=mccolcj01&amp;p2yrfrom=2021)  Also, if McCollum is not actually that good in your eyes, who are you trading him to, and what are you getting back?"
CJ McCollum. He was our best player last night.
"Narratives seem to change daily, first the suns and clippers had NO CHANCE to even get out of the first round, and now suns/clippers looks like a solid WCF pick  If the blazers can win 2 games and turn this series around all of a sudden people will be saying well of course they are a solid team and dame is a super megastar MVP type guy, just have to get past the jazz (another team people dont believe in) and they are in the WCF  It's like the difference between being a viable competitor and having no chance is whether or not CJ mccollum steps out of bounds on one single play late in an overtime loss.  Thats bullshit, portland has enough to win if they bring their A game every night"
[CJ feelin' himself.](http://media.oregonlive.com/blazers_impact/photo/mccollum-glenoak-2007jpg-035a1c900e9cdde9.jpg)
"- cj needs to do what he did in 2019 - nurkic needs to learn from jokic and conserve his fouls (so stotts should be on him about this) - hit open jumpers  - cj mccollum is 30% on open shots, 13% on open 3s - robert covington is 27% on open shots, 18% on opens 3s - norman powell is 33% on open 3s - carmelo is 35% on open 3s"
"I’ve been in discussions in several threads about the likelihood of CJ McCollum, Simons or Little, and 2 1sts for Jimmy Butler. Lots of people say that’s not enough. But the thing is, the Heat *wont* be paying Jimmy $50 million at 35, 36 years old. They’re not that kind of team. That’s why they would make a trade to get ahead of it. They’ll want to shift their gaze forward as this core passes its peak (which was def last season)."
"These are some cold ass takes in this thread by some fucking nephews. It's fucking 2OT, all 10 players out there had clearly been running on fumes for several minutes. It had turned into basically streetball, the finesse had gone out the window, it was basically down to could grit out the win. You could notice it on the other side too. I saw multiple possessions where Jokic had what would've been an open lane to the rim, or he had Melo guarding him one on one, and he didn't even attempt to drive because he was clearly just gassed.  Do you guys have any idea what it's like to use your brain after you've been playing nearly 50 minutes, sprinting several miles, bodying up these guys, with the emotional rollercoaster of two overtimes? Fuck outta here. It takes a fucking braindead casual fan to make some of the comments you clowns are making, saying CJ McCollum isn't a good player. He instinctively puts his off foot back instead of forward, after being a level of gassed which 50% of you commenters will never be in your life, and missteps by 6 inches, and he has to deal with you losers calling him a terrible teammate. Go back to playing 2K."
"Injured forward Zach Collins yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Carmelo Anthony gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard CJ McCollum yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Lillard watched his team mates hit the backboard repeatedly, current NBA great Austin Rivers stood back with no hands and said, “Y’all ain’t making for shit.”"
I'm trying Jennifer  \- CJ Mccollum
"They used to call the Blazers, the Wizards of the West, but god damn CJ McCollum is no Bradley Beal.  I don't know what it'll take, but Beal and Dame need new teammates."
"Dudes sponsored by Anta, Li Ning, peak (Klay, wiseman's , CJ McCollum, dwade) are targeted here. Not LeBron (Nike)"
Not enough to convince you that a 6’7 Covington will replace cj McCollum
How can you even say this... did you see what Dame was doing? Is he supposed to magically make Covington hit two easy dunks? Or magically make sure that CJ McCollum doesn’t step out of bounds with the game on the line? Dame had 55 and 10 assists with 1 turnover and you’re here trying to tell me Jokic had a better game because his team won.
Poor lillard keeps getting sold by CJ McCollum every godamn playoffs.
"I'm pretty sure CJ McCollum has had more All Star appearances with Dame than Harden's Houston cast did. I think only Westbrook made the All Star team while playing next to Harden. CP3 should have though that one year, and was better than McCollum's ever been, but that team also pushed GSW to 7 games and that's a way better achievement than Dame has gotten in the playoffs.   But this is also why stars team up, they get sick of losing and getting judged for that. Dame won't be an exception, at some point he will face serious scrutiny for not winning with a smaller market/weaker team and then will go somewhere else, if he can't get someone to come to Portland.   They need to trade CJ if there's a real star available. They do shake out here and there."
"They don't have to be in their primes, they were still stars.  CJ McCollum is not a star."
He needs a Jimmy Butler instead of a CJ McCollum.
Send CJ McCollum to the Shanghai Sharks right now.
Send CJ McCollum to the Shanghai Sharks right now. Smh
I see MJ had his own CJ McCollum in Orlando Woolridge
"They seriously need to trade mccollum for a wing or guard with size. he’s not the problem per se but it doesn’t work pairing him with dame who’s already a minus on d. dames offense is obviously worth it but it’s hard to win in the playoffs starting two no d guards, and cj can really go cold when it hurts."
Unfortunately Daryl Morey isn’t going to be so foolish as to trade MFin Ben Simmons for a poo poo platter containing CJ McCollum lmao
"the unfortunate part is that I am not sure what's out there for them that makes them better.  The only young pieces they have are Simons &amp; Zach Collins, neither of whom hold a lot of value.  In theory maybe you can package those guys with the Derrick Jones Jr. contract for another veteran wing player but it's really tough to find an available player that moves the needle for them.  I don't know what you are getting for CJ McCollum (you could think about someone like Khris Middleton but the Bucks probably aren't interested) that makes the team better and Nurkic is expiring and I don't know how much value he has either.  Powell is a free-agent, maybe the team brings him back or maybe they can S&amp;T him to his preferred destination for something good."
Game 6 Injury Report  CJ McCollum - Out (Broken Jaw)  Damian Lillard - Out (Broken Hand)
Every time somebody says that Portland needs to trade CJ McCollum they need to say who they should trade him for. Because there's not a lot of teams that are going to be giving up anything good for CJ McCollum
So is CJ McCollum just JR Smith?
No they should keep letting him hit step back threes in isolation until CJ McCollum throws the ball into the fifth row accidentally
You mean Covington with two missed dunks in OT?   Or maybe C. McCollum (can't call him CJ anymore since he has no J)?
Paying CJ McCollum $100 million over 3 years.
"&gt;wasting the rest of his prime pretending he can win anything with CJ McCollum  Tonight was an epic waste, feels bad man  CJ so bad. I'm very doubtful he will show even next game. He doesn't seem like a consistent playoff performer"
"Trailblazers receive: Jimmy Butler   Heat receive: CJ McCollum, Anferney Simons, Zach Collins, 3 first round picks   (My friend who is a Blazers fan doesn’t want to give up Simons because he is the future after Dame. I don’t really see why the Blazers should be stubborn about keeping anyone besides Lillard after this game)"
I mean that's kinda what CJ McCollum already is lol
From Twitter: I think CJ McCollum should just go by C for the rest of the playoffs after tonight. J is clearly missing
All the homies hate CJ McCollum
From Twitter: I think CJ McCollum should just go by C for the rest of the playoffs after tonight.  J is clearly missing
CJ MCCOLLUM SOLD
CJ McCollum has got to go. Jesus
CJ McCollum thinks he's a sprinter now
And CJ McCollum was still the best Nuggets player on the floor
CJ McCollum saw JR Smith in the game 1 of the 2018 finals and said bet
Monte Morris played like CJ McCollum tonight
Cj McCollum making a big case for a move to the Shanghai Sharks
"If you're in that locker room wearing a Portland Trailblazers jersey tonight and your name is not Damian Lillard, how can you live with yourself? We needed only one of them to be fucking replacement level to pull this one off with the way Damian was playing, and what did we get? Robert Covington missing wide open dunks and CJ McCollum walking on the sideline with the ball.  I feel sick to my stomach."
CJ McCollum should go to the CBA. He would ball out on the Shanghai Sharks
[CJ McCollum](https://youtu.be/Ya2xifdO_l0)
CJ McCollum should never be allowed to shit talk again
Managing to lose this game the type of thing that’ll get Dame to start reconsidering this idea of loyalty and wasting the rest of his prime pretending he can win anything with CJ McCollum
All my homies hate CJ McCollum
145-140 Denver. CJ McCollum misses three with 4 seconds left. Denver shooting 2 free throws
Dame doesn't respect himself if he shows loyalty to a Blazers org that doesn't trade CJ McCollum. Seriously he should've been traded 2 years ago.
Dam Covington is actually playing well outside of those two missed dunks! CJ McCollum is the one letting down Dame right now...
CJ McCollum sucks. Blazers are gonna regret not trading him for Jalen Brunson
Dame should walk into Neil Olshey’s office and request CJ mccollum is traded tonight. don’t care about the trade deadline
CJ McCollum steps out of bounds with 9 seconds left. 143-140 Denver
CJ MCCOLLUM CHOKED IT FOR THE BLAZERS! WOW
I think CJ McCollum is the worst No. 2 option to a HOF-level superstar in modern NBA history
Does CJ McCollum play for the Blazers?
CJ “I Know I’m Nice” McCollum
"Damn, I didn’t expect Monte Morris to significantly outplay CJ McCollum"
PLEASE don’t make me watch another season of CJ McCollum ISOs
CJ McCollum is fucking awful.
"McCollum stole the ball on a clear reach (honestly, it was ridiculous, CJ hit him on BOTH arms) and the refs didn't call it."
CJ “i know I’m Nice” McCollum
Inside the NBA is gonna be funny in 15 years when Draymond and Candice Parker are talking about CJ McCollum having no rings.
"if that was a true foul, then CJ McCollum would be averaging 4 more trips to the line every game"
"Yeah often you hear players mentioned as having a career talking ball after they retire with media savvy guys like JJ Reddick or CJ McCollum, but I don’t want guys who are slick, I just want my analysts to care about analyzing the game.  I love seeing Draymond or KG because those are guys who just really fucking love basketball- obviously they all do, but some people just have that fervent passion and ability to dice things up and see things the viewers won’t perceive, and it’s fascinating to hear those guys talk ball.  Jokes and stories are fun, but I don’t want more social media drama age bullshit, I want to know how certain offenses pick defenders apart, I want to know how guys know when to cut and how they read screens, I want the nitty gritty that only people who’ve lived it and love it can speak to.   /end rant"
"Thought about this. I want RJ and Draymond, but I also thought of three other names that might work in this dynamic.  You'd have to screen test personalities as I don't know how the egos mesh.  JJ Redick, CJ McCollum, Joe Ingles. They might all be in the right age range depending on when we lose ITN guys. They all seem like natural media performers (or better, experienced through other formats).  I could see CJ wanting to go down the Aldridge route and wanting to be a reporter though. JJ for Ernie maybe - slightly more edgy due to his white Duke villain past.  Dray already is a Shaq sub somehow, and RJ would be a great Kenny sub. Chuck is hard to replace, but if you replace that southern accent with someone that works (Channing? Jingles? Some sort of Channing Frye/Jayson Tatum hybrid, although Channing Tatum is a ridiculous name for a media performer - it would never happen, right?), maybe?"
"They have him under contract for another season. I could see CJ McCollum and picks for Butler, flip CJ at the trade deadline, tank one season, let most of their money clear off the books, and reset in 2022-2023 with their high pick(s) and insane cap space."
Frankly as long as we can somewhat contend I’m down. I think we just owe it to dame. It’s sad the best teammate he’s had through his prime is CJ McCollum
You would like reliable free throw shooting you say?   Why we have got a shiny CJ McCollum available for trade who will give you 80 plus percent at the stripe in his sleep!  (Although CJ is also weirdly inconsistent at the line in crunch time for some reason)
Lol they would have tanked for years and used multiple #1 overall picks just to end up with a CJ Mccollum and Tobias Harris supporting cast around Embiid.
"After the Hawks series? McCollum for Simmons straight up. But for the Sixers, that doesn’t really get them anywhere. BKN is going to (likely) be at full strength next year. Trading Ben for CJ might make their offense more efficient at the cost of defensive rating but it won’t help them beat BKN next year. They really fucked up not trading him earlier. He’s infuriating because he’ll have 25 point triple doubles, and when you watch that, he’s not doing anything crazy. After all, even then he’s not like taking and making crazy shots. He’s doing what he should be doing all the time: Getting to the rim, making dunks and layups, and at least during the season was shooting about 65% from the line which is good enough. But he doesn’t do that often despite having the ability to."
"If I’m embiid and throughout all these years with the assets the sixers accumulated and I ended up with CJ fucking McCollum , I’d  ask for a trade my damn self"
Fuck CJ McCollum
The funny part is CJ McCollum tweeted about Giannis not guarding KD
what was CJ mccollum going on about then? seriously asking because I feel like he'd know everything you just said unless he's just throwing shade just to throw shade. doesn't seem like something he'd do though. but maybe he's an overrated personality.
CJ McCollum for Julius Randle
"I think it would have be Dame for Simmons. If you gave Dame the keys to the Philly O, they'd work wonders, be even better than they are, considering their PG would be playoff proven and can shoot.  On the other hand, Ben gets the keys to the kingdom, is surrounded by shooters and lengthy big men, and is allowed to really enhance his offensive skillet, plus on defense, it would allow Portland to have a legit defender guarding a teams star player.   Also don't think Dame + Ben would fit or CJ + Joel/Tobias, but Portland takes that deal in a heartbeat if the going rate for Ben Simmons is a CJ McCollum lol"
"If I was embiid and got stuck with CJ McCollum and Tobias Harris after they had all the assets in the world his first few seasons, I would ask out. I don't think he will ask out as he seems to love philly but it's insane how bad they screwed up after the process if that's all they get"
"Fuck, does this mean they won’t give us him for CJ McCollum ?"
"He’s like CJ McCollum in the sense where he plays SG but he’s more of a PG, he has a style where he has good playmaking and reallly good defense. He can shoot but he’s looking to get others involved. Plus Khris is usually their SG technically and Giannis is the 4 when he should be the 5."
People are stuck in 2015 when ppl thought he was a CJ McCollum type player on defence
"I could see a Simmons-CJ McCollum trade working for both teams. Solves the defensive issues in Portland and gives the sixers more scoring. And if MDA goes to Portland, playing Simmons as a small ball 5 would be extremely interesting"
"Bro I don’t like Philly, but don’t try and solve your problems with CJ McCollum of all people, that’s just being mean to yourselves."
Trade Brandon Ingram for CJ McCollum and RoCo Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball for Lauri Markannen  Sign Kyle Lowry in free agency Trade Steven Adams for PJ Washington   Lowry CJ RoCo Zion Lauri  PJ Hayes Bledsoe NAW Lewis Jr
"&gt;Suddenly you've gone from James Harden to CJ McCollum... maybe?  I'm not sure I know any basketball fans who put him on the same level as HArden, ever"
"CJ McCollum. Only reason it won't happen is it makes too much sense for both teams. Trade for CJ, try to sign Lowry in FA. Enjoy new championship contender.   Portland fixes its defensive issues. Gets someone who will play with pace in the transition game. Gets younger. They also need to get a Lou Williams type of spark plug in FA."
"Murray who? Jamal Murray denver hangs up and Dejounte is laughable. And sure, I'm biased, but I don't see DLO or Brogdon being better options/players than CJ McCollum.   Lavine would be a good one though. Not sure how Chicago fans would feel about that, but if I'm Philly I'd trade Ben for Lavine."
The thought of a CJ McCollum-Seth Curry back court defensively makes me queasy
Is that CJ McCollum music!
"CJ McCollum and 2 1sts. Ben and Portland is a match made in heaven, he fills every need they have"
"I had an idea for a trade where Jimmy Butler goes to Portland, CJ McCollum and 2 Portland 1sts go to NOLA, Ingram go to Miami.  Portland goes all in with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk which is much better constructed than their current three guard lineup  Miami moves on from Jimmy since their current core isn’t getting it done and they don’t want to pay him $50m/y when he’s 35. Ingram and Bam are two young all stars they build around for the next ten years.   NOLA gets a veteran floor spacing shooting guard who can run point in a secondary ball handling role. You also get two more firsts, which you can package with other assets and a bad contract or two (see: bledsoe and/or adams) for a star.   Maybe the Trade needs to be rebalanced a bit with more picks here and there, etc. maybe a Miami pick to NOLA as well since they’re getting the best long term asset. But I think the core of the idea is sound.   Maybe you offer Bledsoe and 3-4 1sts for Grant, who the Pistons would definitely sell for that. Maybe you offer the Thunder Adams and 2 1sts for Horford (lol). Maybe you offer the Pacers Bledsoe and 2 1sts for TJ Warren, or Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Levert. Maybe you offer Bledsoe and picks for one of SexLand since that backcourt doesn’t have a long term future. On and on. So many options. Point is, between the Jrue and Ingram trades, you’d have ridiculous draft capital to pair with Bledsoe or Adams to build around CJ/Zion (and Lonzo?)."
"Man all Philly needs a is a closer. Obviously Dame would be perfect, but if they were able to get CJ McCollum on that team with embiid and Simmons, it would open a lot up. I wouldn't do a Harris cj swap straight up if I'm portland though."
Man I’d be pissed if was a sixers fan. I bet Simmons is gone this off-season. That CJ McCollum trade looking better and better now
"Flip a coin with Kemba IMO.  My concern with McCollum would be that he's really not a PG.  So while his scoring fixes the Simmons problem, it's possible it creates another big one with facilitating the offense.  Kemba is a much better ball handling PG and more adequately slides in to the lineup.  Also, while I wouldn't say Kemba is any kind of amazing defender, he's a considerably better defender than the truly awful CJ.  Other concern is why do Blazers do that deal unless they're blowing it up?  How do you possibly use Simmons without taking the ball out of Dame's hands?"
CJ McCollum.
"CJ McCollum, Porzingis, KLove+Garland"
"This is why they need to trade Ben for any other decent asset in the offseason that provides them with more shot creators. Despite his supposed 'DPOY' season Ben isn't even a Top 2 defender on his team is replaceable in Philly with all the defensive talent &amp; scheme they have. Getting spacing and playmaking around Embiid is crucial.  **Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum + filler** is an possible option for both teams as the Sixers would benefit from a quality, clutch shooter/shot creator with experience and Ben would only possibly fit on a team like the Blazers at the 4 or 5 position.   I know people scoff at the thought of trading their young stars for lesser talent because people think their young star players have so much more room to grow, but in this case Simmons doesn't. He's been the same player since the day he was drafted."
CJ McCollum
"This exactly.  Everyone- fire the coach, gm and trade for a better player than CJ.  OK, sounds like a good idea ... Who do you REALISTICALLY replace the GM and coach with? Who do you REALISTICALLY trade CJ with to get the team to the next level?  Remember this isn't 2k where you can just force a trade through. You think the Clips (Who leveraged their future to get him) want to give up PG for a McCollum and Roco? Seriously?  Enough whinging, let's get some genuine possibilities out here!  BTW- I agree something should probably change, but emptying the front office and getting rid of the second best player without a plan doesn't sound like the best off-season move."

cj mccollum it he was an actual point guard.
"I gotta go with Big Al Jefferson over Rudy Gay  CJ McCollum and Rudy gay are close seconds tho all time.  Tend to agree with your picks for last 3 years, notwithstanding tobias’ poor acclimation year last year"
Blazers fan here - it is mind boggling to me that CJ McCollum is a + on defense.
"CJ McCollum has been bad.  People act like he's our 2nd star but in reality, he's Tim Hardaway Jr(who's actually outplayed him so far)."
You need legends so JJ and Steve as entertaining as they are wouldn’t get on.   I think Curry has a shout tbf    Personally   Draymond Anthony edwards Boban as the host CJ McCollum
"Jj redick, embiid, draymond, and CJ McCollum"
CJ McCollum. Funny and well spoken
"I'm waiting for another game where literal NBA players are tweeting about the refs helping the Warriors lol (Jeremy Lin, Boogie/CJ McCollum to name a few)."
"Yeah, if the roles were reversed and you had a healthy Nuggets vs Portland without CJ McCollum it wouldn’t even be close imo."
Booker gives me CJ McCollum vibes. When he is off he is REALLY off and doesn’t do much to contribute elsewhere. Obviously Booker is the better player though.
Homie was a top 5 pick. CJ McCollum was taken twice as high. Put some respect on Al
CJ McCollum  So that we can have butler
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
can I interest you in a CJ McCollum
Playoff overreactions. Mfs were saying CJ McCollum was better than Kyrie in 2019
He's so good. Can't believe people thought Cj McCollum and Tobias Harris were better than him
"if you play bad you should get some flak for it BUT Knicks have young roster and this is the first time since Melo and Linsanity time that they have not sucked. Too much expectation as Cj Mccollum said playing in the nba, playing in the playoffs you are already a winner. Knicks are winners even if they end up losing this series. They went up from LUL its the Knicks to playoffs and now people expect them to win and dominate makes no sense. Same for Randle he went from beyblade man to MIP.  Only 1 in a life time talented players dont buckle down in such high pressure situation when its their first time there."
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
That’s almost as bad as the one on CJ McCollum
Knicks fans y'all still want CJ McCollum?
What I’m saying if you trade for McCollum is that CJ is the main part of the package. Obviously the blazers won’t give out CJ and 4 first rounders so the Rockets would rather have the draft picks than McCollum and little else
Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum straight up; do both teams get better? I think so.
"Who says you have to build around CJ Mccollum? You do realize the Rockets can trade him away, right? The point is to amass assets. You get a shit ton for Harden + another player that will get you even more. Mccollum is worth at least 2 FRP, you could get in the mix on a 3 team trade.. I mean you have options but more importantly you have avenues to basically become the next OKC who owns the Clippers future for the next 5 years. Houston could have had like 8 FRPs and maybe a young player or two that's worth evaluating. It's a really unfortunate missed opportunity by the Rockets to accelerate their rebuild.. it is what it is."
This is still a really bad trade for the clippers. Post injury Nurkic being swapped for Zubac doesn’t even come close to making up for the massive gap in value between Paul George and CJ McCollum. CJ just gets held to far far lower standards than Paul George which is what makes people perceive the gap between them being smaller than it is
Just a thought but CJ McCollum is just a fatter 21 savage.
CJ McCollum plays so lackluster everytime in the playoffs
"McCollum is Lillard's BFF. There's more involved to trading players than just fit, skills, and contract. Obviously it would depend on the FO. Morey probably would have no problems shipping CJ to Siberia whether or not CJ is Lillard's BFF."
"Don't know about the Bucks but I'd do a CJ McCollum for Khris Middleton swap.  Dame-Powell-Middleton-RoCo-Nurkic.  Defensively stalwart team, right there."
It’s 2021 and Austin Rivers is sticking it in CJ McCollum
CJ McCollum ain’t it
CJ McCollum looks like Jaleel white
CJ “”DeMar Derozan” McCollum
"Ofc on the ROTY ladder Quickley takes it, but I personally think Maxey is the better player. I can see him being a CJ McCollum level all star player. His game is just a lot more advanced and smoother than IQ imo, IQ moves a little unorthodox"
