He gets bodied by any physical center  He fouled out against Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley the other night ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Wait Dedmon is a FA ?! I thought he was injured that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt see him yet.   I feel he would be an upgrade over tony Bradley for the 3rd center spot on the Sixers. Could provide some spacing for the nights Jo doesn‚Äôt play.
Tony bradley danny green and seth curry and a churched up 2nd round pick for lowry. Masai shoves you off the phone with that offer
Unless Turner has to face the powerful combo of 35 year old Dwight Howard or Tony Bradley  Or any physical center for that matter
We practically traded tony bradley for favs and bojan.....
"Conley isn't the same player he was last year, he's much more adjusted to the offense and his role. He looks like the Mike Conley we wanted to trade for in the first place  Bogdanovic is back and finally rolling coming back from wrist surgery, which held him out in the playoffs. He was a 20 PPG scorer last year  Favors has returned and looks great, especially defensively. He's been a big reason as to why our bench unit is so much more successful than last year when we were throwing out Tony Bradley and the corpse of Ed Davis whenever Gobert was sitting or injured  Royce O'Neale keeps steadily improving  Jordan Clarkson looks even better than he did for us last season after we traded for him"
People are saying Myles Turner after he fouled out defending 35 year old Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley üòÇ
"tbf last year they were really solid in Embiid-less lineups since Horford was such a good fit at the 5 in Simmons-lineups  It‚Äôs a different challenge when you‚Äôre starting Tony Bradley, thus, different solutions"
It's a pretty easy trade salary wise for the sixers to make. Mike Scott+TFerg+Tony Bradley+Poirier  gets it done. You can sub in some combination of Korkmaz and/or Dwight Howard as well. You can configure that however you want and throw in picks or your young guys to make it work.
When you study for Embiid but get Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard on the test.
Myles turner put up 9 and 5 against tony Bradley and fouled out let‚Äôs relax a little bit suggesting Embiid is ducking that lmao
[Myles Turner decided yesterday to announce he was ready to step up to the challenge of Joel Embiid and then a day later put up 9 points/5 rebounds and fouled out against Tony Bradley and 35 year old Dwight Howard.](https://twitter.com/dansbadtweets/status/1356065509880582147?s=19)
Yeah Tony Bradley ain't it. We need a stretch 4 that can play small ball center for when Embiid is out
I‚Äôm as against Ben at the 5 as anybody but at some point you can‚Äôt keep doing this Tony Bradley thing. They were ok in the first half with Ben at the 5 they‚Äôre not stopping Indiana tonight regardless of what configuration you put out there
So you‚Äôre going to conveniently forgetting when Ben won us 16 games in a row without jo? Like how is a game with tony Bradley starting what you base your opinion off of? Or are you going by the other games this year when Ben was recovering from injury and our roster was wiped out by COVID? Like did you watch the playoffs last year and think wow a team with Joel Embiid as their best player is a perennial first round sweep? It‚Äôs really hard I know but try to use your brain and think about things that happened before this game
tony bradley has played 8 minutes and were only in the second quarter  stop it
Tony Bradley*
"No, we are starting Jazz legend Tony Bradley"
"&gt; Those 2019 moves to invest in offense (not having the firepower for 2 years vs the Rockets in the playoffs)   It was shooting, more than anything. We effectively replaced Rubio &amp; Crowder (good players but not exactly good shooters) with Conley &amp; Bogdanovic (two excellent shooters).  Prior to that we were running lineups where we literally had three non shooters in Gobert, Rubio, &amp; Crowder, which obviously screwed up our spacing and left us relying on Donny bailing out possessions a *lot*.  We simply didn't have enough weapons on offense, and it lead to offenses in the playoffs effectively keying in on Donny and shutting us down.    Our bench offense was also very weak, and the Clarkson trade (and our re-signing him this offseason) was lowkey as important as any moves we've made.    Now we've got, essentially, a roster of two very good defensive bigs in Gobert &amp; Faves, both of whom are active screeners and roll threats, and 6 good shooters we can put around those guys in Mitchell, Conley, Bogdanovic, Clarkson, O'Neale, &amp; Ingles.  It lets us keep playing the same system when Gobert sits, whereas last season we tried doing it with Ed Davis and Tony Bradley, and that didn't go well.  And of those 6 shooters, the first four are good creators, so it's no longer a matter of shutting down Donovan to shut down the Jazz offense.    The roster is ridiculously well constructed to fit Snyder's system.  Only thing I'd ask for is another good wing defender or two for the LA matchups in the playoffs, but that's probably asking a bit too much."
"Plus Favs is a much much better backup C than Tony Bradley. It used to be scary any time Gobert left the game, this season is a lot better"
"I mean, it was 6'6"" juwan morgan and bad Tony Bradley playing center but point stands."
"Favors and a consistent Conley are the difference this year. When gobert leaves the court, the defense is still strong, unlike last year with tony Bradley. We are also taking more 3s and making them then years prior."
Tony  Bradley / Vincent Poirer combo has been doodoo but I suppose you can‚Äôt really expect that much. It‚Äôs nice to have at least one big that‚Äôs worth a damn behind Joel.
side note hut apparently Tony Bradley is so fucking ass that he can‚Äôt even get on the court when this happens. embiid had already played about 7 minutes and was resting and then played the next 17 game minutes (rest of this quarter+Q3) because doc doesn‚Äôt trust bradley at all. Idk he doesn‚Äôt seem THAT bad to me lol
You'll take Tony Bradley and Terrace Ferguson and maybe some 2nd round picks!!
A nice Mike Scott and Tony Bradley would surely entice you. Maybe even a nice reunion with none other than Poirier himself?
Poor nuggs have no depth. Great starters who have to play more mins than they prob should and get cooked when they sit.  Honestly reminds me of us last year with Tony Bradley or Ed Davis at center and mudiay plus jeff green on the floor
Bro do you want Tony Bradley to be our back up for Joel?
In 19-20 Tony Bradley had a 100% 3 point percentage but they said James Harden was a better shooter just because he shot more?
"This is what I'd do:  **Minnesota Receive**: Ben Simmons  **76ers Receive**: Bradley Beal  **Wizards Receive**: Minnesota FRP (unprotected?) 2022/2024/2026 + pick swaps 2023/2025/2027, Anthony Edwards, Jarret Culver  Matisse Thybulle (PHI), Philly 2022 FRP (Top 15 protected, if not conveyed then 2 SRP)  Hawks FRP (Protected Top 20, 2022-2025, if not conveyed then SRP 2025/2026 conveyed), Tony Snell  **Hawks Receive**: Ricky Rubio  You could sub out the Hawks for a different team that you think could use Rubio more (maybe Blazers/Heat/Pacers/Bucks)."
"Not really he has made good picks such as al Jefferson, Tony Allen, Gerald green, rondo, Avery Bradley, Kelly olynky terry rozier, smart brown and Tatum. All of those players have contributed to either a championship team or multiple deep playoff runs. You‚Äôre not going to hit every draft pick and have them be a long tenure vet, but for the most part he has done a solid job at finding talent. Yes he has very questionable draft picks in the past but I would still trust him over almost any gm in league besides the raptors and maybe the warriors"
How about Tony Bradley for Kyrie?
does tony bradley play at all?
"Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed, mike Scott, Dakota Mathias, Tobias Harris...its like all our players"
"For an expiring contract, 76ers certainly help fuel the tank with Danny Green, Tony Bradley, and Terrance Ferguson. No way they should ever give up Maxey for a few months of Lowry rental. Maybe some 2nds on top.   It would basically be a thank you favor from Toronto to Lowry for his tenure there, to send him home to make a run if the Raps aren't pulling it together this year. Philly certainly couldn't re-sign him at anywhere near his current contract."
Danny Green or Tony Bradley best i can do
We played Dakota Mathias (2 way player) and Isaiah joe (2nd round rookie) 40+ mins. Tony Bradley (3rd string) 25+ mins and Paul reed (2nd round rookie) 25+ mins.   What‚Äôs your point?
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
Wtf when did Tony Bradley join the Sixers ?
I get that it's just a positional issue but lol if Tony Bradley somehow manages to get a DNP tonight when there are only 9 players available
Malone played Jokic about 30 minutes on the front-end of a B2B too. And he was out there needing to play the refs into getting foul calls on Tony Bradley.
Not being Tony Bradley is Favors biggest contribution to this team

Tony Bradley showing Doc that he deserves more playing time
My boy Tony Bradley stuffing the stat sheet
i just got destroyed by Isaiah Joe and Tony Bradley in dynasty league that basically has all players who are in NBA on our teams so someone even has them
"43 mins 2 TOs. Had the ball the entire game. He's honestly disgustingly good ball handler and decision maker. He reminds me of Tony parker. He's so good getting to the rim and legit has one of the better floaters in the league. He also never stops moving off ball.   I think this game could've been closer if maxey saw more mins with reed at the 4. I'm not üíØ but I don't think they played together until the 4th. Reed isn't amazing or anything, nugs were just really struggling around the rim because of his length. Reed got most of his mins in the green, mathias, joe, reed, bradley lineup and those guys actually held it down with maxey on the bench with green playing point. I'm pretty sure maxeys only positive +/- mins will be in garbage time when reed was out there."
Tony Bradley?
"Against 4 rooks, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Tony Bradley. He should have double that."
Jokic is straight up getting bodied by Tony Bradley lmao
"Clearly said he hasn‚Äôt been good this game, which is 100% true when he‚Äôs playing against Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley lol."
Blessing for me. Need to see that Paul Reed - Tony Bradley - Dwight Howard monster lineup.
"Maxey, who is the goat to be fair, two dudes drafted in the 50s, Tony Bradley and Dakota Mathias aka the worst player on an NBA roster vs Nuggets and the refs   smh"
"Danny Green, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias. Mike Scott, who has a left knee contusion, was upgraded and will dress but is not likely to see playing time, Sixers coach Doc Rivers said.  Sizers beat writer on The Athletic"
"so who is in the rotation tonight? paul reed, tony bradley, howard, maxey, scott (to avoid forefit), ??"
"""player safety"" - okay Joel, go play 46 minutes tonight for a saturday afternoon regular season game. Just forfeit, or let Tony Bradley and Ben Simmons chuck up 3's for 3 hours on ESPN"
"Isaiah Joe, Dakota Mathias, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed are so far at the end of the bench, they usually outside the arena during game time.  Maxey has been given an opportunity to shine."
"yeah by my count it leaves 7 players available: Simmons, Maxey, Dwight, Isaiah Joe, Terrance Ferguson, Tony Bradley, Dakota Mathias  (Mike Scott and Furkan Korkmaz are injured)"
Okay...Pritchard for Tony Bradley

Getting Favors back should definitely help. Last year we were terrible defensively when Gobert was off the floor. Now Favors - who is a starting 5 in his own right - will be filling in those minutes that Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis weren‚Äôt very effective in.
Favors is super not-Tony Bradley
"Sure, I wouldn't say it turned out awful.  Just making a joke because at one point they had Plumlee, Dedmon, Okafor, Tony Bradley, and Stewart on the roster so it seemed like they were collecting all the centers for some reason.  And while it turned out ok, when they signed Liangelo in the midst of everything it was pretty funny"
"I've been discussing this trade with Raptors fans for months now, and they have given the exact same response. You guys don't care about Tisse or Maxey. Instead how about Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and multiple firsts (I think we can give out 3 with some type of protections)?"
Tony Bradley szn
"Yes. Literally better stats in every way to both of them at that point in their careers.   People here seem to be incapable of understanding players outside their total career legacy if they weren't watching at the time.  In no world where Bosh is averaging 17/9 and no longer the #1 option on his own team, and Duncan averaging 24/11 carrying a whole team would you consider Bosh the better player. So why flip it just cause Duncan was a former MVP at that point?  It's like people 15 years from now saying CP3 was better than Bradley Beal THIS YEAR because he has a better career legacy.  Tim Duncan has some of the craziest revisionist history on here. He was NO WHERE NEAR the LeBron/Kobe tier in the late 00s. A vet putting up respectable numbers for sure. But he wasn't a top 5 player at all and guys like Tony Parker were leading the offense for the Spurs and getting more MVP votes than Timmy.  I think the comparison to CP3 today is pretty valid about how ppl thought of Duncan in the late 00s. He was definitely past his prime."
"On one hand I agree with you, on the other hand I know you don't know how bad Tony Bradley was, so how do you know the impact?"
THT was a 2019 2nd rounder.  Probably have to consider the Thomas Bryant and Hart for Tony Bradley as essentially a draft since that was a draft day deal which IIRC happened before the Bryant pick was announced.  &amp;#x200B;  Also can't forget the undrafted bald mamba.  &amp;#x200B;  Say what you will about LAL player development but the scouting side looks legit.
I‚Äôm thinking Danny green and Tony Bradley for Zach Lavine. Who‚Äôs says no? /s
"Tony Bradley vs boban, the real matchup."
Absolutely. But Philly doesn't have any of those outside of Tony Bradley.. Meh.  Can always flip maxey for a young big man. It's all about assets.
"Favors over Tony Bradley is **monumental**  Last year we'd have similar starts to games that we see this year, only the moment Rudy sat a 12-15 point lead would EVAPORATE because Bradley just isn't a quality NBA defender yet (he's still young and I think he'll turn into a capable rotation piece) and we'd go down.  If we started poorly, when Gobert would sit a close game would become a 12-15 point hole we'd have to dig out of, sometimes we did, sometimes we didn't.  With Favors those leads are maintained, and close games stay close, so when the starters come back in they go up another 12-15 points. And you get a 24 game stretch where Utah wins 20 games by double digit leads."
"literally everything is better for them this year than it was last year  in terms of what changed on paper, healthy bojan, conley has adjusted to the system, favors is our backup centre now instead of tony bradley, and players like royce o'neale and joe ingles are even more willing to to shoot the three than they were before.  you can also point to some smaller improvements like mitchell is a more willing passer (even if his assist numbers aren't noticeably higher), gobert is putting in his best season ever defensively, clarkson has cleaned up his shot selection and is an actual human torch, georges niang is not a negative on defence anymore, snyder's rotations are a lot tighter and more effective as well"
"Maxey is waayyy more valuable than Nunn. Nunn will be 26 next season, he's likely in his final form as a bench spark plug. Maxey may have shown less, but he's over five years younger, that makes him more valuable. I think Precious/Maxey are basically on the same level, but Philly also have Thybulle, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz, and Shake Milton (who, notably, has been putting up numbers similar to Nunn while being two years younger.) Then there's picks: Miami has given up most of their picks in trades, Philly has most of theirs and a number of potentially valuable seconds (Knicks this year, most favorable of us/Hawks/Nets in 2023, Heat 2024.) Finally, as far as filler, Heat are giving up Iggy/Olynyk, whereas the 76ers are giving up Danny Green, Mike Scott, and one of Terrance Ferguson/Tony Bradley. Those last two are a wash, solely useful for being expiring, but IMO Danny Green is a better player than either Iggy or Olynyk, and can help the Raps retool while remaining competitive."
u want tony bradley?
Mentioning last years playoffs without mentioning the small but very important roster changes made this season by the Jazz.  Without Tony Bradley and us having an actual Defensive backup center for Rudy in Derrick Favors we don't hemorrhage points during bench minutes which was a significant factor in the jazz losing during those playoff games.
"Or Favors, which is probably the biggest reason. Tony Bradley was poopoo."
"Yeah the thing that hammered it home for me was this snippet of an SB Nation article from a year ago:  &gt;Recall that Tony Bradley, Utah‚Äôs backup center, was second in the league in most screen assists per 36 minutes behind Gobert. The reason why is simple: Utah‚Äôs offense is built around its centers setting a gajillion ball screens to get its drivers downhill. That means they both have ample opportunity to tally screen assists that other bigs simply don‚Äôt get, which is reflected in their high screen assist totals. The stat that is supposed to reflect the league‚Äôs best screeners instead ends up reflecting the ones who get the most chances.   &gt; In a sense, then, both Jazz centers are ‚Äúscreen assists stat-padding,‚Äù as weird as it may sound when describing an action as unselfish as a screen.  Essentially though, Gobert's offensive game is extremely similar to that of Tyson Chandler's, but with less bounce, more length, and worse hands. And a lot more screen assists."
"&gt; Millsap doctrine has been debunked again and again.   Can you show me an article debunking it? I would be very interested to see as I haven't seen good counters to it.  &gt;100 Tyrus Jones, TJ McConnell and Matthew Dellavedova was all in the top 12 in assists leaders  So what does that say? It says they are pretty good at getting assists and would also likely get a lot of assists if they played more minutes. TJ McConnell played more minutes this year compared to last year and guess what? His assists went up. He has pretty damn near the same assist percentage too.  &gt;Tony Bradley was the 7‚Äôth best rebounder  Tony Bradley is a damn good rebounder, it is just he doesn't do other things good enough to stay in the game.  &gt;Derrick Favours was the 10‚Äôth.  Derrick Favours is a damn good rebounder though."
"Millsap doctrine has been debunked again and again. Last season per 100 Tyrus Jones, TJ McConnell and Matthew Dellavedova was all in the top 12 in assists leaders.  Tony Bradley was the 7‚Äôth best rebounder, Derrick Favours was the 10‚Äôth."
"Tony Allen, Al Jefferson, PP, Avery Bradley, Gerald Green, Delonte West, Marcus Smart"
"I love Lowry but Embiid is 26 and Simmons is 24 we could be in contention for the next 6-7 years if we continue to build depth around these guys. To do that though you need to retain and develop our picks.   I just can't give up Shake, Maxey, or Thybulle for a 34 year old Lowry. Like Thybulle could easily replace Danny Green as a starter next year. Maxey's statistical profile ironically mirrors a young Lowry. Maxey isn't quite ready for the rotation yet but I'm projecting him to be a starter in this league and I think like lowry he has the tools to become a good 3 pt shooter and for a guard he doesn't really have any other holes in his game. I think he'd be playing better if we didn't have Dwight packing the paint.   Shake is actually already valuable for us. He's also hit a wall but how many combo guards with 7 foot wingspans and all around skill set are actually out there? Not many. Shake has also been defending at a high level and whereas in the past he's excelled shooting it and struggled getting to the rim, this year he's been excelling getting to the rim and struggling shooting it. So the best version of Shake probably hasn't been seen yet.   I think we should bring in a stretch 5 maybe Demarcus Cousins and trade for Jabari Parker. High end stuff, Otto Porter and Evan Fournier.   The most disappointing part of our roster has been the dead weight we're carrying in Tony Bradley, Poirier, and Terrance Ferguson. Those guys just bring nothing to the table. It makes no sense we're just keeping them when there's no chance of them playing or ever being useful."
"You literally dont have to look further than the players themselves, how many dogshit big man are there in the league that keep getting contracts lol... You think teams would sign Tony Bradley if there were any better options? same goes for the refs. Sadly these guys are some of the bball refs in the world. You cant just fire people and replace them with worse people"
what you don't think tony bradley is elite??!?!?!?!
"He's definitely better than Tony Bradley, but it sucks that the team is still so dependent on Gobert for rim protection."
Two firsts and don't even need Danny Green. Throw in Tony Bradley and Vincent Poirier's garbage salaries.
"Yeah, last year it was rough throwing Tony Bradley out there as a back up 5, but he was a better option than-- 6'7"" Niang."
Can I interest you in one lightly used Tony Bradley?
"Yep, this is why we sucked so much last season when Tony Bradley was on the floor.   Favors isn't on Rudy's level but he is a very good defender."
"It's pretty safe to say that with Bojan and Favors, this team would've won that series last year.  Instead we were playing lots of Niang and Tony fucking Bradley."
"&gt; Tony Bradley  OMG, that bad?!"
put Tony Bradley in please I can't watch Dwight anymore
"Top five picks have approximately a 1-in-3 chance of becoming all-stars.  Utah's last 3 ""top-5"" picks were Exum, Kanter, &amp; Deron William's. So their scouting &amp; development of elite talent is average.   However, their ability to scout--then draft &amp; develop--late lottery &amp; draft/undrafted talent, or G-league talent, has been very good.   Aside from players on their own roster in this category (O'Neale, Ingles, Niang, Oni), they are also responsible for bringing many other players into the league still currently on rosters, &amp; who've had mulit-season NBA careers through these channels through the Utah Jazz organization, including:   Gordon Hayward  Rodney Hood   Alec Burks  Trey Lyles  DeMarre Carroll   Rayjon Tucker  Wes Matthews   Tony Bradley  Raul Neto  Paul Millsap.  There are likely more still playing, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head."

"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"I think this is the game plan Snyder has always had, and he finally had the right team for it. The team is built around Gobert, his main role is to protect the rim. However, Gobert absolutely is not a shooter, so we can only rely on 1-4 for outside shooting. The last couple of years we generated a shit ton of open shots, but we never had the players to consistently drain them - Rubio, Favors (as PF starter), Crowder etc. Now all of the starters on the floor not named Gobert are excellent 3pt sharpshooters. The Jazz run a ton of screens &amp; switches, and their ball movement is incredible. Also the bench. Jordan Clarkson is a madman. Favors had only spent 1 season away from Utah his entire career - which was last season. He already has deep chemistry with this core. He comes off the bench and slides into the backup C role, where Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis severely lacked last year - defensively and getting boards. Add Joe Ingles and Georges Niang to the mix, and you‚Äôve got a deep team."

"Why didn't Tony Bradley get any run? I kinda know the answer, but I wanna ask lol"
"I honestly thought so too. I thought we were gonna waste Gobert's prime or have to trade him. If we didn't trade up for Mitchell, we were gonna draft Tony Bradley at 24, which...yikes."
* Clarkson takes 3s instead of 2s. MF also plays defense now.  * Mitchell is a better passer and has better vision. Improved on Defense.  * Mike Conley understands the system. Better on Defense this season.  * Bojan is healthy.   * Joe Ingles is resurgent.   * Derrick Favors is the backup C instead of Tony Bradley (when Utah would hemorrhage points on the bench).  * Royce O'Neale decided he wanted to be a rebounding god and added elite rebounding to his top shelf 3&amp;D skillset.

Wtf really? Who/when? Tony Bradley?
"Hopefully he won't have to as much since Bojan will actually be there, and we got DFaves instead of Tony fucking Bradley"
PUT TONY BRADLEY IN YOUR COWARDS
Nah we will probably start Tony Bradley lol
"Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed.  Reed who was called up from the G league for that game.  But there‚Äôs probably no possibility you are going to have a rational conversation about Embiid or the Sixers so there‚Äôs no point in further discussion"
"Between Danny Green, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Tony Bradley &amp; Vincent Poirier, the Sixers have enough expiring salary to take back $38.1M, Lowry's only getting $30M  Those guys aren't particularly great assets but the salary can be made to work and draft capital can be included"
"Most people use the Jazz last few playoff appearances as a reference on why you shouldn't take this team seriously. That is a lazy take for people who don't watch the Jazz, except maybe when they play their team.  2 years ago the Jazz lost to the Rockets, yes, but the Jazz roster was Rubio, Mitchell, Crowder, Favors, Gobert. The team looks completely different now. If you just look at last year, it was pretty similar to this year.   The differences: Conley and Bogdanovic have a year of the system under their belt. They are both playing better this year than last year. Bogdanovic missed the playoffs last year. He was the Jazz 2nd leading scorer with over 20 pts/game. It did take him a bit to get going again this year, but he seems to have hit his stride offensively, but is playing better defense this year and isn't a liability. Even without Bogey last year, if Conley's last shot is 3 inches closer, the Jazz beat the team who went to the WCF finals.  Clarkson was a mid-season trade who fit in decently from the start, and is flourishing in this system. He is playing the best basketball of his career and is front runner 6th Man of the Year. He's another shot creator, which Donovan really needed the last couple years.   Gobert is playing the best he has ever played on both sides of the floor. His defense is quite a bit better than the years he won DPOY, and if he continues is a shoe in. His offense has improved also. If teams really force the Jazz off the 3pt line Gobert gets a lot of open dunks, and if they take away Gobert's touches the Jazz find open 3's.  Mitchell has improved as a facilitator, and is benefiting from having others that can create offense on the floor with him. If teams double team him this year someone is open.  O'Neale has improved his defense and 3pt shooting. He guards the best wing players every game, and is starting to generate noise as a possible defensive team award.   Having a good backup center in Favors is huge. Last year when Rudy left the floor the other teams went on runs almost every game. Tony Bradley just didn't develop as fast as the Jazz needed him to. This year Gobert can get some rest and there isn't a huge drop off.   Finally there were reports that Snyder was bored with being inside from Covid, and revamped both the offense and defense to better fit the players that are on the team. They are getting more open looks at the 3pt line, and when you have four 40% 3pt shooters and Rudy inside, it's just a matter of picking your poison.  The only other argument is that teams don't win without a ""Superstar"". I don't know how a Superstar is defined, but I think they have 2 of the 20 best players in the league. Gobert's impact on the game defensively is equal to the best offensive players in the league's offensive impact. I get that defense isn't sexy, but points saved are equal to points earned. I think Gobert is top ten in the league, and possibly top 3-5. Mitchell is also playing as well as almost anyone in the league. His percentages are up in 3pt% and eFG. His pts, rebounds and assists are all up. He isn't far from averaging 25/5/5 with the best efficiency of his career. Now that teams can't double team and shut the Jazz down, in my eyes, takes this team from good to great.   They are a serious contender this year. Will they win the championship? I don't know. But I think they actually could, and anyone dismissing them isn't watching them. That much I know."

Honestly not being Tony Bradley is an excellent attribute
"So his best attribute is not being Tony Bradley? Fav is good, but Ingles and JC are a level above him"
"Nah, you see the problem is you're acting like we are the same team as last year and you're wrong.   You never watched Jazz games last year and I doubt you've watched hardly any this year either.   Last year we weren't 22-5, last year Clarkson wasn't a bonified 6th man of the year, last year Conley didn't play like he is the best he's ever played, last year Bojan wasn't in the playoffs and last year we had Tony Bradley as a back up center when he should've been in the G league.  You literally know nothing about this team, stop talking like you do."
"This right here, I'm amazed no one brings this up. Favors may not get huge stats off the bench but he's huge for us. Last year we had Tony Bradley in whenever Gobert was out and teams abused us when that happened. This year Favors holds his own and with the rest of the bench guys actually build off leads instead of letting them go."
"things started clicking, snyder changed his system to create more 3s, conley became memphis mike again (he understands the system and his place in it), we got a serviceable backup big in favors back instead of tony bradley, and clarkson has had his shot selection altered a bit for the better so he‚Äôs even more efficient with his omega green light.   in short, all the changes from last year are finally falling into place."
"it might be time to try some Tony Bradley minutes, Dwight is seemingly getting worse by the game. He's bringing almost nothing to the table at the moment"
Tony Bradley lol
Jamal Murray won‚Äôt have the pleasure of playing against Tony Bradley this time
"The Nuggets destroyed the Jazz bench. They staggered their starters to play specifically against the weak Jazz bench. That is where their advantage came from. Jazz starters killed it all playoff series long.  This year hapless Tony Bradley has been replaced by Derrick Favors and Joe Ingles is pushed to the bench because we have Bojan back (who was our second leading scorer last year and will probably end up there this year too.)  Last year the Jazz bench was a -8 points per game on average. This year the bench minutes are a positive. The starters are ridiculous.   Are you just going to ignore that a major cog of the Jazz offense was missing in the playoffs last year? I mean no excuses, you still gotta win, but yeah, the offensive rating will definitely be affected. I guarantee that if Paul George misses the upcoming games against the Jazz you will factor that into the pot if the Jazz sweep.  In any case, it would be a good series, even though i think you are vastly overrating the Clippers Pick and roll defense. I guess they could entirely neutralize one of the best pick and roll combos in the league. They haven't shown an aptitude for doing that either this or last season, though."
You forgot about the combo of Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley forcing him to foul out
He had a rough game against us without Embiid. Fouled out against the combination of Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard.
"He was only here half the year and literally turned the bench around immediately.   Getting Favors back and keeping Clarkson turns the bench into an entirely different beast. At this time last year we were relying on guys like Jeff Green, Emanuel Mudiay, Ed Davis, and even hoping Tony Bradley could develop and help out.  I'll be eternally grateful for Jordan Clarkson getting the rest of our fanbase off of Exum Island and onto Clarkson Cay."
"&gt; an up-and-down defensively (pre-COVID) 2019-2020   This is a huge misconception IMO. The 2019-2020 Jazz struggled defensively but it was not because Gobert regressed. The Jazz switched their focus to a more offensive heavy lineup (introducing Bojan, Conley, Clarkson). They replaced guys who were generally much better defensively (Rubio, Crowder) while also losing their backup center in Favors. They were running Tony Bradley at backup center and it wasn't working.  Rudy is the defensive identity of the team, so when they were no longer a top 5 defense, everyone seems to blame him, even though almost everyone around him got replaced with someone worse.   The biggest change this year is the reintroduction of Favors to the lineup, as the Jazz are no longer hemorrhaging points whenever Gobert leaves the floor.  Gobert really didn't change last year. If anything, he actually improved slightly on the perimeter (though it remains the weak point of his game). A mix of voter fatigue and a fact that most people didn't pay attention to the Jazz lineup changes affected his narrative negatively."
And don‚Äôt forget the upgrade Favs has been over Tony Bradley
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"It's honestly some hardcore 2k level rebuilding. Having 49 million committed next season is ridiculous. I think they'd try and match a few offers on Svi, and maybe Tony Bradley. They're also in a great position to get an absolute haul when they offload Horford at some stage. Contenders will be licking their lips at signing a rested Al Horford and also potentially clearing cap, but its damm sure gonna cost some assets."
If you swap Booker for Dwayne Bacon they 100% loose this game. If you swap Ayton for Tony Bradley I‚Äôm not so sure

And mfs were calling Embiid the MVP when Tony Bradley was right there
"Simmons, Simmons, Harris, BBall Paul, ~~Tony Bradley~~ Embiid"
"Tanking aside, one could easily argue it's legitimately better for the team to dedicate all the PF/C minutes they can to their many young guys who actually need the PT to develop. And by god, they have so many of them:  1. Developing Poku should be their #1 priority in the frontcourt. Very exciting player. 2. Isiah Robi looks promising   4. Darius Bazley is quickly turning into a potentially great stretch big who can get you 15/10 every night  3. Moses Brown is young and needs minutes 4. They also recently acquired Tony Bradley from Philly, and he's been averaging like 20 MPG over the past 4 games, minutes he needs and certainly wouldn't get with Horford back in the rotation.  Horford is not really much of an asset for the squad, he was traded to OKC as a salary dump for Danny Green. At best, you'd call him ""salary _filler_ for Danny Green"", but even then you'd be disingenuous. The main assets OKC got were Theo Maledon and the future first.  I would argue sitting old man Horford isn't about tanking necessarily, because if OKC didn't even have their pick, they still wouldn't play him much (if at all). Whose young guy from that list would you take away minutes from?"
Mike Conley is playing like Mike Conley again. Mitchell has raised his game yet again. Bojan is back from injury. Gobert is playing the best season of his career. Joe Ingles is leading the league in TS%. Jordan Clarkson has become an automatic bucket off the bench. Gobert‚Äôs backup minutes are going to Derrick Favors instead of Tony Bradley.  Plus we were already the best 3pt shooting team in the league last year and simply decided to turn that up to 11.  We‚Äôre really just firing on all cylinders at every position this season... except our 3rd stringers. They‚Äôve turned many 30 points blowouts into 15 point wins this season.
"Just wanted to note that Jazz lineups w/Gobert on the floor last season were all top-5 lineups defensively.  Unfortunately, Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis were shit backups @ the 5."
"&gt;What?  The Lakers win a ring every 4 years, on average, and Towns would've been a Laker for 5 by now.  Their rate is much higher when they have a top center, as well, somewhere around 50%, actually.  So he'd certainly have one, and quite likely more.  Towns has been an extremely good player from his 2nd season on, and if you think about their roster moves over the past 6 years, it's obvious they'd have been very competitive with Towns.    Had they drafted Towns instead of Russell, in 2017 they'd have had Towns, Randle, Ingram, Nance up front and even though young, that's as-good as anyone's frontcourt. They'd have never signed Mozgov -- almost certainly a guard, instead.  Maybe they still draft Zubac in the second round to backup Towns -- which is by-far the best center tandem in the league in short order -- or they flip him for a guard, because they wouldn't need or want Muscala.  They don't sign Andrew Bogut's corpse, either.  They probably don't dump Jordan Clarkson and Nance to clear that second max free agent spot, since they wouldn't need to.  They don't waste a 2019 second trading for Roy Hibbert, either.  They don't trade for Thomas Bryant, either.  There's not any telling who'd they'd draft after that point, but that front office did not really miss on draft picks, so they would likely be good.  They probably don't trade for Kuzma, but don't really need him anyway with the aforementioned forwards.  They almost certainly don't spend two more late-first round picks on centers in Moe Wagner, and Tony Bradley if they have Towns -- probably get guys like Derrick White, or Jalen Brunson instead.  They also don't fire Byron Scott in 2016, who was a very good coach.  The Lakers have wasted a ton of assets since 2015 in searching for a quality big man, and then blew an unprecedented package of assets to rent one last season.  With Towns, none of that would've been necessary, and they'd have been a far more attractive free-agent destination to boot.  There is basically no time in NBA history where the Lakers had a top 5 center and didn't at least make the Finals more often than not -- and the Lakers have had a top 5 center for about 30 seasons."
"I should also clarify that Tony Bradley was our backup big last year and bad, but I never expected a lot from him. Niang would usually play when Bradley was playing. And even if he played when Gobert played last season, opposing players would tune him up.  I expected a lot from Niang because I saw him at Iowa State and I loved him at ISU. What I see from him so far this season is exactly how I thought he would play this year."
I remember Tony Bradley smoking him and didn't even miss.
It's because the rest of the guys and their defense stepped up. They're 5-1 in that stretch with Tony Bradley starting for them.
5-1 when Tony Bradley started in those.
Tony Bradley can grab boards as well
Tony Bradley better
He‚Äôll be competing against Tony Bradley for minutes. Both play a similar rim running style. Seems smart to get some guaranteed money now and set himself up to stick in the league. He‚Äôll hopefully have a better bargaining position later on.
Same place as Tony Bradley
No. Although he might get a few minutes a game while Embiid is out. Sixers have no 5 depth after trading Tony Bradley.
We have Tobias Harris and we had Tony Bradley? I guess that half counts
"Hard to say when it comes to Tony Bradley since they were teammates, but Celtics (and by extension Theis) have not been able to stop Embiid https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-stats-by-game-against-celtics. Giannis has fared well against the Celtics too. https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/giannis-stats-vs-boston-celtics"
Theis and Tony Bradley come to mind.
Tony Bradley didn't play for Detroit. He got traded from Detroit not long after Utah traded him to Detroit.
Tony Bradley never played for the Pistons though?
Shit!!!  Knew we shouldn‚Äôt have gotten ride of Tony Bradley.  We coulda met the quota with Tobi &amp; Tony
I fear to inform you that Tony bradley is no longer a sixer
I fear to inform you this is not Tony Bradley
"Moses Brown dropped a 20 point 20 rebound game against a championship caliber team last night. Embiid and D Howard both vouch that we should build around Tony Bradley. Yes, we are tanking but we are winning games and playing competitive basketball, and definitely exploring the roster. I'm okay with letting these young fellas try to prove themselves and earn a paycheck. In fact it is kinda fun."
"Gorgui has averaged 15mpg for the past few years. We could have essily given him close to that while resting our starters more, and it would have been additional C insurance now that Tony Bradley is gone. But it's not happening, so on to the next hope."
Tony Bradley gonna be on there soon enough if he gets some minutes
Tony Bradley
Ik. I really wish we kept Tony Bradley. Dwight is Philly's only center with Joel out.
"7 games is a VERY small sample size‚Äîespecially 7 games where Rudy struggled and had to play extra minutes because the back up Center (Tony Bradley) was a massive liability against Denver.  Anyway, If you read what I wrote I literally said the only folks Gobert struggles against are MVP caliber players‚Äîlike Jokic.  I also acknowledged Mitchell‚Äôs defense, but it‚Äôs incredibly inconsistent, and he doesnt switch up well, which is why Royce almost always guards an opposing team‚Äôs best player.  I agree, actually, that Offense is more important than defense, but Mitchell alone does not impact the team‚Äôs offense the same way that Gobert impacts the team‚Äôs defense.  Without Mitchell, the team as it now stands gets a BIT worse offensively, but they have other good scorers who will make up many of Mitchell‚Äôs points (and if they had the 200mil they‚Äôre paying mitchell, they could almost certainly buy the rest of those points).  Without Gobert, the team literally falls apart.  They have a 30 point swing in their defensive rating when Gobert is off the court, and that‚Äôs with one of the best back-up centers in the league in Derrick Favors.  And unlike Mitchell, if they lost Gobert, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to find another center that does what he does.  There literally isn‚Äôt one."
"Yeah everyone says Gobert gets played off the court but the only year he averaged less than 30 MPG in the playoffs was his first year in it when he only played 10 seconds before spraining his knee against the Clippers. That was the year that Curry made him a shooting star meme so everyone kind of just gathers their opinion off that  In his playoff career, he has a net rating of +18 per 100 possessions, which is higher than pretty much every superstar in the league today (Harden +11, LeBron +14, Giannis +10, Embiid +3, Dame +6, Jokic +15, Durant +12, Curry +11, CP3 +15, Paul George +7). Kawhi and Anthony Davis are the only other top players I can find in this search with a +18 per 100 in the postseason. The Jazz just never had the offense to keep up with Houston, and then last year they didn't have a reliable backup behind Rudy.  Rudy didn't get played off the floor, Tony Bradley did lol  For what it's worth, Donovan Mitchell is -7 per 100 possessions in the Playoffs. He did play a lot with the 2nd unit in those Rockets games, though. We were desperate for scoring"
Presti is sitting Horford to give his minutes to Moses Brown and Tony Bradley the rest of the season. Brown has been better than Horford since coming back from the G-League bubble. I really don‚Äôt think playing Horford would make the Thunder any better. To each their own.
"Because you believe everything that comes out of Morey's mouth lmfao. Obvs Masai is gonna start high with an asking price of Maxey, Thybulle and 2 FRP. Green is there to match salaries only. That's how negotiations work.   The trade could've been made with the same package minus Thybulle for Tony Bradley. The only valuable piece in all of this for the 76ers this year is Thybulle.  If you think Lowry isn't worth Maxey, 2 low FRP, Danny Green and George Hill then you should tamper your expectations and not be surprised when the Sixers inevitably lose in the 2nd round or CF."
How can the knicks player jump on top of tony Bradley and they don‚Äôt call a foul
tony bradley
Favors hasn‚Äôt been good but he‚Äôs miles better than Tony Bradley and I don‚Äôt give a fuck what Embiid said about him. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we have the best record now
Forgetting Tony Bradley
"I mean seriously we started a game with Isaiah Joe, Tyrese Maxey, Dakota Mathias, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard with a bench of Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and supposedly Mike Scott I‚Äôm not sure why anyone is shocked that our differential is a bit off."
Turns out Embiid has been holding us back this whole time huh    Guess it's time to build around Tony Bradley and Matisse
Tony Bradley season
"Yeah, both of them have been bad this year. Favors is barely an upgrade over fucking Tony Bradley at this point."
*Tony Bradley
This just confirms Tony Bradley as the GOAT even further
Dude had no interior presence against us. Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard feasted against him and Markkanen. This team badly needs an interior presence on both ends.
How‚Äôs he not? Dude got cooked by 36 year old Dwight Howard and Tony Bradley
Best possible outcome. Unleash Tony Bradley (for the next two weeks)!
TONY BRADLEY SZN
"I mean, wouldn‚Äôt you? I was thinking Maxey, Green and Tony Bradley plus 3 firsts and 3 pick swaps, but if you want to go with your idea, that works too."
You must be forgetting about Tony Bradley
"Tony Bradley played better IMO.  Dwight's a fine player, but he's been a little up and down this season particulary when it comes to fouls and decision making. I wanna give Tony more of the backup Embiid minutes and see how it plays out.  He just seems to have a better feel for where to be and how to use his skills and body."
A overdose of defence please. Can't handle seeing us give up 80pts in the paint to Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard or every fucking center in this league.
"Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, Tony Bradley and 2 firsts and two swaps"
"How would you like Danny Green, Tony Bradley, 2 firsts and 3 pick swaps?"
"Tony Bradley showcase game, say hello to the Raptors' new starting center"
Dwight and Tony Bradley were dad dicking y‚Äôall the whole game lmao
"as we all predicted, the Tony Bradley game"
Tony Bradley should be leading the mvp race honestly
"If Hinkie had his way, he would‚Äôve tanked until he drafted Tony Bradley"
Tony Bradley   GIB AWARD PLS
It's been a rough 31 years but being able to witness Tony Bradley makes it worth it
"Tony ""the process"" bradley"
"Pompey hunt-and-pecking the ""Why does Joel Embiid hide behind Tony Bradley?"" article as we speak."
You had the lock...but we had the combination...of Tony Bradley and Dwight Howard.
"Him and Tony Bradley, fucking insane"
Tony Bradley?
1. Tony Bradley
Who'd have guessed our title run would be built upon the backs of such greats as Tony Bradley and 2021 Dwight Howard?
**76 points in the paint** with no Embiid and no Simmons. Tony Bradley and Dwight put em in the basket
[That‚Äôs it!!! I‚Äôve seen enough. Build around Tony Bradley @sixers](https://twitter.com/joelembiid/status/1370199867662929920?s=21)
Embiid was protecting the league from Tony Bradley

Build around Tony Bradley
raps are 4 games under?   smells like a lowry trade to me. yall watch tony bradley tonight?!
"Thybulle, Tobi and Tony Bradley?"
"C'mon Chicago, who will you give us for future All-Star Tony Bradley? Can we talk Thad? Otto?"
Tony Bradley looks like he just got out of the pool
Tony Bradley fast break üòé
"Bigger deal is having Favors as the Backup. Gobert was pretty good last year but the Jazz were probably last in the league in defense once Tony Bradley subbed in. Favors is no longer a defensive force, but he's at least replacement-level good."
we traded Tony Bradley in the George Hill trade with OKC lol you‚Äôll be seeing Mike Scott (downgrade) or BBall Paul (slight upgrade) tonight
Hey wait a second.  Don‚Äôt rest Embiid Simmons and Harris against us because we might win if Tony Bradley is your center with no other go to scorer.  Lol who am I kiddin.  My team sucks.

I agree. At least Tony Bradley puts some type of effort in on defense and doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs better than he really is.
Would you rather have Tony Bradley or Drummond? Because your answer should be Tony Bradley and he‚Äôs currently the backup big on the Thunder.   Drummond maybe isn‚Äôt the worst center in the NBA. Maybe there‚Äôs some absolute scrub sitting at the end of the bench. But Drummond simply doesn‚Äôt deserve minutes on any team that‚Äôs not actively trying to lose games.
"Did they ever say anything about ""accidentally winning""? You can call it blatant tanking all you want, but OKC has made it clear to the league that the organization AND the player agreed that he would sit down because of ""player development"".  We have been playing Moses Brown, Tony Bradley, and Isaiah Roby, who are the young players that we gave a chance. What is the league supposed to do? Force a player to half ass games instead of letting the young guys have minutes?"
"Yes, because we wanted to play Moses Brown, who inked a contract just after the Horford sit down, Tony Bradley, who just got traded to the team, and Roby, who had over achieved in the Center spot all year.  You can call it tanking, the organization called it ""player development"" and we are playing the young players more minutes, aren't we?"
"Oh boy, here come the posts   [""The fine has more to do with transparency (or lack thereof) from the team""](https://twitter.com/jlew1050/status/1383546493437505542?s=21)  Al Horford decided to sit down because he agreed with the team moving forward with a path toward ""player development"". You can call it tanking all you want and say it's a disgrace to competition or whatever, but I think it's better for everyone that we see Moses Brown or Tony Bradley, two players who have something to prove and is fighting for their literal NBA lives, play than Al Horford half ass games because he's forced to.  Anyone who argues otherwise most likely does not actually watch our games and is just mad we managed to get to third best odds for the draft."
Should we get fined for not playing Tony Bradley too? I‚Äôm sure he wants to play
Cant believe Tony Bradley hasn‚Äôt played tonight smh
People wanted a playmaker more than a backup center and at the time the Sixers had already traded for Tony Bradley. Dwight seemed kinda surplus to requirements. He ended up being exactly what the bench needed though
"Let's double check this.  &amp;#x200B;  He's better than Towns, JV, Trez, Kanter, Gafford, Tony Bradley, Drummond, Hermagomez, Whiteside, Zubac, Hartenstein, Dieng, Zeller..."
"The voting process for the All Team selections is pretty garbage. Like l stated, it's a popularity contest. There's no reason a guard like Jrue Holiday only has 2 All Defensive team selections when players all over the league (Damian Lillard, KD, JJ Reddick, Andre Igudola, etc.) say he's the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  Same thing with Jonathan Issac, Tony Allen for some early years, Jimmy Butler, Avery Bradley, AK-47, Robert Covington, and plenty of other players who were shafted in place of bigger names.  An NBA game is 48 minutes star players typically play 75% of that at 36mpg which is also where most of a games production occurs. If he is playing 20+ mpg  during productive stretches on the best team in his conference, which is also a title contender, l don't see how he isn't in the conversation. He plays ~10 minutes less than Ben (DPOY candidate) and Joel (an MVP candidate). That's less than a game's quarter. He has a plus / minus that shows his impact and it's all on the defensive end.  Dejounte Murray played roughly the same amount when he was selected. Tony Allen and PatBev had similar minutes as well in their years.  Don't look at other NBA outlets and analyst, see what the people he guards say about his defense. I presented the stats now go listen to his peers."
"Steph literally gave Jrue ""top 4 Steph defender of all time"" accolades (with Bradley, Tony Allen, and Seth).  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an alien. I fouled him on a half court shot. I‚Äôm pretty sure he didn‚Äôt even look at the rim, and he still almost made it. They didn‚Äôt call the foul.‚Äù. - Jrue"
"You would still be forcing a player to play when he doesn‚Äôt want to.   Sure, OKC is not playing good basketball right now, but I rather see players such as Moses Brown and Tony Bradley instead of forcing Al Horford, who doesn‚Äôt want to play anymore, to suit up."
"Phoenix:   Come on bro. Admit you're being lazy lol. By ""historically injured"" you mean he's had a sore hamstring twice and once broke his leg...leg breaking can happen to anyone lol. And two hamstring injuries in the playoffs in his entire long-ass career with several playoff years isn't a trend.  Utah:   You'll tell me that the jazz can't keep shooting 3s but in reality, the best 3 shooting teams DO keep it going in the playoffs (just look at the rockets and warriors the last several years). If you don't think utah will do that, you just don't believe in utah, which is fine, but don't pretend it isn't lazy.  They generate more open 3s than anyone ever has lol. That's a function of the offensive game plan. And their roster has excellent shooting (except favors and gobert who they don't want to shoot) all the way down to like the 10th guy on the roster.   ""I just don't think they can keep it up"" is lazy. You don't have a reason. You just don't believe in them cuz (let's be honest) you just don't like them. It's the same reason no one believes in them.  Come on. Be real, admit that's why lol.   I have already said I think the lakers are washed (and you've stopped defending that) so you picked bad examples with AD and gasol, but you ""would"" have a point, if not for the fact that gobert has become a signicantly better perimeter defender.  And you would not be aware of that, cuz you don't watch them, cuz you don't like them. (Which, again, is fine, I'm just letting you know).  Also don't acknowledge the dramatic difference it is having Conley integrated this year as well as the fact that last year they didn't have bogey in the playoffs at all. (Or favors. Which you wont appreciate, but he's a dramatic difference maker when last year goberts relief was ed davis and Tony bradley)   Denver:   Why are you just pretending MPJ doesn't exist lol. Most of your points are just intentionally ignoring certain things.      I absolutely DO think it's the case that lebron can't carry this team lol it's already happening. And you haven't pointed to one actually tangible thing about why lebron CAN do it this year...you just ""think"" he can cuz he has before lol.    Nurkic is a good player. I'm not ignoring him, but he doesn't make up for the fact that almost the entirety of the rest of the roster is not just ""not good"" at D, but open liabilities on D. They will always play for a shoot out lol...that's not the make up of a championship team.    I have no idea who's coming out of the west this year. I full on think it could be any of the top 6 current teams.  I don't believe in LAL or the grizz or the warriors to come out of the west."
"Why do you care? Were you watching Thunder games when Horford was playing?   However ""bad"" this may be for the league (btw, it's really not) the Thunder have every right AND incentive to focus on developing young talent rather than play Horford 30 minutes a night. We know what Horford is. He's a solid big man. But he's not even close to being in the plans for what the future of the Thunder holds. And that's what this year has been all about. The future. So the Thunder are giving our young players a look. Moses Brown, Tony Bradley have some potential attached to them. They're seeing if anything is there. That's the strategy."
"Yes, because it was a mutual agreement between him and the organization.   What‚Äôs the point of playing Horford when he‚Äôs not part of the future when we can play Moses Brown (who was a big part of our G League team), Tony Bradley, and Isaiah Roby (who earned minutes this season)?   If the NBA wants us to suddenly win, it‚Äôs easy, just give us the first and fifth pick."
"Yeah, We have 3 guys we play at the 5 right now. Roby, Moses, and Tony Bradley. If we played Horford 30 minutes a game how the hell would those 3 guys be able to show what they can do. Moses wouldn't have been able to earn a 4 year contract. Bradley wouldn't be able to get minutes. Only person that wouldn't be effected is Roby, but he would still be getting less minutes than he is now. And please answer me this, HOW ELSE ARE G LEAGUE PLAYERS SUPPOSED TO GET TO THE NBA? The g league Season is over. If they aren't in the NBA they aren't gonna get a chance until next season. The least we can do in a season like this is give these guys a chance in the NBA. They have to showcase what they can do somewhere, why can't they do that here in a small market franchise, during a Covid season where losing money isn't exactly a issue that other teams aren't facing as well."
"Ainge has had 3 top 10 draft picks. Two of them above 5. Both players taken at 3 are better than Russell and Ball. One is better than Ingram, and Jaylen is damn close to equal to Ingram.   Russell was an all star, he had that one good year, but he hasn't been anywhere near the expectations of a #2 pick outside of that year. You had the cap space for Randle, but decided you wanted to sign other free agents over keeping Randle. Again, that points to him not being a good draft pick by the Lakers. You've drafted decent role players, and the Celtics have too. Ainge drafted Rozier, Robert Williams, Tony Allen, Avery Bradley (he was good, but injuries added up). It's hilarious how you said Ainge has been trash, yet the Celtics have had a single lottery pick of their own in the last decade you've mentioned. Every other one has been another teams pick. Please explain how horrible it is for the team to have made the players every year but one. The Lakers could't manage that, even after multiple number 2 picks and getting LeBron. Must be that ""incredible"" drafting by the Lakers. You'd think if it was so incredible then four top 10 picks and the #1 or #2 best player of all time would at least get you in the playoffs."
"How do you expect to win without former Sixers Legends Mike Muscala, Tony Bradley and Al Horford ?"
"I'm telling y'all, Tony Bradley would be good for you."
"Hes 24 already and has only scored above 13 points once in 120 career games and is averaging 3.8 points. He basically has no offensive game so he will likely be like Andre Roberson,Avery Bradley or Tony Allen"
We got the pick that got us Harris and Zhaire who became Tony Bradley who became George Hill.   Ending up with Hill and Harris is still a win
"If I had known that Benitentiary and Tobi were going to be out, I probably would've felt better about not resting anyone and trying for the win.   We lost when Philly played us at Chase when Embiid and Seth were out. We got cooked by Tony Bradley inside, and Tobi and Ben were good w/ Shake coming off the bench. It was a similar low scoring affair like tonight's game, just the scores reversed. But Steph didn't play, and we were still in Wiseman development mode.  It's too bad we never got the chance to face each other at full strength/health. Hopefully next year we'll get those games and Klay will be back and healthy by then. GG bro."
I miss Tony Bradley.
Tony Bradley
Tony Bradley the +/- God.
"The other day I was thinking about what if Russ and Jerami never asked to be traded, but PG still wanted out, and then a year later we still traded Adams. This would have been the roster this year:  Russ//Dort//Shai//Grant//Horford  Maledon//Hill//Kenrich//Bazely//Roby  Moose//Moses//Svi  And then Gallo potentially could have stayed and also Hill for Tony Bradley could have still been a trade.   That's a complete ass roster with a ton of spacing around Westbrook."
"Warriors should be an easy win if Embiid plays. We couldn't beat you when you had Embiid out and started Tony Bradley instead. We're forced to go small ball the rest of the schedule, so I hope we don't try too hard to defend Embiid because I'd rather not have Dray/Looney or whoever else is put on him to get injured."
Pick up Tony Bradley
Tony Bradley but he is gone now :(
"I feel like Korkmaz has stepped up a bit, but it might be biased view by his few huge performances. Tony Bradley however, before the trade, really stepped up when subbing for Embiid. Also Danny Green."
I mean they still had an elite defense for those weeks Embiid missed and that was with like Tony Bradley starting at Center.
"Favors hasn't been that great in the post series, but oh my god, can you imagine if they still had Tony Bradley as the backup? d rating would be like 230 instead of 150ish"
"Tony Allen yes,  Bradley was too small for some players, Beverley should not be mentioned. Jrue is great but not thybulle is just better"
"Tony Allen, Jrue Holiday, Pat Beverly, Avery Bradley,"
We traded for him at the deadline by sending a ton of 2nds and Tony Bradley and then he barely played in the regular season
"Favors was good... But I was disappointed that he didn't turn into the superstar we wanted him to be. The league sort of shifted away from that type of PF.  Good Jazzman and great at his backup C role (much better than Tony Bradley).  However they wasted sooo many years trying to make the Gobert-Favors frontcourt to work!  I don't understand the hate for Hayward.  He was a borderline all-star/championship third option that wanted max money. He left for a then better team.. Spida came and bloomed in the number 1 option role! If he stayed, we might not have the same Spida we have today!"
Derrick Favors would still be tougher than the Tony Bradley we would throw at Jokic last year too
"Man, imagine if Utah still had Tony Bradley as their back up Center. That rating would be damn near 200 lol"
"In that case, Tony Bradley is unquestionably the best"
Or Tony Bradley
Great work on this.   You're stats show exactly why Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis cost Rudy DPOY last year
"Ehh, KG had Tony Allen, Rajon Rondo, and Avery Bradley with him in Boston. Even a couple years of PJ Brown, James Posey, and Rasheed Wallace just to name a few."
Etwaun Moore Kelly Olynyk Avery Bradley  Rajon Rondo Al Jefferson Tony Allen
I read this as Tony Bradley and was like yeah checks out i guess
Maybe sprinkle a little Moses Brown or Tony Bradley.

"Jokes aside, Tony Bradley would be clutch right now. Give him the Mike Scott minutes cause unfortunately there‚Äôll be some going up against the hawks and their bigs."
Tony Bradley is the best center in the league
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
"If you are referring to Embiid's recent injury, that alone already cripples the team's championship goals. Tony Bradley being Embiid insurance doesn't push the needle for the Sixers in any meaningful way. Also, Hill has been very effective being the 2nd unit ball handler in this series."
Ed Davis to the Knicks for Cash. Where we gave them picks. Then they flipped him for another pick within the same offseason  And Tony Bradley where we gave PHI a pick.   All that to still pay the luxury tax anyway.
"Seriously, the Jazz tried so hard last year without Favors and it was a nightmare. Tony Bradley seems like a good dude and he‚Äôs not the worst backup center, but the contrast when Gobert would sit and Bradley would come on was mind blowing."
"You weren't here for Ostertag, Fesenko, Koufos, or Tony Bradley?"
Bad Favors &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tony Bradley in any form
"Yeah he wasn‚Äôt very valuable, Tony Bradley turned out pretty well for us and we got great return on investment from Zhaire because of it.  Sucks what he had to go through but I hope he succeeds one day, although at this point I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôll happen."
"Well we traded him for Tony Bradley, who played very well for us, and then we flipped Tony for George Hill who has been and will be pretty important for our playoff run.  I‚Äôd say going from Zhaire to George Hill is pretty good."
You mean you wouldn‚Äôt pick Tony Bradley over him?
Tony Bradley before he got traded was up there
Alex Len or Drummond?  Tony Bradley or Drummond?  Dwight Howard (lol) or Drummond?
"Jaylen Hoard, Svi Mykhailiuk, Tony Bradley, and Mike Muscala are all players I‚Äôm preparing to leave the Thunder. There might be a couple trades involving moving Horford and/or possibly Vasilije Micic but I would want to keep him is given the choice."
"Looney tonight reminds me of Tony Bradley when Embiid went down  solid, stays within himself and makes he handful of shots he takes  love it"
We did that with Tony Bradley...it was not ideal
Could have sworn it was Tony Bradley.
"Overall, offense is a far more valuable attribute for a player to have than defense.  It is not a 1:1 ratio.  Typically, just being competent on defense satisfactory, as match-ups and schemes are more important than individual prowess.  One way defensive players typically don't fare well in the NBA.  They are out there, Tony Allen and Andre Roberson come to mind, but they aren't stars and are best used in match-up specific scenarios.  Hiding a players shortcomings on offense can often be downright impossible and the whole team comes to a crawl.  Hiding somebody like Trae Young and Bradley Beal on defense is not only feasible but they can still be your stars on the team.  There's no amount of amazing defense from an individual player that could ever match Trae offensive production.  Defense is also reactionary, you can make it as hard as possible for your opponent to score but it's always up to them to play better.  Of course being able to play excellent individual or help defense is still very valuable, which is why two way players are sought-after.  Draymond certainly is/was a two way player.  So is Klay.  As a whole, advance metrics do favor Draymond It's true.  Until you take Steph or KD off the court.  Then Klay handedly takes over.  Though in general when Steph goes to the bench, even with KD, everyone drops off pretty heavily.  At least in the regular season,  nobody can deny KD being mvp in the finals but overall steph,  the worst defender, is the most important player on that team."
The disrespect to Tony Bradley.
"To expand  &gt; On November 23, 2020, Smith was traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Tony Bradley. On November 30, 2020, Smith was waived by the Pistons.  &gt; On December 15, 2020, Smith signed with the Memphis Grizzlies, but was waived the next day.  &gt; On January 26, 2021, Smith was included in the roster of the Memphis Hustle."

"We'll give them Dort, 6, 16 and 18 and sign and trade Tony Bradley for near min to help w/cap, for Wiseman, 7 and either this year's 14 or their next available first (surely they'd take the latter)."
"Well they brought Favors back because they were garbage without Gobert defensively last year.    As for the pick I think Lindsey just really liked Azabuike.  It's kind of the same reason they drafted Tony Bradley.  You can't play him immediately but there's a floor of at least having a guy you know is a big athlete that can play reliable defense.  That still has value even if the guy doesn't develop all the way.  With the injuries it's looking bad but you still can't really judge whether that was a good pick or not. I wanted Bane and Bane definitely would have played for the Jazz in the playoffs this year but I don't think that was the one dude we were missing.  What they're missing are big athletes that can compete defensively with Giannis or Lebron or PG/Kawhi.  Even in retrospect I think it's defensible you take a bunch of shots on big athletes.  We really need to develop a few more guys, basically if Forrest or Brantley or Morgan don't develop we're fucked."
"(Nuggets fan btw)  **PERFECT:** The Kroenkes hold true to Tim Connelly's statement of being willing to go deep into the luxury tax, and we pick up somebody like Norman Powell, while Barton declines his player option. MPJ Extension gets done, and he develops his ball handling skills and defensive ability.  Jamychal Green opts in to his contract. Sign some backup center who can rim protect. Murray comes back healthy mid-season and returns to form by the start of the postseason.  **REALISTIC:** Will Barton either picks up his contract or declines and returns on a \~15M APY deal. We give MPJ the max. Re-sign Austin Rivers to a relatively inexpensive deal. Sign a backup 5 like Tony Bradley. Otherwise, run it back with current squad. Murray returns by the postseason, but won't return to his pre-injury form until the 22-23 season.  **WORST:** Will Barton and Jamychal Green decline their player options and leave for another team, while the front office doesn't do much to find replacements. MPJ declines any contract offer we put on the table this offseason forcing him to enter RFA in 2022. Murray never returns next season at all."
"Yeah, I'm not sure where to draw the line on ""international player."" Olajuwon and Ewing are widely considered international players, even though they became US citizens and played for the US national team. Duncan is sometimes considered international, although he was born a US citizen on American soil. Boozer is never considered international, he was born outside the US to American parents, and was a citizen at birth. Tony Parker is always considered international, although he was an American citizen at birth and acquired French citizenship later. Shawn Bradley is rarely considered international, although he was born in Germany and played on their national team."
They didnt go to it that much when embiid was out. A lot of tony bradley/Dwight minutes. I also think it‚Äôs one of those things that caught teams by surprise when they did go to it. If a team knows that Simmons at center is coming I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be super effective unless they have a lot of other good defenders around him to be able to switch everything (clippers style with their 5 out lineup).
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
"&gt;I said he can't get too much credit for getting a player right in the top 3  Why cant he? He absolutely nailed those picks in a way  no other team (besides Cleveland) with 2 top 3 picks has. How many teams have absolutely whiffed on top 3 picks? And neither of those picks were obvious choices either. Brown especially was considered a reach and Ainge was heavily criticized for that pick.   And the reason I brought those up was because he said that Massai wasnt Ainge when it came to draft picks. You can criticize Ainge for his drafting, but hes nailed the top of the draft in ways few people have.   If you want later picks we got:  Terry Rozier Timelord  Pritchard  Tony Allen Gerald Green Avery Bradley"
I was a George Hill believer. I didn‚Äôt think he was all that great but thought he would be fine in a very limited role and came at a much lower cost. He was not fine. And it Turns out still having Tony Bradley would‚Äôve helped us a lot more.
Yea Tony Bradley is what we‚Äôre missing in this series
Are you serious? Tony Bradley was terrible.
Jazz fans about to send tony bradley a ‚Äòu up?‚Äô text and thats fucking embarrassing
"You let Tony Bradley walk, that was your first mistake"
"Gobert got Simmons, Sixers need a new Tony Bradley"
Dwight can bounce with his butt buddy Ben. Should have kept Tony Bradley instead
"We‚Äôve never seen Moses as a great prospect. Lots of us preferred Tony Bradley as a longterm backup C way before this trade happened.  I think he could eventually be a 10th man and figure out a role in this league, but even that will take massive strides. He‚Äôs probably the rawest player in the league and has a lot to learn."
The most important part of this trade is that it makes room for okc to start sixers legend tony bradley
Nah. Tony Allen was big. This guy could be Avery Bradley
"No he wasn't. He was a disaster last season, no if you want to put that on Philly bench unit being bad do it, but Tony Bradley was clearly outplaying him before he was traded."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
he doesnt have the size to be tony allen.  he can be avery bradley with an offensive bag
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our ‚ÄúGM‚Äù). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
"Plus, it didn't hurt us really. Tony Bradley was fun to watch, but probably won't be much more than a backup. And if I'm wrong and becomes a potential star (a la Christian Wood), then I'll eat crow but he wouldn't really blossom into that role behind Embiid anyway. Worst case we traded him before he was at peak value.  Only other thing we gave up were 2nd round picks. All in all it was a wash that had potential at the time, so I wouldn't really think of it as a con."
"Please see Andre Iguodala as an example of why you're wrong.  Iggy did a lot of what Smart did, and he's been in the league for ever.  Pat Bev is 33. Avery Bradley is 30, Rondo is 35.  All these guys threw their bodies around and still do, and are still playing.   PJ Tucker is 36. I mean if i really wanted to im sure I could keep naming more, like Tony Allen played till 36."
"Eh they‚Äôll figure it put. Our perimeter defence already have some very solid players. Patrick williams, Troy brown jr, Lonzo ball, Caruso are all plus defenders. Tony Bradley doesn‚Äôt look too bad either. We have the pieces"
"ay can I get a F George Hill tho.  Worst move of the Morey era so far. Dude comes to our team for our best back up big in Tony Bradley. Barely plays and when he does play, plays like hot garbage.  leaves at the first chance in the offseason to sign with a rival. Then tries to poach our players to said rival smh."
We just signed Tony Bradley the only player I want is DFS... if we can‚Äôt get him I would hold onto Lauri.
"But they also can't sign anyone until Lauri is off the books, not even their 2nd rounders. They're ~44k away from the hard cap with Lauri's cap hold, and given that they only have 10 players signed right now (including Tony Bradley and Javonte Green) they'll have to just take what they can get at some point."
"Yeah, like I said, not the best. If we have Lauri that's a really solid 8 man rotation though. I'm also pretty high on Tony Bradley. Troy Brown Jr not so much. Simonovic is a guy to watch though, he was our 44th pick last year and had 1 more year in Europe before coming over this year. He's looked REALLY promising in SL, not in that ""he's putting up big numbers he's the next superstar"" way guys hype their rookies, but just the way he moves and his BBIQ are much better than I expected at 6'11. He could very well be a part of our rotation as well."
"oh geez.  yeah, no.  Their perimeter D improved substantially with the Caruso &amp; Ball signings, and they've also got TBJ in the ranks, along with Pat Williams &amp; Tony Bradley.  Their defense will be fine, better than last season, especially along the arc  Also, why are you mentioning last yr?  what in gods name are you even talking about lol?  AKME completely dismantled the old Paxson roster.  ZLV &amp; Coby are literally the only remnants.  Chicago has 3 all-stars, and two high-upside young pieces in the starting lineup in Ball &amp; Williams  With Billy D at the helm, they are going to be really, really good if they can stay healthy"
"It won't make sense whatsoever for the warriors.  With Ben, you have 2 non shooters on the starting lineup, teams will practically going triangle 2 on Steph and Klay (imagine a taller Grizzlies Tony Allen that refuse to shoot, and there's your Ben Simmons).  Also, Ben will just park down low block and clog up the lane when Steph drives to basket.  You're not really getting an upgrade overall with Ben (sure better defense (maybe), but definitely way worse on offense (since Wiggins can shoot and can score))  Lastly, you're blowing up your futures for a slim chance of improvement that most likely won't happen.  Wiseman, Kaminga and Mody are raw/rookies, why not keep them at least one or two more years to develop them?  (Now if you're trading them for Bradley Beal or someone of THAT caliber then we're talking, but Simmons, absolutely not.)"
"....Vooch?  Heck, he'll likely be their best overall player  Not just their ""Big 4"" either.  Pat Williams's growth is going to be exciting, and they have Caruso &amp; Coby coming off the bench, which projects to be pure fireworks  They've also got Troy Brown Jr, Tony Bradley, Jevonte Green, Dosunmu, possibly Markkenen, and this new Montenegren kid that Karnisovas took with last year's 2nd rounder Marko Simonovic, who is very tall &amp; very talented  Heck of a turnout job by Karnisovas &amp; Eversley, mopping up Paxson's disgusting mess of a roster/organization.  In less than 2 yrs, nearly everyone from the old Uncle Jerry/Paxson guard are goners"
I think the bench would look nice with Lauri.   Clear offensive focal points with White and Markkanen and three defense first guys.   Alex Caruso Coby White Troy Brown Jr Lauri Markkanen Tony Bradley
"I'm aware of Tony Bradley from his stint in Philadelphia and I don't think he's moving the needle. I saw ayo dosunmu play and I like his game I don't think he's going to see a lot of minutes and now that they have Lonzo Ball it should open up Coby Whites game up he's a pretty good three level scorer and can give you points coming off the bench or in a small ball lineup which I think we're going to see a lot of.  And I think you missed the point about the bulls needing a inside shot blocking presence that Gafford would have given them.  Because they are not getting any of that from Troy brown while he may have a higher upside than Gafford but how does that help them when you have a log jam at perimeter wing players with Patrick Williams, and Zach lavine, DeMar DeRozan there only so many minutes and how many can they find for him 12 to 15 a game tops?"
"1)  Gafford sucks.  You could put a broomstick in there with Westbrook, and if it can catch lobs at a respectable clip, Russ will make said broomstick look like Moses Malone.  Chicago moved him for Troy Brown Jr, who has considerably higher upside &amp; is a much more adequate fit for the contemporary NBA, on both sides of the ball  2) Chicago's defense will be fine.  It wasn't that bad last yr, and they shored up their perimeter D big time over the off-season.  Their overall D won't be stellar or anything, but it won't be terrible either.   Maybe actually go look up the stats/evidence before commenting?  The Bulls biggest weaknesses last season by far were ball distribution, turnovers, &amp; free throw attempts.  Both issues have been addressed &amp; subsequently remedied  They've also acquired Tony Bradley, who is a young, serviceable big body down low, and have a 21 yr old 7-footer from Montenegro, Marko Simonovic, that they've recently brought on board, who was their second rd draft pick last yr &amp; is already at the advocate centre practicing with Billy D &amp; their 2nd rd pick from this yr, Ayo Dosunmu, who also looks to be a solid NBA perimeter defender"
It seems like we got Tony Bradley too and he seems like he‚Äôd fill the Gafford role nicely.  We really need a backup pf though.
Tony Bradley is a solid replacement
"The bulls haven‚Äôt announced the demar, Caruso, and tony Bradley signings either. Pretty sure they want to announce them all when they‚Äôre done with free agency"
"&gt;I'm a bit confused by how low the # of all defensive teams is for iggy  Dave Berri showed, I believe in ""The Wages of Wins,"" how a players votes for defensive awards went up as their scoring did. Basically, the best way to get more defensive awards votes was to score more.   It also hurts Iguodala's case that two things seem to drive the public perception of defense:  1) On-ball perimeter defense, delivered with attitude.   2) Emphatic blocks, even if they go out of bounds.   Iguodala's great at on-ball perimeter defense, but what makes him a head-and-shoulders better defender than Tony Allen, Avery Bradley, John Wall, or Mike Conley (the guys who landed all-defense spots above him) was this preternatural ability to break up an offensive set off ball. He had a near-unique ability to anticipate a key pass, and simply move ahead of the play in a way that the pass was never even attempted, and the offense had to reset.  The value of something like that was something you had to watch him to see, especially because until 2015 or so awards voters tended to scoff at analytics.   Also, Kobe deserved many of his defensive accolades, but his all-defensive picks in '11 and '12 were absurd - entirely based on reputation and not what he was actually doing on the floor. There were some great posts on Silver Screen and Roll - a Lakers fan blog - breaking down just how awful his defense was in that period).   In my opinion, Iguodala is one of the most criminally underrated players of the past 30 years. We have four examples (Iguodala leaving Philly, arriving in Denver, leaving Denver, arriving in Golden State) which suggest that Iguodala's presence was worth 10-15 spots in the team defensive rankings. That's unheard of for a perimeter player."
"That‚Äôs one of the middle cases. As a peak? Idk man, they have 3 guys who have been all stars plus super nice players like Lonzo, PatWill, Tony Bradley, Coby White and Caruso. They could really do well if they put it together."
"For all the credit they rightly deserve, the Chicago Bulls kind of did this to themselves with a smaller role last year as well.  They traded away an athletic rim-running, young back up center in Daniel Gafford, who had some flaws but played his role well enough in his 2nd year to warrant keeping.  Fast forward to this Summer, not six months later, and the Bulls biggest remaining need was a young, athletic, rim-running center who can rim protect.  They ended up with Tony Bradley who also fits the bill, but for what was ultimately a rental of Daniel Theis, I'd rather have kept Gafford on his rookie contract.   Genuinely glad he is doing well in Washington and I hope that continues this season."

"It's not just that tho, Dwight had a negative net rating with Simmons (-8,7), Tobi Harris (-3,5), Seth (-14,4) and Danny Green (-8,5).   Like honestly there's a legit argument for Tony Bradley being better before the trade, they were absolutely horrendous when Embiid was sitting and Howard started. Now if you want to argue that it' sbecause of Simmons sure, but Dwight himself wasn't good last year"
"5/6 on hard, only missed freaking Tony Bradley going to Chicago. I couldn't keep up with all their FA signings."
"Considering I got a perfect 6/6 on Hard, I think I need to stop spending so much time on this sub lol. Why do I know that Tony Bradley signed with Chicago this offseason? I could be thinking about like, actual important stuff smh."
"Basically what Oubre got, yes. The only difference is that Oubre got 2yrs, and a S&amp;T has to be for a minimum of 3yrs. However only the first of the three has to be guaranteed, so that's hardly a limitation.  Any idea if Chicago wants Plumlee? I guess the only bigs are Vucevic and Tony Bradley on a minimum, so he wouldn't be the absolute worst guy in the world to add to that roster."
"I know you are just giving your opinion as of this time, but the offseason isn't over yet. The bulls will fill those holes. They have Tony Bradley behind Vuc, and Ayo and Troy Brown Jr are going to be on the roster as well. TBJ is a pretty good defender and Ayo is really versatile and mature in his game for a rookie. We'll see who else they pickup or get in a sign and trade for Lauri. Could possibly match Lauri if it's low enough and keep him for a backup 4. Even though his defense isn't great, his 3 point shot is still really good and he is young."
"I didn‚Äôt make any excuse. I just said that that‚Äôs a completely unfair comparison. If Bradley Beal somehow gets traded to the Nets, he didn‚Äôt somehow become a much better player because he‚Äôs going to make the finals now.  So saying ‚ÄúRuss is gonna make the finals and those players are not‚Äù is a completely ridiculous argument for why he is better value. Whichever you think has better value you should make an actual argument instead of saying stupid shit like that.  Also, I have said the same thing about Kevin Love being overrated (before everyone jumped on that train) and about Tony Parker being a little overrated at the time."
Vucevic and now Tony Bradley.
Hill was wildly disappointing for the sixers and tony Bradley would have been better to have in the playoffs.
"We've also gotten much better at point of attack defense so we won't be out of position as frequently.   Lonzo replacing Coby as a starter, Zach improving, getting Caruso to replace Valentine and adding Tony Bradley should keep us afloat.   My point is that I don't think we'll drop below average."
"The narrative has gone way too far on Lauri, I'm hoping we can retain him on the QO if no home run S&amp;Ts present themselves. Efficient versatile scoring on the second unit from a big never hurts, we don't need him to be a star anymore, and pairing him with Tony Bradley instead of Vuc works much better.   Not breaking any new ground here, but it's unbelievable to me that Lakers fans are happy with the Westbrook trade. I think they were straight up a better team before the trade. Westbrook might be a legitimate negative alongside those other 2, the contract is insane, they weakened the supporting cast and hamstrung flexibility to get complimentary role players."
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he‚Äôs traded for some defensive bigs because we‚Äôre in a bad position if we don‚Äôt get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
"Rudy Gay was from the MLE, this was from our TPE from the Tony Bradley move last offseason, Whiteside was a minimum, Conley we had his bird rights."
One thing about Tony Bradley that Bull fans will like. There is not a better center at basic fundamentals than him. He does a fantastic job of keeping the ball high during offense rebounds unlike most centers who bring the ball back down to their waist or to the floor. You won't see Bradley's shot getting blocked on an offensive rebound. He works hard and hustles. He just won't wow people with his athletic talent though.
Awww man does Tony Bradley suck
"The thing is 2 years ago it was Tony Bradley backup up Gobert, last year it was Favors who took a major step back in production. Both players were essentially traffic cones for opposing offenses. They signed whiteside for the vet minimum, which is practically nothing. All he needs to do it is play some sort of defense for 14 minutes a night and he‚Äôll be fine. I don‚Äôt know how you could see signing a guy for a minimum contract as a backup is one of the worst signings of the offseason"
"1. Stay healthy in the playoffs  2. Pray and hope one of Hassan or Udoka can play backup center minutes better than Tony bradley two years ago  3. Pray rudy gay, plus a healthy Don and Conley provides them enough wing defense to not get totally hacked by small ball"
Should have grabbed Tony Bradley.
"""That‚Äôs it!!! I‚Äôve seen enough. Build around Tony Bradley @sixers""  -Joel Embiid  https://twitter.com/joelembiid/status/1370199867662929920?lang=en"
"As of right now,  Alex Caruso  Coby white Troy brown jr Lauri Markannen Tony Bradley  Ayo"
We just did with Tony Bradley. Same age as Monk.
"Every year? We just did with Tony Bradley, he's 23."
"This is Tony Bradley, a center. When I first skimmed it it I thought Avery Bradley too. Thankfully the Bulls are now addressing the front court gaps."
When did Tony Snell and Avery Bradley have a baby?
Just got Tony Bradley
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
Bulls just got Tony Bradley so no on Powell. Raptors shout is a good one.
"We lost Thad Young, he is not a perimeter defense. Our interior defense is what we are worried for, with Pat moving to the 4, us signing Tony Bradley as Backup Center we are honestly just net neutral on the loss.   Thad was a vet would have been great as a rotational piece to keep but he was getting way too many minutes and dealt with injuries and straight up falling off in play for a bit later in the season. Refreshing with younger players and switch Pat to the 4 from the three where he was left to catch and shoot is a huge upgrade."
Are there any back up bigs left that we can get? I like Tony Bradley but dont know if he is available.
"Favors was great, but I think his strengths are at PF and not center. We were desperate to have someone play the Tony Bradley role last year and Favors was our best option with Azubuike out."
"Get Birch/Tony Bradley. Better Birch coz he can be situational PF too (proven pairing with Vuc last 2 seasons). Ofc dragic not worth that, but no one left on the FA pool rn"
"hell no, we all know drummond is ass.  would much rather have tony bradley as the back up and bball paul as the 3rd/small center"
Tony Bradley was the best IMO.  And we traded him for george hill who we just cut lol.
Nah.  But both are unplayable in the playoffs anyway.  Should have gone after Tony Bradley
"&gt;  76ers fans talk themselves into  I would hope not.  We all know he sucks, even as a backup.  WOuld have rather gone for TOny Bradley"
"It‚Äôs fair point. For the org and the fans into analytics, the non Rudy minutes where we were rolling out Tony Bradley were so so atrocious that we were bleeding points the second gobert went out. 29th ranked bench, until we made the trade for Clarkson which brought us to about 13th simply by keeping up with other teams bench scoring (we still bled points). Ultimately, we woulda won the Nuggs series if it weren‚Äôt for total Tony bradley destruction in the Jazz bench minutes two years ago.  So I think as fans and the org were just very keen on shoring up backup C with a player that we were familiar with and helped made us the number 1 defense several years prior and a continuous system of 4 out 1 in regardless as to whether we had starters or bench.  But ultimately, you are correct - favors got too much money for too small a role, and allowed for zero flexibility once out 4 out was hacked by small ball"
nah they suck. you better get Khem Birch or Tony Bradley tbh
He couldn‚Äôt do either of those things for us and in hindsight it wasn‚Äôt a good trade. Would rather have kept Tony Bradley especially considering how bad Dwight was against the Hawks.

Isn‚Äôt Tony Bradley a free agent? Or am I trippin
The role of ‚Äúour only center is Tony Bradley so why the fuck not?‚Äù Is what I was thinking
The Jazz love Favors‚Ä¶ his production this year left them no choice though. He was an upgrade over Tony Bradley but just barely
76ers legend Tony Bradley
its time to bring sixers legend tony bradley back to philly
"I think the first ask from Masai was Maxey, Thybulle, and two 1sts. That would've been in addition to Danny Green and whoever else, mostly likely Tony Bradley, was needed for salary matching."
Where's the goat Tony Bradley
AKME need this guy. He‚Äôs one of the third stringer who bullied Wendell that  lead Wendell to play off the bench and eventually got traded.   Him then Tony Bradley the next game. Then woot Wendell was coming off the bench ü§£
"yeah being an elite defensive player hasn‚Äôt helped his team get out of the second round. It‚Äôs overrated. NBA games are won by scoring points, not occasional  defense. Ben is a Defensive specialists like Tony Allen or Avery Bradley and shouldn‚Äôt be a max contract.   That‚Äôs how trash Ben Simmons is as an overall player. John wall looks like a better option."
"""I'll take Tony Bradley, the third year F/C on the OKC Thunder for $200, Alex.""  Why did I choose him? I was thumbing through all the rosters trying to see if I could find someone I barely heard about that has been in the league at least three years and averages at least seven in points, rebounds or assists. It took a lot longer than I thought it would.  What his game like?"

"Yeah no idea why people are always picking on Kuzma. He‚Äôs done excellently for himself considering where he was drafted.  Look at a selection of players drafted above him in 2018 and where they are now: - Tony Bradley : on a 1yr deal with the Bulls - Caleb Swanigan : out of the league in 2020 - An≈æejs Paseƒç≈Üiks : waived by Wizards in early 2021 - Tyler Lydon : waived by Kings in 2019 - Terrance Ferguson : waived by Knicks in early 2021 - Harry Giles : making $1.8m with Clippers, contract expires in 2022. - Justin Patton : waived by Rockets in early 2021, now playing in Israel - DJ Wilson : currently a UFA as of Aug 2021 - TJ Leaf : currently a UFA as of Aug 2021  Important to keep these things in context.  Kyle Kuzma is not a bust. He is a success."
"That was my point. Are you agreeing with me there ?  And it culminated in him averaging an inefficient 14/11. Which is fine but far from standout. Not even liking at FG, TS isn‚Äôt great either. Why does age matter?  I listed several teenagers that dominated in summer league. Noah Vonleh was one. Malik Monk had just turned 20. DSJ. Tony Bradley absolutely dominated and he was 19 or 20. Simons was 19 or 20.   Ante zizic couldn‚Äôt score? He averaged 20... how was bam good in summer league ? He had awful efficiency and his defence wasn‚Äôt a fraction of what it is now. And I still listed a wide variety of players that played like shit in summer league and ended up becoming elite players.  I‚Äôm tired of you dancing around my point. The FACT, is summer league is a tiny sample of 4-7 games (4 in Sengun‚Äôs case) against rookies and players who are trying to get fringe rotational contracts, aka not nba level talent. It means literally nothing. It‚Äôs irrelevent. Historically we‚Äôve seen countless players dominate summer league and do nothing in the league or struggle and become stars. It doesn‚Äôt matter. It means nothing. No GM‚Äôs put any stock into it. Nobody cares."
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Championship - speak it into existence! More likely a first round exit but I can‚Äôt stand the people saying we gave up our future to be perennial first round exits. We kept Coby White, who averaged 15/4/5 on 40/35/90 shooting splits in his second year!!! We kept our prized possession: Patrick Williams, who we‚Äôre banking on to succeed just like any other team with young talent. We picked up young prospects who still have the potential to be something in this league such as Tony Bradley, Alize Johnson, Troy Brown Jr. etc...we have two first round picks this year (our own! and Portland‚Äôs lottery protected FRP). This isn‚Äôt me just drinking the Kool-Aid, we‚Äôve been rebuilding for awhile now and it wasn‚Äôt working so the new FO said fuck it, we‚Äôre going to compete and build a team around Lavine, who we believe has superstar potential, while also keeping a solid young core intact to fall back on if this iteration of the team fails."
Tony Bradley lit them up too and he‚Äôs on the team now as well
"94-95 Dana Barros might have been one of the authentically good seasons for a guy on a really bad team.  After Clarence Weatherspoon and Shawn Bradley (who was ok), things went downhill fast in terms of talent...although Willie Burton did go GOAT for a night (53 points).  Also: Tony Campbell in Minnesota. Bill Musselman-era legend. Dropped 44 on the Celtics, averaged 23 a night in 1990."
We signed Tony Bradley this offseason to be the backup 5.
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"I had to look up who TBrad is, apparently is Tony Bradley, some random C. DJJ is Derrick Jones Jr.   Why he would abbreviate on a non-bulls sub for average role players is beyond me though"
"Tony Bradley will be a decent rotational big, and Williams should continue getting more minutes. Millsap is rumored as well, which while he‚Äôs old and not a great rebounder, he should be able to help some. It‚Äôll be interesting what they do going forward no doubt."
"easier said than done...?  dont you mean easier done than said....?  No one cares about rim protectors in the NBA anymore lmfaooo, this isnt 1992.  Also, Chicago has Tony Bradley"
Tony Bradley is all you need
OKC would probably trade Mike Muscala or Tony Bradley for a few 2nd rounders the nets have and waive him
"Coby white, Lauri, Caruso, Troy brown jr, Tony Bradley is no bench?"
Why don‚Äôt you run Tony Bradley more i remember he was a solid player last year
Patrick Williams doing his best Avery Bradley/Tony Snell impression again...
We seriously signed Tony Snell this off season after Dame gave the front office an ultimatum to improve the roster. Looks like we should have made a run at picking up Avery Bradley off waivers.
"Troy brown jr, Alize johnson, and tony bradley all seem decent. The thing is though they run small lineups most of the time and it still seems to work out so far even against the cavs"
That's interesting that Alize was getting all the backup center minutes. Is Tony Bradley hurt or just out of the rotation?
Honestly the only 2 realistic guys I'd rather have backing up Embiid are Nerlens Noel and Tony Bradley
Right?! Lonzo/DeRozan/Vucevic/76ers legend Tony Bradley being added to White and LaVine has me legitimately excited.
"Then why are the other bigs all so much more efficient in the pnr? And it's not because they have Ben to handle the ball, he's terrible as a pnr ball handler, it's hard to screen a defender when he never has to leave the paint. Ben is behind Shake, Maxey, Tobi, and Seth Curry in volume as a pnr handler while being way less efficient, once again near the bottom of the league in efficiency. If Mike Scott, Furkan Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, and Tony Bradley can all be effective rollers with Maxey and Seth as the best PnR ball handlers on the roster, why can't Ben?"
"You need to recheck your notes, because that's not what Philly got for Bridges. [Bridges was traded for Zhaire Smith and the pick that became Tre Mann.](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1009967477114195968?t=a6T7cXqlMKRnlG2POrUyqw&amp;s=19) Smith was subsequently [traded for Tony Bradley.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1330621750661566466?t=pLzD4eq61J_tXxw4if0k6w&amp;s=19) So that's what Philly got for Bridges: Mann and Bradley."
"For a second there, Tony Bradley had me thinking Thaddeus was still on the team"
"That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong. His rim protection is average and anyone above 6‚Äô10 would body him.  Sure, not every team has Embiid but every team has a Tony Bradley type and they all had career games against him."
"Very entertaining game. Memphis was looking much more clean consistent on the offensive end than us truly. Tony Bradley was being seriously exploited defensively as well.   Shows that despite our overall great preseason showing the team indeed has weaknesses on either end, but it also drives confidence that a game as messy as this one was at times, still ended with a W."
Man‚Äôs got destroyed by our very own now Tony Bradley. I hope he can still improve though wishing him nothing but the best!
"That's true, OG is one of the best defenders in the league.  My point was that the Bulls have recruited a ton of good defenders. Even if they aren't as good as OG (and very few players in the world are) guys like Caruso, Lonzo, Troy Brown, Javonte Green, Derrick Jones, Tony Bradley, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Pat Williams - up and down the roster Chicago is filled with lengthy, athletic wing defenders who can help offset the deficiencies of LaVine and DeRozan.  Toronto went the other way by finding solid two way players."
Tony Bradley is good or at least was good
We can't afford Theis so we're putting our chips on Tony Bradley and Alize Johnson. Honestly keeping Theis would probably put us in Miami category because it shores up our shallowest position right now. Hoping Alize and Bradley are okay as rim protectors
Yes they do. Your back up center is mf Tony BradleyüíÄ. Plus you have 0 wing depth. Beating up of a shitty Cavs and an injured pelicans team really got bulls fans outta pocket.
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
"Bruh the Hawks 8 best players played 3 minutes the entire season. Trae's team was never healthy to begin with the entire year. Now Bogy is a reliable shot creator, reliable 3 point shooter, Collins is actually a post-up face up typa guy player, Capela once in a while can create his hook shots. Hunter would actually take advantage of his height in mismatches, you know what huerter did in game 7 against the 76ers. plus gallo and lou will with young guys in jalen johnson, and shariffe.  You really think our whole offense is reliant only on Trae. Also due to size, Lavine is obviously more efficient. You cannot compare a 6'6 guard to a 6'0 guard through efficiency too be honest.  and sure let's say lonzo would actually make trae earn his baskets more, collins is gonna take advantage in the post against pwill/derozan, while hunter could easily isolate derozan. yes i do think hunter's iso game is underrated as people only know him through a 23 game sample  You act like the Hawks team ain't deep, in fact they are easily deeper than the Bulls, have a better core imho. Troy Brown Jr will literally not get PT from us, Tony Bradley would probably be cut from is.  The games might get closer, but on paper (as we haven't really see the Bulls do something during the actual season) the Hawks would defeat the Bulls"
"Still missing 3 of our rotation players Patrick Williams, Coby White, and Tony Bradley."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"Tony Bradley really didn't do much at all last year when he was with us, could be a different story with a more productive offense and a far better team overall but really he scored when anyone could score, rebounded when anyone could etc."
Bulls get Bol Bol or Marvin Bagly as a Backup.  Or sign Demarcus Cousins. Also play Matt Thomas More he a real shooter. If we get a decent back up  big man we should be great. I never seen Tony Bradley play since College tho.
"To me the biggest question mark is whiteside and the team may go as he does. Backup center was our biggest problem two years ago when we had no favors and Tony bradley in; we would have beaten the Nuggs in 5 had we not bled points in the bradley minutes.   Favors was clearly not the faves of old and nowhere near worth his 9.7m last year but he was an upgrade from Tony and the bleeding was much less; some stints were great others were poor.  If whiteside is Ed Davis 2.0 or Tony bradley for the Jazz we could be in serious trouble; if he can match or exceed favors production im excited for where our team is at. Whiteside was literally unplayable and benched on the kings the worst team in the league last year, if he can return to Portland-level whiteside now that he‚Äôs on a contender then I‚Äôm happy. But he MAY just be washed"
"I love that your reasoning is Celtics &gt; Bulls because of scoring and efficiency, but LaVine is the best scorer and by far the most efficient player on either roster.   You say the Bulls will have a bad defense because they lost Thad Young. But the fact is that Chicago had the 7th best defense after the Vucevic trade, Donovan is a terrific defensive coach, and they replaced Thad with strong defensive players in Caruso, Lonzo, Stanley Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr., and Tony Bradley."
I mean if DJJ is getting playing time thats trouble for the Bulls. The Blazers were starved for perimeter defense and DJJ couldnt crack the rotation there and was getting DNP's by the end of the season. Tony Bradley is a career backup who plays like 10 mins a game and Ayo is a rookie.  I dont think the Bulls defense will be terrible but its still very middling.   Teams will definitely abuse DeMar/Lavine and Vuc in the PnR
"By staggering minutes. Yeah they‚Äôll all start but you can just bring in Caruso and Tony Bradley in early to stabilize the defense and then have Demar and Vuc feast against other bench units. This team has a lot versatility and ways it can play. Zach,Demar and Vuc aren‚Äôt going to play the whole game together."
"LaVine and Vuc aren't great defenders, but neither of them are bad at defense. DeMar is obviously not a good defender but let's not fail to mention that we have Lonzo Ball and Patrick Williams in the starting lineup and off the bench we have Caruso, Tony Bradley, Troy Brown Jr., DJJ, Stanley Johnson, etc. the entire bench was pretty much molded with athleticism and defense being the two highest priorities.   12th in the league defensively last year, 8th in the league after trading for Vuc, and despite losing thad i don't think that's enough for us to even be in the bottom half defensively this year and looking at our roster we clearly have guys who are capable of playing good defense."
"The bench is loaded with defenders like Caruso, Djj, and tony Bradley not to mention Patrick Williams being the reincarnation of Kawhi. Billy Donovan just has to make proper rotations to balance the offensive and defensive players. Not to mention we were 12th in defensive rating last year with even worse defenders so Billy does a really good job at making defensive schemes anyways. I think the main defensive hole in the starting 5 is DeRozan but I think he‚Äôs going to start games but play most of his minutes with the bench squad to provide more offense anyways"
"Last year with Dwight, Doc ended up keeping him coming off the bench when Embiid was out and starting Tony Bradley. I wouldn't be surprised if he did something similar again with Drummond."
"I say this as a Bulls fan:  The Bulls are completely and utterly unproven which is the biggest reason nobody is talking about them. They have a bunch of high caliber players who have not had playoff success. Both Vooch and Zach are stars on non-playoff teams and its been awhile since Derozan has done much in the playoffs.   The reality is that we haven't seen a roster construction like this before and it is really hard to know what to expect. IMO they will surprise a lot of people and be in the 4-5 seed region.   I agree with you that on paper this team seems really really good for flying this low under the radar. The starting 5 is extremely solid from 1-5 with a great mix of veteran and young players. They have to have one of the most athletic rosters in the whole league, and the bench has some really nice pieces in Coby White and Caruso.   The only way I see this team playing poorly is if Vucevic gets hurt. The center depth is not good and having to depend on Tony Bradley is a recipe for disaster. The guard and wing depth is really good though. I also think that we will se Patrick Williams playing a decent amount of small ball center. He is really strong and has great rim protection instincts."
Maybe because their bench isn‚Äôt good and his backup has been garbage? Oh yeah the offense is better when Tony Bradley or Whiteside or a washed Favors isn‚Äôt on the floor
Javonte green Tony Bradley Ayo dosunmu Derrick jones jr Coby white   Checkmate
"Tony ""Scissor hands"" Bradley. man cant catch a pass to save his life"
"Yea we‚Äôre really in need of some size off the bench, Tony Bradley and Alize just haven‚Äôt been it so far. The DJJ small ball has been a pleasant surprise but it‚Äôs not sustainable rotation piece of every game"
"Most of the roster is new for the Bulls, so it's tough to get an answer. Vuc got some hate for his slow start but when he was out with COVID and had to start Tony Bradley... All the Vuc love came back.  I'd say the most polarising is Coby White, included in trade talks all the time, but there's probably no actual good answer yet with the Bulls."
when javonte green was recently out the bulls were starting tony bradley for a couple games and it was so hard to watch
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"We've been playing 6'5 Derrick Jones Jr and 6'3 javonte green at center and it's been working for the most part. They've been better than Tony Bradley on everyone who's not a bruiser, and then we have vooch when he comes back for that"

And Pacers whooped our ass with size on a night where we didn't have Vuch was a big deal. Pacers threw the zone at us and we couldn't punish them because Tony Bradley just isn't worth guarding
"that could have possibly been the most embarrassing way to reply.  a) are you saying you think the all-star center is going to make the bulls worse than with backup rim-runner tony bradley? okay.  b) demar derozan is currently shooting the worst he has from the field since 2018. he‚Äôs having a sustainable ‚Äúcareer year‚Äù  because maybe, just maybe, playing with good players makes the game easier.  c) one of the points in my prediction was literally AKME would make big additions in the off-season to try and win."
"Vuc creates infinite more spacing than Tony Bradley or any other big we have. He had a slow start to the season but was picking it up right before he got covid. If he had a mean reversion back to his normal, all-star self then the Bulls are WAY better (at least offensively) with him on the court."
Tony Bradley actually playing like a 7fter tonight wow
"Hassan Whiteside finishes with double-doubles off the bench for the vet minimum.  The backup C the Jazz have needed. Tony Bradley, Ed Davis, and D Favs (love him though) weren‚Äôt cutting it."
Professional Tall Dude Tony Bradley!
List off the guys in the league worse than Tony Bradley
Just tony bradley tings
"Been watching the Bulls lately. It‚Äôs crazy how bad Tony Bradley is, he might be the worst player in the NBA"
Nobody's comparing Vuc to Jokic but our tallest player after Tony Bradley is 6'6. We literally have no paint presence or a rebounder.  Getting this W was huge for us
Tony Bradley vs Jeff Green. A big man duel for the ages
Def seems like a better option than Tony Bradley atm
In lieu of Tony Bradley
Not having Vuc was problem. DJJ got into foul trouble and we're asking too much from Tony Bradley.   Nurkic and Nance jr really hurt us inside with their size. Will take this loss happily as it's our 3rd game in 4 days on this gruelling roadtrip.
"bro he's sick lol  Yes tony bradley sucks, it's a legit weakness"
Tony Bradley is CHARMIN. So fucking soft
tony bradley is dumpster juice
can u guys hear Billy Donovan yelling at Tony bradley lmao
I just realized Tony Bradley looks like a taller Nick Young
Tony Bradley is so bad
Derrick Jones Jr has been a better backup center than Tony Bradley
It wasn't in the 3rd quarter. Most of the double teams were all in the 1st half. AD only got 2 pick n roll buckets and few freethrows. Dude was basically a non-factor on offence. In the 3rd quarter AD starting going with his mid-range against Tony Bradley and we didn't double cause he was taking 16-18 ft jump shots
There's no reason why AD shouldn't have been bodying Tony Bradley all night but he really hates playing the 5 huh. He also got ejected lol

Tony Bradley dropping a 0/10
ive had enough of the Tony Bradley experience
Tony Bradley is so timid man
Tony bradley... jesus christ. lets go small and get Javonte in the game
"Yea I mean our biggest hole all season will be at the pf spot, and with Vuc down, the only legit big we have is Tony Bradley. If teams can go big, they should against the bulls."
Tony Bradley starting LFG
"I actually like a lot of your depth pieces. Alize, Green, and Ayo have good potential to be high level role players. Patrick Williams being out didn't help. Tony Bradley struggled today but I still think he's a good backup C, just not a starter when Vuc is out."
Not having vuc is gonna be tough on Demar and Zach.  Teams are gonna double the ball handler during the PnR as Tony Bradley/Alize are not gonna shoot the 3.   Demar/Zach also can't drive aggressively as the spacing is now fucked. Demar was getting tripled when he was trying to find space for his midrange.  I hope we can atleast go 2-3 on this roadtrip. Go back home and hopefully Vuc and coby are back by the too
Tony Bradley just had an awful 1 minute stretch

"Ayo is the man, his energy in the 2nd half turned the game around. Shout out Tony Bradley too, bench mob doing work."
I miss the days of arguing Tony Allen vs Avery Bradley as best perimeter defender on operation sports
Tony Bradley kinda look like he would carry his young in his mouth for their first few months.
"Later in the game, Tony Bradley actually does foul Harden and Harden acts like he just hit the fuckin' game-winning shot.  Such a dickhead."
"Gonna sound corny but our biggest strength right now is team chemistry. I didn't foresee that all these new guys were gonna adapt to each other and LaVine so quickly.  Our biggest weakness is obviously depth at 4 and forward defense. With Patrick Williams gone, we can only make do with Javonte Green and DJJ for so long. Also we probably need a more experienced backup 5, Tony Bradley is fine and I like his game actually. But someone gotta be able to challenge and/or complement Vucevic."
"Plus minus also depends on the line up on the floor with Lavine‚Ä¶  Having a bunch of meh players like Troy Brown Jr, DJJ and Tony Bradley with Lavine means offense is trash and Lavine has to carry which could lead to minus number"
Build around Tony Bradley.
Tony Bradley is a god so it‚Äôs actually pretty easy choice
Tony Bradley is proper good.
If Vuc keeps playing like this I would rather have Tony Bradley start

Really wanted Tony Bradley in instead of Vooch...
I miss Tony Bradley
Love Tony Bradley he was great for us last year.
I really like both these teams. Didn‚Äôt realize the Bulls picked up 76ers great Tony Bradley
I think we will be better because a bunch of those games billy didn‚Äôt know he could play Tony Bradley and DJJ. Now they‚Äôre firmly in the rotation
"yeah, that's why I don't get people who talk about trading Coby. the whole second unit is built around what he offers. Caruso, great defender, decent playmaker that let's coby play offball which is where he's strong. DJJ and Troy Brown Jr, both have great defense, not volume scorers. Tony Bradley, defensive minded. like you go through the bench and it just needs an offball volume scorer, oh wait that's Coby White!!"
"I was impressed with Billy‚Äôs adjustments, Tony Bradley/DJJ, Ayo‚Äôs play, and Zach taking over to spark the comeback with Demar solidifying it.  Only having 3 misses in a quarter and not giving up any defensive rebounds is insane.  They were losing the rebounding battle badly and that stretch allowed them to actually win it.  There‚Äôs a lot of good.   Obviously there is bad that got us there.   I think it was the missed shots, and Zach (the whole team in general really) get flustered when refs don‚Äôt call it their way.   I can honestly say most times we are down are runs from blown calls and it just snowballs when they get frustrated"
I don‚Äôt know man. Seeing Tony Bradley these last 2 games it looks like he‚Äôs better than vuc in some stretches (in terms of rim protection and rebounding)
yo dont forget tony bradley. no one got anything by the big man. he was insane guarding the rim
He was bad on D tho. Tony Bradley came up big
"Bit of column A, a bit of column B but basically the Celtics stopped hitting their 3s after hitting 57% the 1st 3 quarters. They then got dominated by points in the paint and Tony Bradley, Caruso and DJJ put guys on lockdown"
"Based on the Utah game, those somebodies are Tony Bradley and Derrick Jones Jr.  Coby White still hasn‚Äôt played a game yet either."
u mean Tony Bradley?

Tony Bradley needs to play more
"Bulls only have 5 offensive rebounds, 3 of them came from Tony Bradley who played 6 mins  Billy should really try to incorporate him into the 2nd unit."
The final shot should‚Äôve been given to Tony ‚Äúgoat‚Äù Bradley smh
Tony Bradley!
Bulls should try integrating Tony Bradley in the 2nd unit so they don't get killed on the board.  Bradley was decent with Sixers and OKC last year
