1. Anthony Edwards  2. James Wiseman  3. Lamelo Ball  4. Patrick Williams  5. Isaac Okoro  We're 20 games into these guys' career and none of them have looked like they don't belong. Wait at least a year before you try to bring up this discussion.

Isaac Okoro looks likes he been in the league for 9 years
"isaac okoro! although his advanced stats are horrible, his disruption of passing lanes and lock down defense passes the eye test 100% and coaches are noticing it. man just locked down james harden and kevin durant several times in 2 games"
Isaac Okoro is really solid
"Garland is out so just Sexton coming back, sad.  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (6-7) | [](/BKN)Nets (9-6) ---|--- C.

"Welcome to Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to complete a clean sweep of the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers.   The starting five for the Cavaliers tonight is Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. Look for big contributions from 6th man Larry Nance Jr off the bench."
"Pat is the better defender both based on eye test and defensive advanced stats. Okoro is 295th out of 313 players in Defensive RAPTOR with a score of -4.4. This is one of the worst, if not the worst, score in rookie class. Pat was tasked with guarding Giannis, Kawhi, Lebron, and Doncic, and has a score of -0.5, which is only below Wiseman for rookie lottery picks.   I've only watched one Cavs game and I like Okoro, but his help defense is pretty bad, although he seems to be alright on-ball. Either way, Okoro is young and I think he will continue to improve and blossom into an elite two-way combo guard/wing eventually.   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Isaac%20Okoro&amp;season=2021"
 Isaac Okoro. 14.6/36.6
I'd argue you could also apply this to Isaac Okoro

Disgraceful to forget Isaac Okoro
What? No it absolutely wouldn’t. Look at this years draft. You trying to say that a player like Isaac okoro or Patrick williams would make this a great trade???
"3rd  Edit: actually their 4th. The Cavs got JA for basically nothing, pairing him with Isaac Okoro"
"Really hyped on Devin Vassell and Haliburton as they were my guys throughout the long draft process. Isaac Okoro looks like he’ll be a contributor for a long time, and soon"

"Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. Both teams played with good energy and made plays, both offensively and defensively.   Memphis had 9 players with more than one assist, 6 of them with 3+. Larry Nance shot perfect from the field. Isaac Okoro showed some flashes."
Isaac Okoro
Guys I don't want to alarm you but I think Isaac Okoro might be the greatest Cavaliers player off all time
Isaac “LeBron James” Okoro gets me hot and bothered
Isaac Okoro.

Don’t know about that.  We only have 3 shooters and one of them was out.  Also Isaac takes the defense to another level.  Granted I think not having Love and Garland is a massive loss but Okoro is still a rookie who can’t shoot who is like bait for our defense because we do a great job on non shooters.

"First of all, Wiseman didn’t get a decreased role as he is playing the same amount of minutes as he always had. You keep bringing up he’s getting benched but in reality his role is still the same bc he still is playing more min than Looney who is the starting center. 2nd, his numbers are as good as they appear and that’s why it’s an anomaly to me that he’s playing so few minutes. I understand that in bad games, he should play little min but why is he playing so few min in good games as well? My main point is that Wiseman playing so few min is not his fault. You act like it’s his fault he’s not playing so few min when I disagree heavily. I think he’s performing better than rookies that are averaging more minutes than him like payton pritchard, Saddiq Bey, Cole Anthony, killian hayes, Isaac okoro, etc. I really think that the only rookies performing better than him that are averaging more minutes are Lamelo and Haliburton. I don’t see how Wiseman is playing so bad to the point where he deserves less minutes than those other guys."

Isaac Okoro if we’re going realllly under the radar.    His defense is really good for a rookie.  And his three point shooting when open is solid.   Seems like he can easily be a very good 3&amp;D guy that turns into all start if he develops even an average offensive game

"How do you know they will have at least 2 top 3-5 picks? Can you tell me if I’m going to win the lottery? Seems like you’re assuming there’s 100% that the Nets will have a terrible record, and the pick will hit 1-5 with the new lottery odds.   And probably the most laughable thing you assume is a 50% chance that a single top 5 pick will be better than Ben Simmons? That would essentially mean that you think Simmons is the average top 5 pick, which is just hilarious. The top 5 picks from the last 2 drafts were Zion, Jah Morant, RJ Barrett, DeAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Isaac Okoro. The only guys that have even shown the potential to be better than Simmons are Zion, Jah, and LaMelo (3/10)"

Isaac Okoro
He has Jalen Green lol. We had Brodric Thomas running the point and Isaac Okoro being put at PG for stretches
Darius Garland  Maybe Isaac Okoro…
"basically the only players we have developed in the past few years are Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro... they're all developing well?  Okoro could be better but he's not bad.  Idk wtf you want from us.  Are you upset Dylan Windler isn't good enough???"
"So did LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, and Isaac Okoro"
Isaac Okoro pt 2
"Isaac Okoro, not Josh Okogie, whose a Timberwolf"
Amoung SFs last season Isaac Okoro was ranked 11th in real defensive plus minus while he was consistently assigned to defend the best offensive player on opposing teams. He did this while leading the NBA in rookie mins played and doesn't turn 21 until January  2022. I'd call that pretty promising.

"Other than the Cavs, none of the teams in this top 5 are really lottery dwellers. Plus the talent base in this class is pretty great compared to your average year.

"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people. Wise investment here for the NBA. It also makes me wonder whether they'll be investing in India as well, another place with a huge population and the potential to produce NBA players and grow the NBA's international audience"
"Isaac Okoro ran away with the scoring title in our shitty fantasy league (points for minutes, missed shots, turnovers, lose points if you do anything good)"
"I understand why Isaac Okoro isn't on anybody's list, but I feel he should be on the second team.  The Cavs were bad all year so no one watched him and he only started finding an offensive rhythm late in the year so his averages aren't great.  But he led all rookies in minutes per game, consistently guarded the other team's best player from the start, and stepped up to shoulder more of the offensive load late in the season when Cavs injuries piled up."

Their rotation is essentially 3 point guards 4 centers and Isaac Okoro.
"Nah, he's 38th   for reference  Isaac Okoro: 36th in 2019  Tyler Herro: 37th in 2018  Nickeil Alexander-Walker: 40th in 2017  -----------------  Basically if he develops physically a little bit, he's a fine NBA prospect. He's only about 6'2"" right now though."
"He’s getting better on offense but that’s what was expected of him and he’s delivered in the defense. Also, look at those drafted after him. Is there really that many people we’d take over him if given the chance to redraft? Saddiq Bey? Isaiah Stewart? Tyrese Maxey? That’s about it, and they were all drafted way after our pick.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/isaac-okoro-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-offense-defense-analysis/"
"Your team is so bad at drafting, I like isaac Okoro though I’m not sold on garland or sexton, or cedi"
"Isaac Okoro becomes the fourth best player from the 2020 draft behind Melo, Ant and Tyrese."
"&gt;  finishing between Josh Jackson and Isaac Okoro.  and also tied with Domantas Sabonis. I think this is a bit disingenuous, bad players can shoot free throws well, good players can shoot them poorly."
"It's not full-blown bad, but it is below league average (77.8% in 20/21 and no lower than 76.6% the past five seasons). And he dropped to 72.8% while shooting more FTs last season, which isn't a good look.  It's fair to ask a star guard to improve their below average FT shooting after a season in which they were the NBA's 89th best FT shooter, finishing between Josh Jackson and Isaac Okoro."
Isaac Okoro vs the universe
So if hes already the best player then why would you expect him to make that big of a jump ?   It'll be someone who sucked his rookie year most likely like Isaac okoro
"Anthony Edwards, Isaiah Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, Tyrese Maxey, Xavier Tillman, Isaac Okoro  I’m not sure if what to expect from Poku this season, but I’m really rooting for him and hoping he makes a jump this season"
isaac okoro
"&gt; closer to 6'5 than 6'8  &gt; He is 6’6 without shoes  TBF 6'6"" *is* closer to 6'5"" than 6'8"". I feel you, though - Isaac Okoro is 6'5"" and that makes people say he can't play the 3 even though he played there all last season and defended extremely well. It's not like an inch or two makes that much fucking difference."
isaac okoro is pretty good:)
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
"Cavs:  *2016: Kay Felder - Marcus Paige  We didn’t select Felder, but the Hawks traded him to us on draft night.  2017: No draft selections  2018: Collin Sexton - Kevin Knox  2019: Darius Garland - Jarrett Culver   2020: Isaac Okoro - Onyeka Okongwu  Yeah I’ll stick with what we drafted."
"Isaac Okoro has been getting quite a bit late, a lot of guys expect a polished 20 year old product and want to ship him out for a SG with a sole focus on scoring the ball. I appreciate his defense though he fits our teams mentality at the moment quite well."

Isaac Okoro. His offense is stuck in high school
"Isaac Okoro is one of the best iso defenders in the league. He is the guy you go to when faced up against players like Harden or Beal. He is another Cleveland guy who should be considered for DPOY, but won't be because his offense is a major work in progress and negates all of his hard work on the defensive side."
Neither should Isaac Okoro for the Cavs but here we are lmao  Detroit vs Steelers but NBA edition

Need Sexton's scoring. Until Isaac becomes even a respectable jump shooter he's going to create a ton of spacing problems with Garland.  Pistons just flat out ignored Okoro and it was by far their most successful defensive strategy.
"I don’t see much mention of this in the thread, but Isaac Okoro is an absolute menace on defense. Gave Brad fits all night long. Obviously Mobley is a special player but the Cavs defense really impressed me tonight, especially Okoro. GG Cavs"
"My pre-draft comparison for him was Isaac Okoro and I was called insane for that. After watching a ton of Suggs over the offseason on the chance that he was our pick, and watching Okoro play the most minutes of any rookie, their game just looked so similar. They’re the same size, both good defenders, both have a high level of intensity. They both need to develop offensively."
"LeBron isn't coming back unless he can force the Lakers to trade him for Kevin Love.  We don't have the cap space to sign him.  He could always play a vet min season with us but I feel like that championship would always have a massive shameful asterisk next to it.  That's as blatantly cheating as you can get in the NBA.  Furthermore, do we want LeGM back?  Do we want him to force us to trade Isaac Okoro for Carmelo Anthony?  This team is built to be good for the next decade, we shouldn't be blowing that up just to get a championship run in now.  But you know LeBron doesn't care how the team's gonna look when he's 45.  I think he'll sign on a ten day and retire a Cav to end his career, and that'll be the last we see of him."
"The tough part of this is you kind of have to ignore what players do their first two years.  Like if you said Isaac Okoro looked like a bust this year it’s not really fair, you’re not really a true bust until year 3 IMO.  There’s an understanding it takes some time to pull it together.  And if you’re a bust in year 3 I doubt many people give you an opportunity."
Isaac Okoro looks like a solid role player too. Cole Anthony and R.J. Hampton have both shined in various moments on the Magic as well. It's a very well rounded draft overall.

"Give Okoro an offseason and summer league and a regular season before judging him.    Curry is having a very hot stretch and the only one who gave him fits behind the arc was... Isaac Okoro.  Refs screwed up vs the wizards cause when he was on the floor, he gave westbrook fits, though honestly, he should've been guarding beal instead of Cedi.     Okoro needs time to improve his 3pt shooting, he's already looking better at the free throw line.  He can also hit step back 3s."

"That makes sense to me apart from the Nurk comparison imo. Allen is a better rim protector/finisher and more of a lob threat than Nurk is, but Nurk is a much better passer and it’s not close. Also, hopefully Okoro can blossom into that kind of defensive wing that they need. He’s a little under sized at SF but he’s shown some promise and if he can knock down open 3s at a higher rate things may start to click. Kevin Love has to go though, they need a younger PF that can move his feet and hit 3s, maybe through the draft. Like a JJJ or Jonathan Isaac would be sick for this team"
"I see his VORP as 0.7 which actually ranks him in the top 113 out of 524 total players.  Anthony Edwards ranks 519 out of 524 which is interesting. The only players below him are Sekou Doumbouya, Isaac Okoro, Dwayne Bacon, Rodney Hood, and Theo Maledon."
"Lets also have a clip on the front page titled ""Rookie Isaac Okoro clamps the hell out of Stephen Curry"""
"Top 10 rookies this season in no particular order: Edwards, Ball, Haliburton, Stewart, Tate, Patrick Williams, Saddiq Bey, Immanuel Quickley, Isaac Okoro, and Cole Anthony. I'd also potentially put Okeke, Campazzo, Wiseman, Bane, and Maledon above Flynn for their body of work so far.  Flynn's been great for a couple weeks, if he keeps it up until the end of the season maybe he cracks the All Rookie team ahead of someone like Quickley who doesn't have as much opportunity down the stretch."

"I know /s but I’d be so pissed if they trade Sexton for another guard lol. They have guards and bigs for days. Right now the wings are Cedi Osman, Isaac Okoro (I think he fits better as a guard, personally) and now Denzel Valentine. If they trade him, it needs to be for a wing."
"Again, he was drafted for his Defense which was pretty solid against All NBA players last year, even as he was a 19 - 20 yr old kid. HE wasnt drafted for his 3 ball. But he did show flashes of nasty attacking the paint towards the end of last year that will help elevate his 2 way game.   https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/05/isaac-okoro-shows-two-way-potential-as-cleveland-cavaliers-take-phoenix-suns-into-overtime-before-losing-134-118.html"
I got banned for doing that.  Better watch out.  Give Isaac Okoro Kevin Loves spot up shooting and he becomes a superstar.
"&gt;But what if the Sixers got Sexton, Isaac Okoro and a bunch of future first-round picks"
Isaac Okoro.  Hes gonna be a god damn monster
"I mean, we've got Isaac Okoro, the glass-boned corpse of Dylan Windler, and a lightly used Cedi Osman. That's technically a wing rotation, by the broadest of possible technicalities."
"An outstanding job, that's what!  What the heck are you on about?  3 bigs - Mobley JAllen and Markannen - for 2 positions.  2 of them can shoot, and 2 of them can defend.  The one who can do both needs some development time.  Sprinkle a little DWade in there.  Darius Garland will be the first guy from this group to be an allstar.  No, it wont be Sexton.  Long term Sexton might be the starting shooting guard, or (more likely) the 6th man.  Dylan Windler and Isaac Okoro are going to surprise the hell out of people.  Pay attention.  This team is on track to be scary as hell before long!"
1. Isaac Okoro will be an All-Star in the future. 2. Carmelo Anthony will have a buzzer beater in a Finals game before he retires.

It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
"Kyra will be fine man, I’m an auburn alum I’ve seen him play a lot he’s a child. He was a freshman in college at 17. He’s wise beyond his years and his probably the fastest player in the league. His tape especially high school is incredible, he gave Isaac Okoro trouble and he was the best defender in the SEC last year. Don’t give up hope."
"I iant saying Okoro is the next Kawhi, but as a 19 year old kid he guarded literally every single All-Star night in and night out and held most of them to well below average scoring and play.    https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/04/isaac-okoro-undaunted-after-defending-gauntlet-of-nba-stars-including-stephen-curry.html   “But Isaac makes you beat him. He doesn’t give you angles, he doesn’t go for steals and get out of position. He makes you have to score over the top of him, and I thought he did a great job of that in the first half for sure.”  Harden’s attempts to get past or around the stout Okoro were to no avail, so much that he didn’t even take a shot until a minute and 25 seconds into the second quarter.   “It was impressive from the young fella,” said Taurean Prince, who scored a season-high 17 points in his Cavs debut. “Usually you see guys kinda get happy feet guarding those caliber of players, but he was staying solid and sticking to his principles. Definitely stuck to the game plan. He definitely looked well-prepared and focused out there, and that’s truly all you can ask (for) out of the young guy.”  Of course, Harden is not going to be held down for very long. He found some success in the second-half and overtime periods, and ended up dropping 21 points (along with recording his third consecutive triple-double for the Nets). With that said, when you look at the shots he made, he didn't actually score on Okoro until the 3:28 mark in the fourth quarter.  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-isaac-okoro-swarms-james-harden-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-defense  Pre All-Star break, a span of time consisting of 31 games, Okoro averaged a mere 8.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Not exactly encouraging numbers for a top five pick averaging 33.2 minutes a game up to that point.  Post All-Star break, the rook has scored at a rate of 10.6 points per game, adding 3.4 rebounds and is still dishing out just 1.9 assists. What’s more? Okoro is having a great month of May as through seven games, he is posting about 16.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists.  “Ice,” as he is often referred to, showcased exactly what he is capable of in a May 4 matchup against the Phoenix Suns (currently the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference) in which he exploded for a career-high 32 points while defending two of the game’s best in Chris Paul and Devin Booker.  He did a bit of everything offensively as he hit 10-of-16 of his field goal attempts and shot three-of-four from three-point range while also going nine-of-nine from the free throw line.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/05/14/cleveland-cavaliers-should-isaac-okoro-make-one-all-rookie-teams/"
If you draft based on Isaac Okoro you are drafting from the wrong frame of mind to begin with.
"No, No, Yes as a Cavs fan if they take Green.. sign me up for a Garland, Green, Okoro, Isaac, Allen starting 5"
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"i wasn't quite as on him unfortunately, weird looking shot. the wing in the last draft I'm hype over is Isaac Okoro man CLE fans know, he could be a superstar in 2-3 years time"
Not sure it's totally his game but Isaac Okoro on the Cavs has been making up for his lackluster shot by becoming a great cutter. Thybulle should look into other options than 3s for getting better.
Okoro is a defense first wing who started to put it together on offense [towards the end of the season](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4432822/isaac-okoro).
"Ain't no way Isaac Okoro, Desmond Bane, Immanuel Quickley are better than Cole Anthony."
Can anyone explain isaac okoro to me? His stat line is not at all impressive. Is this guy some kind of defensive sevant? Was he like boarder line all D or what?
