crazy how oubre played so bad in the fourth they had kent bazemore out there
Kent Bazemore!
How dare you! Kent bazemore is a SAINT
Bro I watched Trae play with Alex Len and Kent Bazemore.
"Stotts didn't sign Mario Herzonia, Kent Bazemore, and Anthony Tolliver to man the forward positions last year  Stotts didn't refuse to sign a backup PG leading to Rodney Hood being the second best ball handler and distributer with CJ out  Stotts didn't get Nurk and CJ and Derrik Jones Jr hurt this year  Stotts can't help that Roco has lost his shot so far despite getting his shots classified as open over 80% of the time   Stotts didn't get Rodney Hood an Achilles injury last year  Neil should get way more heat than he does"
Kent Bazemore for 6th of the year!!!
"Man, I hate kent bazemore.  I hate him the way I used to hate raja bell."
Kent Bazemore was playing 4D chess a decade ago.
"Those are pretty tough ones, but I’ll try: Kostas Antetokounmpo, Nick Claxton, Kent Bazemore, Ivica Zubac, Bryn Forbes, Maxi Kleber, Matisse Thybulle, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Caleb Martin, aaaaaaand Damian Lillard?"
Imagine letting Curry get a layup cause you didn't wanna risk Kent Bazemore getting a shot off lmao
Is Kent Bazemore a joke to you?
Kent bazemore not mentioned?   Everybody seems to love that guy
"kent ""carmelo anthony"" bazemore"
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
Yes just last game.. pissed me off so much lol what stats does Kent Bazemore need to be worrying about
I saw Kent Bazemore do this. KENT BAZEMORE smh
Garrett Temple  And as a Dubs fan I was surprised when we signed Kent Bazemore. I thought he retired for some reason
Kent bazemore smoked his cigar and swung the bat a few times before clowning paul and kawhi
Don't forget Kent Bazemore! His energy was huge for them.
Kent Bazemore or Woodstock 1969 Joe Cocker?
Kent Bazemore looks like a cat
"Better,  Are you equally upset with the other players who had “education reform” on their jerseys?  Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum, Marcus Morris, Solomon Hill,  Kent Bazemore, Demar Derozan, Ed Davis, Georges Niang"
"IDK if you watch basketball in 2021, but Kelly Oubre has been very limited (might be starting to improve, but until tonight he was on the all-time historical worst shooting start ever), James Wiseman had played 3 basketball games since college, and the Warriors are giving real minutes to Kent Bazemore, Brad Wanamaker and Mychal Mulder."
"Yeah it was Kent Bazemore, he has some crazy celebrations!"
Anyone can put up these numbers with Kent Bazemore and Brad Wanamaker backing them up
"I say that and then when I actually have to say who they are it gets more difficult.   Favorite Warriors of all time definitely gets the top 3 nod. Players of all time, probably not.  Favorite Warriors 1. Steph 2. Klay 3. Draymond (how could you not have those three as the top?) 4. Rick Barry. (But I never saw him play, I just love the underhand free throw) 5. Baron Davis 6. Chris Mullin 7. Tim Hardaway 8. Mitch Richmond. (I did get to see them in person when I was a kid) 9. Manute Bol. (Spelling?) 10. Kent Bazemore (I got to meet him after a Santa Cruz Warriors game and he was super nice and actually talked, so glad he’s on the team again)"
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
Kent Bazemore? More like Kent ‘Should Play More’ amirite?
"Harden and Lebron are the only ones I think you can definitevely say are better at dragging a team to the playoffs.    Our most common starting lineup last year was Dame, CJ, Carmelo Anthony, Hassan Whiteside, and either Trevor Ariza or Kent Bazemore and we had the 3rd best offense in the league"
"Every time someone mentions X player is playing pretty good this season, 9 times out of 10 dude is averaging 40% from 3.   Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nicholas Batum, and even Jeff Green are all averaging above 40%.  Frank Kraminsky is averaging 42%.  Even Kent Bazemore.  Come on."
Left corners. He’s alright on right corners. I wonder if Kent Bazemore stole Steph’s shooting ability there (he’s averaging 60% on that spot)
"Ugh game 1, the spurs couldn't do anything about Steph. We were so close to Kent Bazemore having the game winning shot but Manu hit one to win it seconds later. Could have gone back to Oracle up 2-0."
"If you look closely, Randle got fouled by Kent Bazemore as he was going to Oubre and made him lose the handle on the ball a bit."
"So he runs past Jimmy, possibly giving up a wide open layup if not for Jimmy trying to draw the foul and ending up missing badly... and that's called ""an incredible play defensively""?  That's like running to the side of a wide-open 3 point shooter, hands down, and the shooter (say Kent Bazemore) spreads his legs trying to draw the foul and misses badly.  This is just a bad play by Jimmy."
"Yes but unfortunately that's by design of our defense  Primary guys of the offense like Beal RJ and Steph will have the worst shooting nights of their careers but guys like Marcus Morris, Nemanja Bjelica, Kent Bazemore and others all scored 24+ against us cause we can't guard a 3 to save our lives"
Unleash Kent Bazemore. Let him carry those bums
You think Kent Bazemore has another carryjob in him?
Kent Bazemore is carrying that scrub Steph.
Kent Bazemore last night
"I’m just saying the team, franchise, and coach are all great BECAUSE of Curry. Before that the Warriors had been pathetic for decades, the core of the roster was all acquired through draft picks, and Kerr had never had a head coaching job before. We’re even seeing this year how Curry makes literal D league players look serviceable. He’s winning games with Kelly Oubre, Wiggins, and Kent Bazemore plus a D league roster lol."
"According to who? Because I watched the whole interview of why he wanted to return and he didn’t mention what you claimed..   ""When we talk about things coming back full circle -- coming off a really big contract in Atlanta, to sign for the minimum, it made me think, 'It's not about the money,' "" Bazemore said during a Wednesday morning conference call. ""You can't buy happiness.   ""Being back here, I'm the happiest I've been in a very long time. You just can't beat that.""   ""Free agency was ... somewhat stressful,"" he said. ""Finishing the year in Sacramento -- I was really looking forward to going back actually. I really felt like I could take a really big leadership role there, rebuild the culture.   ""Things didn't work out. They decided to go a different route.""   ""When Golden State came into the picture, I knew it would complicate things,"" he said. ""The money wasn't any big differences anywhere. You look at what makes sense, quality of life. It's just not about me anymore. I have a family now -- two great kids, an amazing wife. You gotta think about everything.   ""Coming back here -- any time I would think about it, I would daydream about it. Any time I mentioned Golden State, I would kind of get this warm feeling inside. I chose to follow that.""   [Source](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kent-bazemore-explains-why-he-signed-warriors-nba-free-agency)"
Imagine being like a Kent Bazemore tier player and you see Steph fucking curry make a shot like that and then he goes to YOU for a high five
Kent Bazemore was amazing last night.
Like a Kent Bazemore jersey
I would have never believed it if someone told me Kent Bazemore would out-dog Jimmy Butler for four straight quarters
"There were some hating clowns after the BK game (in December) that said that Curry cannot carry a team  This team is playoff bound, above Dallas, NOLA, the Rockets, the Nuggets and Memphis.  This team consists of players like Wiggins, Kelly Ouble, Paschall, Kent fucking Bazemore, Brad Wannamaker and a not-so-effective Draymond Green.   Yes, Wardell is carrying this motherfucker, big time.  Shut the fuck up."
You don't think he should be boxing out Kent Bazemore who is 6'4?
Curry goes 3-18 from 3 and 2 of the made ones go to the front page   Kent Bazemore makes hustle plays and goes 10-19 and no one cares
"They had no Draymond, no Klay, no Wiseman, and we were up by 15. Allowing OT is already a huge L. Then we got outworked by KENT BAZEMORE in OT. We didn't play hard at all lol."
This is honestly kind of disrespectful because curry played like shit this game. Kent Bazemore legit got them back in it.
Kent “MVP SZN” Bazemore
Kent Bazemore for MVP
Don't forget prime Kent Bazemore.
"""All you guys saying Kent Bazemore weak, Kent Bazemore ain't doing shit...KENT BAZEMORE WHOOP YOUR ASS!"""
Kent Bazemore
I fucking love Kent Bazemore
"Yeah lmao to be honest, if you don’t mention Kent Bazemore when talking about who helped the Warriors win, you probably didn’t watch it. Bazemore was out hustling everybody in the gym at the end of game. He was their best player tonight, bar none."
Michael “Kent Bazemore” Jordan
Kent Bazemore &lt;3333
"I thought for sure Miami had this game.  Curry having an off night, no Draymond, no centers, Miami trying to right their ship, and yet somehow the Warriors come out on top with Kent Bazemore as the top scorer for both teams.  I'll take it!"
&gt; NOTHING'S WRONG with posting their statline.   lol Whose benefit is that for?  &gt;Can thank Wiggins/Oubre for hitting their shots.  And **Kent motherfucking Bazemore**
Kent bazemore gonna recieve his first of many finals mvps
Can certainly thank my man Kent Bazemore !
"Kent ""Michael Jordan"" Bazemore."
"The role players really stepped up today, especially THE GOAT KENT BAZEMORE. Wiggins also had elite 4th quarter defense, Bazemore on ball scoring, Oubre keeping us in it in the first half, Pascahll taking advantage of smaller players, giving time for Dteph to TAKE OVER in the end"
Kendrick Nunn blew a game-winner after Kent Bazemore went supernova.
KENT 'LBJ' BAZEMORE
Kent fucking Bazemore
Kent Bazemore turned into Lebron
Kent Bazemore.
"I love Eric Paschal  I love Kent Bazemore  I love Andrew Wiggins  I love Kelly Oubre Jr.  I love Juan Toscano-Anderson  I love Steph Curry  I love that all these guys feel like they've got extra pride wearing these uniforms and playing for this team. On a night that Steph was shooting horribly the rest of the team came together and made plays, made big shots, came up with huge rebounds and came back in a big way. These guys are just getting better and everyone's really coming together as a unit and I'm excited for everything to come."
"I swear Kent Bazemore was the fastest man I've ever seen this game, wtf"
"The role players really stepped up today, especially the GOAT KENT BAZEMORE #MyGoat"
The Kent Bazemore &amp; friends show!
kent bazemore is fucking relentless
Kent Bazemore
When Curry shoots 5/20 from 3 but it doesn't matter cause KENT FUCKING BAZEMORE  I can't believe they won that game lmao
Kent Bazemore.
Jesus Christ it's Kent Bazemore. Absolutely dominating out there. I've been loving his effort recently.   Steph was ***ICE*** cold but hey he still hit three clutch as fuck threes in the 4th and OT.  Wiggins and Oubre were both very good today which is what the Warriors **need** to win consistently.   Very happy with the defensive and rebounding effort with Draymond out.
Kent Bazemore.
"Wardell Stephen ""Kent ""Bazegod"" Bazemore"" Curry"
"Idk what I love more, curry‘s last couple shots, or the fact that Kent bazemore has dominated this OT."
How the defending east champs getting cooked by kent bazemore of all people
Clark Kent Bazemore
there’s no way kent bazemore is an nba player
Love me some Clark Kent Bazemore
Cam is just Kent Bazemore but without the charm because he was a 10th overall pick and not undrafted
Kent bazemore signing a $70 mil contract feels like it happened 15 years ago
"Kent Bazemore is a professional basketball player more commonly known for his use of the ""air-guitar"" celebration during his first stint with the Golden State Warriors. The celebration, which Bazemore popularized, is now widely accepted as an actual shot celebration."
"Combined with UA using Kent Bazemore as their sleeper cell, spoiling him with gear and perks in front of Steph daily."
i would def jam out to ~The Kent Bazemore Experience~ 🎸
Welcome to the Kent Bazemore Experience
Is that Kent Bazemore or James Harden out there? /s
"Man, I remember he and Kent Bazemore had themselves a game against the Celtics in their Laker debuts back in 2014."
"Kent Bazemore was the best defensive player in college basketball. If he wanted to, he could be winning DPOY awards."
"Top 2 and he ain't 2 ;)  but nah, i mean our non steph minutes i didn't expect to be such trash. Kent Bazemore, JTA, are modest improvements to the roster, i think losing marquese hurt more than we realize."
He'd probably have Steve Kerr fired if he made him set pindown screens for Kelly Oubre and Kent Bazemore so yeah prolly
kent bazemore
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
Yeah but he was so disciplined in everything else. Like now we have KENT BAZEMORE WHO CANT SHOOT FROM ANYWHERE AND SOMEHOW GETS ISOS
"Myers filling the end of this roster with guys like Jordan Poole and Kent Bazemore just isn't gonna cut it. You can't convince me that the Warriors couldn't have gotten better players to fill this roster. Let alone Wiggins and Oubre in the starting lineup.  I don't wanna see this same bench next year, and hopefully they can trade Oubre/Wiggins/etc for some reliable scoring."
Inside agent Kent Bazemore wins one for us again! I'll miss your chance lookin ass forever :'(
Name one person on that roster that is better than this years Jazz. Pero Antic?  Kent Bazemore?  Elton Brand?  DeMarre Carroll?  Austin Daye?  Al Horford?  John Jenkins?  Kyle Korver(ILY)?  Shelvin Mack(UPSHELVINS)?  Paul Millsap(ILY2)?  Mike Muscala?  Adreian Payne?  Dennis Schroder?  Mike Scott?  Thabo Sefolosha?  Jeff Teague?
"Conaidering the roster Bud was working with, he gets far too much criticism for that series (and I'm no Bud apologist or anything).  That Hawks team had a starting 5 of Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, DeMarre Carroll, Paul Millsap, and Al Horford.  Their main bench players were Dennis Schröder, Kent Bazemore, Mike Scott, and Pero Antić.  Lots of solid players, but does it really surprise you that Lebron swept them when he pretty much single handedly brought the Warriors to 6 in the finals? (plus he had Irving in 2 of the games against the hawks vs just 1 game in the finals)"
"I mean look at the 2016 thunder roster that Westbrook took to the playoffs. The only players that are still in the league are Steven Adams, Jerami Grant, Sabonis, and Oladipo. Grant and Sabonis were both really young and no where near the players they are today, and Oladipo was awful that season.  I'm not saying Draymond, Kent Bazemore, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman are better (they might be, but I haven't watched any warriors games). But Steph doing worse than what russ already did and gets called GOAT level lmao"
When Lamar is being compared to Kent Bazemore 😂
Kent Bazemore.
"You're willfully ignoring my point.  It's not a ""convenience-for-my-argument-thing"" when you're talking about separating guys who are entering free agency all NBA and are going to make 30+ million dollars (like Kemba) and good role players who're going to sign for around mid level contracts. Kemba's contract was only going to fit in one of a couple places and even fewer places when you're talking about adding a $30 mil. salary to a team that's already competitive before you get there. Boston was able to make him fit because Kemba wasn't actually in free agency for very long, he signed and traded with Charlotte to go to Boston so Charlotte could get Rozier back.  The nature of the salary cap means max guys don't fit in as many places because they're signing for contracts with bigger numbers like JJ Reddick, Serge Ibaka, Kent Bazemore, Jeremy Lamb, etc. etc. A team with 2 young all stars like Boston has with Brown and Tatum *should* be attractive to these role players that could make a difference. These guys aren't signing with Boston though. And I have beach front property in Kansas to sell you if you think that these lower-mid guys aren't signing with Boston for any reason besides Ainge's history as a GM"
It was close until Warriors legend Kent Bazemore (?) went off

Kent bazemore got the same deal from the hawks too lmao
There's an uncomfortable amount of Alfonzo Mckinnie and Kent Bazemore in this game
i’d love to swap Bullock or Elf for Kent Bazemore.
"Went from playing with Giannis, LeBron, Jokic, Dame and Luka to Kent Bazemore and Andrew Wiggins in 4 days..that'll make anyone mad"
"Yeah.   Close to when the Lakers traded Steve Blake to the Warriors for Marshon Brooks and Kent Bazemore. Warriors went on to win 3 championships after that trade, insane."
"Yeah thanks a lot for clarifying some of my misconceptions here. And don't worry, I've been following your lead and also misspelling ""retrodictive"" as reductive. I think I've heard many people praise EPM for its evaluation of offense, but it's defensive ratings seem a bit weird and differ from many other advanced metrics it seems. For example this season Dario Saric ranks second and Kent Bazemore fourth. Also, for some reason, this metrics really seems to be a lot lower on AD than the others. I heard Tim, Cranjis McBasketball the creator of LEBRON, say that he thinks DEPM is a bit suspect as it seems to suffer from not luck-adjusting the results. For example according to luck-adjusted RAPM Dario Saric looks like one of the luckiest defenders in the league and DLEBRON adjusts for luck so Saric comes out looking much more like what the eye test would suggest. Thoughts?"
"ah yes, this one stat is the end all! Simmons, who spends the highest % of minutes guarding all star/all NBA players of any player (at least last year, doubt this stat has changed) has less of a defensive impact that Kent Bazemore. Checks out"
Kent Bazemore used to be on this list. Now he's a legitimately good rotation piece
"Let’s wait 10 years. We will look back and it’s gonna be like how was that team 36-26 when Curry played.   Draymond - good on offense bc of fit with Curry and high IQ/good facilitating.   Wiggins - Legit good most of season.   Oubre - Makes the team worse despite being a rotational player in NBA. Tunnel vision ball hog was playing a lot for political reasons and eventually got benched for Kent fucking bazmore   Looney- Great defender, high IQ but can’t score. Knows how to play with Steph.   JTA- two way guy, has improved a lot and most of what makes him good is being one of the smartest players on the team who knows to look for Steph. Good low volume three point shooter this year   Poole- was literally in the G-League early in the year , improved a lot tho still streaky shooter and pretty bad his rookie year.   Mulder- only a shooter, left wide open all the time and still misses a bunch.   Bazemore- decent rotation player, 9th or 10th man on a good team.   Paschal- can score one on one vs slow footed centers but got hurt and then started to suck and got benched before injury that kept him out.   Wanamaker- lol   Damion Lee- decent player,  10th man on a good team.   Smiley and Nico - not nba players    When we look back on this team a lot of these guys will be looked at similar to Kobe’s team that year"
Kent Bazemore
"I can imagine this lineup, and anyone who's giving minutes to Kent Bazemore isn't the best team. I love the dude and his time in Portland, but he ain't it."
"The Kent bazemore stuff was equally stupid, he’s one of the last people on earth who’s opinion I would care for"
"What surprises me is how massive the “normal tall” guys look in real life. Like 6’-6’6” range. I met Kent Bazemore and Tim Hardaway Jr. at a charity event a couple years ago and they look absolutely swoll in person (especially THJ).  Hell, Marco Belinelli might have the largest calves I’ve ever seen. But the big guys actually look super skinny (even dudes like Cousins)"
Do people care? Go look at the Bradley Beal and Kent bazemore posts. This sub and people in general fucking love drama lol.
let Kent Bazemore beat you
"Stephen ""Can't Carry"" Curry is playing with:   * Draymond ""Unscorer"" Green * Andrew ""No Heart"" Wiggins * Kent ""Foul Trouble Vet-Min"" Bazemore * Kevon ""Oldest 25-Year-Old Ever"" Looney * a bunch of G-Leaguers  Even without two all-stars, the Jazz still have better depth than the Warriors, yet the Warriors won anyway."
"I’m calling it, warriors going to the finals for the next 17 years as Poole takes over as Curry 2.0, no teams stand a chance against our roster of Michael Mulder and Kent Bazemore"
Man I love watching Booker play he reminds me of Kent Bazemore with better passing
wtf kent bazemore needs to stfu dude aint even on Beals level please calm down
"Beal just has a lot of pent up frustration playing with Washington and constantly losing every year that Bazemore trolled him and set him over the edge. Beal is making himself look like a clown with the amount of tweets, his wife tweeting and now this. Get out of Washington and play for an actual franchise and you might not be so mad at what somebody like Kent Bazemore says"
This dude right here:  &gt;Your husbands a whole all star on a max contract tweeting 7 times about a bench player on a minimum Loudly crying face... Kent of bazemore got a whole real estate agency in yall heads Face with tears of joy
Who would have thought that the name on Bradley Beal's brain in crunch time would be Kent Bazemore?  *Huh?*
Fine dude Bazemore is an evil person that wishes injury on others. You've convinced me fully that he's not some idiot that attempted a bad joke. My only question in all of this is why is anyone asking Kent Bazemore anything in the first place?
I would understand all of this if Steph made original the comment but doing all of this because of Kent Bazemore is sad.   It was a foul comment from Baze though
"Are you kidding man?  Beal you're letting Kent Bazemore live in your head rent free bro, let it go, he made a dumb remark but it's not that serious"
"Nah, idgaf either way honestly. But Beal was soft. It's Kent Bazemore, dude's the clown of the NBA. It was a light joke and Beal went way too hard."
"Just fwiw, Bazemore isn't a nobody to Beal... Like yea they are different leagues of player, but they met in the playoffs multiple times when Kent played for Atlanta.  If they played today obviously Beal would smoke him, but Kent played him as well as anybody in the playoffs"
"I don't disagree with you. I meant that it makes Bazemore come off like more of a dick because you can tell he thought about what he was going to say as opposed to just word salad coming out half assed. Even still, Beal going off at Kent fucking Bazemore is just not a good look."
Kent Bazemore and Beal have some prior history. Beal already didn't like him before the injury comment.
Didn’t even realize Kent Bazemore was still in the league lol
Poole is better than you're describing. But you also forgot to mention the fact that Kent Bazemore makes my eyes bleed to balance that out.
"It wasn’t miss written or miss said, it was NBA player Kent Bazemore."
"Sure, but 4 tweets? Why is an All-Star player and one of the best scorers in the league giving Kent fucking Bazemore the time of day"
"Kent Bazemore reportedly played a role in Curry signing with Under Armour instead of Nike. In 2013, Under Armour reached out to Curry via Bazemore (who was among UA's early signings and is close friends with Curry).  Bazemore referring to Steph Curry as ""SC30"" is basically brand promotion."
Beal tweeting about it like 20 times just made him out to look stupid lmao. Like it’s Kent fucking Bazemore. Tweet your one tweet and move on.
Can I interest you in trash talk between Kent Bazemore and the Beal family?
If I saw Kent Bazemore in public I’d probably have no idea who he is
Kent Bazemore is definitely not sus.
imagine taking kent bazemore seriously LMAOOOOOOO
"Definitely with you, honestly Baze’s comment wasn’t even that bad.            Bradley Beal is a star in this league, he shouldn’t care about Kent Bazemore this much."
Yeah you can't let Kent Bazemore fuck with you that much.
Bazemore made a stupid joke but Beal looks ridiculous getting this upset about it especially considering its coming from Kent fucking Bazemore.
"Kent Bazemore was the one talking out of pocket though. This is actually one of my pet peeves. Someone says an insult, the other person claps back, and the instigator basically says ""lol chill"" and everyone sides with the instigator for taking the high road."
Imagine being Kent Bazemore and opening your mouth about anything related to the NBA.
"Both sides just look pathetic on this beef really.   Just the way Baze said it makes it look shitty.   Beal literally replied 4 fucking times on twitter. Like dude, its Kent Bazemore. 95% of fans don't even know he exists"
Doesnt change the fact that Kent Bazemore is awful
Kent Bazemore talking shit about Beal is like Draymond talking shit to KD.      Scrubs need to know their place
"75 combined points for the Warriors Big 3 of Steph, Poole, and Bradley Beal's  #1 fan Kent Bazemore"
"Yeah, I mean look at how Bay Area NBC covered it too:  [https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kent-bazemore-takes-jab-bradley-beal-over-steph-curry-scoring-race](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kent-bazemore-takes-jab-bradley-beal-over-steph-curry-scoring-race)  You know it's a dumb comment when the hometown press has to try to explain it as ""good natured"" in the title off the jump lmao"
Who tf is Kent Bazemore??
You would never know Kent Bazemore is shooting 41.7% from 3 with the way some Warriors fans talk about him.
"Kent ""the real scoring champ"" Bazemore.     Don't look at the box score please"
kent bazemore is such a bum so why is he talking in the first place?
"For the source:  &gt;Kent Bazemore, marveling at teammate Stephen Curry:   “49 points in 29 minutes, that’s unreal. We got guys hurting hamstrings to keep up.”    [Tweet from Monte Poole](https://twitter.com/MontePooleNBCS/status/1391850601349214211?s=20)"

Kent bazemore has not and will never be anything more than a mediocre bench player
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
Lucky for him Kent Bazemore wasn’t there https://youtu.be/hg6CSSkqkXE
"&gt; I think as long as you stick with them when they suck, you lose frontrunner status.  How is someone supposed to know though?  I watched the lakers in those Marcelo Huertas, Robert Sacre, Kent Bazemore lakers days but I still get called a bandwagon lakers fan or ex warriors fan still on r/nba."
Kent Bazemore makes me want to pull my hair out. He's also anti vax so fuck him double
"He’s been coming off the bench for damion Lee and Kent bazemore bruh, that shouldn’t be an issue when Klay comes back. He’s been great as the 6th man still playing a lot of minutes. Hope the dubs keep him"
Feel bad for him. Dude runs literal miles every game to get other guys wide open. Only problem is those other guys are Kent fucking Bazemore and Mycal Mulder
"burh they were vs a bunch of bubble and teams with lowing records and you are acting like the nuggest dont got depth which is part of the reason why the team is good. you still have at least 7-8 players you can play who can score some points. nuggets win games a lot previously when the 2nd team comes on to the floor and they are capable of not letting the game fall out of their grasp. the warriors do no have the luxary with the amount of injuries, losit obrue who is a very good defender most of the month, noi JW, no 6th man in EP. warriors 6th man was literally kent bazemore who single handly lost us the game vs the celtics."
"Warriors also commit a fuckton of fouls  Looking at you, Kent Bazemore"
there’s nobody i trust less handling the ball than kent bazemore
"who are we talking about, kent bazemore?"

Wow I didn't realise Kent Bazemore and Ben McLemore had a son and that he's playing for the Hawks
"Yeah we're shit this season, but credit is due when y'all survived a Curry detonation w/ a Tatum detonation to match and Marcus Smart making Kent Bazemore look like a toddler."
"Kent Bazemore. Just having fun and locking dudes down from time to time, any offense is a bonus. Already made so much money relative to his talent, no pressure."
"Yeah, Kent Bazemore looks just like Wilt when he's on the floor, people make that comparison all the time. I'm sure he'll score a hundred points any time now."
Kent Bazemore was on the Blazers last year and we also were playing Caleb Swanigan and Mario Herzonjia
"I mean CJ has played 35 games and Nurk 25. Like Klay literally hasn’t played in 2 years and the Warriors have used starting rotations including Kent Bazemore, Juan Tuscano Anderson, Jordan Poole, and fucking Mychal Mulder lol"
Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore were out with Covid and they get 20+ minutes a night. And then they were missing their other two centers. Right now it’s just Looney and Draymond.
"I'm fairly certain that even if the Warriors had the #1 defense in the league A LOT of folks would just assume it was in spite of Steph.  Like, god damn, they aren't a top 10 defense because of Mychal Mulder and Kent Bazemore, FFS."
"Gentle reminder that the Warriors are missing: Klay Thompson, Marquese Chriss, James Wiseman, Eric Paschall, Kent Bazemore and Damion Lee."
"Warriors started Mychal Mulder because the preferred choices of Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore were out.   Lol, okay."
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
More evidence for why stats are pointless for comparing players more like. Easy to have an offensive impact and get decent efficiency when your third best player isn't Kent fucking Bazemore
"Well, the warriors are officially a Kent bazemore lead team after last night."
"-Nobody with a brain actually thinks Steph will win MVP on a play-in team  -Steph isn't a pass first guard, sorry he couldn't get more assists with Kent Bazemore and Two Way Wiggs as his best offensive options  -Embiid is a great player and a great playmaker, but MVP isn't just about talent (regardless of whether you think it should be or not)"

This is the Kent bazemore team now. Sorry Steph. You had a decent run but the true warrior king is here.
[Kent Bazemore this season.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecRytTfWL8Q)
"Eric Snow was never a scorer, he was a great defender. The entire Cavs was built around as a defensive core around LeBron, they were ranked 14th in the NBA in defense rating.   &gt; THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN  Lmao at a Cavs fan calling Draymond the best defender in history in 2021, yall weren't saying shit when you begged for his suspension in game 5 and said it made no differene. Wiggins was RoY and still plays like a rookie. Wiseman has the worst net rating of any starter in the NBA and you're selling the shit out of everyone else.   &gt; Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.    Seriously? What shit are you smoking because none of those guys except Bazemore are even NBA ready players.   &gt; Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   Look at starting lineups not involving Wiseman and Steph's on/off is in reality more like +15.   &gt; LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   We still looking at BPM and VORP in 2021? It's a box based stat that awards people who fill out the box stats, it literally measures defense as an accumulation of steals, blocks, and rebounds and thinks Westbrook is a historically good defender.   Also funny how that works doesn't it, LeBron finished 4th in the weak Eastern conference and came 2nd in mvp voting."
You're telling me a team that has gone 1-7 without curry is not a G league team? Oubre and Wiggins have a net negative on the court. Please use facts instead of tossing out names. The only net positive players on his team that gets minutes is dray and Kent bazemore.
"I wouldn't put too much importance on individual on/off numbers. Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Lebron, KAT, Kawhi all have higher on/off differential than Steph. And those are only the players with the highest usage % on their team that I looked up. Even Kent Bazemore has a higher on/off differential than Steph. Individual players' on/off differential is just a noisy stat that I don' think should be emphasized that much."
"Well if you go by on/off differential which is the stat everyone is using for the ""worst team ever with him off the floor"" line, then there are some players with a higher differential. Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Lebron, KAT, Kawhi all have higher on/off differential than Steph. And those are only the players with the highest usage % on their team that I looked up. Even Kent Bazemore has a higher on/off differential than Steph. Individual players' on/off differential is just a noisy stat that I don' think should be emphasized that much."
"larry hughes got hurt and played 30 games, calling Z an all-star in the center depleted eastern conference is just malpractice, Brad Miller was an all star that year too, eric snow was 34 years old in 2006 averaging 4.0(!) ppg as a starter, and drew gooden is the epitome of replacement level big   THE WARRIORS HAVE BEST DEFENDER IN HISTORY, #1 PICK ROY ANDREW WIGGINS, #2 PICK JAMES WISEMAN, oubre who just scored 20 a game last year, eric paschal who was first team rookie last year, and kevon looney has minutes as a starter in the NBA finals  really, Kent Bazemore, mulder, and Smailagic are the only warriors on the cavs level.   warriors have other guys averaging 18.5, 15.2, 1..7, and 10.2    Steph has a on/off of +9.0, LeBron (at age 22) was at +10.4.   LeBron led the league in BPM, VORP, and only was second to MVP Dirk when they won 60+ games   curry really isn’t even close"
Idk just how much better we’d be but I’d do a lot of DeMar Derozan on the warriors instead of like Kent Bazemore playing 25 minutes a game.
shout out to everyone not named Kent Bazemore for actually trying on defense and not just shaking your head when you get beat on a bad hedge for the 204th time in a row
Klay with one leg is an upgrade from Kent Bazemore and Nico Mannion.
"I don't think that is very persuasive. First of all, there's always going to be the ""maybe next time"" argument. When's the next time a player THIS transcendent having THIS amazing of a season will be stuck on a .500 team?   As for the ""trying something different,"" sure, a center winning the award would be different. But that's not why I'm saying Steph should win. Steph should win because he's been the best player in the league this season and is carrying his team on a nightly basis despite what seems like an endless parade of devastating injuries and Kent Bazemore. He shouldn't win just because we absolutely have to try something different. Now, if you want to say Jokic *still* deserves it, that's actually fine because he's mf incredible."
"It was for sure impressive but I hate how people always completely discount Kyrie in that series. Kyrie averaged almost 30 ppg on 47/42/94 shooting splits including that monstrous game 5 where he dropped 41 on over 80% TS and his huge game 7 when Lebron was struggling shooting, plus his shot to literally win the championship.    It’s just kinda unfair to compare Kyrie having one of the best offensive series in recent history to a starting lineup with Kent Bazemore and Juan Tuscano Anderson."
This is Kent Bazemore slander.
Unfortunately that still wouldn’t guarantee a win. Steph could break Wilt’s 100 just for Kent Bazemore to end up doing something stupid to cost them the game.
"&gt; Two superstars went head to head pretty much equally and it just came down to which secondary guys delivered down the stretch.  Curry narrowly outmatched Tatum, and Kemba narrowly outmatched Wiggins. I think it came down to the rest of the supporting cast. The biggest difference came down to Marcus Smart vs Kent ""Not Smart"" Bazemore, and Jabari Parker being a pleasant surprise for y'all. Didn't think a Jabari vs. Wiggs duel would take place in this manner."
"Yeah, you love to see the hustle but I'd rather have JTA closing out a game than Kent Foulmore. Or even Gary Payton II.  People have been saying Baze is better than Oubre ever since Oubre started missing games, but I doubt it. Baze buys into the system more so the ball movement may look better when he's playing, but he makes more boneheaded decision per minute than Oubre does. Oubre isn't at risk of fouling out every game, and he doesn't just give up on defense either. Bazemore also shoots mid-range shots that he never makes, while Oubre can at least make some of them, and he's stronger finishing at the rim. If only he'd buy into the system...."
Watching Kent Bazemore talk about vaccinations.
Lmao Kent Bazemore misses two game throws to extend the lead and they lose. Threw away a monster game from Curry and this hustle play from JTA.
All my homies hate Kent Bazemore
Fuck Kent Bazemore
It was till I saw a man (Kent bazemore) forget how to play basketball
"We go from Klay Thompson, 60 points in 29 minutes, 14 threes in a game, 37 points in one quarter. To Kent Bazemore, can’t hit 2 free throws"
Crazy that we have the GOAT shooter and we surround him with... Kent Bazemore.
"Yeah, we’re probably going to sit him out until the end of this current calendar year to give him a 13~14 month timeline to return. But at the same time Klay’s shooting ability is something that should’ve been kept so I don’t think he’s going to look terribly bad. He’s always been a slow starter so we’ll have to wait a bit longer after his return to fully see how he’s recovered.  And besides, the only thing he needs to do for the Warriors to improve is to be better than Kent Bazemore and Mychal Mulder, which is not a tall task."
"famous G Leaguers Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Jordan Poole(he WAS a GLeague player, he's a very good NBA level talent now), Kent Bazemore"
Hack a Shaq would work. Throw in Kent Bazemore there for the fouls
Lets not forget he first replaced Aminu and Harkless with Kent Bazemore and Mario Hezonja
Steph lost to the AD LeBron Lakers by 3  With no Klay  With Kent Bazemore and Kevon Looney starting
we're comparing him to luka's team and it's true. literally what is the argument against that. kent bazemore and james wiseman were getting consistent minutes
"If I'm jody allen next on the list is neil Olshey, he's given horrible contracts, and brought in players like mario hezonja, kent bazemore."
"That was one of the best nationally televised regular season games this season with Tatum and Curry both going nuclear. And in typical Warriors fashion, Draymond missed a game tying layup that ended up sealing the deal (with Marcus Smart taking out Kent Bazemore with a fake pass that had him running a circle before just standing there while Smart contemplated the existence of life before taking his sweet time to swish a 3 pointer).  JTA flew out of bounds saving the ball that Curry caught and sunk a 3, but unfortunately after he crashed over the scorer's table he hit his head on the same type of metal plating that Curry broke his tailbone on and got a concussion and 35 stitches."
There are very few people who can make the playoffs with Kent Bazemore in their rotation
Kent Bazemore would have at least 2 of them
"Basically. Yeah they signed Oubre (who was helpful in some situations, but also made the team worse in other situations), but other than that they did nothing, made no moves at the deadline other than trading away Chriss and Wanamaker to save money, and basically said fuck it and made us compete with multiple wasted roster spots on unplayable players. By the end of the season we ended up with an 8 man roster, we were starting Kent Bazemore and half of those players had played in the G League either this year or last year."
"I never said Wiggins was a scrub. He actually stepped up and had his best year efficiency wise and I commend him for that. The Warriors ran an 8man roster that included JTA, Mulder, Looney and Draymond. Best shooters on that roster were Kent Bazemore and Jordan Poole and in that stretch Steph was far and away the best scorer in the league on ultra efficiency. If you honestly think they had similar supporting casts I don’t know what to say. Do you think Steph was the reason they weren’t a higher seed ?  You’re entitled to your opinion I just think it’s ridiculous to say Steph wouldn’t have his accolades when just this year you saw him win a scoring title on amazing efficiency with terrible spacing. He IS the system my man."
"It’s not even a discussion. Steph ended this conversation this season by playing out of his mind with his second best helper being Kent fucking Bazemore, and being triple teamed for most of the season.   Dame is unreal. Clutch as absolute fuck. But he is just not on Steph’s level. You give Steph this Blazers team and they finish top 4 and make conference finals. At least."
"38ppg, 50% from three, double teamed every possession in play ins. Only lost because of pure variance of a one game series  Or how about a month of 35 ppg on 50/45/90 efficiency, ending the season on a 15-5 run, while literally having Kent Bazemore playing as starter on an 8 man rotation"
Wiggins helped a lot ngl. The problem is outside him it is nothing. Plus our problem is shooting and Wiggins has all the chances in the world to shoot but doesn't...which is ok bc he does everything else well.  The problem though is our 2nd option shooter rn is Kent Bazemore...on a minimum vet contract. Every team needs s good 2nd option shooter right? Kent is a good dude but he is a bench player at the end of the day.  GSW is just a badly constructed roster with no offense. Just triple team Curry and you win.  Didn't help that Oubre was out for the last month.
It's how I feel about Kent Bazemore with the Warriors. Vet min and only plays 10-15 minutes a game? Fine. Anything more than that? Depressed.
"Dillon ""Kent Bazemore"" Brooks, fouling machine"
Kent Bazemore
Kent Bazemore is the goat at this
We went from Klay Thompson to Kent Bazemore so I think we have them beat
"Nicolas Batum (Hornets): Five years, $120,000,000  Hassan Whiteside (Heat): Four years, $98,419,537  Chandler Parsons (Grizzlies): Four years, $94,438,524  Ryan Anderson (Rockets): Four years, $80,000,000  Allen Crabbe (Trail Blazers): Four years, $74,832,500  Joakim Noah (Knicks): Four years, $72,590,000  Luol Deng (Lakers): Four years, $72,000,000  Kent Bazemore (Hawks): Four years, $70,000,000  Evan Turner (Trail Blazers): Four years, $70,000,000  Bismack Biyombo (Magic): Four years, $68,000,000  Ian Mahinmi (Wizards): Four years, $64,000,000  Timofey Mozgov (Lakers): Four years, $64,000,000"
&gt; The real crucial match up of this series: Patty Mills v. Kent Bazemore  YOU LIED TO ME
We can offer you Kent Bazemore
"When your role as a starter can be mostly filled by Kent Bazemore, you're doing something wrong."
"Kent Bazemore starts for the warriors and trust me, the jazz 8th man is better than him. I say Clarkson is top 75"
"Yes absolutely. GS had the best player but could only go 8 deep and 1 of those played only 6 minutes in Mulder. Memphis has one of the deepest rosters in the league. While GS had to rely on Juan Toscano Anderson, Kevon Looney, and Kent Bazemore in crunch time"
Idk but fuck Kent bazemore tbh
"Portland had a lot more issues. Nurkic alone missed 66 games, let alone Rodney Hood tearing his Achilles (and missing half the season), Trevor Ariza missing half the season, Zach Collins missed nearly the entire season, etc  I mean their starting frontcourt for most of the season was Kent Bazemore, Carmelo Anthony, and Hassan Whiteside and they still managed to make the playoffs."
OH I got you. I’m pissed off at Kent Bazemore. I was so frustrated watching him play that game 😂
I was happy I no longer had to watch Kent Bazemore play basketball this season but then Andre Drummond appeared
"Maybe we should have been more concerned when they just barely squeaked past the Big 3 of Steph Curry, Kent Bazemore, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
"How has Steph had excuses? No one defends him losing 3-1. He played terribly and was a massive downgrade from the regular season, but he wasn't the only factor in the team losing.   This year Steph did what he could, he had the warriors as the 4th seed then they went 1-7 while he was injured. During  the two play-in games he had 37 on on 52% FG% and 66.2 3P%. Him and Wiggins were the only positive players on the court.  Then vs the grizzlies he had 39 points on 46 FG% and 40 3P%. Him and Jordan Poole brought them to OT, yet Kent bazemore shot 33% on shots and JTA went 1-5.  Curry did have slot of turnovers though, if he secured the ball better they probably win too, but if his team could just score 2 shots they win."
Crazy that Kent bazemore and tascano-Anderson aren’t enough to elevate them.
"If CJ tears his achilles and ACL and misses the entire season next year, the Blazers run a crunchtime lineup with a guy on a 2-way contract, a guy who was in the g-league bubble last year, and Kent Bazemore, and the Blazers still make the playoffs when Dame is 33 years old, I'll eat my words."
That's highly speculative.   It's gonna be hard for Klay's contract to look bad as long as he's healthy enough to play; he'll be taking a spot in the starting lineup that belonged to Kent fucking Bazemore down the stretch this season.
"I hope so man, dunno if Oubre will be staying somehow or if Wiggins will get shipped off but I just hope Klay stays healthy next year and we compete for a solid playoff spot - Curry should have a good season with hopefully less triple teams on him every game, and Poole is only improving. JTA shows a lot of potential as well.  Gonna be nice to not have fucking Kent Bazemore in the starting lineup."
"Bro, they started Kent Bazemore and Kevon Looney. Stop discrediting Curry and Draymond for dragging a roster that literally no one else would have sniffing the playoffs."
"I hate my life and JORDAN POOLE, KENT BAZEMORE , GRAYSON ALLEN , DILLON BROOKS , KYLE ANDERSON. Jordan poole for that nasty turover"
Yeah people forget Kent Bazemore was a shaqtin meme off the bench for most of his career. He's not a starter on a playoff team
I mean they are starting Kent Bazemore instead of Klay Thompson. That’s the biggest problem
Fuxking Kent Bazemore playing like a damn bum and is asking the crowd to cheer
My life will be much better when I no longer have to watch Kent Bazemore play basketball
Kent Bazemore is one of the worst players I’ve had the displeasure of watching as of late
Kent Bazemore Andrew Wiggins not shooting 80% and getting foul calls OH NO!!
Any team that plays Kent fuckin Bazemore 30 minutes a night just isn’t winning it.
"I’m not sure if you don’t know who Kent Bazemore is or are intentionally throwing shade at him by not saying his name, but it’s absolutely hilarious either way and I love it"
Kent Bazemore looks like a Veggie Tale
Is Kent Bazemore as bad as he seems every time I watch the Warriors play?
No particular order  Dominique Wilkins   Shawn kemp   Charles Barkley   Carmelo Anthony   Trae young   Dwight Howard   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Dame   Kent Bazemore
"Haha I speak more to the current state of the team, like as awesome a person Kent Bazemore is he should not be receiving anything resembling the minutes he gets lol"
I mean every team has stuff like this. I just keep imagining klay instead of Kent freaking bazemore in the lineup
Dell Curry -&gt; Karl Malone -&gt; Devean George -&gt; Steph Curry   Pace Mannion -&gt; Karl Malone -&gt; Kobe Bryant -&gt; Kent Bazemore -&gt; Nico Mannion  Manute Bol -&gt; Muggsy Bogues -&gt; Antawn Jamison -&gt; Javale McGee -&gt; Bol Bol
"Absolutely. This is my biggest gripe with the Warriors taking Wiseman over someone like Williams, Ball, or Haliburton.   Many have argued it was really a fit pick, but it really wasn’t. It was so they had a body to throw out there for 25+ minutes at center until the minutes started mattering.   Even if you’re not playing the long game, at least some of the other guys would have been able to make an immediate impact in close games over Kent Bazemore or Mychal Mulder."
"As far as I'm aware, everyone on the Warriors has been vaccinated except for Kent Bazemore. They didn't make a big thing about it in the media, except for that one Tweet w/ Jordan Poole and Klay getting vaccinated and promoting it."
"No I just am saying how the Lakers bent their defense a lot more to stop Curry than the Warriors bent theirs to stop LeBron.  That bending of the defense leaves openings all over the court, however the Warriors shambled roster wasn't able to take advantage of it well enough, which is the reason it's a viable strategy in the first place.  Had Anthony Davis been one of Curry's teammates; he would've been getting a LOT of free dunks out there (which would not show on the stat sheets as assists for Steph despite creating them btw). If Klay Thompson is out there, that's a lot of wide open threes.   Unfortunately it is JTA, Jordan poole, Kevon looney, Kent Bazemore, Wiggins trying to finish those opportunities. They were almost able to do enough but not quite"
Kent Bazemore shouldn’t be allowed to take 10 shots a game.
Lol Kent bazemore
Kent bazemore ain’t stepping on the floor for a finals game
*Kent Bazemore
I just realized that Kent Bazemore has 5 steals wtf
Kent Bazemore sucks
Imagine getting beat by Kent Bazemore
Kent Bazemore is either making a difficult three or smoking a layup to an egregious extent
I mean the Warriors are playing kent bazemore lmao
Kent bazemore just not missing lmao
This performance is easily the second most embarrassing thing Kent Bazemore has done in the past two weeks
"Kent ""Brad Wanamaker"" Bazemore"
I really don’t like the “Kent Bazemore driving to the rim faster than he can fucking think” play
"Imagine having Kent Bazemore on you and you decide to pass out to a turnover, lmao"
"Idk about you guys, but coming into the gane I was expecting the leading scorers to not be Kent Bazemore for the warriors and KCP for the lakers"
how does your entire team get outscored by Kent bazemore
"*kent bazemore checks out*  lakers: ""finally...a break.....unless--""  eric paschall: *smiles* guess it's my turn now"
Imagine allowing kent bazemore of all people to celebrate anything other than a trip to Cancun
Lakers prepped for Steph Curry but not for the true sniper Kent Bazemore I guess
KENT BAZEMORE LOL
The Kent Bazemore game
"When you have 3 stars and you lose 2 and the last one left is LeBron, no you aren't as good as you were, but LeBron was still surrounded by shooters which we all know is always an elite team. When you have NO stars and you lose the only 2 players capable of even hindering LeBron (Thabo and demarre) and a top 3 shooter in the league, ... yeah you're fucked. The hawks were a perfectly oiled machine where everyone played their roles perfectly with elite chemistry. You can't replace the sharpshooting Korver role with Kent bazemore. You also can't guard LeBron with fucking Kent bazemore."
Are u kidding me??? We have Kent Bazemore starting..
Steph keeps it close but in the end Lakers win by 7 points after AD hits a fadeaway over Kent Bazemore and gets fouled
"If you don't like Kent Bazemore, I don't like you.  Take that flair off, b."
"I just worry about who will be able to defend Bron, with AD probably guarded by Draymond I can’t imagine Kent Bazemore or JTA will be able to handle Bron"
On Kent Bazemore? No way  ..i am very scared and this is not a joke
"Kent ""Aizen"" Bazemore"
"-Kent Bazemore, probably"
He didn't. He just said he heard about Beal scoring 50 because news travels around.  Then Beal being a thin-skinned moron quoted something made up when ranting about Kent Bazemore.
"His #2 was Andrew Wiggins w/ Kent Bazemore and Kevin Looney in the starting lineup with Oubre out. Not to mention GSW had barely any depth on their roster at all.  Against the Lakers w/ LB &amp; AD in, he dropped 37/7/3 and it was a 3pt loss.  Against the Grizzlies he dropped 39/4/5 w/ 3 steals. Grizzlies had like 8 guys basically at double figures (Anderson and Valanciunus had 9 pts each) for scoring.  The fact that they had a positive season with that squad in the West (let's not forget Curry was season scoring leader) and almost beat the Lakers who at the time were the most likely candidate for a championship outside the Nets is impressive if anything.  The only people who will view Curry negatively are people who don't understand context or basketball in general."
"If you have to ask, you weren't watching those Warriors teams.  Jackson had the Warriors passing less than almost any team in the NBA. Opposing teams could goad Jackson into calling ISO post-ups for pretty much any player on the roster so long as the other team put a smaller defender on a Warrior player. Jermaine O'Neal, Klay Thompson, and Harrison Barnes post-ups were a fundamental part of the 2013-14 Warriors' offense. Harrison Barnes played shooting guard in many bench lineups that year. Draymond Green was a 3 for much of the season, until Jackson finally started using him in closing lineups at the 4 next to Andrew Bogut. The Jermaine O'Neal/Mo Speights frontcourt was a thing. Kent Bazemore played the back-up point guard role. It was an absolute mess."
"We were a top 5 defense for a lot of this past season, even touching the 1 and 2 spots on occasion after Wiseman went down iirc.  Considering we were starting Kent Bazemore, and our only ‘good’ defenders were Draymond and Wiggins, that should not happen.  Curry isn’t a great defender, but he is nowhere near as bad as people try and claim."
He was shooting around with Kent Bazemore on his IG live a day or two ago  Link:  https://youtu.be/p0uMisUnqlk
"I do not mean this as an insult, but you need to understand how the cap works in the NBA.   Hard caps are only triggered if you use the non tax payer MLE, sign and trade, or bi annual exception.   Otherwise, you can resign your own players and go over the cap. Your penalty is the luxury tax.   160m is a lot but they wouldn't even be the highest in the NBA.   Next season if the Warriors do not resign Kelly Oubre or Kent Bazemore, they are at 168m.   The Nets if they do not retain Spencer Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, they are at 150m with 7 players on their roster."
Rookie Kent Bazemore
If we go in to next season with a bench made entirely of children and Kent bazemore (who is an idiot) we deserve to miss the playoffs again.
"I actually have a lot of encounters with Atlanta athletes but have no proof other than stories because I'm never one to ask for a picture.    I've run on a treadmill at LA Fitness in Alpharetta next to John Smoltz on a Sunday morning.  We gave each other the look of ""I know, you know, that I know, that you know.""  I just nodded and smiled and he did the same.  I've fist bumped Freddie Freeman at a sushi restaurant, literally the day he proposed to his wife and their entire family were there celebrating.  Ironically my wife and friends were there celebrating our engagement too, but as he was leaving he walked right by our booth, and I just said ""Hey man, go get them this weekend!"" and stuck my fist out, and he gave me a bump and said ""Thanks.""  I met Kent Bazemore and his wife at a high end baby products store about 2 and a half years ago as my wife and I were looking at cribs and baby furniture.  I actually noticed a really nice Turbo Porsche in the parking lot, and the plate said ""Bazeman"" and I turned to my wife and said ""I bet that's Kent Bazemore's car.""  Turns out it was and he was pretty cool to chat with for a minute in the store.  His wife was super nice too and they congratulated us on our upcoming baby.  The employees of the store asked me who that was and I had to explain that he was a Hawks player lol.  They had no idea.  I've run into Miguel Almaron in a Whole Foods in Sandy Springs before he was bought out from Atlanta United.  We didn't chat, but I looked at him, realized who it was and just gave him a thumbs up, and he had a big shit eating grin on his face.  I think he really liked that I didn't bother him but recognized him.    The ONLY famous person who I got a photo of (more for my wife than me) and was a complete bitch was Anna Kendrick.  We had our company kickoff at the ""W"" in Midtown, and there were rumors she was staying in the penthouse suite for a new film.  Well the night we had our big gala, my coworker and I went down to the bar area in the main lobby, and she was chilling with her boyfriend and another girl.  I walked up and waited for a second before asking her if I could get a photo for my wife?  She got up, put on the fakest smile I've ever seen, and took the phone out of my hands, snapped a selfie, and then I said ""Thanks, I appreciate it!""  I told her that the gala was about to close up at 9:30pm and that the 200 employees would start making their way down to the lobby bar because the free alcohol ran out.  She smiled again and told me:  ""Tell them to fuck off!"".  She sat down and I went about my evening.    [Photo of me and Anna](https://imgur.com/a/tKLc2Fr)"
"Our biggest need is more shooting. We don't need Siakam missing a shitload of beyblade spinning midrange 2s. I'd rather bet on Wiseman reaching his potential and the 7th and 14th pick providing the missing depth we're sorely lacking in. Yeah they're rookies but we're also playing Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore heavy minutes right now, so they definitely won't be worse than them."
Kent Bazemore was just at the last game
Kent Bazemore and Kelly Oubre started at the 2 most of this past season. This would be such an upgrade in every way. They’d be fine.
"I’m taking LeBron and AD over Steph, a washed Draymond, who knows how good Klay is after 2 major injuries, Wiggins who is inconsistent as fuck, and a bench led by Kent Bazemore and Jordan Poole lmao"
I'll be generous and offer you a Kent Bazemore.
Kent Bazemore sighting in Milwaukee
"Bazemore has continued to get decent minutes where, and I can not stress this enough, we literally had to pay Monta to NOT play for us because he was so bad  Not to mention Teague gets less runtime than Kent  Thad gets similar playtime but we could not hold on to him   And the majority of our bench mob couldn’t stay in the league   So all of those players, including Bazemore, are improvements on what we put together. Sure he isn’t the standout on the list, but I’m more interested in what we could have done better, and he would have been a better pickup than what we had"
remember when yalls best player was Kent Bazemore. Hawks have come a long way and im here for it
Is Kent Bazemore not enough for you??
Better than Kent Bazemore
"Why would Steph sign it?   Look, I’m a Warriors fan. I want nothing more.    That said, they’ve done nothing to improve the roster the last two years - even ignoring Klay’s injuries.    Brad Wanamaker and Kent Bazemore?!?!?   Just wasted an all-time season by Steph.    Him signing the contract now costs him leverage in getting a competitive roster around him.    He certainly doesn’t need the money."
"What's more interesting is how little of what that 2014- 2015 team became assets for them:  * The following left in free agency for nothing: Al Horford, Paul Millsap, DeMarre Carroll, Thabo Sefolosha, Pero Antic, John Jenkins, Elton Brand, Austin Daye (waived in his final season) * Adreian Payne traded that season (his rookie year) to the Twolves for the pick that became K'Von ""Red Velvet"" Huerter  * Following were traded for things that didn't matter: Mike Scott  (a 2nd that did not convey), Shelvin Mack (traded for washed up Kirk Hinrich in his final season), Korver (traded for a retired Mo Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr. in his final season and a 1st that did not convey). * Schroder was traded for a pick that conveys next year plus a whole bunch of nothing. *  Jeff Teague traded for Taurean Prince and a pick that was packaged with other picks to get DeAndre Hunter. * Kent Bazemore and a future first eventually became Clint Capela.   So in summary, from that roster they only really got Clint Capela, Huerter, and DeAndre Hunter. 4/5 of the ""NBA Player of the Month"" team left for nothing. I remember there was a lot of criticism of the Hawks for not getting assets for their players, but it didn't really matter. Schlenk did a good job of rebuilding through the draft and free agency."
"Throwing shit at the wall   East  1. Milwaukee: Despite winning a championship, Giannis, Middleton and Jrue go full all gas, no breaks next year and gun for 65ish wins and the 1 seed in the East. Love the Portis re-sign.   2. Brooklyn: Battle injuries like they did last year, but still prevail as the most dangerous team in the league.   3. Boston: Ime Udoka brings much needed cohesion to a C’s team with a lot of firepower. Jay’s + Rob Will stay healthy. Schroeder guns for 6moy.   4. Atlanta: After a rocky first 10 games and everyone questioning how legit the young Hawks are, they explode back. One of Reddish or Huerter gets dealt at the deadline.   5. Miami: Pretty significant drop off in win column from top 4 to here. Heat play hard, but it’s not pretty. Robinson underperforms.   6. Philadelphia: Simmons situation leaks into season. A lot of turmoil. Embiid’s health is a big question. Maxey takes a big step.   7. Indiana: Have a sturdy season led by Carlisle. Warren and LeVert play 65+ games each.   8. Washington: The Wiz outlast New York and Chicago in the play-in. Washington has multiple 6moy candidates.   Other East  Chicago barely misses out. Derozan contract quickly becomes bad, fit turns out to be atrocious.   Cleveland (for no other reason that I plan on hammering the Over for their season win total) takes a step forward.   Charlotte is everyone’s favorite bad team.   West (In general has a pretty down year)  1. LAL: Hate this team with a passion (not Russ &amp; Me7o) so it’s only right. Spacing is a legit issue but the defense is still top notch. Kent Bazemore tries to fight Trevor Ariza at some point.   2. Phoenix: CP3 slows down, but the rest of the team comes to play after slipping in the Finals. Ayton MIP finalist.   3. Utah: Same ole Utah, nothing too crazy. One of Ingles/Bogdonavic gets dealt at the deadline.   4. Denver: Jokic keeps everyone in awe. Porter Jr. never takes that step everyone expects him to with Murray out. Nuggets make a move for Dame.   5. New Orleans: FUCK YOU DONT CARE. Na but Zion and BI take over, Zion comes back and shocks everyone on defense. New back court + defensive depth is a huge strength. Willie Green for COY. Nickeil finishes top 5 MIP.   6. Dallas: Solid year, Luka wins scoring title. Jury is out on Kidd, he and Luka fight a lot. Porzingis bounces back and plays 60ish games. Team defense gets really bad though. Lot of shootouts.   7. LAC: Interesting year for the Clips. They meddle around .500 but are that random team every year that wins all its close games but gets shredded by lottery teams. Terrence Mann has the greenest of lights. Kawhi returns.  8. Minnesota: Now we’re in the ugly. T-Wolves and their fans don’t give a shit though, playoffs baby. Edwards and KAT become unstoppable. DLo doesn’t get in the way. Defense is close to non-existent, but enough energy from Pat Bev keeps the young team engaged enough to go .500.   Golden State: I’m gonna get ripped apart for this but I don’t see the hype. Curry is fuckin amazing, but I think we see a really broken down Klay. Draymond replicates last two years. Youth isn’t what it needs to be. They come up short as KAT gives Draymond and Wiseman absolute hell in the battle for the 8th spot in the play in. Pat Bev gets a clutch block on Curry and the internet folds inwards.   Other West   Portland is horrible after Dame literally sits out (I 25% believe this) and gets traded East (plz). CJ gets dealt. Powell gets the green light to shoot 25 times a game.   Kings finish as the 9th seed but Walton fucks it up and gets knocked out by Curry and the Warriors.   Memphis = Charlotte West  Houston starts 5-0 and finishes with another top 5 pick."
Russ is a net negative in the playoffs and was a net negative for most of the regular season last year   AD was pretty mediocre from the jump for his standards last year   Every role player that can shoot can’t defend  The defenders can’t shoot  Kent Bazemore is the only one who’s solid at both but he has terrible basketball IQ which will lead to him getting sporadic minutes
"I mean, he definitely does know how to play basketball. His IQ isn’t great but Kent Bazemore has had a long career so it must not matter that much."
"Huh? Everyone’s highlights aren’t this exciting lol. I just finished watching Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington, and Kendrick Nunns highlights and none of them are as cold blooded and exciting as these plays"
"Unless they can get a legit two-way star or a top 5 on-ball creator, they need his defense at the point of attack badly. Thybulle can’t really be counted on to guard the best guard/wing all night until he learns to stop with the Kent Bazemore fouls and Danny Green is more of a team defender.   Morey took an L this off-season, Simmons isn’t wrong to be upset with how Doc and Embiid treated him, and team needs to face reality here."
"Going to disagree.  People really underestimate what Curry was doing with the squad he had. Warriors had basically no depth. Took the Lakers with both AD and Lebron in with Kevin Looney and Kent Bazemore in the starting lineup and Wiggins as his 2nd option to a 3pt game in the play ins.  Had Poole, Mychal Mulder, and Juan Toscano-Anderson on rotation. That was it."
Used to be Kent Bazemore. Then we learned he was a anti vax asshole. So I'll go with Mareese Speights instead
revised  PG: Damian Lillard - 36$  SG: Jamal Murray - 7$  SF: Khris Middleton - 30$  PF: Bobby Portis - 3$  C: Embiid - 38$  BENCH  Tristan Thompson - 2$  Andre Iguodala - 2$  Kent Bazemore - 2$  this team is not losing
"Trae’s had better assist stats since they got drafted. Even when he was playing with Jabari Parker, Damian Jones, Alex Len and Kent Bazemore."
Ok. Lakers can sign players on the Vets minimum. Malik Monk is on a vets minimum. He could have made more somewhere else. Same thing with Kent Bazemore.
"Kelly Oubre Jr, Kent Bazemore deserve to be on this list."

I see your 53% from 3 on 12.5 attempts and raise you 50.3% on 14.3 attempts while playing with Juan Toscano Anderson and Kent Bazemore.
Kent Bazemore lol
"What the hell are you talking about? Month and a half ago lmao.   KOC has been on Ben Simmons hand thingy since the initial draft analysis in 2016 and he did his own analysis. It started with this [article](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2016/10/10/16077030/nba-shooting-coaches-kent-bazemore-kawhi-leonard-8660e9939680#.8fpqpp33l).    Here's the beginning:    &gt; It sure doesn’t look natural. For all the dazzling passes that made him an elite prospect, Simmons is a poor shooter; he hit just 13 of his 40 jump shots at LSU, and only five of 23 in the summer league. Those numbers come from me. I’ve been tracking all of his shots going back to LSU, and will continue to once he returns to the floor in the NBA. Why? For one, because I am obsessed with weird stats like this, but there’s a deeper method to my madness: I believe Ben Simmons is shooting with the wrong hand, and I’ve never been more sure of anything in my entire life."
I mean they could also start Kent Bazemore and the point would still stand
"I suppose the rest of the payroll balances out.  Lakers spending $15M on Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Trevor Ariza, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore.  Knicks spending $19.5M on Evan Fournier."
"&gt;Shooters get paid  No, playmakers get paid.  There are tons of guys who can shoot around 40% -- 100 players shot 40%+ last season.  Many are making near NBA minimum wage, guys like Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington, Jordan Nwora, and many others.  There are very few who can produce 6 assists per game -- only 22, last season, and almost all are very expensive, and none make close to the minimum."
"Regardless of the team he chooses I don't think he is going to contribute a lot and is not going to have a lot of minutes. Not a good shooter and he is old, the only way he can help is on defense and thinking about the teams he can sign with: - Warriors should focus on getting offense players for their bench and they already have Otto Porter Jr. Who is a 3 and D wing ( Iggy would technically be the same position). - Nets could definitely use a defensive wing coming of the bench. Right now they have Carter and Brown who are good defenders but are guards. They also have James Johnson and Blake who should get PF minutes or small Ball 5 minutes. - Lakers biggest problem is their defense, got a lot of shooters and scorers but lost their best defenders, Kent Bazemore and Ariza might be their best options coming of the bench and still are not as good as KCP and Caruso were. So maybe he could help with that 🤷."
Kent bazemore is a vet. But yes the other two are not.
"Ah yes, NBA vets Malik Monk, Kent Bazemore and Kendrick Nunn"
Yeah I’m sure teams were climbing over themselves to sign Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore
"&gt;Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza  guys who are either old, washed, or unwanted by their former teams  &gt;Carmelo Anthony   old  &gt;Dwight Howard  he was the butt of jokes a few seasons ago, now he knows his role as an energy guy in spurts, but still nothing great  &gt;Kent Bazemore  ok, he's a good shooter in the regular season   Lakers fans need to get a reality check. Pelinka is no genius. Lebron and the geography got a bunch of old guys few wanted to take a little for the chance of getting a ring, that's it.   Fournier is 28 and is a decent player - he's not making crazy money but fair market value."
"One is a championship contender and the other isn't. The price of the most valuable players is exponentially less than their value. AD (35) + Lebron (41) + Westbrook (44) plus 15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. In the playoffs, rotations get cut to 8 players and your star players are going to eat up the minutes and on ball play. There's a reason big 3's are so popular and successful."
"This must be retaliation for this post from earlier today  “ The Lakers will spend $15M total on contracts of Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, &amp; Dwight Howard. The Knicks are gonna pay Evan Fournier $19.5M per yr.”"
Kent Bazemore is getting in.
"Your exact quote was that their moves were only enough to keep them competitive. That, to me, sounds like they are just middling contenders and not the most talented team in the league like I think they are. Ok, that is fine to compare those 4 players in a vacuum (Melo and Dwight vs KCP and Kuzma). But those two acquisitions are at the end of the list in terms of the Lakers most important (in my opinion). They added Malik Monk, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, and Ariza on top of that. That kind of bench depth with athleticism and versatility, on top of their new big 3, is what makes them the most talented team in the league. Again, imo"
"They have Kevon Looney. But other than that, I agree, he's probably not moving the needle. More or less just replacing Kent Bazemore."
he'd be the 10th man on those teams. He's kent bazemore level atleast.
"Laker fans act like this but they hype up their guys more than anyone. Ive never seen as many pro-Carmelo Anthony comments in the last couple years as ive seen in the last 24 hours.  Seriously go back and look at last year’s Dennis Schroeder post and then compare it to the words on guys who either haven’t played in a year or were like the 8th man on a lottery team. Kendrick Nunn and Malik were solid gets for a bench backcourt esp at their cost, but no have no idea if they will perform to par in the playoffs, and I’m already seeing Pelinka won the offseason posts.  Also, I have no idea who is actually going to replace KCP as the 3&amp;D shooting guard for this time. All I know is, you have to be doing mental gymnastics to think Wayne Ellington or Kent Bazemore are upgrades there.   You think they’ve been bad with the Bron stans + Laker fans together, now they got the Westbrook stans, and the Melo stans now. It’s gonna reach a zenith we haven’t seen yet"
"Malik Monk - So insanely talented that the team that drafted him and is trying to rebuild it good young talent didn't even extend a qualifying offer to him.   Kendrick Nunn - So insanely talented that the Heat stopped playing him in the playoffs when they made a run to the finals.   Kent Bazemore - So insanely talented as a 32 year old he average a whopping 7.2 ppg and averaged a single made 3 pointer per game. I mean, damn, where do you get that kind of production?!  Wayne Ellington - On his 10th team he's bound to find consistency and success. This insanely talented sniper who turns 34 this year has shot above 40% from 3 exactly one time since 2014 -- last year in a 40-something game sample. The previous year he shot 33% on open catch and shoot 3s. I'm on the edge of my seat to find out if this middle aged shooter will find consistency in his 11th stop of his career!"
"&gt;You'll see the difference once Baze plays for your team.  Not like the Laker fans haven't seen Kent Bazemore play before for them, what kind of player he is isn't unknown to the Lakers.   But maximizing the potential of big 3 is the priority. And you do that by providing floor spacing. Sure Caruso hustles on defense and makes smart plays, but ultimately he doesn't provide spacing - hence wouldn't really be played in closing lineup.   And that's why they moved on."
Kent Bazemore is graded as the 5th best G/F defender according to RAPTOR and 3 year RAPM. THT also graded really well. KCP was solid but not irreplaceable on that end  The only loss is in their PG rotation. Schroder/Caruso to Westbrook/Nunn. Big defense for offense trade off
"Kent Bazemore swooped into the Lakers roster spot Kawhi was angling for, and now he doesn’t know what to do"
Thanks for the backup big market bro  Caruso has worse stats across the board while playing one more minute than Kent bazemore
Kent Bazemore makes $100K from Under Armor for bringing in Curry. Even that’s considered an anomaly.
All the players you signed are pretty bad and will most likely not be in your playoff rotation besides Nunn who took 5 million. Oubre is most likely gonna get paid in the 8-10 million range  EDIT: Yall Lakers fans are delusional do you seriously think fucking Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore will be in your playoff rotation
"&gt;SG- Wayne Ellington, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk, Talen Horton-Tucker  that's definitely an all time great list of shooting guards"
Kent Bazemore and it's not even close.

I don't understand the salt. Who did we sign that is changing things?   Is Carmelo 27 again? Is Dwight 26? Is Marc Gasol going to decide to show up before the playoffs this year? Carmelo Anthony is like 40.   Kendrick Nunn? Malik Monk? Kent Bazemore?   I'm confused.
Kent Bazemore and Carmelo Anthony are not good basketball players.
"These crybabies are the worst and I swear they’re growing more and more vocal as time goes on.   Oh no, Kent Bazemore and the corpse of Carmelo Anthony who’ll be an active liability after the first round signed for the minimum, the league is ruined!!!"

&gt; we just got him in Kent Bazemore  You just got an older version that is less tradable though.
"Reddit nephews glued to this narrative instead of possibly thinking, maybe Caruso isn’t as good as redditors want him to be or think him to be. The man has zero offense.  If we need someone to run around and play hard on defense and flail his arms when called for fouls, we just got him in Kent Bazemore"
"Kent Bazemore made 1 three a game last season and is a career .356 % shooter on low volume.   Ariza made 1.7 threes a game last season on .350 %.   Ellington is a good three point shooter, but he was cut by the Knicks two years ago and didn’t even play a full season for the Pistons.   These “pickups” did not solve the spacing issue."
"Dude, yes. The problem for me is actually seeing the other 2 starters. Kent bazemore, Rudy gay, Trevor ariza.. None of those guys are starting caliber players anymore. Bazemore may be younger but I've never ever been impressed with his game."
"I think the league has just done a much better job of optimizing and projecting values since the new CBA. After the 2015-2017 fiasco where players like Evan Turner and Kent Bazemore were getting $80mil contracts, it really could only get better from there."
Clearly it’s Kent Bazemore
You’re undervaluing Bazemore’s defense. Kent is also a fantastic defender and has proven to be a good defender across multiple teams and systems.  I don’t care about Jeannie’s pocketbook. Spend spend spend. But his defense was very replaceable and his offense was lacking. Bazemore is an upgrade at the position because he can defend and fits better alongside our star trio.
"This is the exactly correct analysis. Oh btw, KCP’s role has already been replaced by Kent Bazemore and Trevor Ariza. They could still sign a patty mills or Rudy gay."
Yeah the Lakers’ title chances hinge on Kent Bazemore this season.
"Idgaf about Kent Bazemore. We did nothing with the roster this last week but add a 19 year PG who had more turnovers than assists in college.   We lost Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie and will be stuck with KD’s smoke buddy DeAndre again."
"Please. There’s much worse contending cores than KD, Harden, Kyrie, Harris, and Griffin.   No need to get your ruffles in a bunch over missing out on Kent Bazemore"
Laker fans will hate this but Caruso was replaceable. He’s the sort of guy that you love having on the cheap but don’t want to be the one paying his salary.   All these /r/NBA have been concern trolling the Lakers all weekend over a lack of spacing. The Lakers swap out Kent Bazemore on a league min deal for Caruso on a $37M deal and they call it a bad move.  Caruso can’t shoot. Bazemore can. The both play solid defense.   The real takeaway is that Caruso is part of a pipeline. He was preceded by Josh Hart and he’ll be followed by another no name we’ve developed into a contributor.
You guys added a top 10 player and you are saying Miami?  Kent bazemore for free
"So they replace Caruso with Kent Bazemore. Yeah, that’s a downgrade for a team that is also incredibly thin and old"
"Kent ""Ray Allen"" Bazemore."
This sounds like Kent Bazemore talking about Steph Curry
Laker legend Kent Bazemore is back baby https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzLgYHxXt_k
Kent bazemore and Wayne Ellington? I’m getting ptsd from the dark years
kent bazemore to the lakers wow imma miss him :(
Kent bazemore was the deciding factor for you
"Yea I agree with this take but fucking idiots on the Ws sub (Im a Ws fan) thought we were one Kelly Oubre trade away from being a contender 🙄  We had fucking Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore and Michal Mulder playing clutch minutes in the 4th....   It’s hard to contend when 1/4 if your salary cap is injured for the season"
"Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Jeff Teague, Kent Bazemore, E'Twaun Moore, Mike Scott, Langston Galloway, Wes Matthews, Ben Mclemore...   Really not as hard as you're making it out to be to just grab some cheap guys to shoot open 3s"
"Nic Batum, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Rudy Gay, Wayne Ellington, JJ Reddick, Trevor Ariza, Carmelo Anthony, Kelly Olynik, Reggie Bullock, Jeff Green, Kent Bazemore, Georges Niang  Not saying all or even any are gettable for the Lakers, but... there are a lot of free agents out there who can shoot respectably."
"No, as a warriors' fan, they made the right moves tonight.  Kuminga and Moody was beyond a best case scenario.  I posted this in the warriors sub during the draft, but my big board prior to this draft was:  1) Cunningham  2) Green  3) Mobley  4) Suggs  5) Kuminga  6) Barnes  7) Giddey  8) Moody  You can't do better than getting two of the top eight players that I had at picks #7 and #14.    Do I think the warriors can win a title next year?  No, I don't, unless something completely unforeseen happens at the start of free agency.  What these two picks allow is for the warriors to move on from Kent Bazemore and from Mychal Mulder as regular rotation players.    Right now, you can divide the roster into the ""present"" and the ""future"".  That's part of the dual thread-the-needle team-building strategy they're employing.  The present is:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney  The future is:  Mannion, Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Wiseman  In the second half of last year, Poole took the jump, and he figures to slide in as the warriors sixth man this year, he's both the future AND very much going to help in the present.  Mannion is playing well in the Olympics, hoping for more development from him.  Wiseman should be a lot better in year two.    Now, besides these two parts of the roster, they have the ""rest"", which right now consists of:   JTA, Damion Lee, Eric Paschall  Paschall can be cut if need be, they'd have to swallow some money, but it's doable.  Ditto Damian Lee.  JTA is the only guy on this tier with significant financial guarantees, and also the best player.    What this means is the warriors have easy room to add at least two free agents next week, three if they can keep Nico Mannion on a two-way deal next season.  The draft is about your future, free agency is about addressing the roster holes you have in the present.    The dubs should go into free agency and see what they can get.  As time goes on, hopefully more and more of the future starts to contribute to the present.    The easiest way for an aging core to get back to title contention quickly is not to trade young players for a star, the easiest path back to the top is to do what the Spurs did: draft another star.  The cost controlled rookie scale contract, as opposed to the big money you'd have to pay an additional star, allow you to fill out your bench with depth.    The warriors won't be title contenders next year, but I think they'll make the moves in free agency to qualify for the playoffs as a top six seed in the west next year (and avoid the play-in tourney).  They can then build on that to take the next step to the top of the mountain again.    If there was a magic bullet trade that would make them title contenders now, they would have made that trade already.  That they haven't indicates there isn't such a trade to be had.  If no such trade exists, the best alternative is to accumulate assets for the point when a such trade does become available.    Kuminga and Moody are excellent assets for that trade, especially since to make such a big time trade will definitely require parting with Wiggins for salary matching reasons.  It would be awful nice to have players ready to step in if and when Wiggins gets dealt, wouldn't it?"
"We're just talking shooting and nothing else? There's a busload of guys available on the market who are good shooters who probably wouldn't be super expensive.  Carmelo, Ellington, Lou Will, Ennis, Jeff Green, maybe Redick would be willing to make a near-min deal, maybe Korver, E'Twaun Moore, Patty Mills, Rivers, JaMychal Green, Kent Bazemore, Korkmaz, Otto Porter, Temple, Terence Davis, and on and on.  Obviously these are all role players and certainly not the elite of the elite, but they're all guys who can give shooting/spacing on cheap deals."
"Very original choice...  I'll go with a single game. Warriors vs. Spurs, G1 of the 2nd round in 2013.  Warriors had not won in San Antonio since 1997. I believe 30 straight losses.  Up 16 with 4 minutes left, give up an 18-2 run to tie the game.  Game goes to 2OT. Clutch go-ahead layup by Kent Bazemore (only known for bench celebrations at that time) with 4 seconds.  Warriors leave Manu wide open and he makes the game winning 3.  Then the Warriors actually *do* win G2, so they break the curse. But they would have been up 2-0 and in the driver's seat for the series."
"""Somebody get Kent Bazemore a map"" is my personal favorite"
"In the worst-case scenario in which they have to use their picks they can get some really solid bench depth that they're hurting for.   Davion Mitchell at 7 seems solid, especially considering their bench PG is *checks notes* Nico Mannion.  At 14 I'd go for a roleplayer wing - Chris Duarte, Moses Moody or Trey Murphy.   PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole / Damion Lee   SF: Wiggins / #14 / Kent Bazemore  PF: Draymond / Juan Toscano  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid lineup in the West. Obviously it depends on the big 3 playing out of their minds to get deep into the playoffs but the talent is there."
It got to the point where Kent Bazemore was better at filling Oubre's role than Oubre was. And Kent Bazemore is an awful NBA player
Kent Bazemore
"Surely you don’t remember the last decade this team had. We had a fucking starting lineup of Kendall Marshall, Jodie Meeks, Kent Bazemore, Ryan Kelly, and Jordan Hull. The lakers post dwight and before bron were not a FA destination. Yes it’s LA, but you have to be good to be a FA destination as well"
'I don't recall marrying a bum. You really let Kent Bazemore outplay you tonight? For real? Eight turnovers?'
Bruh even Kent bazemore is getting vaccinated Wiggins must be a bozo
Wow I'm shocked they even convinced [Kent Bazemore to get vaccinated](https://twitter.com/MontePooleNBCS/status/1374875986521583616)
"When Klay went down, he straight up called a meeting and told his GM to go get him wings.  So we got Kent Bazemore and Kelly Oubre.  Do you think Bob Myers would have made those bad decisions?"
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"This tweet is basically speculating the possibility of Wiggins not getting the vaccine. In other words, this isn’t really new information outside of what *could* happen, because we haven’t been updated on Wiggins’ vaccination status.  But seeing how Kent Bazemore was the only one to get quarantined for Damion Lee’s COVID outbreak, it’s safer to assume that Wiggins got the vaccine."
"Calling him an average playmaker and average defender is a bit.  He is basically the same level of playmaker as a Kent Bazemore type, and statistically he is the worst defender on the Warriors.   Despite being on a good defensive team he has a -3.0 DRaptor (Lou Williams, DeMar DeRozan, DLo Russell territory), a -1.4 DBPM (same as CJ McCullom, Joe Harris).  He is a promising young player with potential to improve, but he isn’t average at playmaking or defence yet"
"AD is great. The linchpin  Bron is great but is going to pick his spots and might laze on some plays.  [Bazemore](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/8/6/22613809/lakers-officially-sign-kent-bazemore-free-agency-contract-took-less-money-win) is good on defense.  Dwight is situational.  [Trevor Ariza](https://allucanheat.com/2021/03/17/miami-heat-rumors-trevor-ariza-great/2/) might still be good at defense, despite a decline.  Nunn has [potential](https://allucanheat.com/2021/01/26/miami-heat-3-reasons-keep-kendrick-nunn/2/) on defense  Monk has his pluses and minuses  THT is weak on defense, DeAndre weak on rim protection, Westbrook inattentive, Mello has typically not been great, Rondo old and weak on defense  However, Vogel has been a defensive focused coach, and everyone right now seems to be team focused, rather than self-focused, so the Lakers have a chance to be good on defense. There's likely going o be a lot of ""next man up"" as Vogel has a tendency to try different looks in the regular season and a lot of these guys are not 30 mpg players"
As ridiculous as it sounds kerr just doesn't like people taking 3pt shots.  Hr comes from an era where Shooters still primarily took midrange Js. And he berates players who aren't steph or Klay (or KD) for taking 3s. You can see this in the game against OKC the dubs had in 2016. Where draymond takes a 3 and misses in the timeout kerr is yelling at draymond for taking 3s. After this game draymond ends up finishing the season shooting 33% from 3.  Another example of this. Is the warriors role players. When we signed swaggy P and Omri Casspi we signed them as specialist Shooters but towards the end of their seasons with us they started passing up open 3s basically meaning they no longer had a role.  Id also say kerr gives players a lot of slack in regards to midrange jump shots. Kent Bazemore posted up and took turnaround fade away 2s all the time for us. And if kerr wanted players to take 3s and not 2s he'd have yanked bazemore the possession after he did it.
Kent Bazemore at 75m + is just mind blowing.   The money in sports is absolutely wild.
"Totally. It’s like, first Kent Bazemore, now James Ennis? Might as well hand over the Larry Obrien Trophy right now and call it a season."
Lakers are really giving DeAndre Jordan and Kent Bazemore larger roles...

We have Kent Bazemore now (who famously dropped 26 points on the Heat this year) we are unstoppable
"Here's every off-season signing by the Lakers this summer:  1. Carmelo Anthony - vet minimum  2. Kent Bazemore - vet minimum  3. Talen Horton-Tucker - 3 years $30 million  4. Malik Monk - vet minimum  5. Kendrick Nunn - 2 years $10 million  6. Trevor Ariza - vet minimum  7. Wayne Ellington - vet minimum  8. Dwight Howard - vet minimum  9. Rajon Rondo - vet minimum  10. DeAndre Jordan - vet minimum  Since you say 90% of them were bad signings, which is the only one you think was defensible?"
"Yeah, I think this is also a bad take. Having watched both of them almost every game they've played, I would probably rather have Simmons as a defender than Thybulle but it's close enough that I get the argument on the other side. Thybulle just does things [nobody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWozzO5VALs&amp;t=77s) in the league does, here are the stats to prove it:      4th among guards in [steals](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=STL&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=GP*GE*50&amp;PlayerPosition=G), highest in steals per minute      Lead all guards in [blocks](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=BLK&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=GP*GE*50&amp;PlayerPosition=G) despite playing fewer minutes per game than all of them down to Kent Bazemore, who has less than half the BPG numbers Thybulle has      Easily leads the league in [blocked jump shots](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1392881065447104516)      7th in the NBA in [deflections](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle/?sort=DEFLECTIONS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=G*GE*50), highest in deflections per minute      He leads the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=G*GE*50&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)      One of [seven players](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=STL*GE*1:BLK*GE*1:GP*GE*50) in the league to average at least one steal and one block per game, the other players are pretty big, averaging out to 6'9.5"", Thybulle is 6'5"""
I like how you said viable options and then mentioned Kent Bazemore as one of them lol
Kent Bazemore. He will fall for every single pump fake. Every time.
Kent bazemore warriors celebrations were top tier
"I know all the reasons why the Warriors wouldn't be (and aren't) expected to contend for the NBA title. I know how their roster and salary cap situation differs from their 14/15 through 18/19 teams. And I know Klay's future is unknown.  But it is silly to say, *unequivocally*, that the Steph-Dray-Klay trio cannot contend for a title anymore. All they've done together in their primes is contend for titles and Steph and Dray are quite clearly still in their primes.  They finished three games behind the Mavs, Blazers and Lakers last season without Klay; they also went 15-5 down the stretch with Kent Bazemore starting and playing 30 minutes a night.  We don't know they can't contend because we've only seen them contend together since 14/15."
For talking basketball like an idiot.   Talking about how Bazemore is bad at contested 3s when the guy said all he’ll shoot is open 3s  talking about how Dwight shouldn’t be shooting 3s when the dude was clearly talking about his overall play  For saying Russ doesn’t get shooters open   for saying Bazemore doesn’t have to goat shooter to get him open looks when Lebron James is probably the best player in history at getting teammates open 3s…  For even acting like Kent Bazemore matters on this Laker team…
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."
"“Non hoopers” like Kobe, Gilbert Arenas, and Jameer Neldon who both suggested that wasn’t the ideal attitude to have? Or Zack Lavine who said he understood both sides of the debate?  I know KD and Trae said they agreed with Booker I’m sure there were others I’m not seeing now (Kent bazemore was one I think). But saying it was “most real hoopers” feels like a massive overstatement."
Kent bazemore
"\&gt; If they switched teams last year the Warriors are easily in the playoffs.  I think it close between the two, but this is very questionable. People act like Harden has been playing with bums all his life and its nonsense to anyone watching basketball. Harden long played in a run and gun system built for him with really good roleplayers that fit the system. Yes, Curry until recently has had better supporting casts overall, but that's not the focus here.  There's no way you're convincing me Harden would 'easily' have made the playoffs in the western conference with Wiggins as his 2nd option and Kent Bazemore + Looney in the starting lineup. Most of all, the Warriors had essentially no depth at all. Seriously, people way overlook this. They had Poole, Mulder, and Juan Tascano-Anderson playing heavy minutes. In fact they were the only guys on rotation in the play-ins in which Curry led them to a 3pt game against the Lakers with LeBron and AD both playing.  People also act like Curry's only ability is 3pt shooting. The irony being Curry is one of the most efficient guard finishers in the league for a while now. He's top tier from basically every distance."
"Ah yes, those 23 games of Kent Bazemore. Laker legend."
"They are not the best  choices I would choose but reality most like these guys will guard them   &amp;#x200B;  Trevor Ariza, Kent Bazemore, Kendrick Nunn, Malik Monk, BRON , RUSS"
"the chance is that he most likely already got vaccinated. In the quote, he doesn't say that he is against the vaccine, more like he wouldn't go out of his way to get it unless needed. He played in Canada for the Olympic qualifiers without any problems about the vaccine arising. Late during last season, Damian Lee got the virus while fully vaccinated and Kent Bazemore, noted anti vaccine, needed to quarantine. Wiggins, who was also in close contact, didn't need to. League Rules at the time were that if you were vaccinated and came into close contact with another vaccinated person who had the virus, you didn't need to quarintine."
"That's a PPP of 0.5, which is on par with a Kent Bazemore iso (also 0.5 PPP last season). Let's just say no team is shuddering at the sight of a Kent Bazemore iso."
Bye Kent Bazemore. You won’t be missed.
Kent bazemore?
"Instead of MYCHAL MULDER, KENT BAZEMORE, DAMION LEE, KELLY OUBRE JR., ERIC PASCHAL, brad wannamaker, the Warriors will have KLAY FRICKIN THOMPSON taking the open shot .... Teams will have to keep an eye on Curry for 30+ minutes every night, running around screens whilst Klay will probably be setting those screens. Klay is more than a shooter and knows the Warriors ball movement and knows to pass it for a better shot. However, what's better than a Klay Thompson top of the 3 point line ball screen for Curry to pass the ball to Klay to shoot a couple feet behind the line? Or could give and go to Curry for the easy 3 or drive to the basket, only to open up an open shooter.  Too many possibilities with just Klay on the court with Curry. There's a reason why they were so dominant, those 2 are probably the best 1 2 offensive punch in NBA history. Klay won't need to sprint every minute he's on the court, I expect him to play smart since he's one of the smartest players on the team."
"Ah yes, Rondo will be able to take young players, such as Kent Bazemore and Wesley Matthews under his wing."
"No one calling the Lakers old is saying they're old cause of their big 3 average age, lol.  It's the fact they signed...  Melo who is 37.  Trevor Ariza who is 36.  Marc Gasol who is 35.  Dwight who is 35.  Wayne Ellington who is 33.   Kent Bazemore who is 32.   LeBron who is 36.   Westbrook who is 32."
"Curry was +4 and scored 4 more points on 1 less shot. Morant was -1.  Curry was doing this while getting trapped because he was playing alongside Wiggins (Averaged 19 pts), Green (Averaged 7 pts), Looney (Averaged 4 pts) and Kent Bazemore (Averaged 7 pts). Meanwhile, Warriors had to guard Dillon Brooks (Averaged 17 pts), Valanciunas (Averaged 17 pts), Jackson Jr. (Averaged 14 pts) and Kyle Anderson (Averaged 12 pts)."
"This was a classic game. Warriors gave up a big lead in the 4th, went to double OT. A rookie Kent Bazemore made a transition basket with just couple of seconds left for the lead and then Ginobili hit a 3 at the buzzer to win it.  Pop after the series said the game plan was to keep Curry under 40 ppg.  Reporters laughed but deadpan he said he wasn't joking."
Kelly Oubre all day! Sprinkle in some Kent bazemore and you got a stew going
"The lakers were already thin last season, and then they traded their remaining depth for Russ and let Caruso walk. They had to fill out like 10 roster spots with minimum players, and while some of those guys were good for a minimum, they're still bench guys at best. The lakers need THT and Kendrick Nunn to come back and play great, because you cannot win a championship starting Kent Bazemore and Deandre Jordan."
Kent Bazemore
"&gt;Dude, the 15 win team the year prior is meaningless. It wasn't the same team. Tons of different pieces, Draymond didn't give two shits, etc.     Wasn't the same team? Can you respond to what I'm saying? Which of Brad Wanamaker, Kent Bazemore and Kelly Oubre turns that 15 win team into above 20 wins?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And what do you mean why? Looking at on/off in context matters. Especially since no one's is more inflated than Curry's generally speaking, since you guys don't stagger your stars at all. Aka, Curry's on/off is always Curry + Draymond on vs neither Curry nor Dray     1) That literally just further illustrates Currys impact  2) Why do you think we don't stagger? Because Dray is borderline unplayable without Curry. Eye test absolutely confirms it, just watch the games."
"&gt;In the first 41 games prior to Steph's tailbone injury, they played 657 minutes without Steph and were -5.9 as compared to +2.0 with him   &gt;   &gt;Steph then missed 6 games and in the 317 minutes without him, they were -15.7   &gt;   &gt;They were then +4.4 in the remaining 335 minutes without him   &gt;   &gt;AKA, literally 25% of the minutes without Steph came in just a 6 game stretch and it paints a massively different picture than do the minutes without him when they actually played  Why?   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Notice how you haven't actually responded to the main point, which was me countering your hypothetical by showing that Steph had the Warriors, a 15 win team the season prior, on a 60 win pace. Oubre was a net negative, Wiseman was a net negative and Wanamaker was a net negative. Is your argument that Kent Bazemore is the reason the Warriors go from 15 to above 20 wins? Nah man, that's Steph lmao."
"&gt;His on/off stats also got inflated by the stretch he missed. In the actual games he played, they weren't nearly as impressive. Turns out playing without your star against other starters tends to be bad. Who knew?  Do... Do you know what on/off is????? That's literally the point of on/off. That isn't inflation, that is LITERALLY ON/OFF. You cannot dilly dally around Steph's insane impact being above Dames.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The Blazers without Dame would be a sub 30 win team too lol  Notice how you haven't actually responded to the main point, which was me countering your hypothetical by showing that Steph had the Warriors, a 15 win team the season prior, on a 60 win pace. Oubre was a net negative, Wiseman was a net negative and Wanamaker was a net negative. Is your argument that Kent Bazemore is the reason the Warriors go from 15 to above 20 wins? Nah man, that's Steph lmao."
KENT BAZEMORE
"Through 3 games, I believe Ariza would have been maybe 2x better than Kent Bazemore. Kent Bazemore's defense has been dog shit."
"Okay but are they better than Kent Bazemore? If it's a yes, then they are difference makers."
"Anytime a team has to start Kent Bazemore they’re suffering a great loss somewhere, lol"
The hawks and whatever team the goat kent bazemore plays for
"Big Ja Morant fan too  Jerami Grant (prob my favorite)  De’Aaron Fox  Larry Nance Jr  SGA  John Collins  Kent Bazemore   Luka is fun, but I don’t actively root for him  Edit: formatting. Also, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for Tony Snell"
Fr. Knew Beal wasn't good when he got pressed about Kent Bazemore last year 😂
Some dude tried arguing with me recently that it was more exciting watching a player risk the extra foul (and see them have to balance the very unlikely chance they'll foul out) than a potentially highlight transition play   Imagine thinking Kent Bazemore fouling to stop a transition play is more exciting than a LeBron dunk or Steph Curry transition 3
"Wow, the more you look at the Lakers' boxscore, the less you like their chances.  DeAndre Jordan and Kent Bazemore starting? Austin Reeves with 18 minutes and Rondo with the DNP? Carmelo Anthony the 6th man? Anxiously awaiting Kendrick Nunn's return from injury?"
"Laker fans, we warned you about Kent Bazemore"
Kent Bazemore you lucky bastard
Kent Bazemore is somewhere out there feeling grateful that he won’t get traded
that’s the kent bazemore i know
Kent Bazemore is fried and barely an NBA player
What is kent Bazemore hair
Why is Kent Bazemore in and Austin Reeves out
"Put Ja on Kent Bazemore, dont need to have him on Westbrook and make it easy for LeBron to put him in every pick and roll and make RW a natural short roll man"
"Nunn and THT are going to take minutes from Kent Bazemore, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, and Malik Monk.  Nothing to see here."
Kent Bazemore walking away all disappointed from the whole scrum lol
At the end of the day its still the GMs job to do the trades and signings. Signing DeAndre jordan and starting him isn't a good idea. Having Kent Bazemore start is a horrendous idea. That's why I'm putting the blame on the GM
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
Starting kent bazemore isn how you get a lottery pick (yes injuries i know)
"People only think the Lakers are a super team because they think of the players as the version of them that were in their prime... If you watched Westbrook on the Rockets two seasons ago you would've known he's washed and makes boneheaded decisions. Carmelo was washed but had 1 good season last year, Street Clothes is great but gets hurt too much. Even Lebron is getting too old to be able to carry this team. Kent Bazemore wasn't good on the Warriors last year too..."
you have Malik Monk right fucking there and you’re running premier Kent Bazemore minutes?
"As a Warriors fan, I'll submit a few:  [Blake Griffin hits the side of the backboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLMQ3-MqDA0) (thus beginning the legend of Kent Bazemore)  [Adonal Foyle misses the backboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkoNgq-O3R4) (Jim Barnett has to explain why it's not so bad)  [Nick Young guaranteed 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG_wClmLUh8)"
They had Kent Bazemore playing major minutes sort of like this years Lakers? 🧐 just playing
I’m always down for Kent Bazemore hate.
Alright man. James Harden faked injuries to be traded. AD did. Kawhi exaggerated a real one for months longer than he needed to. That’s just the last five years. It’s 1. not a battle and shouldn’t be framed as such and 2. not about who wins. There is currently no winner. Ben is losing money and while if traded he might get it back there isn’t really an indication he’s going to be traded. You’ve said just a whole bunch of dumb stuff. Kent Bazemore and a second rounder doesn’t fit the salary requirements for a trade. There is no chance Ben wins an appeal. There’s no chance Ben is traded by Friday. I don’t know man. Clearly you’ve just started following the NBA. I’ve got better things to do than argue with a middle schooler on the internet.
"Lmao he literally got fined today dog. He knows the line? This dude has shown no self awareness whatsoever. The Sixers have no incentive to trade him for Kent Bazemore and a second rounder - so they won’t. You’re out here calling me delusional and you’re just making stuff up. If Simmons had any idea where any sort of line was he would have reported for training camp and have been nursing a “back injury” since day 2. And again, he literally paid a fine today. “He’s not getting fined anymore” is objectively wrong."
No I’m not. He’s not getting fined anymore he knows the line and he’s making the sixers pay big time. They about to get Kent bazemore and a 2nd rd pick
He’s not wrong. No way do they let Lebron go off ball. And the issue is they need shooters due to Lebron and AD. I’m not kidding when I say I’d rather have Kent Bazemore starting over Russ alongside AD and Bron.
He was outplayed by Kent Bazemore sadly
Avery Bradley and Kent Bazemore both former Warriors came to play.
They really let **Kent Bazemore** take and keep rondos number lmaooo so disrespectful
Lebron having to take contested 30 footers or else Kent bazemore is the one taking the clutch time shots for this team??? This squad getting washed
I like it when buckets are scored on Kent Bazemore
"Lmfao the lakers have Kent bazemore?  Didnt realize that, They’re a shitshow"
Kent bazemore with elite defense on curry. Amazing stuff
Kent Bazemore love
"Curry is shooting 9 times out of 10 when he sees slow ass DeAndre coming up to blitz him. The right strategy for the Lakers would be to not play DeAndre at all, dude is completely washed and shouldn’t be playing lineups where Kent Bazemore is the best shooter."
"I can't believe Kent Bazemore still starts in this league, i thought his career was over after The Big Day."
"when kent bazemore is your best 3pt shooter on the court , you may have a problem with spacing"
When Kent Bazemore is your only shooter &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
I've always liked Bazemore his names Kent fir good essay sake
Kenny Anderson  Kenny Smith  Kenneth Faried  Kentavious Caldwell Pope  Kendall Marshall  Kenyon Martin  Kent Bazemore  Kendrick Nunn  Kendrick Perkins
Easy  PG: Falco Campazzo SG: Kent Bazemore SF: Evan Fournier PF: PJ Tucker C: Bizmack Byambo   Oh you said best?
As far as kent bazemore takes them
"&gt;And you lost 4  Only ones that played any significant time were Caruso and KCP. The other guys you mentioned production is replaced with Nunn and Ariza.   &gt;Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol  Are we acting like Wayne Ellington and Melo aren't shooters now?"
"And you lost 4. Plus McLemore and Wesley Matthews who can both shoot.   Also those 4 40% shooters are Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, Malik monk, and a Wayne Ellington lol"
They don’t have spacing or shooting.  That doesn’t just change cause of chemistry.  Relying on Kent Bazemore and Carmelo to hit 3’s consistently won’t bode well for the lakers…like at all
"He had shooters, now he has Kent Bazemore."
"This Lakers team will have a hard time shooting the ball.  If Kent Bazemore is one of your good three point shooters, there’s going to be a problem"
1 legend named Kent Bazemore.
"I met Kent Bazemore and his family when I worked at the Norfolk yacht and country club, his parents were members at the time. He seemed really nice."
"1-5 injury prone, andrew wiggins injury flopping, who is kent bazemore again?"
Is this roster better tho? More top heavy for sure but Danny Green is a huge upgrade over Kent Bazemore
"I agree.  Part of jordans coolness was the long shorts.  He changed the fasion of the league.  That and the shoes.  The leader in shoes the last decade has been lebron.  I don’t know who is responsible for bringing back short shorts.  First I remember is kent bazemore.  Now rugrats shorts are popular, maybe thats tyler herro, idk."
"Kent Bazemore is pretty high in that list, for me. A mix of dumb as fuck + asshole."
"I don’t know if I “100%” believe it, but the [Kent Bazemore alleged Burner](https://twitter.com/kennethbanks26?s=21). It could just be a troll but it’s just so niche and mild, that I almost have to believe that it is Kent Bazemore"
Kent Bazemore is gonna play the 4th most minutes on this team
"poole will be starting until klay is up to starting again.  but THT apparently is the second option for SG _and_ SF, behind wayne ellington and kent bazemore.  i feel like he should have a lot of opportunities to steal a starting spot.  there's a reason they gave him a real mid-level contract and (i'm not familiar with ellington but) bazemore would be a min even if he weren't on the lakers."
Steph was taking notes as an understudy to Kent Bazemore all those years
So alternate universe Steph is just Kent Bazemore
Kent Bazemore leading the Lakers in scoring lol
"The Lakers are starting DeAndre Jordan, LeBron James, Kent Bazemore, Malik Monk and Russell Westbrook.  Should be fun."
"Yeah, that was the year our starting frontcourt was basically injured the entire season. Also the year of our bench being Mario Hezonja, Kent Bazemore and Anthony Tolliver. Dame basically willed us to the 8th seed in the bubble."
"Probably, I remember Kent bazemore talking about how he had to completely rebuild his jump shot after college when he got into the league. He said the hardest part was the mental exhaustion he faced. Not just having to discard the muscle memory of his previous jump shot, but the continuous failure he faced (he missed a lot of shots when starting off) for very slow incremental progress. I’d have to imagine it’s something similar with Ben simmons."
"He might’ve been joking, but his anti-vaxx friend Kent Bazemore definitely wasn’t."
Yeah pre-season games are usually just a chance for the team to get a look at some of their younger guys like Kent Bazemore and Russel Westbrook.
"Just looked at the box score of that game  Why the fuck did Kent Bazemore have 12 FGA lmao, he went 4/12 with 10 points  Also Wiggins with his trademark 22 points on 22 shots"
"Wiggins Kyrie Beal and MPJ held out for as long as they could because their contracts are so big and three are great, almost irreplaceable players. People like Kent Bazemore had to (gasp) get vaccinated against their wishes because his ass can be cut if he's still a headcase about it."
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
"Yeah Kent Bazemore already said that he got it but only because he felt pretty much forced to do so. Which I don't have a ton of sympathy for. Like dude you're Kent Bazemore, the Lakers don't really need you, so either get your check or don't"
Kent Bazemore also said he thinks he's a starter so I guess Bazemore isn't always right
Everyone stares at Kent Bazemore
"""You know your Kent Bazemore right"" - Rob Pelinka"
Kent Bazemore talks like someone who does know that they are only Kent Bazemore
Kent Bazemore said he wasn’t planning on getting the vaccine ever whilst on the warriors. Looks like the lakers convinced him to change his ways.
"- LeBrOptimus 6th Prime James,  - Carmelo Anthony,  - Wayne Ellington,  - Kent Bazemore, - Trevor Ariza,  - Malik Monk,  - Talen Horton-Tucker,   Lakers wing depth those wondering."
Brad Beal is so dumb bro. Mans really went to First Take to go cry about Kent Bazemore of all people
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
Shaun Livingston/Jamal Crawford  E’twaun Moore  Kelly Oubre/Kent Bazemore  Corey Maggette  Andrew Bogut
Add Kent Bazemore to the list.
"People already went by that logic when Trae was playing with guys like Alex Len, Damian Jones, Kent Bazemore, Jabari Parker etc.   I think Luka will be fine though."
As long as they make room for Kent Bazemore clutch minutes
"""KB"" is Kent Bazemore, for anyone else who doesn't recognize 9th men by their initials."
the kent bazemore that isnt getting minutes on the lakers was a STARTER for steph last year. think about that
With Kent Bazemore as his Robin
Fuck Kent Bazemore.
"To the Lakers for Wayne Ellington, Malik monk, Kent Bazemore, and a 2035 protected 3rd rounder."
Rookie Kent Bazemore vibes
"There have been 4 players in the rotation that might not play at all on 20 other teams, including 2 starting (DJ, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington) The NBA is a star centric league but it doesn't mean the other guys aren't important, especially on the defensive side. What makes matters worse is that the team in general just doesn't really fit together, the lack of complimentary pieces means no one is really in their ideal role. Even LeBron and AD have to play outside of themselves to make up for the teams deficiencies"
"Besides the obvious problems (DJ is complete ass, Russ is a terrible fit with this roster, Melo and Monk can't defend anyone in the league) they have other big-time issues.  Avery Bradley, Rondo, Kent Bazemore, and Wayne Ellington have played a ton of minutes and all of them look totally cooked.  LeBron looks older than he ever has. AD looks disinterested for stretches. THT looks overmatched in his role more often than not.   This is not a roster that's going to win 4 playoff series. And I have no idea how to fix it."
"That's why Kelly Oubre Jr, Brad Wanamaker, Kent Bazemore, Mychel Mulder and Eric Paschall are all still with the team and doing well right?"
Kent Bazemore… good thing he benched now
Kent Bazemore
"Personally I wish we could have kept him, how could you not want the sexiest man in the nba and also in human history on your team? He also had a few amazing stretches for the Warriors last year, rebounding, scoring, shooting well all while playing great defense. Curious if that's essentially what Charlotte has gotten out of him?  As for why we actually sucked last year, Oubre also had stretches of being a turnover and missed FG machine and a awful three point shooter (Defense was consistently good). Wanamaker couldn't shoot or playmake and his defense would have been mediocre on any team that didn't have a much worse defensively and offensively Jordan Poole, mychal mulder, and nico mannion as the defensive alternative backup guards. Kent Bazemore honestly had some crazy hustle on both ends and shot 40% from three in golden state but he fouled a ton, as did Wiseman.   Oubre definitely was not the problem with the Warriors season."
Kent Bazemore and DeAndre Jordan
"“Malik Monk, Kendrick Nunn, Wayne Ellington, Carmelo Anthony, Kent Bazemore, Trevor Ariza, THT and Dwight Howard combined for 28 points tonight against the Knicks. Evan Fournier scored 26 points tonight against the Lakers.”"
"Damien Lee got significantly better in not turning it over and shooting better when it counts, he’s also just playing smarter.  We got rid of Kent Bazemore, who shot ok last year but was this fouling machine and made stupid stupid decisions.   We have Otto Porter, a legitimate guy who gets rebounds and shoots, and Bjelica who is perfect in this system and helps move the ball.  Gary Payton, who only played maybe 10 games for us last year in limited limited minutes - has a much bigger role this year and is a legitimate gamechanger in terms of second team defense and moving the ball.   Iggy is playing out of his mind for his age, like really solid.  Overall our bench was totally revamped with really solid players, which means Steph doesn’t have to play 36 minutes+ a game most of the time, and the minutes without him aren’t some terrible time where Brad Wanamaker shoots 2/7 and passes to Mychael Mulder for another missed 3."
Josh Hart is the very definition of role-player. He’s this generation’s Kent Bazemore.
"Not so worried. Last year the Warriors were starting Kent Bazemore and Juan Toscano in the play-in games. No offense to those guys--they play hard and are good enough to be in the NBA, but neither should really start critical games. This year, Kerr didn't read the game situation and stuck to an obsolete rotation. The Warriors also played poorly across the board. Would not be surprised of we don't lose to them again this season."
"These comparisons are hard because defense is much, much harder today.   At the end of his career, you started seeing the strong-side overload defense (which Thibs really pioneered as an assistant in Boston), but before that, KG just played straight-up man defense or was the weakside rim protector. Even the strong-side overload can be pretty straightforward compared to what modern teams throw out there.  KG also didn't have to spend whole games covering from the 3-pt line to the 3-pt line. Now, I think young KG would have been able to do that just fine, because he was so mobile, but he never had to. KG's clearly a better athlete.   The thing that there's really no comparison for, though, is the complexity of stuff that Draymond does on defense. Pre switching, captaining the defense, orchestrating the team defense to stop plays before they start, etc. I think there's a strong case to be made that Draymond is the *smartest* defender the league has ever seen, and he's smart in a way that we just really haven't seen before. He's transformational. Draymond was the key to a switching defense that terrorized the league - using switching as a weapon to attack the offense, rather than reactively. As much as KG was great, did you really want him switched on to zippy little point guards?   I believe that Draymond belongs on the short list of the greatest defenders in the history of the league - and that's not something you usually hear said of KG.   And look, before the advent of modern defensive stats (which are still often quite inadequate) the simple truth is that nobody in the media was really any good at talking about defense. You got all-defense votes from scoring a lot (yes, scoring, see Dave Berry's ""The Wages of Wins"") and from emphatic blocks and highlight plays. KG did very well by those metrics which *probably* means he was somewhat over-rated defensively during much of that time.  It's also worth pointing out that the vast majority of his defenses in Minnesota were average, none of them were particularly good. Never better than 10th and on a few occasions worse than 20th.   Yes, he was on a great defensive team in Boston, but that was a team that had solid defenders up and down the roster including generally-recognized as great defenders in Rondo and Tony Allen, as well as Kendrick Perkins (very very good before injuries slowed him down), Paul Pierce (one of those frustrating guys who seemed like he should be bad at defense but actually wasn't), and, more importantly, unleashed a revolutionary defensive scheme that took the league completely by surprise. Thib's strong-side overload defense just completely bamboozled teams, as the dominant offensive ethos of the era was ""clear out and let your best guy go to work one-on-one"" which the overload rendered ineffective. Even a year or two later, teams just flat-out had more tools and understanding about how to attack it.  Meanwhile, Draymond led the scrap head of the 2021 Warriors to a top-five defense on a team that gave major minutes to guys like Kelly Oubre (who otherwise has generally otherwise only been a part of bottom-10 defenses), James Wiseman (who was completely lost on defense all year), Kent Bazemore (currently scrapping for minutes on a team that has significant injuries and DESPERATELY needs wing defense).  And, look, we all have to be humble about this. But none of the people posting that KG was clearly better, I'm betting, broke down game film during his prime. (The kind of video analysis we all now take for granted was simply flat-out unavailable!). But I've got to say, given that, the number of people who are so confident that KG was better ... how much are you going on highlights and reputation?   Can I see a show of hands from people who actually watched more than 10 complete games at the time from his years in Minnesota?"
"I hate when people say this stuff without any stats to back up.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2022.html  8/11 of your top 11 minute getters this year were on the team last year, and you’re missing Wiseman still otherwise presumably 9/11 top minutes would’ve been on the team playing last year. The differences are you swapped Kent Bazemore (40% 3p shooter for you), who is apparently so bad he’s gotten starting minutes at times this year with another Western conference contender, with 38 yr old Iguadola. And you’ve swapped Oubre for Otto Porter and added Bjelica. So you gonna convince me Porter and Bjelica are the real needle movers?"
"Brad Wanamaker played so many games, they relied heavily on smelly poubre, kent bazemore played soo many minutes, Nico manion, mychal mulder, Eric paschall, honestly wtf are you talking about lol? This is a completely different team"
"Steph basically rock lee’d last season: one leg carrying oubre, one leg wiseman, one arm wannamaker, one arm Kent bazemore.  Now that shackles are gone 😂"
We all know that only LeGoat would beat Kent Bazemore   /s
Goodbye Kent Bazemore
By 25 because Kelly Oubre and Kent Bazemore keep getting the ball
"I pray Thanasis gets minutes. Not because he's special, but because he knows he's incapable of scoring outside the rim and only tries to dunk.  I'd take that over Semi trying to out-brick Kent Bazemore every night"
This situation would be exactly equally bad if the roles were reversed.     Kent Bazemore breaking LeBron's neck on the floor would be exactly as bad as LeBron breaking Bazemore's neck.
"I see your Kent Bazemore and I raise you Garry Harris who must have just not played enough games due to being out early in the season to qualify for those rankings lists.   3.2 PER  \-6.0 Offensive BPM  \-9.3 BPM  \-0.075 WS/48 (yes its negative)  Averaging 5 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in 21.8 minutes per game on 40.1% true shooting %  Garry Harris in my eyes is the worst player in the NBA right now."
There’s less than 500 people on the planet who can play NBA basketball at any one time and I can’t believe Kent Bazemore is one of them.
That's because Kent Bazemore is one of the dumbest players to reach the NBA
that’s tank commander Kent bazemore to you.
Kent Bazemore and Semi Ojeleye were throwing up shots just to see who could miss more tonight.
I hate Kent bazemore too
Mike Breen: “... and covering Giannis for the Lakers will be Kent Bazemore!”
Trading for Westbrook and signing Kent bazemore was bad enough... Fuck this
Nets need to trade for a 3&amp;D player like Kent Bazemore
"Yeah the roster just isn't working with the current rotations. Avery Bradley and Kent bazemore just don't fit into any line-up well in my opinion. Deandre is lacklustre and we don't know if Dwight can do anything meaningful yet.  They would benefit greatly from a proper 6man and staggered rosters, I could easily see Westbrook come off the bench and take that role."
Kent Bazemore
"I consider them a lock to make it if healthy, but not to win it all. They haven't shown any chemistry yet and Kent Bazemore and DeAndre Jordan play entirely too many minutes."
"This is true. a lot of Warriors fans didn’t appreciate the Steph betrayal. Bob Myers actually put a two-year offer on the table for Kent, who was Curry’s loudest fan last season, but he took less money to play with the Lakers on a one-year deal.  Another wrinkle to this, free agency became a mini panic for Dubs fans, as wishlist players even mentioned by local sports reporters were being signed elsewhere. Shams and Woj Tweets announcing our supposed Plan B and C tier free agents signing with other teams, then the news comes that Bazemore signed with the Lakers. A combination of the two set fans off.   Of course, when Bjelica and OPJ were eventually signed, and discussions went back to what Baze provided on the court (great corner threes and energy on defense, but attributed to our overall lower than ideal IQ with poorly timed hero ball and awful fouling), things calmed down a little bit."
The idea of Kent Bazemore is better than the actual Kent Bazemore
The idea of Kent Bazemore is better than the actual Kent Bazemore
"What does this have to do with being a homer? I'm just saying that he deserves to be in the league and shouldn't be benched for worse players like Avery Bradley. I agree that building a roster where the only perimeter defenders are Kent Bazemore and 36-year old Trevor Ariza coming off ankle surgery is asinine. Having to do that because you traded for 33-year old Russell Westbrook and cheaped out on luxury tax as the Lakers is even more asinine.  I'm always ready to shit on Rob Pelinka who I've considered a bottom 5 GM basically since he was hired or the Lakers ownership who tried to make Caruso feel bad for wanting what he's worth.   What I have an issue with is people underrating players who have memeable lowlights. Baze is a solid rotation player and a good defender despite a high foul rate for a perimeter player.   As far as Buddy is concerned, I don't really think that would've been a panacea. He's a high volume average efficiency scorer who is awful defensively. Not sure he'd be able to close games in the conference finals. Trading Kuzma+Harrell+pick for him would've been solid and kept KCP and Caruso but I would've liked to target someone with more two-way ability."
I’m pretty sure it was LeSeducer that lured Kent Bazemore away from Steph
Kent Bazemore has to be the worst player getting consistent rotation minutes in the NBA. Mans is stinky tier on both ends of the court
"Ah, Kent bazemore, 3 minutes, 4 fouls."
Kent Bazemore is the single dumbest player I’ve ever seen. I feel bad or lakers fans this dude was painful to watch last year
Kent bazemore is so bad
I am so glad I never have to watch Kent Bazemore play for my team
"Former Hawks:  PG: Dennis Schroeder  SG: Tim Hardaway Jr.  SF: Paul Millsap  PF: Mike Muscala  C: Al Horford  Bench: Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, DeAndre Bembry, Taurean Prince, Dwight Howard, Dewayne Dedmon  Thank goodness for Trae."
"OK guys, we need to swing the ball side to side. The man in the corner is going to be Baze. Do not get the ball to the man in the corner. If Kent Bazemore misses a shot tonight, whoever passes him the ball is off the team."
"He reinvented his career as a small-ball 5 and I'm glad to see it.   I remember a great quote from somewhere on Reddit a few years ago, ""The idea of Jeff Green is better than the actual Jeff Green.""  Now you can swap that with Kent Bazemore instead."
"I got dog piled yesterday for saying that people claiming ""the lakers won't make the playoffs "" are dumb. It's almost like having most of ur role players out and playing kent bazemore isn't good basketball. 4-4 without lebron agianst decent teams and would be second seed if they didn't shit the bed on okc. Y'all so weird for the lakers hate it's delusional"
"Well, we did offer him more money, but he saw Lakers as more of a contender plus he was promised a bigger role. At that point, what else is there to say?     https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-kent-bazemore-takes-less-money-join-lakers-over-warriors"
"Adam Silver: “Due to the Lakers tampering to sign Kent Bazemore away from Golden State, the Lakers must pay an additional 5 years of Luol Deng’s contract. The Warriors will be given an additional $50mil in cap space as an apology for this tragedy. Magic Johnson has been fined $100k for tampering.”"
"That is true! Vogel confirmed this too:  &gt; Frank says that it was THT returning and how good Malik Monk and Wayne Ellington are playing that knocked Kent Bazemore out of the rotation.  &gt; Frank told @jovanbuha that Kent Bazemore will still be ""a big part of what we do.""  https://twitter.com/hmfaigen/status/1460020165777637376"
[reminded me of this gem from the offseason](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/owt7cy/amick_when_faced_with_the_prospect_of_losing_alex/h7ifjjl/)  &gt;The Lakers swap in Kent Bazemore on a Ring-Chaser Special deal for Caruso who’s leaving on a $37M deal and these same folks call it a bad move.  &gt;They both play solid defense. There’s not really much of a difference between the two aside from Kent’s got a better shooting resume and has played heavier minutes in the past.
trade kent bazemore for jason pls...
Dwight is just a 7’0 Kent Bazemore
"Surprised Kent Bazemore was positive.  From the games I watched him play last year, he was pure trash 😂"
Nobody including me ever watched him play. We just think oh kent baZemore I know him hes a solid role player isn't he?
Ive watched a few Lakers games this season. Still blows my mind how Kent Bazemore is still starting while playing as bad as he is.
"They thought Kent Bazemore can replace his defense, what an idiots"
Why are people saying the lakers are a play in team when they are 7th in the west without Lebron and starting Kent bazemore lol
Kent Bazemore in shambles.......
These clowns let go of KCP and Caruso just so they could start Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore lmao
He started Kent Bazemore like 20 games man Steph curry did not get enough credit with the way he dragged that Fucking team to a 8 seed before the play ins started.
"Kat was deadly today, played really well against AD. Without Lebron the Lakers are just not the same, Westbrook/AD combo might not be enough to carry them to a decent playoff seed. Kent Bazemore is invisible, reminds me of JR Smith last years in Cleveland but with even less production."
5th in defense while giving big minutes to Kent fucking Bazemore.
"In the last few years Rondo was :  \- disastrous for 2 regular season with the Lakers  \- great for 2,5 playoffs series  \- disastrous for half a season with the Hawks  \- decent for a half season with the Clippers  \- disastrous and benched with the Clippers in the playoffs  &amp;#x200B;  But yeah let's just remember the 2,5 great playoffs series.  And yeah, turns out Kent Bazemore who shoots below average from 3 on completly open looks while being a disaster everytime he puts it on the floor has been bad. if he suddenly shoots well from 3 it would change, it hasn't been the case, he hasn't deserved to start in the first 10 games or so"
"What kind of cheat code did Kent Bazemore find? He can't really play basketball very well but he's been in the NBA for a long time, and has arguably the most beautiful wife of all the NBA players when he looks like discount Chance the Rapper"
"For the life of me, I can't figure out why Kent Bazemore has had such a long NBA career"
Kent Bazemore
Kent bazemore. In theory hes the perfect role player. I like him just from afar
"So you want to give up $27M in salary, so you get to use $5M???  Wtf kind of logic is that   Lacob is paying insane luxury tax bills to keep a 4th max roster spot available, not to sign Kent Bazemore to the TPMLE."
"yes, I too am happy that kent bazemore is in LA now"
Anyone that can shoot would be good for the Lakers. They got Kent bazemore starting games.
"&gt; Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard  Lmfao"
"Yes the roster construction isn’t that great I agree, but listen to what you said, 5 players combined for 19 shots and missed 17. Westbrook alone took 23 and missed 13. That is why he takes the brunt of the loss, or are we just admitting Kent bazemore, deandre Jordan, or Malik monk should’ve had more opportunities. Or possibly not dribbling into a contested three for the game? I went through this and I’ll tell you, Westbrook making shots in the early game is bittersweet, because then come fourth quarter…"
Kent Bazemore gotta be up there
now they're saying it's kent bazemore
"We ran a lineup with Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard with like 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter."
kent bazemore euro step :(
"westbrook has lots of fans at least, how many people say they are a kent bazemore fan"
Kent Bazemore fucking sucks.
Bro Kent Bazemore blew a wide open lay up last night did you watch?
It had Kent Bazemore in it and I hear he plays basketball sometimes.
Kent Bazemore has had a job in the NBA for damn near a decade… how sway
"Lakers fans please explain, how does Kent bazemore start over melo"
Avery Bradley and Kent Bazemore as starters in 2021-22… oooffff
He’d start over Kent bazemore or Trevor Ariza and they were a top west team and probably will be. He’d start over will Barton too if you don’t wanna accept the warriors.
"We also missed Nurk and CJ for half of last year, in what world is having to start Kanter and use Melo for bench minutes not going to create a bad defense regardless of the coach?  Also last year Terry wanted an actual backup PG and Neil refused to bring one in wanting Ant to get those minutes, this year, we have DSJ in that role and it is allowing Ant to flourish along with the team  Neil gutted the roster after he WCF finals run and then hyped the team up like it was somehow a title contending roster and that turned a lot of the fans on Terry but it was absolutely Neils shit roster  After that WCF season the team lost Seth Curry, Mo Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard (and then ten games into the next season Rodney Hood went down for the year)  and replaced those guys with: Hassan Whiteside, Mario Herzonjia, Anthony Tolliver, Nik Staukas, Kent Bazemore, Wenyen Garbiel and eventually Melo  and fans wanted to act like it was all on Terry and not on Neil, like c'mon"
"Their 3- point shooting is completely unsustainable this season. Avery Bradley is not a career 56% 3-point shooter (he's at 36%), LeBron is not a career 48% 3-point shooter (he's at 34-35%) Rondo is not a career 44% 3-point shooter (32.3%) , Carmelo is not a career 43% 3-point shooter (35%) neither is Kent bazemore (35-36%), and Malik monk who's shooting 38% is still outperforming his career 34% significantly."
"The most asinine part of it for me is that it's not like anyone needs help figuring out what kind of players to put around LeBron at this point; the formula of shooters + LeBron has been established for over a decade.  Instead the Lakers are relying on Malik Monk, Carmelo Anthony, Kent bazemore, and when healthy Wayne Ellington, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor ariza to space the floor because they brought in two non-shooting guards in Russ and Rondo."
idk how they could criticize when we had Kent Bazemore and Kelly Oubre where the ball went to die.
steph i’m so sorry you have to have kent bazemore in your 4th qtr lineup
Kent Bazemore missing those FTs and Draymond Green missing that layup......  Warriors late game situations just dont know how to execute. I dont know how many games I have seen where the last 2 minutes is where they lose the game after a pretty good overall performance.
Is there anything more infuriating than watching kent bazemore play basketball?
Kent Bazemore is the name   Basketball is NOT the game
Kent Bazemore that is all
Kent Bazemore is so bad jeez
Kent Bazemore always in the middle of Celtics' run. great
Anyone who thinks GS would be legit better without Wiggins is straight up braindead.  You really think the Warriors would be better this season if they were playing Kent fucking Bazemore for 33 minutes per game against starting quality NBA wings?  We've seen Wiggins straight up clamp guys like Kawhi this year.  How much money would you bet on Bazemore or Mychal Mulder locking them up?
"Honestly, no. I WAS at Oracle when he dropped that halfcourt game winner though, that was fucking crazy. I have nothing but respect for Harden's scoring ability, but IMHO he had a better coach and GM who actually looked for players to compliment him instead of sticking him in a motion offense next to Kelly Oubre, Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, and James Wiseman.  Harden is a fucking killer tho, people love to hate because of the ft's but they forget that's how Kobe and MJ and all ISO scorers since the dawn of basketball have feasted. I also fucking love Harden's shot profile, too. The fact that we got to see arguably the two best scoring backcourt players since MJ go head to head year after year is truly a blessing."
That was all kent bazemore
"LeBron would kill for having the DPOY Draymond, future DPOY Wiggins, future 2x ROY Wiseman, future dominating center Kevon Looney, future top 10 3pt shooter ever Oubre, not to mention Damion Lee and Kent Bazemore. That’s an all-time supporting cast and Curry somehow holding them back, even trying to commit suicide on Houston’s stairway and still choked on that one"
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
