"A lot of teams would kill to have a guy who can produce like that.  What isn't talked about enough is how poorly constructed that wizards roster is in general.  Also,  unpopular opinion,  Bradley Beal is overrated."
"Yeah, they have Bradley Beal. He’s averaging over 30 a game. We don’t have anyone like that. Not sure what you were trying to do"
I don't think it means much tbh. Players today are going to look better on that stat.   Bradley averages high points per 100 than KD did in 13/14 when he averaged 32ppg. Why do you think that is? maybe because Beal shoots more per possession on the court? lol
"The ability to create your own shot is only important if you’re the best player on your team though imo. Especially if you rely on it.  Give me a Beal/Klay to play off of a Curry/LeBron moreso than another ball dominant player.  Obviously pairings like Kyrie/LeBron are still amazing, and I think it’s nice to have multiple creators, but it becomes more an more redundant.  It is especially noticeable in the lower tier of scorers, for example D’Lo is a great shot creator, but on a contender he’s not really going to be able to get the touches to do that (as he’s at best a 3rd option on a team like that).  The Nets would also likely be much better with a Klay Thompson or even Bradley Beal type of player as their 3rd option, but obviously it’s never a BAD thing, it’s just a redundancy and you can likely get a better defensive player in that spot."
"They are 10-10 when he gets a Triple Double and 8-22 when he doesn't, how is that not helping his team win?  The Wizards are 2-8 when Bradley Beal attempts 25+ shots and i don't see anyone here saying that he isn't helping them or that he is statpadding, miss me with that bullshit."
Is Bradley Beal better then Klay before the injuries because he puts up better stats ?!?!?!? 😱😱😱
Lebron Steph KD AD Giannis Harden  Dame Jokic Kawhi Embiid Gobert Luka Simmons Bradley Beal Jimmy Butler Bam Adebayo Klay Booker Tatum Ingram Randle CP3 Zion? Mitchell? Westbrook? PG? Jrue?  There's hella dudes you're going to have to convince me he's better than. And that's just off the top of my head
"&gt; The idea that people making the NBA aren't competitive as all hell though is outrageous.  with how much money there is in sports and the enormous draw that has, anybody who has made a professional league has outcompeted so many others that they are almost certainly amongst the most competitive and driven people around.  maybe someone like lebron could have been good without trying, but even the difference between someone like bradley beal being the leading scorer and being a guy who flamed out after college is razor thin."
Good thing Bradley Beal isn’t scoring 20 on 50% TS
"Just wait for the outrage when people realize that 4 of Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal wont even make an All NBA team this year. Have no idea which 2 even should of that group"
"First, Bradley Beal is not a superstar - he is a fantastic offensive player who is a category below the elite offensive guys like Harden, Durant, Jokic, Embiid, Lebron, Curry, Lillard, etc.  Second, Westbrook is an inefficient offensive player.  Third, neither of them play defense, and the rest of the Wizards' team is not particularly inspiring (though I do like Rui) on either offense of defense.    Finally, basketball is a game that is about talent, but is also about chemistry and roster construction. The Wizards' team is just not well constructed."
"Love the Russ and Bradley Beal relationship, can’t wait for the them to wreck havoc in the playoffs"
Bradley Beal is a better player than Kuzma.
bradley beal does not lead the league in scoring because Alex English held the title in 1982

"GOAT offensive player  Get this man Bradley Beal in the offseason and they’ll contend, hot take.  Provided the Wizards and Beal feel it’s the best time to move along, I got respect for the loyalty too."
"TIL Westbrook is responsible for the emergence of Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard wants to trade careers with him, he basically is Oscar Robertson reincarnated, and above all IF there are any shortcomings in his career they are all other people's fault  Lol wtf is this propaganda?"
Bradley beal has no interest in winning and would rather be mediocre in The wizards with no expectations while getting payed
"A superstar isn't a superstar for just one year  Besides this year, he has done jack shit since 2017 finals, besides shooting the celtics out of the playoffs  And he played alot alongside Harden and the whole team has good offense, defenses can't focus on him  I'm not taking him over any of the players I mentioned, plus a couple like Luka, Dame, AD, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal  Out of the players in my original comment and the ones I mentioned now, who tf is Kyrie better than?"
"Rui Hachimura and Bradley Beal WILL play. Fuck it, play-in time?"
"Bradley Beal is the MVP, most points should get the MVP. None of these defensive playin' bitches are deserving."
"Golden State's salary structure is so bad that the trading Wiseman for a Star talk really doesn't make sense because they would have to move the Andrew Wiggins contract and it would probably cost them an additional asset or two to move it given the salary compared to the play. Just do the mirror test: if you are a Golden State fan, are you really letting go of Steph Curry for James Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins at 60 million over 2 years? Chances are you're not, which means that a hypothetical trade for Karl Anthony towns or kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal probably ain't happening with the assets the warriors have available.   If the warriors get Thompson back healthy, there's a good chance that they can be a competitive team again and if they can't get him back healthy, there's a good chance that they aren't going to be a competitive team again and that's relatively independent of other factors.  The best case scenario for them is that the Minnesota pick conveys to them and then they get Klay back next year and can make a run with their big three while developing their younger players in meaningful games."
"I'm not going to debate you that Edwards needs to be a good 3pt shooter to be an effective player (I think you underselling his ability to drive to the rim which can be extremely elite and his defensive potential).  Second the limitation is not accounting for volume, while volume is a variable that should be considered, the point I was making is that a raw 3% is suitable to alot of noise because there are abuch of uncounted variables that you are ignoring, and the overall assumption that good 3% == being a good shooter is incorrect . I mean look at your own chart you provided do you think that Otto Porter is a better shooter than PG, Kemba, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker ... the list goes on. Also consider in 2016 Bradley Beal avg 7.6 3pt attempts having a 40% percentage, this season he is averaging 6.5 attempts at 33% if you just looked at it you would think Beal became worse at shooting but this is the wrong conclusion the reason why the drop off happened is that in 2016 he had John Wall in his prime and Beal was a second option making his shots alot more easier, but it is also obvious in the last 5 years Beal has become a much better shooter and scorer.  Because of these factor your cannot properly test your hypothesis that players do not get better at shooting."
Maybe you can get Bradley Beal to bring that up in congress?
I just don't think they're blowing it up. They have indicated they are retooling. I would still lean into them waiting for what will happen to Bradley Beal. But Steph is far from falling off his game. They'll obviously look at how Klay would recover from the injury.
They probably have to be the first when Bradley Beal decides he wants to leave.
"1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Dwight Howard  5. Chauncey Billups  6. Derrick Rose  7. Rajon Rondo  8. Bradley Beal  9. Avery Bradley  10. Michael Jordan  To change it to people I grew up watching, I'd swap out Hakeem and MJ for Kobe and Paul Pierce"
Bradley Beal.
PG: DJ Augustin / Steph Curry  SG: James Harden / Bradley BEal  SF: LeBron / kd  pf draymond / rudy gay   center embiid / nick olayokich
That is the kind of offer that can get you a Bradley Beal even if he isn't available.
"Steven Adams is nice, but he was considered a dirty player at one point. Kicked Bradley Beal in the balls, he throws elbows, etc."
Someone pull up the Bradley beal star man meme
"the lakers were lucky enough to get a star who fit with lebron. if that guy was bradley beal, i don't think the lakers win the chip. what the warriors need is a star wing/big man and that's not out there atm."
"It wouldn't, but it would definitely hamper Warriors ability to put out a competitive roster for next season for sure unless Bradley Beal wants to sign up for us on a vet min."
Bradley Beal.   It’s become a meme how much the Heat front office was thirsting for this guy but our offense really needed a guy like him when our shooters went cold.
"And KD, Paul George, Bradley Beal.."
"&gt; Paul George, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant (insistent), Damian Lillard (insistent), CJ McCollum, PG13, JJ Redick, Kelly Oubre.  Is that enough for you, or do you know better than NBA players?"
"It's ok, if Ben has another bad performance he'll for sure be traded for a guy like Bradley Beal, and I know he ain't Harden, but still great"
"Paul George, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant (insistent), Damian Lillard (insistent), CJ McCollum, PG13, JJ Redick, Kelly Oubre"
"I mean, r/nba considers LeBron the best player in the league and he hasn't led in ppg for a long time now. If this were the cade, Bradley Beal or dame would be considered the best in the world."
"Randle’s playing 37 minutes a game and perhaps more importantly the Knicks are the slowest team in the league. They’re not exactly being run into the ground.  He’s on the floor for ~74 possessions per game. Bradley Beal, on the fastest team in the league, is averaging ~77 possessions a game. Lillard is on the floor for ~73.5. Even Giannis, he of the no minutes, is playing 72 possessions a game for us this year.  They’ll be fine."
"What? I’m talking about Bradley Beal  Westbrook is a fun player, but this Wizards team isn’t the worst team he’s been on."
"I'm not saying they would do this, but if you're the Wizards, would you not take the #4 draft pick, another lottery pick, Wiggins, Wiseman, and probably another FRP for Bradley Beal if he demanded a trade? I would seriously think about it."
"I don't know if it's ""shin splints"" _per se_, but Bradley Beal a couple years ago was struggling with lower leg stress fractures and mentioned on JJ Redick's pod that he had to dial back his off-season workouts a lot to make sure that it wasn't a continuing problem"
"Let's call a spade a spade and just acknowledge that Washington doesn't have much legitimate NBA talent on their roster, especially with Thomas Bryant out.  It's basically Bradley Beal, a declining and very inefficient Westbrook, two mid level prospects in Rui/Deni, a washed RoLo, and then end of bench guys.  With the Wall/Westbrook trade, I think they're probably in purgatory for the next few seasons. They probably need to blow it up and move Beal for the good of the team."
"not just point guards. someone like bradley beal can play in tight spaces just as well as john wall or russ, and needs to operate there for the offense to function as the secondary ball handler.   which is what the 2g is on offense. the scorer/secondary ball handler hybrid. emphasis on the secondary ball handler part.  its a prerequisite to play the position. its why kobe, mj, tmac were special. wing size but guard body control and reaction time. so they were able to use that advantage at 2g.  if you cant move that way, you play a wing spot if you're big enough. if you arent, you dont play.  this isnt arbitrary but literally a requirement based on what guards do.  kd is a center size w swing movement and skills, so he uses the advantage there.  this also isnt about playmaking. jokic can run an offense but doesnt move like a guard, same with lebron, same with giannis, same w bill walton or wilt.  kd can catch the ball anywhere b hes tall. but he needs space to dribble and move. which is why vs pat bev he had to shoot pass or post after not being able to dribble in game 1"
"okay, Jrues great but he's always been a fairly spotty scorer. he can fill it up but you don't expect him to be Bradley Beal either. Ben is more valuable as a player imo. Jrue just happens to be the perfect guy for the team he's on as a two way player."
1st Team-  PG: Damian Lillard  SG: James Harden  SF: Giannis Antetokounmpo   PF: Zion Williamson  C: Nikola Jokic  ---------------------  2nd Team-  PG: Steph Curry  SG: Bradley Beal  SF: Zach LaVine  PF: Julius Randle  C: Nikola Vucevic
"You're analysis is absolutely spot on, the reality is catching up with the idea of Wiseman. I had him ranked [19th](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/jvq1a4/my_final_2020_nba_draft_big_board/) on my board and received plenty of pushback and downvotes for doing do, but I'm feeling better everyday about putting him behind names like Haliburton, McDaniels, and Maledon. It's just so clear already that they should've taken BPA over ""fit"" and even I as a LaMelo skeptic absolutely thought that he was undeniably a better prospect. Just the sheer dynamism he'd be able to bring to the offense as a playmaker alongside Steph and Klay... it's a damn shame we didn't get to see that.  They should trade him asap before the rest of the league sours on his potential trade value as it's a matter of time before he loses his blue-chip reputation. I'd do all I could do to end up with either a Bradley Beal level star or one of Cade or Mobley in this upcoming draft."
Is Tobias+assets enough to get a Bradley Beal?
"Hornets maybe? 7-59 season, drafting MKG over Dame and Bradley Beal, just three first round  exits in the playoffs to talk about. Batum contract, wasting Kemba's prime, just bad at drafting in general. Maybe not the worst but pretty terrible"
Bradley Beal.
"Im going to get downvoted to hell for saying this. But in gonna say bradley beal for 2 main reasons.  1. I have ALOT of questions about his ability as a leader. He doesnt seem to motivate and lead his teammates and like wall or westbrook did. 2. His lack of defense. His absolute lack of trying on defense is i think spreading to other players. Now granted the blame falls on scott brooks as well, but both sides of the ball are important.  Hes still an all star and top 5 shooting guard in the league, but i dont see him as a franchise savior. Great SGs like AI and Kobe can lead trash teams to the playoffs, and beal for some reason cant."
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"...Are you braindead?   Do you not realize just how good Bradley Beal is? Do you not realize how much firepower having Steph/Beal/Klay is, with Draymond being able to playmake for them, and all of them being able to play off the ball?"
"I mean there are countless examples. Bradley Beal didn't make the all-star game last season despite making it the two seasons before. Did he cease to be an ""all-star level"" player for a season and then become one again? I think you're being a bit pedantic because you don't seem to like Atlanta very much. From what I can see most people can recognize that Trae is an all-star level/caliber player."
"bradley beal was the third overall pick who, going into his draft, had been the best non-pro guard in the country since highschool... it would be absolutely unheard of for him to get to bradley beal's level"
Bradley “2ic” Beal
"I guess?  I honestly just would have preferred they traded Kemba and embraced a mini-tank, then turn this top pick, two young guys and 2-3 picks into bradley beal or some other all-star level player."
I remember a playoff game in 2018 where Bradley Beal gave back almost as many point committing stupid jumpshot fouls as he scored.
"My name is Bradley Beal. I'm 27 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Washington D.C., where all the villas are, and I am married. I work as an employee for the Wizards as tank commander, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing or making the playoffs, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to play a one on one pick up game, I wouldn't lose to anyone."
"&gt; most of the reason he fell to 16 was that teams knew he would struggle to play due to anxiety tho. he would have gone top 5 easily  This is just revisionist history.  In a draft with Anthony Davis, MKG (lol), Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond, and Harrison Barnes -- all of whom were one and done elite prospects -- as well as Dion Waiters and Damian Lillard, no one was going to pick 21 year-old Royce White in the top 5.  And Thomas Robinson, the actual Player of the Year in White's conference, was also picked ahead of him.  He was a fringe top 10 pick with no baggage."
Bradley Beal moving to Japan and joining a junior high team to try and win the Inter High with the power of friendship is all I want out of this season.
"You act like Westbrook hasn't played with the 2 greatest scorers of his generation...and now another elite scorer in Bradley Beal, and they have 17 wins lmaoo. Westbrook just isn't a winning player. It's time for you to accept that."
"Here are his words:   &gt; ""Westbrook's numbers last night mean absolutely nothing to me because even though that's great numbers, that's what Westbrook can do. We all know this,"" Smith said. ""He's a former league MVP. He's the most athletic point guard we have ever seen in NBA history.  &gt;""But Bradley Beal and you are in the backcourt together and y'all are 17-28 in the Eastern Conference. ... You've played with some great, great players over the years, some talent. And not a single title to show for it.  &gt;""The numbers are the numbers. That's Russell Westbrook. He can do that to anybody. But I'm at a point in time in his career where it ain't about that no more. It's about whether or not you can get to another level to win the chip."""
Remember when Wall was surprised that Washington was building around Bradley Beal?
"you dont need to be the favorite to win it all. I don't think the Spurs were ever the favorites to win it all in the years they won. They have 5 rings. The fact is Westbrook has had multiple chances to win a ring and hasnt been able to do it. Hes been to the Finals, was up 3-1 against the Warriors and lost, played like absolute trash in the playoffs with Harden on the Rockets. He hasnt consistently performed in the playoffs. He's not a winner. Now he has Bradley Beal on his team and they have 17 wins."
no bradley beal on here which is surprising
"It's not just the championships - if you have a team with a Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal backcourt, having a 12-29 record is a bit underwhelming."
"You have zero response to mountains of data, as is the Kobe stan's way.  Bud coaches fought against analytic data longer than any subset of people within basketball. They insisted they understood defense via eye test. They loved a good actor like Kobe, who pulls at his shorts, narrows his eyes, slaps the floor &amp; looks the part of ""locking in"" on D. Even COACHES underrated Pau's defense and thought of him soft, because he didn't slap the floor and put on a big show, or put up monster block numbers.   If it soothes you a bit, Kobe had all the talent in the world to be a consistent two way player. If His flashes of good D proved that. But he expended most of his energy and focus on offense, coasted on D. He had a consistent lack of effort on defense as he saved himself for offensive sets. He was more Bradley Beal than Dwyane Wade"
"Ya i dont really disagree. I think he could headline a package for a bradley beal type player.  Throw in a couple 1sts, or another young guy."
ye bron wins so many rings playing with just bradley beal
"Russ isn't disrespected, hes just not very good. He takes bad shots, hes inefficient, his defense isn't very good anymore. There's a reason Washington is bad, they have one star player and his name is Bradley Beal. Calm down, he had one good game."
The disrespect. John Wall played 40 games in 2018. The Wizards were a under .500 team even when he played.  Bradley Beal has never sniffed being an all-nba player while Derozan was 2nd team all-nba that year.
"The first round opponent is injured and the Sixers get lucky and squeeze by with a 1 pt game 7 victory.  The Harden Nets, 1st seed, coming off of a sweep of the 8th seed, destroy the Sixers, who fell to 4th seed because Ben and Doc can’t lead the ship without an MVP player.  Embiid will then realize he can’t win with this roster and Morey will trade Simmons and picks for a real good second option like Bradley Beal."
"If 25 plane crashes happened, and Bradley Beal somehow snuck on another team’s plane in the process, he might be in the lead  The Pistons, Magic, Rockets, and Cavs can survive"
philly need a bradley beal type of guard.
Imagine going from Bradley Beal as your starter to Jerome Robinson
"There's a stat that measures this. Win share rate and on/off rating are the best measures we have to show how much a player contributes to wins while they are on the court. Westbrook is dead last out of all of the Wizards regular rotation in **both** of those stats. Lmao  If Westbrook is helping his team win games, how do he and Bradley Beal only have 17 wins?"
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
bradley beal is not stephen curry
*Then I'm walking in Memphis*  *Was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale*  Is this song about Bradley Beal dunking on a 10ft rim for the Grizzlies?
"Bruh, hes played with Paul George, Bradley Beal, and James Harden and has had zero playoff accomplishments since KD left. So convenient that whenever Westbrook plays like shit, he's injured"
"Probably. Build a team with lots of good shooting and a decent center and I don’t see why they couldn’t be serious contenders with his playmaking. He can’t be the best scorer on your team, but he could be the best player.   For example:  Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Rudy Gobert.  Simmons is probably the best player on a team like this because Beal sucks so bad at defense, but a team like that could win the championship.  Some of this depends on era too. Are they winning a championship against healthy Brooklyn? No. Could a team like this win absent of a super team (like if the super team gets injured like in 2019, or 2020) sure."
"Sure but he stopped there. Didn't spam Bradley Beal to ask for a trade to the Lakers this summer. KD literally had a good enough team to win and then thought to himself, this isn't 100% victory and went recruiting for Harden"
"He’s averaging less free throw attempts per game then Giannis, Embiid, Trae, Zion, Bradley Beal, and Jimmy Butler. He’s shooting less free throw attempts and shooting a better percentage from the field than Kobe did his MVP season. If Harden is boring than I guess all those I just named are more boring to watch.  “He’s leaning for fouls” just isn’t true either because if you actually watched him you would see he gets the majority of his fouls driving to the lane and getting contact through the arms. He slows down the game because he’s controlling the pace of the game with his facilitating which is what you want your point guard to do. Watching him facilitate and throw lobs and behind the back passes is pretty fun to see. You’re entitled to your own opinion bud it honestly just sounds like you’re a hater."
"I mean, he had a great game, but he's also at 50% TS on the season and ranks 167th in the league in WS/48.  Westbrook has always been a guy who will shoot you into some games and shoot you out of others. But, he requires an offence designed around himself to do it, and these Beastbrook games are fewer and farther between.  One good game doesn't take away from the fact that, even with Bradley Beal next to him, he's only got the Wizards at 17-28 in a weak East."
"Ad, Bradley beal, luka?"
"lol ok.. because bradley beal, the leading scorer in the nba, is taking the wizards straight into the playoffs with his buckets 🤦🏻‍♂️  ben has exactly what it takes to make his teammates better, which usually translates to team success"
"Westbrook shoots too much and sacrifices a TON of perimeter defense to fish for rebounds in the paint. If he just took smarter shots and played hard perimeter defense he would be a lot better.  And everyone here seems to love shitting on the stats guys, but the Wizards have Bradley Beal who’s playing excellent this year and solid role players but are 17-28. If Westbrook was actually helping generate wins they’d have a way better record than that. You can downplay advanced stats and Plus/Minus numbers all you want, but why are the Wizards doing so poorly if they legitimately have two superstars on their team?"
"He’s correctly criticized for gathering tons of empty stats that do not translate to actually winning. In the playoffs where this is especially true, he has been straight garbage in many of his recent playoff series. The only season in the last 5 where Russ didn’t average a triple double was with Houston, where D’Antoni made him cut the nonsense and he actually became a way more beneficial player. His stats were still amazing and he averaged 27/8/7, but he didn’t get his meaningless triple double average. That season was easily way better than this one or the one before, but it doesn’t get the stupid “averaged a triple double” label because Westbrook actually played much smarter that year.  The last several seasons Westbrook could have gotten an organic 26/8/7 year to year, played real perimeter defense instead of constantly fishing for rebounds in the paint, and his teams would have won a lot more games. Guys like Jokic and LeBron could almost certainly average a triple double if that was their main priority, but it would harm their overall game and their teams if they did so. For all of Westbrook’s triple doubles the Wizards are 11 games under .500 and the 12 seed. And the team isn’t filled with scrubs. They have Bradley Beal and a bunch of solid role players. If Westbrook’s game actually translated into wins the Wizards would be doing way better."
"It's not just his TS% (which is terrible).  But how is he creating a million points a game and yet still has the lowest individual offensive rating, lowest win share rate, and worst on/off rating of anyone in the Wizards regular rotation? Im not talking one of those stats. He is the worst of the Wizards rotation in **all** of those stats. He is not helping the Wizards win games. They have 16 wins. If Russ was even just a net positive player, a team with Bradley Beal + Westbrook would be in the playoff hunt."
"if wesbtrook is such a good player, can you explain how a team with him and bradley beal is 16-28? how come the wizards win % is drastically higher when westbrook doesn't play?"
"Super old Ray is basically just like every basic corner 3 shooter. a Kyle Korver on the Cavs/Bucks, maybe Furkan Korkmas etc.  Prime Ray was Bradley Beal. Less scoring but more on the other end."
"They already have good talent. I’m saying, for right now, they shouldn’t focus on big names. Even in trade situations, it’ll hurt their depth, like with Bradley Beal because he has a huge price tag.   Who’s to say Siakam doesn’t develop into that ‘big star’? He’s already getting there. Besides, they have to make a compelling reason for stars to want to come there in the free agency. Finishing 11th in the East isn’t one."
I want to say Bradley beal but that doesn't feel right beal is a better passer and I want to say Donovan Mitchell but Ray never had the handle like Mitchell although he could take you off the dribble.   My answer would be Bradley Beal
Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal. Take that for data.
"Bradley Beal is overrated anyway. Kobe was winning with Smush Parker, Kwame Brown, and Chris Mihm as teammates. Meanwhile, Beal just scores a lot without winning."
"He was kinda like Bradley Beal, but Beal had less hops. On the other hand, Ray didn’t shoot off the dribble as much."
Bradley Beal
But how better is Avery Bradley Beal?
I mean does he mean avery bradley at his best and Beal specifically in tha 2018 season?
"Bradley Beal averaged 47 pts per game in this first round matchup....a 4 game exit LMFAO, no way they win if he scores a lot and no way they win if he doesnt"
"We don't know what his trade value is though. I mean, we're not getting Bradley Beal for him. But probably could get many other Max players that haven't lived up to their contract either. Money is weird in the NBA. There's always a small market that's going to overpay talent like Wiggins. Look at D-Lo. What's he doing for Minny? Wiggins is one of those players that's not quite a max player but you have to pay that much to get him. Oubre may wind up close as well."
"Jerami Grant, Tobias Harris, Bradley Beal"
"Bradley Beal. By the time he gets the opportunity to leave, he'd be at the end of his peak and entering the end of his prime."
Probably Bradley Beal
Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

Bradley Beal once again held back by his team.
"Imagine if Giannis had a Bradley Beal so teams couldnt wall up o him, Same stats if not better than Embiid with a worse team. Still my MVP. Haters gonna hate cause he didnt leave lol."
I love Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal is on fucking fire rn
"I didnt know Bradley Beal was on the first name basis like Lebron lmao. Dude just said ""Bradley for three"""
Bradley Beal is so nasty
Is it just me that thinks that Bradley Beal has the weirdest body shape? I can't even describe what it is.. dude's got tiny elbows and knees.
Bradley Beal runs like his knees are square
Can we talk about how Bradley Beal looks like Bronn from Game of Thrones..
Does Bradley Beal actually sprint like that
"What would be the fallout if doc just snapped, pulled a grenade out of his jacket and took Bradley Beal hostage before pulling the pin?   Would the season end? I don't think so, maybe if he took Lebron or Steph out."
Predict who will close the game  Bradley Beal or Harden or both?
"What's stopping Minnesota or Charlotte from offering a better package for Harden than what the Nets offered? What stopped the Cavs from acquiring Amare at the deadline that year?  I find it hard to believe that small markets don't have a trade package to acquire superstar players. I find it much easier to believe that they do have the packages that could acquire those guys but they're scared that those players would want out very soon or that they wouldn't want to go there at all.   I'm sure that Wolves picks would be much much more attractive to the Rockets than those Nets picks. Maybe one day one of those small market teams will have the balls to say hey, let's go get this superstar and we'll pair him with KAT or LaMelo or whoever the star is that they currently have, and they'll go get that James Harden or even a Bradley Beal type of player and say fuck it.   I'm just using those two teams as an example. I don't see why you couldn't go get a star that might have one or two years left on his contract and say hey, we're acquiring you, figure it out with KAT or don't, you're going to be here for the next year and a half.   There was no guarantee that AD would have stayed with the Lakers, but they said hey, we have LeBron and the assets to get AD, we're going to acquire him with no assurances that he'll re-sign with us and let's see what happens. I don't think that's some once in a lifetime scenario only available to the Lakers because they play in Los Angeles. The Lakers had one star and the assets to acquire another star who only had 1 year left on his deal and made it anyway.   What's stopping the Twolves from getting one other than fear? All these small markets do is luck into one star, surround them with garbage (assuming they don't luck their way into another star or two in the lottery), piss away their careers for 7 years then trade them in year 8 and complain that stars are always leaving them."
Bradley Beal was being thrown around as an mvp contender by some of my casual nba watching friends. That was really jarring lol
"My understanding is that alot of these stats like matchup difficulty and dFG% at the rim arent incorporated into your latest metric LEBRON correct? Is that something you guys are considering doing at some point and are just trying to figure out how or is it something you've found doesnt actually help improve your model and make it more predictive year to year by incorporating that? I know ESPN RPM has tried incorporating tracking data in recent years and its led to uhhh some rather bizarre data  One thing Ive noticed also comparing EPM to LEBRON is that some of these defensive guards like Zach LaVine and Bradley Beal seem to be more penalized for their defense by your metric than EPM. Any thoughts on that, do you think guys like LaVine and Beal are as detrimental on that end as your models say or are they overly penalized due to factors like who their teammates are."
"Yes. Literally better stats in every way to both of them at that point in their careers.   People here seem to be incapable of understanding players outside their total career legacy if they weren't watching at the time.  In no world where Bosh is averaging 17/9 and no longer the #1 option on his own team, and Duncan averaging 24/11 carrying a whole team would you consider Bosh the better player. So why flip it just cause Duncan was a former MVP at that point?  It's like people 15 years from now saying CP3 was better than Bradley Beal THIS YEAR because he has a better career legacy.  Tim Duncan has some of the craziest revisionist history on here. He was NO WHERE NEAR the LeBron/Kobe tier in the late 00s. A vet putting up respectable numbers for sure. But he wasn't a top 5 player at all and guys like Tony Parker were leading the offense for the Spurs and getting more MVP votes than Timmy.  I think the comparison to CP3 today is pretty valid about how ppl thought of Duncan in the late 00s. He was definitely past his prime."

"Shaq was on Philly sports talk radio last week to talk about the sixers and when asked what he would do / add to this team around the trade deadline to help them make it out of the East he said “two words - Bradley Beal.” When asked what he would give up or what it would take though he wouldn’t answer, just responded like “morey has to figure that out.”   Like what? Beal would require Simmons, at least. That would be a cut off your nose to spite your face move.

"You're right but NBA fans always feel compelled to defend the NBA even though the product on the court sucks. The Bucks Clippers game was such a fresh breath of air. I thought to myself, ""Wow, this is why I love watching basketball."" There haven't been many games like that this season. Guys like Jokic, Embiid, Luka, and even my guy Bradley Beal put up massive numbers but it just feels meaningless. It's just not exciting anymore. The problem is that players these days practice threes so much that so many are good at making them. Another big problem is the foul baiting. The ball will be better come playoff time but the regular season just sucks now."

"Curry was bad, I mean really bad, like Trae Young bad his first few years. By his first MVP season, he picked this up and was pretty close to average and people still acting like he was awful we’re just wrong.  Harden was a defensive liability because he didn’t really try and his IQ on that side of the ball was well below average. As he kept getting better and older, his IQ progressed too. The last few years he just clearly hasn’t tried, kinda like Bradley Beal last year. He too is a average-a little below average defender when he puts the effort in.   Dame has just never been at their level. They are both MVPs, he is not that so it’s not judged as much. He has been about the same as Curry. I wouldn’t really tag any of them as defensive liability, just not amazing ones."

"I think he means like, how much is three point shooting ability helps his team. For example, Javale mcgees three point percentage is better than Bradley beals, but Bradley Beal provides much better spacing than javale McGee does"
Kevin Durant  or Bradley Beal(Florida Fan)
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"He said that if Lamelo was on the knicks he’d be an all star “for sure”, and that’s completely wrong.    He’s averaging 15.7/6.0/6.4 on decent shooting.    The two east starting guards are Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal, he obviously would not have eclipsed them in fan voting, which again is only half of the equation for all star starters.    If he wasn’t a starter he’d have to be chosen by the coaches, which he wouldn’t be. Again, 15/6/6 on ok shooting not gonna cut it for a guard in the east. Trae Young didn’t make it on 27/9/4!!!    So GTFOH with that"
"He meant he wasn't a top 10 in the current NBA, he gave a list but I cant remember who he had above Harden, I think it was something like DWade, Demar, Klay, Booker, Butler, Avery Bradley, then I think he put CJ, Beal, Gary Harris, and Andre Roberson but I'm not sure"

Kid... Why did I think Bradley Beal was 31 or something?

Breaking: Bradley Beal have been traded to the Denver Nuggets
"I mean Mike Malone literally said both Murray and MPJ screwed up. I think the NBA coach is the authority here.  It's clear what Murray wants to do, and MPJ should've recognized it too, but there is still no excuse for failing to get a shot in the paint on that play if you're the ballhandler. MPJ's mistake should've taken what would be a 4-on-1 layup and turned it into a 3-on-1 layup. It's Bradley Beal, not Rudy Gobert. Force him to stop a full-speed transition layup by one of the best finishers in the game while backpedaling without fouling or surrendering a putback. The only reason Morris and Campazzo stop is because Murray slows down and looks toward them before he even reaches midcourt."
I love Bradley Beal.

Ok? And James Harden is leading the league in assists. Are you really going to make the argument that Bradley Beal has been playing better this season than James Harden?

Bradley Beal is the best player on the wizards and it isn’t close
There is a stat called points per 48 minutes. Immanuel Quickley currently sits at 37th in the NBA with 31.1 points per 48 minutes. Bradley Beal leads the NBA with 44.
Defensive terror Bradley Beal with the clutch stop
"Considering they were a top 4 seed a year before, and along with the fact that Bradley Beal was getting better, they would have hundo been top a top 4 seed."
Yeah very common play to drive and then dump it off. It’s also not like Bradley Beal is Draymond green
bradley beal DPOY
"&gt; I didn't use that metric to claim that Gobert made the Jazz x points better defensively. I used it to explain a statistical fact, that is, the reason that the Jazz were average defensively was solely to do with what happened when Gobert is off the court. When he was on the court, they were an elite defensive team. And why should Gobert be punished for that?  It's the same thing, you are using the point differential to say they would be a top 5 defense. It's the same as saying what I said about Giannis, why should Giannis not given credit for leading the best defensive team in the decade because the team suffered when he sat?  Gobert was higher on DRPM, Giannis on DBPM and DWS, and deffesinve advanced stats aren't that great. Bradley Beal had a higher DRPM in 2018 than Gobert for example, and he won rightfully his DPOY and Beal was a negative player on defense.  If you still want to disrespect Giannis just to elevate Gobert, do it. You probably don't like when people diss Gobert unnecesarly, and rightfully so, which seems ironic. I'm really done with this discussion."
"In my unbiased opinion (fact), Bradley Emmanuel Beal."
I think they’re one player away. Maybe try to make a splash for Bradley Beal and then they NEED to change their defensive scheme
Last year Bradley beal was bad
he's gonna bench bradley beal immediately.
"Tell Bradley Beal that he has improved a lot since last, because he wasn't an all star last year and now he is a starter.  He would be heated"
"Bradley Beal was inefficient in college, as was Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, and Zach Lavine. I’m obviously not saying he’s going to be close to those guys, but he’s going to be more efficient then he is now. How efficient, I don’t know and neither do you. It’s incredibly ignorant to say Ant is the next Andrew Wiggins this early into his career. Just let him atleast finish the season before saying he’s a bust"
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"Bradley Beal was scoring an efficient 30 for the last place Wizards while we had, I believe, the second best record in the east at that time.   The Pacers are currently one game ahead of the Celtics in the standings. If you can't see the difference between those situations I dont know what to tell you.   If you believe Sabonis has been playing better than Jaylen Brown, he deserves it. If you can't say that Sabonis has been better than Brown, Sabonis doesn't deserve it."
The best player on a playoff team. Bradley Beal was efficiently scoring 30 a game last year but lost out to Walker because of winning so why does Sabonis lose out when he’s the reason his teams in the playoffs and the Celtics get 2 for a mediocre record. (I understand the Celtics were in the playoffs at the time of voting).
"Saddiq Bey, Bradley Beal, Nikola Jokic, Trae Young, Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Luka Doncic and……  Danilo fucking Gallinari"
Alright then why is Bradley Beal an all star? Can't have it both ways.
"Basically a better version of Bradley Beal, top 7-10 ish."
"He played 39 (68%) games before the All Star break where their record was 28-29 overall and 22-17 (.564) with Lebron playing. If the Lakers had a .564 winning percentage for the season they would have moved one space up to 9th. They would have not been a top 4 seed if Lebron played 82 games.   16 games is a lot (Almost 1/5 of the season) so I'm not sure why you bring that up as if they were just outside of being the 3rd seed there were 6 teams ahead of them as well. You're also missing the point that Lebron was still an All-Star regardless of the Lakers team performance. It's the same this year with Bradley Beal, it doesn't matter that the Wizards are a bad team because Bradley Beal is still a really good player and deserves to be an All Star."
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Team success as always been apart of all-star reserve selections when splitting hairs.   Look at Bradley Beal last year and Trae Young this year.   At some point you have have impact winning and reward the teams for winning games. Not having an all-star from a top 4 seed in your conference is a bad look imo.   I would also argue that if Sabonis were on the Magic his stats may even been better bc he would get more usage but that's just speculation.
How can you call Bradley Beal most valuable if they’re not winning? Any other team can win without their superstar playing but if Lebron doesn’t play his team turns into a lottery team.
Bradley Beal didn’t start in the west idiot.  Do you even know how these things work?  Casual.
"Bradley Beal.  He’s a good player, but his scoring output is inflated by his huge volume.  He isn’t as impactful as other scorers around the league averaging similar numbers"
"to me it’s bradley beal. bucket getter for sure, but plays no defense. overrated doesn’t mean he isn’t good before y’all come for my neck"
Bradley Beal. Mans is averaging all those points and what’s he doing to actually win
Tyler Johnson over Bradley Beal

     Giannis (26)  Luka (21) wtf this dudes only 21...  \---  Embiid (26)  Jokic (26)  AD (27)  \---       Players that could age well and keep pace:  Trae Young (22)  Bam Adebayo (23)  Bradley Beal (27)  \---  Zach Lavine (25)  Donovan Mitchell (24)  Sabonis (24)  Jayson Tatum (22)  Jaylen Brown (24)
"It's not that simple, though, is it? Bradley Beal (especially last season) might as well be the MVP 'cause we both know without him the Wizards wouldn't even crack 10 wins. However, no one's giving him the award, winning only 25 games."

"Ya that is a dumb argument. There are some great teams that just had/have a bunch of B+ role players, it doesn’t mean the best player on that team is better than Bradley Beal"
I forgot about Bradley Beal so u are right about that.  Paul George is definitely the 2 of the Clippers. Idk why they had him as a FrountCourt candidate for MVP but he definitely is the SG  1- Pat Bev   2- Paul George  3- Kawhi  4- Batum  5- Ibaka
No Bradley Beal? Sabonis? Lebron playing PG?
Nuggets would never do this. We aren't trading mpj unless we get someone Bradley Beal esque
bradley beal
"I agree I think he’s a little overrated too, but if you’re trading him you better see if you could do it for Bradley Beal not FVV"
Bradley Beal is my dream
"What makes it even more ridiculous (especially with the media) is that apparently Bradley Beal, playing for the 11-17 Wizards, deserves to start ahead of Zach LaVine (who's also setting milestones for Chicago that were unheard of since Jordan last played for them in 1998; Chicago is also 8th right now and not 13th) and James Harden (whereas having been traded during the season somehow ""lessens"" his viability as an All-Star starter)."
"One more Bradley Beal, KD prefers the 4 star system"
"I was thinking the term could mean the total amount of picks you have stashed away over multiple years.  If the term is good enough for NBA writers, it’s good enough for me 🤷🏻‍♂️  https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/28790067/ranking-every-nba-team-2020-draft-capital  https://hoopshype.com/rumor/nba-execs-knicks-have-the-draft-capital-but-not-the-personnel-for-a-bradley-beal-trade/"
"Ok fine you want to do this? I was not going to dignify this with a response while I was on my phone but I have the time now.  &gt;Simmons  You're whole argument of ""he was just boxing out and Simmons jumped"" might hold up, but Lowry moved back into him while he was in the air...he was trying to take out his legs. And yes whole weird incident happened directly after where they both acted like bitches...Lowry shoved his ass in his face on purpose (not dirty but weird af) and Simmons elbowed him in the balls..its a good thing I'm not calling Simmons the clean player here, or else you might actually have an argument.  &gt;Paul George  The Paul George one is 100% an intentional and dirty play by Lowry, and by far the most dirty play on this whole list..as he was going down, he locks PG's arm up intentionally knowing he was going to fall with all his weight onto it..that was fucked up and the most damning example on his list..its embarrassing you're trying to duck this one. If you aren't willing to concede this one, you have zero credibility..although that was already obvious.  &gt;Aaron Gordon  You glossed over it but again, an extremely damning video of him putting a guy in an extremely dangerous situation, and it ended up injuring him exactly as you'd expect. His lack of remorse and tough guy attitude after only solidifies that.  &gt;Bradley Beal  Flagrant and dirty, if it was a one off and the only incident on this list, fine..could write it off, but its not and Lowry is always going way too far and then tries to act all innocent. He wound up and aimed straight for his head.  &gt;Porter Jr  If you ever played basketball in your life, you'd know that if you are not going to go up for a rebound, then you clear the hell out from underneath the guy jumping or else you are going to take out his legs and hurt him. He makes no effort to get out of his way here. He literally stops, looks at Porter, then runs to the spot he is landing...he has really mastered the art of ""accidentally being at the wrong place at the right time"".  &gt;Delly  Great you agree, elbowing a player in the face is dirty, cool. Even though you still feel the need to qualify it lol like you really can't concede an inch though...""ya it was dirty...but he started it!""  &gt;Lebron  Of course you try to get out of this one, he literally latches onto his arm and then once the play is clearly dead, and then he purposefully tries to throw him to the ground and trip him. Just because it didn't result in injury doesn't mean a play isn't dirty..the fact that Lowry is constantly looking for plays like this only solidifies that he is dirty.  &gt;Last Video  He blatantly shoves the guy while he is mid air...did you not just see the Lebron-Embiid play a few games ago? That will always be dangerous and needless...just because the guy didn't end up losing his balance and falling doesn't change the fact that Lowry is once again, looking for a chance to put a guy in a dangerous position...like why make that shove at all? Answer me why that would be a basketball play in any scenario?  And then there is the hipcheck on Ennis...and the close outs underneath shooter's feet and probably countless other instances that weren't captured in a clip.  You think one other Raptors fan chiming in is me getting ""dumped on""...dude you asked what other examples there were and I gave you a whole list and you think I'm the one getting dumped on? lol You and your thin skinned Raptors buddies should just call it a day and keep quiet when your precious players do questionable shit and stop trying to defend their bullshit. I never thought that Raptors fans cheering after KD's injury was a fair representation of your base, but honestly its starting to seem like it is, you guys seem to get off on this shit.  Anyway, I hope you have fun watching the playoffs from the sidelines this year."

"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"Well it is impressive, understandably it would get over looked.  1) VanVleet had 54 points (a franchise high) and a win.   2) Kyrie had 39 points on 60%+ on national television against won against one of the best teams in the league  3) Curry had 38-11-8 on national television but lost.  So while it’s an impressive outing for Beal, his team still lost, showing that his scoring effort wasn’t enough to get the job done. While it might’ve been efficient, it’s not even that high for Bradley who dropped 37 the game before, 47 a few games back, and 60 in early January.   His career is promising and he is a prolific scorer, but there’s good reason why his name wasn’t the center of attention this evening."
Bradley Beal is the emperor of despite the loss.
"Apparently we need to get Bradley Beal and Jerami Grant to have a chance. /s  Lol idk what's up with some of these dudes but if we have Klay back and the potential Twolves pick plus a developed Wiseman, that's a contender to me. That's all you can ask for"
*\*dramatic Bradley Beal-style closeups\**
Trae was voted in last year and we were terrible. Bradley Beal has gained a ton of press with his play. I think he has a great shot.
the point of the comment was that some bigbrain could make a similar post shitpost titled  'bradley beal is making the all star team and here's why'  and point out that no one who's led the league in scoring has not been an all star or whatever
"If you believe Marc Stein (and he's as reputable as they get so no idea why you wouldn't), Milwaukee was fairly confident about keeping Giannis before Free Agency began and before Myers signed that contract. Agents and league execs talk but when it was official that Giannis was signing the super max, there very likely wasn't a team in the Giannis sweepstakes that was shocked by the news. By the time Myers Leonard signed his new deal with the Heat, Pat Riley very likely had already moved on to James Harden or Bradley Beal."
That's just straight up not true.      I made a comment about Tobias Harris' competition but Ben Simmons is also no chance. There are 8 guards in the East (only a maximum of 6 can make the team) that are having a better season than Simmons.      |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Jaylen Brown|G|E|BOS|18|27.1|5.4|3.5|1.4|0.6|2.6|0.531|0.443|0.756| |James Harden|G|E|BRK|16|24.5|6.4|11.1|1.0|0.7|3.1|0.463|0.371|0.880| |Trae Young|G|E|ATL|19|26.9|4.2|9.0|0.7|0.2|2.3|0.422|0.364|0.887| |Kyrie Irving|G|E|BRK|14|27.6|4.8|6.0|1.0|0.7|2.9|0.525|0.421|0.945| |Zach LaVine|G|E|CHI|19|26.6|5.3|5.1|1.3|0.6|3.5|0.510|0.419|0.881| |Bradley Beal|G|E|WAS|15|34.9|5.1|4.7|1.3|0.6|2.4|0.479|0.340|0.891| |Collin Sexton|G|E|CLE|16|24.1|2.6|4.1|1.0|0.2|1.7|0.498|0.435|0.824| |Malcolm Brogdon|G|E|IND|20|22.9|4.3|7.0|1.4|0.3|3.0|0.457|0.404|0.896|.
"I feel like Bradley Beal should get the starter spot, but Kyrie is just very popular with fans..."
Double Bradley Beal and leave Westbrook wide open. He'll sabotage his team like he always does in the playoffs.
bradley beal has over 500 at 15 games
"Off the top of my head, out of players who drive from the perimeter at a high volume, Giannis, Harden, LeBron, Zion, and Durant all have SIGNIFICANTLY higher finishing percentages at the rim for their careers.   If you want to keep it to just guards, Steph Curry, Harden, Ja Morant, Chris Paul, and Bradley Beal all have higher finishing percentages for their careers.   Kyrie doesn’t get extra points because his shots look pretty."
"Just like when Bradley Beal was going off a few weeks ago and looked like he could go to break Kobe's 81, and then the Wizards didn't pass him the all in the 4th quarter and lost."
"Petition to just have Bradley Beal &amp; Dame Lillard play HORSE, 1 on 1 and/or just have a 3-point shooting contest to determine the result of tonight's game."
Think ESPN wants a Bradley Beal trade more than Bradley Beal does
"&gt;It was as bad a look as you could have.      Maybe if we're only talking about free agents but that wasnt the discussion.  He played every minute of his career on suspect teams without ever having a trade demand.   That should count for something in this discussion as we compare bradley beal, harden, ad, gasol, kg, tmac, kyrie, etc... and what the actual thread is about."
"😂Kyrie is a better 3pt shooter statistically and it’s not that close, he’s a better mid range shooter and finisher. Beal as the number one option has never lead the Wizards to anything. Kyrie led the 2018 Celtics to 41-16 before he got hurt. He at least led the Celtics to the second round in 2019. He’s not a great leader but Bradley Beal is arguably the number 3 option on a championship team, and has led nothing successfully. Kyrie is a proven number 2 at 28 years old who averaged 27 PPG and 29 PPG in the finals. He also hit one of the biggest shots in NBA history if not the biggest. Again, what is Bradley Beal better at than Kyrie? You can’t even really say scoring because again, Beals 34 PPG doesn’t hold much weight when you realize he’s doing it on the worst team in the league."
How is Bradley Beal a better player than Kyrie? What is he better at?
"Bradley Beal is literally not better at any facet of the game than Kyrie. Not one. How tf is he ahead of him and what has he done in his career to be considered a better player than Kyrie? Kyrie has accomplished way more than him and deserves some damn respect.  Trae young last year was insane scorer in a bad situation. Zach Lavine is an insane scorer in a bad situation. There are plenty of great scorers in bad situations, I understand they’re not averaging 34 PPG but weight does that hold when the Wizards are the worst team in the league? You think Beal would average that if he was on a contending team with another superstar?"
"I mean what's something more?  Most of the trade packages posted here don't provide any guarantee that something more can happen.  Trading Demar was fine, because it landed Kawhi, and the raptors had other good pieces. That's not the case here.  Rebuilding does not mean you get something more out of it. After the Arenas era, we got lottery picks for 4 years. 1 #1, and 2 #3 picks, We drafted Wall/Vesely/Beal/Porter, they made some good runs ... but weren't really 'something more'.   ---  High draft picks aren't guaranteed to be as good as Bradley Beal, and most of them aren't.   If you have a top player in the league who's only 27, and wants to stay with the team .. you don't make a trade.  ---  I think the Westbrook/Beal combo is better than what the record shows. A lot of our losses are because half of our team was out with covid. We can definitely at least get into the play-in picture.   A couple years of making the playoffs will be good, to build a winning culture. We have plenty of young players.   2.5 Years from now  - Beal is still in his prime.  - Advija, Hachimura, and other young players are more experienced   - Westbrooks contract is over, meaning we get 40M in cap   - We can try to make a splash in free agency, which is much easier when you already have player like Beal on the team."
Bradley Beal deserves all we have wizards nation!
TIL that bradley beal is on reddit
Do you not remember that interview/podcast in which Bradley beal said he wanted to start winning on a winning organization?   https://www.slamonline.com/nba/bradley-beal-wizards-opt-out/
"I think Bradley Beal really does want to try to be the best player on a contender. Whether that's for better or worse for his career as a whole, you gotta admire that confidence."
Bradley Beal a real one unlike some player I know
[link to paywalled article ](https://theathletic.com/2361547/2021/02/02/a-bradley-beal-trade-sources-say-he-doesnt-want-one-right-now-inside-the-situation-in-d-c/)
"Someone really blasted Tommy Sheppard for not righting the ship fast enough? He's been the GM literally 1.25 seasons and has been hampered by Ian Mahinmi and John Wall's contracts.  Sorry he didn't splash cash during one of the worst free agency classes in recent memory?  Sorry he drafted our first all-rookie team member since Bradley Beal, 8 years prior?  I wanted us to get Ujiri when we fired Grunfeld, but Tommy Sheppard has not YET proven himself to be a negative in the front office. Only thing he's done wrong, in my opinion, is not fire Scott Brooks yet."
He’s not going to be a all star dude. You have to think like a coach. Why would they vote in a guy that openly left is team and is generally disliked. Also Bradley Beal averaged 29/6/4 on great effiency also and they chose guys like Sabonis and Bam ahead of him
"PG: Luka, Ja, Trae, De'Aaron Fox, a future player.  SG: Jaylen Brown. Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Future player  SF: Jayson Tatum, De'Andre Hunter, Keldon Johnson, 2 future players  PF: Giannis, AD, Sabonis, John Collins, Kristaps Porzingis  C: Jokic, Embiid, Bam Adebayo, James Wiseman, a future player"
I know he’s not but I’d do anything to make Bradley Beal mad.
Well in that case I don’t think anybody would want Bradley Beal if they had to rice that up..
to get bradley beal
Bradley beal john wall christian wood luka . new superteam
they're the same fans that think the Celtics can get KAT or Bradley Beal using the TPE.  At this point they're the sons of the Red Sox fans that thought we could get Dontrelle Willis from the Marlins in 2003 for Jeff Suppan.  Looney Toons.
I agree. I know this is a personal problem but there’s just a much lessened wow factor with efficient volume scoring. The league overcorrected from the brutal 2000s era of offense. This is just a bit much. Bradley Beal averaging thirty five?
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Bradley Beal got at least 20 points and multiple And1s by just going at Jordan yesterday, he is just completely washed on defense"
For Bradley Beal?
"Those are honestly terrible examples.   The only ones that apply are Kawhi and Kyrie and they both left to be closer to home.  There's no NBA franchise in St. Louis for Tatum to leave for. And no Celtic is ever leaving for the fucking *Hawks*.  Players who are drafted by the Celtics don't tend to leave. It's more likely the Celtics *get* another star to come play with Tatum/Brown, like ya know, Bradley Beal whose Tatum's best friend, than they leave."
That’s not true tho  You can put blame on both. I don’t see how most of the blame goes towards the team. They didn’t make him play like shit.   You don’t see Bradley Beal doing that now.
Pace of play.  Teams are playing 8 to 10 more possessions per game.  Give guys like Bradley Beal/Steph Curry/Dame Lillard five more shots every game and getting to 30 makes sense.
...is this your first time ever watching a full Bradley Beal game?
"The more important question is..should I keep Bradley Beal in fantasy-roto, 9 categories, or trade him right now while he’s still putting up 35? Is it likely he gets traded and sees a big dip in usage?"
Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal should love Box Score fans because thats all he got.
"""Bradley beal sits down"""
What is Bradley Beal doing on defense here?
*Also: Bradley Beal gives a sideways glance to Russell Westbrook!!*              This dude is literally ESPN....
Bradley Beal is a big beneficiary of this no?
Bradley Beal also responds: https://twitter.com/RealDealBeal23/status/1356101954917855234
Are we really surprised Bradley Beal doesn’t know what to do on this side of the ball?
"The Wizards have won four games.  Bradley Beal looked like he wanted to kill himself at the end of the last game.   I get you still like Russ, but he’s not been the same guy.   He looked injured a couple weeks ago.  Slower than he ever had been."
&gt; Nothing to lose by keeping him  You realize that 1.5 years of Bradley Beal is worth more than 1.0 years correct?
No bro the Wizards will be going 60-12 and sweeping everyone with Bradley Beal averaging 73.7 PPG
"Way to go 4-12 Washington Westbrooks!  Lol to people defending him. He almost air balled a three with 15 seconds on the clock.   Dude is a monster, and one of the greatest freaks of nature. But dont pretend he can shoot because he hit that last shot. There is a reason his team has won 4 games all year, 2 against Durant. He is a high school player who gets hyped when his name is in the paper. Other than that, he is just another player on the court that demands way too much attention for always being on the B squad.  And before you argue against, show me a system that he fits in.   4-12 with Bradley Beal scoring 25+ everygame."
 Bradley Beal is a great offensive player
What on earth is Bradley Beal doing on this play. TLC is his guy and he's just guarding nobody lol. I get he wants to help on KD but this is just dumb
Bradley Beal seems to play just fine even thought they kept losing. Fact is Westbrook was horrible for most of the game he only had 2 or 3 goof games.
37 points for Bradley “despite the win” Beal
There's a fucking difference between Bradley Beal taking a shot he is efficient and effective at and Westbrook taking a stupid shot early in the shot clock that he is notoriously inefficient at.  Don't be facetious.
Bradley Beal is throwing this game.
Bradley Beal
GOBF?  Bradley Beal is Government of Burkina Faso confirmed?
Bradley Beal caused this.
I believe Bradley beal is the mvp
Can you imagine if Bradley Beal asks for a trade?  On Russ's resume:   played with Kevin Durant in OKC -  Durant wanted out  played with James Harden in HOU - Harden wanted out  played with Bradley Beal in WAS - Beal wants out  Talk about a legacy.
Also: Bradley Beal angrily throws the ball away - https://streamable.com/fomj37
"East is loaded though. You still have Harden, Kyrie, Trae, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Collin Sexton is improving quickly.  Not saying RJ has no chance, but good chance is a little optimistic imo  Though the Knicks do have a ton of fans so it’s possible he gets voted in"
"and if Bradley Beal finishes the first half with 15, he ends the game with 45"
Bradley Beal should be traded but tbh i have no idea where he'll land
Booker is 47TS% in the 4th. Bradley beal is 45 TS%. Jamal Murray is 44 TS%. Donovan Mitchell is 52 TS%. Kawhi is 49TS%. AD is 51%. Lebron is 53TS%.  Jaylen Brown is 48TS%.   I will tell them their stats don't matter if they aren't efficient in the 4th lol.
"I'm confused here? Didn't Bradley Beal sign a max contract with a crappy team and take a huge part of their salary cap instead of sharing the wealth to improve the team? Fuck him, that team owes him nothing in terms of a trade. Also, fuck Perk for constantly acting like Tucker Carlson from Fox News taking the opposition of every argument to make himself relevant post NBA career.  I'm pretty sick of Kendrick Perkins constantly talking about the NBA like he doesn't understand anything about it just to say abrupt things. Perkins made 57 mill in his career and his net worth is roughly 18 mill according celebrity net worth which should be taken with a grain of salt. That means if my calculations are correct, he would have spent all his money within only 3 years of his career ending. He is genuinely only saying this stuff to stay relevant as he can so he doesn't go completely broke.   Who would have thought that a guy who only averaged 5 points, 5 rebounds and 1 block a game for his career would be super annoying to hear listen to talking about the NBA. Why don't we get like Eddy Curry to be a commentator/analysis as well? He averaged twice as many points for his career, same boards and blocks and he also has a championship too! Oh you don't want to hear Eddy Curry tell you who is good or not? Then why do we have Perk?  I apologize for the Perk rant. Bradley Beal is a fantastic player but I truly believe he made a decision and he should be held accountable for what the contract he signed. That contract doesn't say if he didn't like the next year, you can refuse to play or anything like that so he doesn't really deserve to request a trade. Again, if the Wizards want to move on, that's their decision but they never misled Beal or screwed him over. They only helped him get one of the biggest contracts in the league. I feel no sympathy here."
"Its probably due to all the media recognition they’re getting, especially Bradley Beal. I think I’ve seen a Beal post everyday. As for Grant and Wood, it’s probably because they’ve just improved a shit ton."
For just the price of a coffee you too can help free Bradley Beal
"This gave me the same vibe as those abused animal commercials, I suddenly feel sad for Bradley Beal"
"You can legit make a folder of Sad Bradley Beal pictures at this point, somebody please rescue that man."
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.       These players should all make it before him for the final team:  |East|Pos|Team| :--|:--|:--| |Kyrie Irving|G|BRK|.   |Bradley Beal|G|WAS| |Kevin Durant|F|BRK| |Joel Embiid|F|PHI| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|MIL| |Trae Young|G|ATL| |James Harden|G|BRK| |Jayson Tatum|F|BOS| |Khris Middleton|F|MIL| |Domantans Sabonis|F|IND| |Zach LaVine|WC|CHI| |Jaylen Brown|WC|BOS|.        That's not even including other contenders like Bam, Vic, Randle, Hayward, Tobi, Brogdon and Sexton."
there is no way the Celtics are getting Bradley Beal or Harrison Barnes with the Hayward TPE or by trading Kemba's contract.  Keep dreaming r/bostonceltics
Bradley Beal saying “we couldn’t defend a parked car”   In a press conference is an all timer shitting on a team quote for me
I had a dream where I went more than 1 day without hearing about a potential Bradley Beal trade.   It was all a dream
Yeah I got to think that Riley is going to try to go hard for Bradley Beal he knows Jimmy buckets and Bam isn't enough. TBH I think plan A by a mile was to get Giannis in free agency and they're still figuring things out from there.
send Bradley Beal
"What does that have to do with Trae? He’s not the gm. He didn’t build the hawks.   Not sure how a player that finishes top 3 in PPG and top 7 in APG doesn’t make any of the teams. Bradley Beal also got snubbed. Trae was an all star that year, so..."
Ah crap I always get him and Bradley Beal mixed up
For who? Bradley Beal?
"Miles Bridges, Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal"
"I mean Yao Ming was voted in despite only playing 5 games in his final season, name recognition is helluva boost to All-Star chances  I won't know whether to laugh or cry though if Bradley Beal misses out again because Westbrook got voted in lmfao"
"I know this is probably a joke, but I was watching the jump 2 days ago, And Matt barnes and Kendrick perkins both said this exact thing. They said we'd have to trade for Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal to be looked at as contenders"
Right so we should give up a future star and the best draft pick for Bradley Beal? Why on Earth would we do that? That's dumb
Porzingis package for Bradley Beal.
Giannis is so damn unstoppable when he's locked in.  He and Bradley Beal could have won those last games on their onesome and that's scary.
I haven’t had fun since the 2016-2017 season but I keep coming back because I really like Bradley Beal. If he leaves it’ll be tough
Bradley beal has games way way way better then this and they still lose
"&gt;Bradley Beal, Robin Lopez FOR Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, 1st Round pick  &gt;Beal, Moritz Wagner FOR James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota pick, 1 warriors pick  How the fuck are you equating these two deals, my god"
Lmao you wanna talk about the better franchise? Look at what your stupid FO did with John Wall.   You traded him for WestBrick 😂  Do you cry now when you watch Wall play?  Clearly the Wizards got hustled in that trade you even gave up a pick.  So let's not talk about the stupid franchise that attracts washed up players who can't even control their emotions on the court.  There's a reason why people want Bradley Beal to play for a real team. Even his own wife!   Lol bro this is not your season so save your arguments for next year.
"Trae ""Bradley Beal"" Young"
Why should somebody like Bradley Beal  miss out on an all-nba selection because Kyrie has been taking time off entire season?

They aren't really the same type of player. Bradley Beal is his best comparison.
I believe Steph Curry just needs 42 points in his next two games to secure the scoring title from Bradley Beal

1. No one thinks that  2. We're playing without Bradley Beal.
Talk to me again when you've actually watched an NBA game with Bradley Beal on defense.
If anyone has ever seen Bradley Beal in person/street clothes. He looks like a normal dude. I'm 6'1 185ish and he wasn't much bigger than me.
Damn Bradley Beal is still out?
"But the main argument with Beal his his scoring. That is Beals position and place in the league. This is not like comparing Dame and Giannis with PPG because obviously Giannis brings way more than just his PPG. If you can't see how using PPG as an argument with Bradley Beal over Trae Young makes sense, I don't know what to tell you."

Do people care? Go look at the Bradley Beal and Kent bazemore posts. This sub and people in general fucking love drama lol.
Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal took the L by going to first take to cry about it like we didn't see KD going to first take in 2016 after going to GSW      At this point Beal is now the biggest diva in the NBA
"They should just make the last 2 minutes a free for all, no rules, anything goes. Westbrook can kick his defender in the nuts to create extra space, while Bradley Beal is pulling mercilessly on the hair of the man trying to play help D. Imagine how much more fun that would be to watch"
"Paul George, Bradley Beal, probably Jamal Murray"
is this a shot at Bradley Beal?
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
"I don't know why, but Bradley Beal."
Ok let's talk basketball then. Every backup guard in the league is taking notes on how soft Bradley Beal is emotionally. Punching down at a bench guy is bad basketball for an All-NBA guard.  A Celtics fan of all people should know how ruthless some shit talk can be. This is ammo for some of these dudes.
I'm not even a fan of Bradley Beal but Bazemore is a piece of shit. Who the hell makes jokes about a player's injury.
PG13 in danger of this.   Bradley Beal  Jamal Murray   Karl Anthony Towns  Ben Simmons.   Aldridge.    Donavan Mitchell  Draymond who?   Oladipo   Kemba Walker
"Bradley Beal is not a winner. Russ, who’s been to multiple playoffs, conference finals and finals, is a winner despite what you think"
i think this era is so packed with guards that can shoot i wouldnt be surprised if (and a pains me to say this bc i love this man) a Bradley Beal or Mike Conley or (insert above average guard that hasnt won here)  dont get me wrong i love Beal. i think hes easily top 2 or 3 at his position. injuries havent been kind to Bradley
"If we’re just going by all-stars, I’d say Bradley Beal. I think people are gonna be shocked to find out about him and realize he dropped 30ppg in multiple seasons"

"Beal has every right to respond. All I was saying was that this would have died down if he didn’t respond. Bazemore’s comments were in poor taste, but Beal is many tiers above him as a basketball player so he should consider the optics when responding. As far as Reddit comments go, we aren’t professional athletes. Bradley Beal has a brand/image to protect; anonymous internet posters don’t."
Bruh you are more OVER REACTING than Bradley Beal!!
Dear diary ft. Bradley Beal
"agreed, i'm praying for bradley beal and his family. i hope they can get through this"
It’s different given the fact that Bradley Beal is only out for a week at most.  I doubt Bazemore makes that comment if Beal was out with a season ending injury.  Context is everything
Bradley Beal is currently ranked 37th all time for ppg in a season.
Lol Bradley Beal emotional. He the type who can't take a joke from his friends.
That’s what asking questions is for lol. Don’t get too offended by nothing like Bradley Beal did lol
Maybe this company will be better after ~~Vince Mcmahon~~ Bradley Beal is dead.
If Baze tweeted this that would be one thing. but he just said some dumb joke off the cuff in real life. There isn't anybody here who would feel like they need to defend themselves saying that joke after Beal took it that hard. It was nothing. Bradley Beal is one sensitive dude
He played with Harden for 2 years (and had an insane record on the court together)  The rest of those guys should never be compared in the same sentence.  Like dude you’re genuinely comparing Paul George and Bradley Beal to Crawford and Stojakovic? Or 8 years of KD to Blake Griffin?  Im done here. You’re outta your mind
"Yeah but when you were 13 you were just a doofus whose friends made fun of him.    This is some childish role player randomly taking shots at Bradley Beal, whose season most likely is over w his hammy being injured, for no reason (which is also such a shit injury to have as an athlete bc it can be chronic).   His hammy is worth *millions*."
"Beal is sensitive as fuck, he went way overboard. Kent probably only thought about him for 5 minutes of his day while Bradley is so obsessed with being on Twitter talking shit instead of trying to relax after getting injured. Miss me with this bullshit, Bradley is sensitive as FUCK."
"Ooh, an average r/nba shitposter thinks Bradley Beal is weird, mmmmm."
"Personally I think it was the level of response Beal had that gives him the L. Baze poked at him very subtlety and both Bradley and his wife were ranting with tweet after tweet to the point it got comical. If you make a small joke and a guy flips the hell out the correct response is ""damn dude, chill"" imo"
"The Warriors supporting cast has been absolutely awful and lost without Curry this year. The Wizards have a much more respectable roster, including Bradley Beal who has been better than Westbrook this year. The Warriors are also 35-26 with Steph in the tougher conference compared to the Wizards who are 28-34 with Westbrook.   Being sub .500 and the 10 seed with two apparent superstars shouldn’t be possible unless one of both of them are being overrated."
"It was a joke in terrible taste, but not intended to be malicious, you're acting like he said ""fuck Bradley Beal, he deserved to get hurt"""
Bradley Beal 3 tweets in on this subject: [“I stay in my lane. I’m concerned with BRAD.”](https://youtu.be/WDBq3PkBD44)
"I mean, Baze is a career role player in the league like why should Bradley Beal be letting this even reach his eyes lmfao there's levels to this and reaching down like this just looks insecure"
If being worse than KD all time than KD is being considered a scrub then you need to fix your definition of what a scrub is. By that definition Bradley Beal is a scrub as well. If anything Bradley Beal is a scrub compared to prime Draymond
Honestly I don’t really like bazemore as a player haha. I like Bradley Beal a lot more than bazemore. I honestly just think Bradley Beal’s reaction came off as overly sensitive. His wife’s tweet about bazemore was WAY more disrespectful imo but nobody getting bent out of shape about that.
Bradley Beal is great at basketball but he needs to go for some lessons on trash talking
Bradley Beal shook
"Definitely with you, honestly Baze’s comment wasn’t even that bad.            Bradley Beal is a star in this league, he shouldn’t care about Kent Bazemore this much."
"Sucks to see warrior fans with stupid opinions, calling a Bradley Beal shooting his best overall percentage ever and scoring his most ever a chucker is just idiotic. Acting like he hurt himself going for the scoring title is even more stupid. You did both, you can have your opinion but I don’t have to respect it when it’s based in falsehoods"
"I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do with a holistic player measurement that suggests Fred Van Vleet is more impactful to winning than James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, and Kevin Durant. If your suggestion is to ignore what doesn’t seem to make sense then it returns back to a subjective evaluation of the data and at that point the LEBRON measurement is pretty damn useless. This has been essentially my critique of all these holistic player measurements. They don’t really add anything to the NBA discussion besides confirmation bias when a player you like/dislike is rated high/low on RAPTOR, LEBRON, etc."
I wonder how Bradley Beal copes with the stuff said during games if Bazemore got under his skin this badly. I just remember how vicious people were at the park. This is about as tame as it gets.
"Bradley Beal, #3 Guard"
"The comeback roast is always harder to make good than the original roast.  The only way to have a good comeback roast ready quickly, is to be in the practice of roasting people often.  And if Bradley Beal doesn't roast people as normal behavior, there's no one he's going to be ready with a witty comeback.  Which is why he tried and then just tried way too hard.  Trolls always have the advantage.  Or roasters. Or comedians. What ever you want to call some one who roasts others often. It's subjective"
"how dare you Bradley Beal score 77 on us and then light a fire on Kent ""Towelie"" Bazemore's cotton ass"
"Yeah, I mean look at how Bay Area NBC covered it too:  [https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kent-bazemore-takes-jab-bradley-beal-over-steph-curry-scoring-race](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kent-bazemore-takes-jab-bradley-beal-over-steph-curry-scoring-race)  You know it's a dumb comment when the hometown press has to try to explain it as ""good natured"" in the title off the jump lmao"
Bradley Beal laughing his ass off at home
"Melo was not an all star player by the time he played with russ, PG wasn't during his team in OKC because of his playoff shortcomings and Bradley Beal isn't one as of now."
"I think you both have it wrong. I think he's saying Bradley has to work so hard to beat Curry's score that he got hurt. Steph is so much better of a scorer, he's cruising to the title in only 29 mins.  It's shit talking Bradley Beal as a scorer, not intentionally I think, but a subliminal shot. That's beef."
"&gt;HOF teammates  He started to do this after KD left OKC and he had no another star players around him. Guys like Bradley Beal, Paul George, Melo in that last season with OKC aren't HOF players and he was doing it with them too."
Bradley Beal wife need to chill. No reason for her to be acting like that.
Bradley Beal says he doesn't care about what some bum says. Proceeds to type four paragraphs about that same bum lol
"I'm about to list the win share totals on the season for all the major candidates (in my eyes) for All-NBA in the guard position, try to guess which one is Westbrook without clicking on the names.  9.5 &gt;!Dame!&lt;  8.8 &gt;!Curry!&lt;  8.6 &gt;!Chris Paul!&lt;  7.7 &gt;!Luka!&lt;  7.0 &gt;!Kyrie!&lt;  6.6 &gt;!Harden!&lt;  6.0 &gt;!Bradley Beal!&lt;  3.3 &gt;!Westbrook!&lt;"
Bradley Beal is literally [taking it as disrespect](https://twitter.com/realdealbeal23/status/1391950004022022144?s=21)
"Seemed like he was just complimenting Steph.. also, I'm sure Bradley Beal was going for the scoring title this year- why wouldn't he?"
"Just saw Beal’s tweet, why is Baze saying anything about Bradley Beal - dude just went 1/4 on wide open 3s in a crucial first half. So dumb, sometimes he plays well but a lot of the time I don’t understand why he’s beneficial at all."
"yeah it's not career/life threatening but it's an injury and injury mean more than physical pain there's the emotional side to it too, Bradley Beal saying that those 50 points were for his parents in attendance and he was visibly distraught that he couldn't help his team win and also is missing important games to close the season"
[[Bradley Beal] Lol should I let him live or really go off?](https://twitter.com/RealDealBeal23/status/1391937270836604930)
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"I mean it would require a shit ton of bad coaching and bad defense, but you see some of the lineups these sorry teams are throwing out there. It's more conceivable that Bradley Beal scores 101 than Adam Silver presents Bradley Beal with his 7th mvp trophy."
"Curry could be a free agent next summer.   Chris Paul, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal are also guys coming up for free agency in the near future too I believe.   Russ, Nets Big 3, and Jimmy Butler will be up in 2023"
"&gt; 22nd triple double in his last 26 games, at age 32  That is fucking insanity. And nobody can argue he's stat padding, along with the help of Bradley Beal, he has literally catapulted the Wizards into the 9th seed and are looking to contend into the Playoffs.   He sets every one of his teammates up with their favourite shots. The Wizards have completely figured it out.  Honestly, Russell Westbrook, one of the all time GREATS. A privilege to be able to witness this.   Shout out to Big O. This record is a feat only a handful can ever touch, top 5 is entrenched for years upon years."
"Fair, but then by that criteria you could include Bradley Beal, Luka, and Zion. All scoring 27ppg with 35% or less on 3PT FG%"
And acknowledging that fact while praising his teammate is a shot a Bradley Beal how?
How is this a shot at Bradley Beal?
"I definitely would prefer the Celtics, not only because it would be great to have that rivalry rekindled, but because the Wizards' are absolutely terrifying with Westbrook and Beal. I mean, shit, check what the Wizards' record was before Westbrook and check it now and see just how important he is to that team. Bradley Beal is also extremely important to that team."
He's just joking and probably friendly with Beal but man nothing gets me redder than Bradley Beal disrespect.
So do you think Bradley Beal is better then Steph Curry? LOL
Even Warriors fans don't like this guy. Bradley Beal is fucking awesome
"This is lovely and all, but no Bradley Beal."
Because he played his prime years with Kobe lol he’s not gonna be the best SG in the league compared to now where Bradley Beal and Paul George are Harden’s main competition at the SG slot  Also it’s stupid to write rings off as a team accomplishment. Wade did a hell of a lot for those rings he wasn’t just some benchwarmer that tagged along. In 2006 I would go as far as to say he carried the heat in that finals comeback
"He wouldn’t be the main piece on this team, Bradley Beal would."
Wizard fan better not be talking shit...Under .500 with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook in a Micky mouse East
"Maybe just me, but I feel Bradley Beal is one of the only stars I'm not sure I'd recognize on the street"
Bill Bradley Beal  Avery Bradley Beal
All I know from Richmond was he was apart of run TMC and usually was the guy that got all nba appearances behind jordan and kinda was like the Bradley Beal of the 90s to a lesser extend playing for the kings
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
"2016? Why? Up until then he had 0 MVPs, 1 All-NBA, 1 scoring champion, 0 rings.   That's like saying Bradley Beal is first ballot hall of fame. I mean now he surely is but no way you get in with these accolades I mentioned."
"He's having maybe the best season, him or Jokic, but it doesn't mean he's the best overall player unless you have to specify for this current season alone so far. It doesn't fluctuate that often. I didn't think Kawhi was better overall than LeBron in 2019 either. That's like saying if a guy like Bradley Beal has an insanely dominant week or month that he's the best player in the league.   How quickly we forget that LeBron is in on another level when healthy and in important games."
"No you should think about it in terms of a replacement player. If I pass it to Bradley Beal and he makes a 3, how valuable was my pass? You can find a replacement player to make the same pass to Beal, and if he makes it, either player would get the assist. But the pass itself wasn’t the reason for Beal making the shot. Most of the shot being made was a result of Beal. These days you can pass it to a player, he takes 3 dribbles and makes a tough fadeaway 3 like Steph, and you get an assist even though you contributed like maybe 5% of the actual shot and Steph was 95%. Whereas a TO is a direct possession lost and is worth a lot more in expected value. That’s why CP3 is so much better than Westbrook, and it’s far more than what you just see in things like pure assist numbers.  There’s a reason why Westbrook doesn’t lead to wins as much as you would think from a player who has such amazing counting stats."
Bradley Beal? Is that possible?
Bradley “Bartholomew” Beal
"Guess bradley beal is better than Jokic, Embiid, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi... Dumb take"
Remember Bradley Beal got All NBA over Trae Young.  Lol.
How did Bradley Beal not make first or second team? Dude averaged 30 points a game.
Explain Bradley Beal?
"People just need to accept that Westbrook is a guy who can carry your team into the playoffs but won't win you Series once you are there. He's played with Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden and Bradley Beal throughout his career. Dude just isn't a Championship caliber player in a major leading role."
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
"I'd say Bradley Beal because Book &amp; Mitchell won 20 more games than Beal.  I'd give Booker the edge over Mitchell simply because of games played, since Mitchell missed a lot of time."
"Westbrook should have gotten in instead of bradley beal. He was literally the reason why they got into the playoffs, plus he had a triple double season."
ITT nephews who didn’t know who Bradley Beal is until playoffs
You’re cracked if you don’t think Bradley Beal deserves to be on an All-NBA team this year.
Holy moly Julius Randle stands out as being way worse than all the other names on this list.     Also Trae Young &gt; Bradley Beal
Is it just me that Bradley Beal deserve higher than 3rd team?
Seems a lot of players don't like Giannis for some reason lol. Ive seen Bradley Beal always liking/RT stuff poking fun at him
Bradley Beal supermax next year LET'S GOOOOOOOO
"Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker have been robbed in my estimation.  And perhaps Westbrook and Trae.   Who do I take off?   Well, Butler for sure. He's got there on name only. He had a subpar season for sure.   No doubt in my mind that Booker and Mitchell played better than him this year.   Bradley Beal too. I mean, if Westy ain't going to make it, how is the second best player on his team going to make it? And over two guys who play the same position and led their teams to the top of the west?   But damn... it's hard to fit Westy and Trae on there."
"Lebron, Bradley Beal, Embiid would be actually so insane"
Tatum over paul George or Bradley beal
"I watched every single Bradley Beal game this year. He’s a lot of hype. Not that there isn’t skill, there’s tons. It’s just the easiest kinds of skills to observe. He’s a digestible player to watch. He’s below average in so many areas though and even his elite scoring ability has its obvious deficiencies (like 3 point shooting)."
"Jayson Tatum over Paul George is the only thing I would DEFINITELY change. Otherwise I think its a great list. I think the toughest spot is the last two guard spots, Bradley Beal + Zach Lavine would've been my pick to be completely honest, but I think it definitely comes down Beal/Irving/Mitchell/Lavine/Booker and even James Harden despite his limited action was incredible."
I feel like Bradley Beal should be resting a little more after the injury filled season he had
Bradley Beal has become overrated
"Yep, Bradley Beal"
Bradley Beal &amp; Jimmy Butler have no place in any of the teams.
Bradley Beal lmao... Unbelievable.
With your assets I think you could potentially make a move for a Bradley Beal if he wants to come to the Warriors specifically. Wiseman/Wiggins/picks works I guess. But if Klay comes back absolutely destroyed by injures…that luxury tax bill might be too much for ownership to swallow.
Bradley Beal is not a superstar.
"Luka is going to play with a Bradley Beal or CJ type of player at best for what the Mavs can give him. The way Cuban runs this team, nobody of substantial value will come to Dallas. He’s not a good owner and the majority of fans don’t understand that."

Players have too much of an ego for that... Imagine Bradley Beal playing in the G-League lol.
"I also don't think Jaylen is traded. BUT if he was I'd say his value is roughly the same as:   Bradley Beal. Ben Simmons. Karl Anthony Towns. Sabonis. Ingram.    Add picks + players to either side. Again totally hypothetical, assuming any of those players would ever want out, Boston would want to trade Brown, and any of those players would be a good fit."
"If I was Denver, I’d probably trade MPJ while his stock is high. I’d look to see if I can package him in a deal to nab a veteran all-star similar to how CP3 made the Suns elite contenders. Bradley Beal? Malcom Brogdon? Kyle Lowry?"
"I think you’d get some baseline star players trying to go, the Bradley Beal or Zach LaVine type (great player on a bad to 8 seed type team)"
Unless the Lakers add Bradley Beal or Dame it doesn’t matter. An older Lebron &amp; injury prone AD with kcp &amp; those other dudes like Caruso won’t win anything unless they get another 4 month break with no travel.
Steph Curry/Bradley Beal/LeBron James/Giannis Antetokounmpo/Anthony Davis
Wherever Bradley Beal and Zach Lavine are ranked probably just put him right above them I guess  His prime is pretty weird cause he looked promising in Toronto early on then fell off then looked promising in new jersey and again fell off
"Why the hell would we want Bradley Beal?.  He’s a similar talent to PG with worse defense, vision, and a pretty bad 3 point shooter"
"If Rockets don’t get Cade, they should draft Green  He’s like Bradley Beal. A Green/KPJ backcourt is gonna be nice"
Bradley Beal put up 60 on this dude lmao. Why did he get any votes?
Devin Booker is better than Bradley Beal. A healthy Klay is too
It would be fun if the Warriors got the #1 pick and turned it into Bradley Beal or something
PG/Mann/whatever picks for Bradley Beal/Hutchinson.   Works salary wise and Beal is a proven offensive juggernaut and can be decent defensively on the Clippers. But it all hinges on Beal forcing a trade and the Wizards get an all star on a long term deal they can flip later on as well as a solid young piece.
"Meanwhile the 3rd pick has produced LaMelo, RJ Barrett, Luka, Tatum, Brown, and Embiid and Bradley Beal in the last 10 years"
"Jimmy Butler:  22/7/7, 61% TS  Best defender of the group, likely all defense selection, leading the league in steals  7.5 BPM, 0.255 WS/48, 8.6 RAPTOR WAR, 6.1 Total RAPTOR, 5.56 LEBRON  Chris Paul:   16/5/9, 60% TS  Elite defender, but not as good as Jimmy  4.7 BPM, 0.201 WS/48, 7.7 RAPTOR WAR, 3.4 Total RAPTOR, 3.5 LEBRON  Bradley Beal:   31/5/4, 59% TS  Not a good defender at all  3.2 BPM, 0.132 WS/48, 7.3 RAPTOR WAR, 3.3 Total RAPTOR, 2.77 LEBRON   Notes: the one advanced stat that they're even close in, RAPTOR WAR, is a total stat, meaning playing more games gives you an advantage in the stat, Jimmy played 52 games to Beal's 60 and Paul's 70.    Chris Paul has been really good this year, great ceiling raiser for the Suns, Beal has been a fantastic volume scorer, but Jimmy was the overall better player of the 3."
And suddenly Bradley Beal is unlikely to return as Wizards star player

Paul George for Bradley Beal.
"Yeah, that was my suspicion. The top 15 is stupidly stacked. Your list doesn’t even include guys like Bradley Beal or Jimmy Butler.   I think Gobert is probably top 20. His defensive value is undeniable and he’s no useless stiff on offense. But people should remember just how many great players there are in this league when it comes to these lists."
"He said he's not thinking about it when he was recently asked about his upcoming contract situation with Washington. I think it's very likely that the Wizards start off poorly next regular season and it's not gonna make too much sense for a middling team to mortgage their future to get a little better. Whether the Wiz or Bradley Beal want it, it makes the most sense for both to part ways."
You think Bradley Beal is better than Trae Young?
"This exactly. Guys like Lebron and KD should not have ANYWHERE near the same contract as John Wall or Bradley Beal. No matter how you cut it, so long as players can make more money in endorsements than actual contracts, they will go to big markets.   You remove the Max contract, then teams will fork over half the cap to a star. Then you can finally get the big names dispersed throughout the league."
You spelled Bradley Beal wrong
People questioned if Curry could carry a team and he didn't make the playoffs. He's just like Bradley Beal from last year with more media hype.
"Draymond and Adebayo can guard anyone 1-5 incredibly well, just because they're best offensively at the 4 or 5 doesn't mean they are best there defensively. Bam has had Bradley Beal and Steph Curry as his main assignment and done very well.   Simmons, Draymond, and Bam can all guard any person in the NBA about as good as anyone, Jimmy can guard smaller players very well, as well as anything up to smaller 4's, while being one of the best in the league at attacking passing lanes, and Gobert puts the paint into complete lockdown, while being well above average at guarding the perimeter for a center."
"I just dont get it. I mean he had insane season but players with better stats and much better team success didnt win it before. Like Bradley Beal averaged 0.7 ppg less, made playoffs and nobody mentioned his season."
"I never once said that this was only a stats based argument.  What I’m saying is the only thing Russ has going for him is narrative.  You could say the same things you said about Russ about a half dozen other players.  Randle took the Knicks to the 4 seed.  Lillard shot out of his mind and took Portland to the 4 in the west with cj and murk missing time.  Steph had one of the greatest shooting seasons of all time and carried his team while being triple guarded.  None of those teams had a Bradley Beal backing him up.  When you look at that whole collection of people we just named, there is no statistical argument for Russ over any of them."
"Wow, really? Is that active players as in “Bradley Beal is an active NBA player” or active players as in “currently playing for one of the 8 remaining teams?”"

no way i bet my life savings on bradley beal
We will gladly take Bradley Beal off your hands. Thank you.
"The Wizards were 14-18 at the ASB with Beal getting in on near-identical scoring efficiency.   Trae Young: 26.4/9.4/4.2 on .430/.378/.878, 59.5% True Shooting  Bradley Beal: 32.9/4.7/5.4 on .482/.335/.903, 59.7% True Shooting"
"Giannis clearly does not have enough talent on this team. It's like Lebron in his first stint with the Cavs.   They won over 60 games in both the 08/09 and 09/10 season, but in the playoffs, they were exposed. They did not have enough offensive firepower.   Same thing with the Bucks. Middleton is not talented enough to be the second best offensive player on a championship team.   Holiday is a good all around player, but cannot be the second option either, he is much better as the third/fourth option.   They need a legit second option, that can get to the free-throw line, create their shot consistently against tough defenses. Bradley Beal would be the perfect complement to Giannis as his second option."
"Also:  &gt;The onus, though, is on Olshey to mollify a frustrated Lillard, who is rapidly gaining on Washington’s Bradley Beal as the star some rival front offices want to believe they have a chance of pilfering. Referring to Lillard (or Beal) as a disgruntled star might be a step too far, but he appears to have begun questioning his well-chronicled loyalty to the franchise that drafted him out of Weber State."
"Bradley Beal had worse stats than Trae, but was still an All-Star despite Wizards had NBA's worst record IIRC."
"Like 3rd row back, but close enough. The price was to good for me not to go.  Trust me, Wizards were super cheap back then, too - as John Wall and Bradley Beal hadn't made a name for themselves yet. Combine that with the Processing Sixers, and it made for game that nobody wanted to attend - except for me."
The fact that they haven’t announced a parting of the ways with Scott Brooks yet is a red flag. Bradley Beal only has one year left on his deal so maybe they’ll try to roll it back.
"Y’all ain’t wanna listen to me when I said 4 months ago that the Nets were winning it all. They were already a great team, but once they added Harden that was a super team. The only hope to beat them is having the Lakers getting a 3rd superstar like Dame, Lavine or Bradley Beal."
"Zion is not a #1 option.  Even with AD healthy, the Lakers are not a contender with that current team.  Luka is a ball hog and doesn't trust his teammates.  Bradley Beal is the most underrated player in the NBA."
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."
Why is Bruce brown playing so much? They nets should’ve just got Bradley Beal mid season
"&gt;Westbrook, Bradley Beal, and Rui Hachimura are essentially off the table in trade talks, a source tells FortyEightMinutes.  Beal and Rui make perfect sense, but if somebody calls about Westbrook there is no way the Wizards hang up the phone without hearing an offer."
"I can't believe this guy got paid more than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bradley Beal, Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown this season."
"I mean Luka is a ball hog, no one should deny that, but that's just the way the roster is constructed. He's the primary ball handler and shoots as much as Bradley Beal. The team would benefit a lot more if his usage went down but that would require having players who could handle the ball and would require Luka to be better at playing off ball."

Bradley Beal would be widely considered top 10-15 if he played for a decent team. Throw him on Miami or the Knicks and people would never shut up about him
"I mean in a system like this, you're essentially limiting him to a role player position. He's a dude that needs the ball more. I think they'd be better with a guy like Bradley Break Beal or another 3 and D guy. KP is being relegated to a 3pt shooter when he would play better on ball more. He needs to be in a system where the primary ball handler isn't the primary scorer."
"If we're being realistic, I don't think we'll move KP. Cuban was adamant that he saw the Porzingis/Luka pair with Dirk/Nash potential, and he did not want to break that. I thin even Rick sees that they don't mesh, but Cuban has PTSD of the Nash trade, so it is more likely than not that we'll try to see what a healthy offseason gives to KP.   But if Cuban sees reality, it will take a team desperate, that honestly thinks KP will push them over the edge, or who is just willing to swap bad contracts and hope that a new place will bring out the Unicorn. On bad contracts, Kemba is the best win-win for both parties, Wall would be the most benefical for us and Horford would be just a ""fuck you Porzingis"" move. People are delirious when thinking about Myles Turner and Bradley Beal."
Have you met 4th quarter Bradley Beal?
"It is quite significant. Do you really think Trae Young is more talented than Steve Nash was? Is Jason Tatum more gifted than T-mac? I believe if T-mac was in this era, he would average something like 36, 8 and 8. Even Bradley Beal is in the running for scoring titles on good efficiency. Bradley Beal is not more talented than Ray Allen was when he played for the Bucks and Supersonics."
"Caruso, Kuzma, #22 Pick and S&amp;T Shröeder for CJ is probably a pretty decent offer.   I think we make the same offer + THT / Trez for Bradley Beal."
1. Trade Porzingis 2. Resign THJ and Brunson 3. Somehow get Zach Lavine or  Bradley Beal 4. Sign Norman Powell or Evan Fournier 5. Sign more veteran centers
Still untradable and you think they’ll get Bradley Beal for him lol just delete the comment before it gets bad.
Probably trade KP and whatever picks they have left for Bradley Beal or something like that
"I will take one 7'3"" Bradley Beal plz"
Bradley Beal on the Nuggets or Mavs would be dope
"If Luka improves his conditioning and gets a legit 2nd star, the Mavs will be a top championship contender for a long time. Give the guy a Bradley Beal type talent or try to pull off a trade for Lillard somehow and that becomes the scariest/most entertaining team in the league."
It gets a lot harder to trap Luka if you have Bradley Beal possibly playing a 4x3. Teams would probably be forced to accept the switch that Luka wants.
Get Bradley Beal pls
"Nah man, to us fans it's a game. Watch this: https://youtu.be/JJKvsDWX7PY - old or new, makes no difference. Not to guys like Bradley Beal."
Bradley Beal  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Zach LaVine  Jaylen Brown (count him as a SF though)
1: Devin Booker  2: Bradley Beal  3: Spida  4: Jaylen   5: Brown      99: Trash ass Ben Simmons
I feel like CJ would be a very slightly watered down Bradley Beal with less defense and marginally better 3 ball. Wouldn’t be surprised if his percentages go down when he’s not next to Dame though.
MKG isn't an active player anymore.  Why the fuck didn't we just pick Bradley Beal
"He's no Bradley Beal either, who rose to first option after Wall dropped out. CJ and Randle probably think more along these lines of Beal, while they're really more of the Pippen to some Jordan. (With the real Pippen of course way above these guys, but that's not the point)"
They can trade him for Bradley beal
That’s why the only main offensive guy is Bradley Beal and the other three starters are to hold down the defense and also the backups are to be used when the d is struggling on O
**Kobe vs Wade** - Kobe  **Duncan vs  Garnett** - Tim Duncan  **Dirk vs  Robinson** - Dirk Nowitizi  Some of my own:   **James Harden vs Kevin Durant**  **Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker vs Bradley Beal**  **Rudy Gobert vs KAT**  **Jimmy Butler vs Kyrie Irving**
And I'm saying booker never elevated anyone in the way you think he did. He had a poor team for most of his career and still put up great numbers. He's in the same level as Bradley Beal
Did u read my comment? I don't think Bradley Beal is empty stats and I feel the same way about Booker. I just think Booker is a better player with his ability to score and his growth as a playmaker
"Devin Booker was literally an ""empty stats""(which doesn't really make sense) guy until Chris Paul came along. I don't know how you said he has an impact on the game but not Bradley Beal."
Just imagine Bradley Beal with Westbrook's relentlessness and motor and athleticism. Sheesh.
Do you think the suns would be worse if they have Bradley Beal instead of devin booker?
"Bradley Beal, I see nothing special about him"
&gt;His wife is really anti-vax  [She said Hank Aaron died from vaccine](https://brobible.com/sports/article/bradley-beal-hank-aaron-vaccine/)
"Bradley Beal.  He is the definition of an empty stats guy.  Sell all my stocks on him, first chance."

"Nah, Beal Bradley"
Bradley Beal.
"Am I confused about what you’re saying here, or do you think that Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard are on the same team????"
"Overall, offense is a far more valuable attribute for a player to have than defense.  It is not a 1:1 ratio.  Typically, just being competent on defense satisfactory, as match-ups and schemes are more important than individual prowess.  One way defensive players typically don't fare well in the NBA.  They are out there, Tony Allen and Andre Roberson come to mind, but they aren't stars and are best used in match-up specific scenarios.  Hiding a players shortcomings on offense can often be downright impossible and the whole team comes to a crawl.  Hiding somebody like Trae Young and Bradley Beal on defense is not only feasible but they can still be your stars on the team.  There's no amount of amazing defense from an individual player that could ever match Trae offensive production.  Defense is also reactionary, you can make it as hard as possible for your opponent to score but it's always up to them to play better.  Of course being able to play excellent individual or help defense is still very valuable, which is why two way players are sought-after.  Draymond certainly is/was a two way player.  So is Klay.  As a whole, advance metrics do favor Draymond It's true.  Until you take Steph or KD off the court.  Then Klay handedly takes over.  Though in general when Steph goes to the bench, even with KD, everyone drops off pretty heavily.  At least in the regular season,  nobody can deny KD being mvp in the finals but overall steph,  the worst defender, is the most important player on that team."
Such a better fit than Bradley Beal it's not even funny.
"Bradley Beal isn’t taking credit for hacking him, he’s taking credit for hacking his confidence. Jesus fucking Christ the smartasses in the comments."
Bradley “Soulja Boy” Beal
"&gt;Which is why there are never any arguments, and certainly no divorces!  Yeah. And Bradley Beal and his antivaxx wife are still together. One can assume they would acquiesce on certain issues. It wouldn't be farfetched to assume they agreed not to get vaccinated based on his wife's views.  I agree there's a chance he's not antivaxx and this is all speculation. But that doesn't disqualify him from sharing the same views as his wife given they're together and he's quiet on the situation."
"So his wife is an idiot.  Nothing in that article said anything about Beal, other than ""Bradley Beal's wife...."""
Pops mentioned Bradley Beal is thicc too. Add that to the list and you got yourself the thicc-est team in the nba
&gt;is Beal antivaxx ?  [See for yourself](https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/basketball-news/bradley-beals-wife-mocked-for-suggesting-mlb-icon-hank-aaron-died-due-to-covid-19-vaccine.html)
"Yeah I see your point  But the Wizards were the first team to ever hack-a-ben under Scott Brooks in November of 2017.   Ben had to attempt 24 free throws in the final 9:17. I think he made 12 of them.  Bradley Beal commented on it back then as well. “I loved it. I got to trash talk, too, to get him to miss a few, but we definitely extended the length of the game with that. That’s what kept us in the game.”"
Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal and him are almost identical. They’re also both the king of empty stats who can’t win games for their teams. There is a reason why Phoenix was ass before CP3 joined.
"Bradley Beal if he had hops, but not *hops*."
"EAST  - Giannis wins a Championship with the Bucks - Bulls eventually trade Lavine - Cavaliers make the playoffs once - Ime Udoka doesn't last as Celtics coach  - Capela is still a Hawk  - The Heat never make the finals again - LaMelo gets 3rd team All NBA honors - The Knicks never win a playoff series  - Jonathan Isaac never gets healthy  - KD wins 2 titles with the Nets - Goga Bitadze is the next Gobert - Isaiah Stewart leads the league in rebounds at least once - Vanvleet will be the only Raptor still with the team - Sixers sign Kyle Lowry - Somehow someway Bradley Beal never leaves the Wizards   WEST  - Lillard never leaves Portland - Paul George is still a Clipper - Jaren Jackson Jr is a bust - Gordon Hayward returns to Utah - The Kings still haven't made the playoffs, Fox gets traded to the East - Lebron surpasses Kareem as all time leading scorer and retires as a Cavalier - Luka and Mavs never makes it past the 2nd round  - Michael Porter Jr leads his team in points - Zion never participates in dunk contest, Pelicans make it to the playoffs twice - Rockets never make it to the playoffs - Gregg Popovich retires in 2 years - Mikal Bridges wins MIP - SGA demands trade from the Thunder - The Wolves finally make the playoffs at least once - Steph Curry leads the Warriors to the finals but loses"
"&gt;Bradley Beal: ""I don't disagree that maybe Wes can change our team and make us a better team. But I think if you look at our team as it is, I don't see how you say 'this is a 50-win team, we just need a new coach.'"""
"This made me want to look up the leaders in possessions doubled/game:  Top 5 for the regular season:  1: Trae Young - 26.9; 43.9% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss   2: Luka Doncic - 26.9; 45.1% of possessions; 1.21 team pts/poss  3: Damian Lillard - 23.8; 40.3% of possessions; 1.23 team pts/poss  4: Chris Paul - 22.9; 42.8% of possessions; 1.19 team pts/poss  5: Bradley Beal - 22.4; 47.1% of possessions; 1.13 team pts/poss  -------------  Side note: It's hilarious how many of these stats I look up and see Trae and Luka 1 and 2 in some order. I know Luka's better and everything, but it's still absurd to have 2 players that aren't only this good but are this good at so many of the same things and defended in similar ways that were drafted the same year and traded for each other."
"Not necessarily true. Any GM can use assets, not just tanking ones. You can always flip those assets + a player for a better player down the line. In fact, those assets may be worth even more because they’re not your own picks.  I mean, look at the warriors for example - because they have the TWolves pick, they can negotiate a strong trade for a potential borderline star.  Imagine a hypothetical - Morley trades Simmons for CJ + 2 FRP. Then, next season, the Trailblazers still aren’t good, and Dame wants out, and the FO trades him. Now you have extremely valuable assets, and who knows who’ll be available on the trade market. Maybe you can flip CJ back out for Bradley Beal, or D’Aaron Fox."
Lakers are a long shot unless he had like 1 year left on his deal. Knicks I could see tho especially if some star maybe comes and joins him (Bradley Beal👀)
"&gt; Because defense isn’t as impactful as offense.  I've once read, in this sub I believe, the best summary of this: ""one player can score on 5 guys but there's no way one guy can defend 5 opponents."" There's a reason why Bradley Beal is a max player and PJ Tucker is making 8m/year."
Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Bradley Beal  Damian Lillard
"And it was crazy because we really didn't have any other options.   Isaiah was the only player on our roster who could dribble **and** shoot at a decent level. Everyone else on the roster could only do one or the other.   Marcus could handle the ball but was having a historically bad shooting season, Avery could shoot but he's a 6'2 SG because he has zero handles, etc etc.  We had decent players, but there was no Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum or even a Lou Williams that Isaiah could share those late-game responsibilities with.  Plus he had a huge target on his back because of the KOT4 stuff.  So when the game slowed down in the clutch entire defenses would just zero in on Isaiah. Teams knew they only had to slow this one guy down for a short specific stretch.  He obliterated them game after game.   It was absurd how consistently he did it too, it was like clockwork. He would sub in with 8 minutes left and 12-15 points on the board, he'd finish the game with 30."
"I agree with most of what you said - players can ask for trades, and devalue their contracts, when they feel they need/want a change.   But this is something I noticed earlier this year with Bradley Beal (all the people saying #FreeBradleyBeal) and now this Dame situation - as much as they have a right to ask for a trade, they also are required to play out their contracts. Dame just signed 3 + an option to stay in Portland. Beal signed to stay in Washington. Unfortunately they have no leverage in their current situation and the team has no obligation to trade them. This is the unfortunate truth of being able to make $150 million in guaranteed money.   I'm just trying to play devil's advocate here. I don't pretend to have the solution, because it's really is a complicated situation."
"Mom, can we have Bradley Beal and Kevin Love?   No, we have Bradley Beal and Kevin Love at home.  Bradley Beal and Kevin Love at home: javale sniffs his fingers and another dude that averages 13 ppg"
Bradley Beal is always about to get traded
They could’ve done more in the past but I think that ship has kind of sailed. Who is the top 20 player that wants out right now that Portland could get? Bradley Beal and Lavine don’t seem to be going anywhere (and if they were there would probably be better offers than the blazers). The next closest is like Simmons but that’s probably not enough to get them past the second round considering his severe limitations
Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal  he’s good but Lavine, Booker, Mitchell are all just as good and offer the same value offensively but Beal is seen as better for some reason."
"If I’m Bradley Beal, I’d like to have the ability to control the narrative. I’m unhappy with my coach? Tell my contact that there’s tension between the coach and the players. I want to put pressure on the FO to trade me? Let out that I’m “unhappy with my situation” and that I’m going to demand a trade soon. Just a couple of the ways you can use a relationship like that to get what you want"
Ngl I'm so confused by what players stand to gain from these kinds of relationships with reporters. Like if im Bradley Beal why am I texting random dude after every game just for him to share it with the world
Unironically makes the roster better. This team desperately needs role players. Bradley Beal is useless offball as are most of the players already on the roster.
"His source is most likely Bradley Beal, for whatever that's worth. Either that or he lied and has no source."
Dude I’m pissed. I was supposed to go to the game in vegas today but it got canceled (thanks Bradley Beal). And now this happens.
Based on following Q I believe the part about him talking/texting with Beal who tells him stuff here and there. He also said that they had been talking about Team USA (this ended up being reported by the ESPN guys later on)  [Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard spoke at length about the possibility of playing alongside each other in the Olympics following their playoff exits.](https://twitter.com/RealQuintonMayo/status/1405963575953444866?s=20)  Beal and Lillard are very close so I think there's a high probability they talked about their careers and keep tabs on what each other are planning to do.
His word in DC is only as good as what Bradley Beal or his wife tell him. They play video games together. Given that Brad and Dame are actually good friends it is possible Quinton Mayo was told something from Dame's camp. But it's also possible this is a stretch. He's tweeted out some flops before too.
I mean if he's true he's close to Bradley beal and his family as people in this thread say it's not out of the realm of possibility that Dame told Beal and Beal told this guy.
"Did you notice that Brad didn't say he wanted to stay in Washington last time he was asked?  June 3rd:  &gt; What Beal did not have answers for were questions about his future with the franchise.  &gt; Asked Wednesday about his intentions entering a contract year with the Wizards — he will be a free agent in 2022 — the 27-year-old said he had not yet thought about the years to come.  &gt; “We’re not even going to think about that or even talk about it right now,” Beal said.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/06/03/bradley-beal-future-with-wizards/"

"&gt;4 of the 5 greatest forwards of all time played during the same time as him.   Wait, who are these 4 out of 5 you're referring to? Cause he didn't play at the same time as Bird, Malone, Barkley, Dr. J, Baylor, McHale, Pippen, Havlicek, Giannis, Kawhi etc. Pierce is 100% *not* a top 20 all time forward. He's barely a top 20 all time small forward. He made 4 All NBA teams (3x 3rd team and 1x 2nd team) and he only finished top 10 in MVP voting once, at 7th. Pierce was really good, but he was more like say, Bradley Beal, than Dwyane Wade."
It's not weird.  Booker is a 3 point shooter who doesn't actually make 3 pointers.  He's one of those reputation shooters from 3 like Bradley Beal.  They get hot at the right time and so they'll look better than the percentages.
He’d use the Bradley Beal “really?”

"&gt; that MIGHT be a hint that he belongs on the team because of how good he was!  See, you keep missing my point entirely. I've not once said that Carmelo was bad. Or that he didn't deserve to be on the Olympic Team. He deserved to be on the team then the same way Bradley Beal deserves to be on the team now. Or how Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry deserved to be on the team in 2016."
you have not watched a bradley beal game have you
Bradley Beal is not very good at safety precautions from what I gather...
"The comparison was always so wild, and people just kept running with it so irresponsibly no matter how obviously not true it was lol. ESPN's Paul Biancardi wrote a whole article about it, and Yahoo wrote an article about whether Bronny, a 6-foot rising freshman at the time, was an actual NBA prospect. I kind of imagined that Bronny would become like, a big, 6'3-6'4"" (without shoes) guard with a big frame like Bradley Beal, Eric Gordon or Jrue Holiday even if he didn't get as tall as LeBron, just because LeBron is so massive and Savannah isn't small really. But he looks kind of done growing at a legit 6'2"" and with average length and a much slimmer/shorter torso than those guys. His arms seem very small. There's a chance he has one last growth spurt, and I think that would change things and make him an NBA prospect if it gives him more bulk and 2 more inches, but can't expect that. I've watched LeBron his freshman and sophomore years, and he was just a ridiculous freak from day 1, and it was obvious. He was incredibly fluid like Michael Jordan or Kobe. He could change directions effortlessly and he was incredibly fast and on-balance and quick at all times. He could jump, but that part didn't even come all the way in until after his sophomore season. His frame was huge and he looked gangly and like he was still filling out even though he was already huge. bronny has always looked kind of heavy footed and kind of lacked the fluidity and explosiveness of a potential high major guard prospect or an NBA guy. However, he is a great defender, with solid passing skills and he plays a lot better than his highlights suggest."

If Steph shot 36% from 3 instead of 42% he'd still be Bradley Beal basically.

Bradley Beal is closer to Draymon Green in terms of that draft than he is to AD and Lillard.  Lillard and Beal arent even in the same tier.  Beal struggles cant get to .500 in the Leastern Conference without Prime Wall.
Sheeeiiiiiiiiiiit. You ever heard Ish Smith and Bradley Beal?

"Bradley Beal is a mental midget, always has been"
"The imperfect fit is strictly on the offensive end. Ben provides zero spacing allowing teams to come off him easier and double Embiid which amplifies embiids, declining, yet most obvious weakness which is passing. Embiid demands a lot of attention down low which makes it harder for Ben to attack the paint in the half court unless embiid is deciding to try and space at the 3 pt line. Defensively tho, they’re hands down 2 of the 5 best defensive players in the nba. Embiid finished 2nd in DPOY voting a few years ago and if he wasn’t required to do so much on offense, his defense would be at that level again. Not that it isn’t now, it’s just not constant like it was before. A Bradley Beal in the place of ben would force Embiid into a slightly bigger defensive role over the course of the season but not only would he be less demanded of on offense but being able to kick out of a double to a guy that averages over 30 ppg would be pretty ideal. That’s who I’d like us to get most but I’m not so sure it’s likely"
"LOL   ""Yo, i'm Bradley Beal, fool""   ""Who?""  ""Bradley Beal.""   ""Kobe?""  ""No.""  ""LeBron?""  ""No.""   ""Fuck off"""
"I suppose it would be something like Jayson Tatum ≤  Player x  ≤ Bradley Beal   You know, all those dudes"
"Unless a third team such as the Washington Wizards (Bradley Beal) is involved, the 76ers aren't trading Ben for assets."
"&gt;Throughout the games, multiple players, from Jayson Tatum to Bradley Beal  The hell does this even mean? Is there a range between Tatum and Beal? Who would be considered inside that range?"
"Hopefully Mobley or Green, or Garland and a combination of other players. We'll find it. He isn't the end all be all and we can find some scoring in better ways. The backcourt is too small regardless. We aren't going to be there next year, but we can't follow the Sexton train. Gotta make the right moves for the future now. Dame/CJ or John Wall/ Bradley Beal didn't even work all that well at their peak and we want a shittier version."
"Zach Lavine is actually useless on this team. Not only is his skill set completely redundant and strictly dominated by a few other players (like a Bradley Beal), but he also plays no defense. They would have been better off taking literally any player over him. Heck someone like Lonzo Ball, even if he’s not the better player in a vaccum, would be a way better fit for this team."
LeBron James - he's James  Bradley Beal - he's Beal  Ben Simmons - he's Simmons
"&gt; Bradley Beal didn’t exist?   Beal was a promising 21 year old that you could tell was going to get better. But he wasn't actually that great in 2015, shooting even less efficiently than Wall did.  &gt; Every starter on the team averaged double figures. Wall, Beal, Pierce, Nene and Gortat all had double figure averages?  I think we have different ways of evaluating how good a team is. I certainly don't base it on the ability of the fifth highest scoring player to average double digits.  &gt; We would have made Conference Finals had Wall not broken his wrist.  I'm sorry, I'm not meaning to piss in your cereal. In 2015 the Wizards were a 5th seed. They exceeded expectations just by making it out of the first round. Granted the Hawks were a 'weak' #1 seed that year, but they were still a 60 win team to the Wizards 44 wins.   &gt; And we actually matched up amazingly well against LeBron’s Cavaliers had we gone further.  I think we're departing from reality here. I think beating a slightly higher seeded non-contending team was the Wizards ceiling. They did it in 2014. Again in 2015. Skipped the playoffs in 2016. Won vs Hawks and lost vs Celtics in 2017.  I think you are greatly overrating them to think of them as contenders or serious NBA finalists."
Favourite: Pascal Siakam  Least Favourite: Bradley Beal
Even if it were that's Bradley Beal numbers. Not close to top 3.
Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal are better at basketball than 99.99% of all players in NBA history. Their combination of elite scoring at all levels and very good ball handling/playmaking would have made them dominant in any era. And casual fans in 20 years might not even know their names.
"Not that surprising, Bradley Beal has played most of his career without injury, Wall has missed entire seasons and spends significant time getting back to form.  When he's healthy, John wall is nasty with blocks."
John Wall and Bradley Beal
"if you had lebron, embiid and could trade simmons for a star guard like bradley beal (plausible at the time) i think that team wins in 2019 and 2020  2021 would be possible too if health y"
bradley beal… 9 years in the league and 0 success in the playoff.. 89 seems generous
"Bradley Beal is 6'3""????"
Feel like if you come to the lakers you can be pretty excited because being good here boosts your popularity a lot  Example: Kyle Kuzma has more followers than Bradley Beal and he was just solid. Imagine being an actual star
Bradley Beal surprises me on that list
KD is not the best player in the league when every team he plays with has two superstars with him. If you insert Bradley Beal on those teams they do the same thing as he did..
"offensively he was really really good but his defense was really bad, you really have to hardcore build around him or it just won't work out, so i put him in a similar spot as bradley beal, a top 20 player in the league, maybe fringe top 15"
Where does Bradley Beal rank ? Below him.
"Exactly, like they think an All-NBA player in Bradley Beal isn’t gonna be sought after by at least 25 of the 30 teams and those teams are going to give up diddly squat for him! LOL  Beal is up for a huge extension in October, no way he turns that down when he specifically signed for 2 years so he could get this extension.  Even if he gets traded, he’s signing that extension first which means teams would need to match his salary plus I’m positive he’d have a trade kicker included."
"""Franchise: Harden (player) and Beal (player)""  I stopped reading there.  Bradley Beal is not a franchise player. Not even a diss. A franchise player is someone a franchise can be built around and at least have hopes of a Finals appearance after surrounding the player with fitting pieces.   LeBron, Giannis, Steph, Harden, Kawhi and KD have proven to be franchise players. Luka, Jokic and Trae (which surprised me) showed they can potentially be those players.   Beal is a fantastic player who can ball out. LeBron in CLE, MIA or LAL means you are going to the Finals. Kawhi with SA, TOR or the Clippers means you have a chance to win it all. KD with OKC, GS or BKN means you have a chance to win it all.  Name one team in the league where Beal becomes their best player and suddenly they achieve more team success than they did last season."
"Nah, no defense, turnover prone, lost two big games to not even make the playoffs.  How is that really even better than what Bradley Beal or Trae Young or Lillard did the year before?  Lots of points, no results.  I've got him at like 6 or 7th.  If I'm starting a squad, that's where he'd go."
Not a superstar but Marc Gasol was All NBA 2nd team and 1st team in that span  It wouldn't be a stretch to say he was a fringe top 15 player  You don't think those Grizzlies plus Bradley Beal or even Jaylen Brown can win it?
So is the cap space for a Bradley Beal trade dead now?
"Bradley Beal isn't a ""we have our franchise guy, time to go all in on winning"" level of player"
"I don't even know what that means.  ""Bradley Beal isn't as good as Bradley Beal""  - reddit, 2021"
"Technically, they have to prove that they are a winning organization. Obviously, the average person realizes that they probably aren’t, but some people aren’t that smart (like Bradley Beal)."
"Well, all the guys who are currently up there, plus Bradley beal, Jimmy butler (I know he was bad in these last playoffs), and Paul George. Booker probably ranks about 20 for me."
Kawhi and Butler def. Butler loves giving tough love. Bradley Beal?   James Harden can get away with stuff similar to MJ. Only thing is MJ didn't really bait fouls. Both of them are good at bumping defenders to create space and get calls.
Preach! There’s only soo many times you can see  **Bradley Beal for some other teams bench scrubs and 2nd Round Pick**
"Butler, Paul George, Bradley Beal?"
"Yeah Richmond means current guys like Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal will make it in for sure.  The bar is crazy low. You just gotta be a a 22ish ppg player for a decade and you'll get in."
"David Griffin has been trying to get Bradley Beal to New Orleans since he took the job, I think that's who he's looking to move for next year once Beal sees if he can get a supermax S&amp;T."
"There aren’t any good free agents next season and the cap is increasing, so there’s actually a chance that some team would throw more money at him.   Here’s the top 2021 unrestricted free agents:   1.	James Harden 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Kyrie Irving  4.	Zach LaVine  -	Terrry Rozier -	Aaron Gordon -	Jusuf Nurkic -	TJ Warren -	Gary Harris -	Collin Sexton (He’s a RFA though, so you’d likely have to offer a max or figure out a sign and trade)   It’s pretty darn likely that Harden, Irving, and LaVine all re-sign with their current teams. As a result, Terry Rozier is arguably one of the best UFA’s available next season. His only real competition is Beal (obviously better), Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic, TJ Warren, and Gary Harris. I might pick Rozier over almost all of those dude other than Beal."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about that. There aren’t many good free agents available and the projected cap increase is going to mean that teams have money.   I just looked at available 2022 free agents and outside of James Harden (PO), Bradley Beal (PO), Kyrie Irving (PO), and Zach LaVine, Terry Rozier might arguably be the best unrestricted free agent available. The only guys he’s really competing with is Aaron Gordon. It’s a pretty empty free agent class. Everyone is just re-signing with their original teams.   **TL,DR:** There aren’t many good free agents next year. Outside of Harden, Beal, Irving, and LaVine, Terry Rozier might be the best UFA available. His only real competition is Aaron Gordon."
"You can't directly combine them, but with foresight you can. This hypothetical below shows the **financial** ability to make this trade, while clearly not factoring in player value.  * **At some point 2 months before the trade deadline:** * *Pels receive expiring F Thad Young and $3M TPE, Spurs receive $17M TPE*  * **At the trade deadline** * *Pels receive G Bradley Beal, Wizards receive Josh Hart, Thad Young, Wenyen Gabriel, 5 1sts*  *** * Beal salary: $34,502,129 * Minimum outgoing to acquire (25% less - $100k): **$27,501,704** * Hart salary: $12,000,000 * Young salary: $14,190,000 * Gabriel salary: $1,762,796 * Pels Outgoing: **$27,762,796**  ***  Obviously the Pelicans aren't getting Bradley Beal, but the financial ability to do something like this. You just need to wait 2 months after acquiring someone with the TPE to aggregate them with Hart."
Gotta remember that Charlotte isn’t gonna magically attract Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard. Might as well spend the $ on someone who wants to be there rather than save the $ for hypothetical players like NYK and BOS.

"What was the best team lebron beat to get to the finals when he was In The East all those years? The Roy Hibbett Paul George Pacers? Jordan beat Ewing and starks, Miller, price and Daugherty, Thomas and dumars, hardaway and O’Neal, Barkley (when he was still  in philly), Wilkins, Bird, mchale and parish (old, but still playing).    Lebron beat Kyle Lowry and senator derozan over and over and over.  Oh, and John wall and Bradley Beal.   Who did Jordan beat in the finals? Malone, stockton, Barkley, magic, Payton, and Drexler.    I give lebron credit for beating the Spurs with Duncan, Ginobli, and Parker (popovich is the best coach either Jordan or lebron faced.  So I give him major kudos for beating him), and the warriors with klay, steph and draymond.  But his lost to mavs is inexcusable and cannot be ignored when comparing him with someone who went 6-0 in finals series.  How do you ignore that and his 3-6 record in finals series? Aside from his first run with the cavs against the Spurs where he had no shot to win (I don’t hold this against him) he played with 2 other hall of famers in all of his other finals series and his record is under 500.  What measure do you want to use to figure this out? Jordan has him beat with everything! Jordan’s peaks was higher than lebron, it just is.  Lebron has played damn near 50% more games than jordan and thus has amassed an incredible resume. But it’s just not as good as Jordans"
Bradley Beal is kinda nice tho
Bradley Beal used to walk Jayson Tatum home from school
We are actually trading paperclips until we get Bradley Beal I'm sure of it.
depends on the team imo and level of the player..Bradley beal being the scorer guy will be more valuable than prolly a guy like ben wallace / rodman  but for a starter calibre guy the defender might be more valuable...smart/thybulle vs lou williams/clarkson i am picking smart /thybulle
Bradley Beal we gotchu
"I don't watch college basketball at all so I'm not going to pretend like I know how good of a prospect Mobley is. I did however pay attention to the G-league ignite because I was interested in seeing how top prospects would play as 18 year olds against experienced NBA players. I don't know if Jalen Green or Mobley has more potential, I just know that Green has a lot of potential.  Just how often do we see KG archetypes reach their full potential compared to Bradley Beal archetypes?"
He is great but Mobley is a waaaay better prospect.   A guy who could become Kevin Garnett vs a guy who could become Bradley Beal who you picking?
"I'm talking specifically about a sign-and-trade (or an AD-style ""trade me to this team only"", but that's super unlikely). Unless there's a big salary cap spike a la 2016 we can't sign a star outright in the near future, and while we have the salary to make a trade work we don't have the young assets to make a really competitive offer, so it'd have to be a situation where a star wants to come to the *Celtics,* and their team doesn't have enough leverage to field other offers.  ...specifically, we're obviously positioning ourselves to make a pitch to Bradley Beal in free agency. I wouldn't say we're putting *all* our eggs in one basket, since I think we can still build a good team around the Jays even if Beal doesn't end up coming, but he's pretty obviously Brad Stevens' option #1 next offseason. If it's not Beal, Lavine could also be there if the new-look Bulls disappoint, but after that there aren't really other big-name free agents (other than Harden, but he's not leaving the Nets unless something *catastrophic* happens)."
"The reasons the trade didn’t go through is because Beal and Tommy said no because Brad must have indicated he wants to sign the huge contract in October.  Don’t get me wrong, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if Beal comes out and says he only wants to go to Boston, then that’s where he’ll end up.  I also don’t think Tommy will lay down and let teams walk all over him either.  He just haggled the Nets over Dinwiddie and managed to come out way ahead on that end. He seems to be very astute and has a plan in place because he’s giving Bradley a huge amount of control in what happens with the team.  I’ll guess we’ll see in October, if Beal doesn’t sign the contract on that date, the trade rumour mill will be going beserk."
"i hear where you are coming from. my understanding (which could easily be wrong btw, someone should google this) is that with the trade kicker, the c's would need to attach less assets to match money. if bradley beal decides he wants to come to boston, its that much easier for the C's to acquire him, although the number of years would definitely make any team think twice unless the cap explodes again."
"Bruh, Bradley Beal and James Harden average more than 30 in today's game. You saying MJ couldn't do that? W/o a 3-point shot, he'd average 32-35, but by the second season (when he's practiced and got a 3-point shot), he'd average 40."
"i watched the entire thing at 6x speed. it's not THAT bad of a list  how is andre drummond #165? how is he above al horford, bradley beal, jrue holiday, john wall, KAT, brad daugherty? kevin love over yao ming? billups over reggie miller? moncrief over miller?"
"They’ve tried hard to sign non white stars and no one is interested in coming here. We swung and missed on Lowry, Butler, Beal, Kemba, Dwight Howard, Giannis, Kawhi, DeRozan, Conley, Grant, etc…   I don’t think it’s a conscious choice, we are signing players who are interested in playing with us, most of them want to play with Luka (Goran Dragic, fellow country man) or Lauri Markkanen who expressed interest in playing here. If Bradley Beal or Lowry had wanted to play here we 100% would’ve signed them."
Luka-Bradley Beal-Jaylen Brown-Jayson Tatum-Joel Embiid with RJ Barrett-Otto Porter- and Enes Kanter off the bench.
"We'd still suck let's be honest. If we follow the hypothetical though, we trade away KPJ, Green, and our young assets for a star to build around Hakeem. Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, or ideally Dame plus Hakeem, Wood, and Wall would make that team a title favorite."
He can really score but idk if that can make him an arguably top ten player. Someone like Bradley beal can score too but people dont really consider him a top 10 player
Same age as Bradley Beal and from STL. Have multiple good friends who were in his graduating class and can confirm his GPA was super high. Supposedly very good student.
You can’t tell he’s a future Bradley Beal from watching summer league. Lots of kids put up numbers in SL and don’t turn into much.   I’m not saying he’s one of them necessarily but to claim he’s a future star from SL makes no sense.
"Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown"
Bradley Beal?
Bradley Beal I think
Zach Lavine &gt; Bradley Beal
CJ is just Bradley Beal except in the Western Conference
They're going after Bradley Beal  It's so obvious
Lavine &gt; Bradley Beal
Jaylen Brown &gt; Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal
Al who?  Cousins has been gone  Kemba walker  Bradley beal  Middleton
"Derrick Rose, Bradley Beal (unless he makes some very strong playoff runs), KAT, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown.  And totally agree, Carmelo reminiscent of Dantley and Alex English, albeit with slightly larger fanbase."
"Efficiency in the league has increased as more and more teams prioritize shooting threes, Wade obviously didn’t grow up in an era where teams prioritize making threes and he was never very good at them. This hurts his efficiency when compared to present day players. This position less basketball has new fans minds clouded, voting used to be a lot more stringent, they preferred the all nba teams to express more traditional views. Bradley Beal until recently was thought of as an empty stats guy. There isn’t more competition today than in the past you had Nash, Iverson, Tmac, Steve Francis, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, Toney Parker, Wade, and many more guys competing for these spots."
Bradley Beal if he stays on a mediocre team
"This is a terrible argument though. For all nba teams, they don’t care if you’re a 2 guard, they just pick the best guards. So wade and Kobe could have been on the team together (which they were both times wade made the team).  Also, you said the league has “trended towards being more efficient, which helps harden.” How does that make any sense? If the whole league gets more efficient, and harden is still more efficient than almost everybody else, isn’t that just a testament to how good he is offensively?   If anything, there are way more guards to pick from now and so it’s harder. There’s been an absolute explosion of amazing combo guards that score 30 a game. Bradley Beal has trouble making the all star game in the east while scoring 30 ppg lol. To stand out among all of these guards in a guard driven era is pretty impressive imo"
"Bradley Beal &gt; Klay Thompson  Don’t look at my flair I’m not biased, trust me"
I watched Bradley Beal drop a then career high 51 pts at the Moda and they litterally could not stop him.
"Nah but I can see him avg 18 ppg in a season with 5+ assists.  People need to realize it’s very hard to make an allstar game now, it’s not like Mo Williams era. Devin Booker and Bradley Beal miss/almost miss the all star game some seasons.   There is no way Fultz reaches THAT level. He doesn’t have such a refined offense."
"Are you talking about basketball fans or the population in general? Because non-sports fans probably only know who LeBron and maybe Curry are, even someone like KD is a foreign name to non-sports people, and guys like Bradley Beal might be unknown to non-basketball fans who only get a little exposure to basketball if they watch sports center.   Basketball fans, besides little kids and new fans, all know who Hakeem and Kareem are."
"I don’t think anyone will ever forget Carmelo, he’s in the Harden/Westbrook/Barkley tier.   Paul George  John wall  Bradley Beal  Cousins  Horford  Butler  Millsap  Oladipo  There’s a lot of players who aren’t gonna be heavily remembered in 15yrs."
Tyrese feels like he could be Kyle Lowry or Bradley Beal
"Kukoc was the 3rd best player on a 3 time back to back to back championship team (between Rodman and him depending on your preference); he was not just a role player.  Kukoc was nice! He was a mismatch at his size because of his shooting ability.  He could take bigs off the bounce and was able to hit shots over smaller defenders because of his giant 6’11 frame.  Although he was huge, he played like a small forward.    In my opinion, if he were on a team where he was the central focus of the offense, he could have led an average to below average team to the playoffs as a 7th or 8th seed.  Which is comparable to someone like Bradley Beal or ja Morant.  His game was not like those two, they are better shot makers and are more dynamic.  Kukoc was a better passer, rebounder, and shooter. I use these two to illustrate what I think his impact on a team would be.  Those two players are not considered roll players and I don’t think kukoc would be considered one either if he were to be playing today.    His game was perfect for today’s nba. Who knows though? I hear you with your argument that he is not as good as jokic, you’re spot on.  But kukoc was much more than just a role player (much better than joe Harris or Bobby Portis)"
"Bradley Beal dropping 60 points in losses has finally gotten to you huh? Btw, Kispert is gonna be the new Nik Stauskas."
Bradley Beal.
"The guys I was most scared of as Toronto fan are/were Kobe, Pierce, Joe Johnson, LeBron, Bradley Beal, and any Cavs roleplayer. Oh and PG13 that one series."
29/6/4.5 didn't get Bradley Beal an All-Star appearance.
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"lol gtfoh  For starters its a couple of SL games. Green is used to this shit due to the G League. Lastly, scoring isnt everything. If it was then Bradley Beal would be leading the Wiz to ships."
His jumper is WAY better then I thought coming into the summer league. His shot creation along with his athleticism is going to create problems for a lot of people. Mans is already looking like Lite Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal is overrated.   Westbrook is a liability on the Lakers.  The Suns should not have given Chris Paul a 4 year deal at age 36.
KD/Dirk  Klay Thompson / Michael Redd  Bradley Beal / Ray Allen  Lowry / Billups
Bradley beal &gt; Mitchell == Booker &gt; Lavine
They need a player better than Bradley Beal if they want to win a ring.  They are probably content fighting in play in tournament games every year tho.
And the moment you keep Bradley Beal is the moment you stay in the 8 seed. The point of trading Beal is that you hope to find the next one but you get assets so that you can surround that next one with good players to build a contender.   The Pelicans are a good blue print even though they’ve kinda botched the rebuild.
"the moment you trade away Bradley Beal is the moment you begin looking for the next Bradley Beal.  if he wants to stay, you do your best to build around him. I don't think they're doing a great job of it, but I can't really fault them for trying."
"Kobe said good things about his friend so what? T-Mac wasn’t the first or last player who wasn’t as good as his numbers. Bradley Beal is basically the new Mcgrady. Or Zach Lavine. Or some other guys. Pretty numbers are just pretty numbers, Kobe has jewelry. Mcgrady wasn’t even as sucessful as Iverson, facts are he was nowhere near Kobe. 5 rings vs 0 playoff series wins lmao. If you give Kobe Yao it doesn’t matter who else is on the team Kobe and Yao are winning the series."
"Talent means nothing if it doesn’t amount to anything. Mcgrady’s talent amounted to 0 playoff series wins, Kobe’s amounted to 5 rings. What your saying is like saying Bradley Beal is as good as Steph or Harden because he put up great numbers the last 2 years. He isn’t."
"Middleton and Adebayo are great players, but they are way too high on this list. Why are they ahead of Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, and Donovan Mitchell?"
"1. Healthy LeBron is now the 4th best player in the world, behind KD, Giannis, and Luka. 1b. Luka is a better all around player than Steph (but it's close).   2. Bradley Beal is an overrated trade target. While a very good player, his size and position makes it tough for him to fit in with star point guards. Trading for him probably makes you better, but he won't turn most teams into title contenders.  3. NBA prospects should immediately hit a special free agency rather than be drafted. Teams cannot offer an amount that sets their cap equal to the luxury tax line, and cannot make an offer if they are over the luxury tax line. Contracts capped at 4 years for whatever a no. 1 overall draft pick salary would be."

"When scoring isn’t enough  Devin Booker put up 70 and still lost.  Think it was last year where Bradley Beal got a few 40pt games and somehow still kept losing while almost leading the league in scoring.  As an individual or team you can score all the points, but if you can’t win then it’s kinda pointless. It’s why the other aspects are so important"
"to further drive the point home that this isn't really a problem, bradley beal scored the second most ppg last season and no one thinks he's anywhere close to the second best player in the league"
I skimmed and read that as Bradley Beal
read this as bradley beal. fuck me
How did Tatum make the list but not book? Same w Bradley beal
76ers just kind of take a gap year. Embiid rests a lot. Simmons holds out until the trade deadline. Morey trades Tobias Harris for someone that we all think is washed up or not that great but then they turn out to be really fucking great. Ben Simmons gets traded at the deadline for Bradley Beal and the 2022-23 76ers are stacked.
Julius fucking RANDLE is better than Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal is beneath Paul George?? What has PG done in the past 2 years  Edit: just realizing how low Dame is too, this list is garbage"
T2 stars not a chance. You paying Bradley Beal a max to barely play? Hell nah
"&gt; Beal needs to make it as well this year to be supermax eligible.  That's not true actually, because Beal will be a 10 year vet next summer and thus will be eligible for the 35% 5 year max with 8% raises from the Wizards either way (or he could get a sign and trade elsewhere for 4 years at 35% of the cap with 5% annual raises, or roughly $179 million over 4 years).   However, if Beal doesn't want to wait until next summer, [he'll be eligible to sign a 4 year deal with Washington in a couple weeks.](https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1404957132336906241?s=19) Apparently here's how [that extension would break down if he signed it:](https://www-nbcsports-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/bradley-beal-will-be-eligible-extension-wizards-offseason?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#aoh=16324433338506&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcsports.com%2Fwashington%2Fwizards%2Fbradley-beal-will-be-eligible-extension-wizards-offseason)  &gt; Per ESPN's salary cap expert Bobby Marks, Beal can sign a contract with the Wizards worth about $181.5 million over four years this offseason ($45.4M annually), or wait until next offseason and sign for about $235 million over five years ($47M annually). He currently has a player option for the 2022-23 season, which was the second year on the two-year extension he signed in 2019, worth a projected $37.3 million."
"No problem with the list except for Bradley Beal. Granted I'm not a fan but does he really deserve top 15 over guys like Booker, Morant, Trae, Zion?"
How TF is Bradley Beal 15?  Kyrie is easy too 15 fucking Paul George at 12 gross
You have lost your mind if you don’t think he is better than Bradley Beal.
"Paul George and especially Bradley Beal are overrated, and Kawhi is crazy disrespected on this year’s list.  Kawhi is still top 5, Paul George isn’t better than Tatum, and Beal shouldn’t be on here Mitchell and Booker are better, I’d replace him with Kyrie"
"&gt; Bradley Beal    I love Bradley Beal but has anyone gotten more credit for less success than him? What has he done since Wall's injury, in terms of team success? I know his teams haven't been very good, and I am not expecting him to go on deep playoff runs with this squad, but last year he wasn't even the best player on his team and yet that other player is not on this list. Without that other player, the Wizards would not have even been a playoff team. But Brad Beal is regarded more highly. It doesn't make sense."
"How is it that ESPN's lists are always so uniquely stupid? Like last year's was even worse, but for this year let's just point out like some of the most obvious things:     * Jokic at #5. Undisputed MVP last year, and only going to get better. I guess he's ok, right? * LeBron at #3. Why not just put him as #1 again you brainless shills. * Jimmy Butler at #11 above fukkin Dame, PG, and Bradley Beal????"
Bradley Beal should not be on this list.
Bradley Beal is top 15 over Trae?
I would take Trae and CP3 over Bradley Beal. Maybe Booker too.
"I mean, with this criteria, you could even go as low as someone like Trae Young or Bradley Beal"
"Considering people gave him credit for the Wizards success over Bradley Beal, who is actually a superstar, that would mean ppl consider him a superstar"
"Bradley Beal is talking with Wizards rn for his upcoming contract, that could have been leaked during negotiations"
I mean sure. But there’s also a good chance his value depreciates by then and you have to include more of your other assets for said star. And at best it’s still gonna be a middling star.   For example you have no real shot at getting a Bradley Beal or a Damian Lillard. If those teams trade them they’ll want rebuilding packages and there are plenty of teams that could outbid Philly fairly easily.  In a best case scenerio it’s like a CJ McCollum or a Gordon Hayward
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Listen I get that the model looks at injury seasons unfavorably but cmon man lets be real for a second. Even if klay doesnt get his legs back and isnt a great defender anymore or cant drive to hoop like he used to his shooting alone will allow him to be at the very least a rotation player. This same metric has kevin durant, kyrie and bradley beal as borderline allstars while FVV is an allstar?? Likewise in what world in robert covington a borderline allstar?!? I dont care what advanced metrics they used to create this list, anyone with eyes who has actually watched basketball will tell you this list is complete garbage."
"&gt;Guys like Tatum, Beal, Booker can have a championship team built around them if they have solid playmakers, 3 and D guys and very good center.  Maybe in a vacuum, but versus real teams in the league? A team with Bradley Beal as their best player is not beating the Nets or the Bucks."
"I was trying to give you the benefit of a doubt, but maybe your brain isn't a good asset. You saying it was ""obvious"" about the bubble a year ago is bullshit. The bubble was extremely experimental and most people thought it wouldn't be successful enough to finish the Playoffs. Compared to now,, no one knew anything about covid, and everyone was scared of the ramifications of getting it.     Bradley Beal, Davis Bertans, DeAndre Jordan, and Spencer Dinwiddie all sat out the bubble. And guess what, they're all on teams. So I have no clue where you're getting this ""people don't want him because he wasn't in the bubble"" nonsense.     **The guy isn't as good as he used to be**. That's the only reason teams need not to sign him. But its weird you seem so hellbent on making it about covid."

I think of him as like a Byron Scott type. Like if he was in the modern NBA he would be a worse Bradley Beal. But this is a pure shit opinion based on speculation.
Bradley Beal is 28 and not a first option on a playoff contender imo. Building around him makes no sense. He should've been dealt years ago. He's an exceptional player but that's not someone you build around.
Every laker expert I have heard disagrees with you. You’re better off thinking of Bron playing the Bradley Beal role of last year.
Homie what the fuck do you think we traded for Westbrook for? And do you understand Lebron is 37 years old this season? Every single person involved with the Lakers has said they expect Lebron to play a more off ball role. Obviously that changes in the playoffs and in crunch time. But the majority of the season he’ll be playing the “Bradley Beal role” that Russ had last year.
"Honestly, I don't think he was as bad as he played. He was still knocking off rust and was encouraged to over shoot as a tank commander. On a team like the Clips I think he would tone back the shots and pass more which he is still very good at. I was less than impressed with his defense but yet again that's more conditioning and not wanting to give his all to the worst team in the league. Also, for some reason people seem to think the John Wall is a Westbrook or Simmons level shooter. Below is some [3pt shooting stats](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/numbers-john-wall-sees-himself-playing-ball-alongside-improved-bradley-beal) from recent years.  2018-19 Overall 3PT%: 30.2 Catch and shoot 3s: 37.3 Pull-up 3s: 20.6  2017-18 Overall 3PT%: 37.3 Catch and shoot 3s: 43.8 Pull-up 3s: 31.3  2016-17 Overall 3PT%: 33 Catch and shoot 3s: 35.9 Pull-up 3s: 30.5  2015-16 Overall 3PT%: 35.4 Catch and shoot 3s: 38.4 Pull-up 3s: 31.3  On catch and shoot 3pt shots Wall is a serviceable shooter. You cannot just leave him open. Because of this I don't expect Wall to damage spacing as much as people seem to expect. Would he be maximized by being the worst shooter on the floor? Yes, it would open up his driving far more. However, you can still play Wall with traditional centers.  I should add that I still don't think the Clips should gut the roster for him and I don't think the Rockets are buying him out."
"idk why but i consider 16-6-6 to be the lamelo statline.  trae young owns the 30-10+ games for me.  deandre jordan, dwight howard and robert williams are 7-14-3 block guys.  can't forget the bradley beal 35-2-3"
Yes I’d trade Bradley Beal for peak Michael Jordan
"Giannis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Paul George/Bradley Beal/Donovan Mitchell/Klay Thompson would be favorites there dude. They would have better shooting and defense pretty handily, and could play great zone with Giannis and Brook Lopez to force shots from the nets"
"I'm sure someone else probably mentioned it already but the clip that motivates me the most is the Bradley Beal one from sometime in the last year I think talking to those college players, you can tell how passionate he is about basketball conveying this to those kids."
Alex caruso or Bradley beal
Did he just copy Bradley Beal
"This reminds me of the Bradley Beal clip that was posted where he talked about how hard guys needed to work to get their shot in the NBA. “Because not only do you need to be elite but you have elite guys like me working hard also, you won’t take my spot. “"
"The list of people who they have ranked as worse prospects than Elfrid is pretty epic. Embiid, Giannis, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gobert, Bradley Beal, it just goes on and on and on, lol."
"Charlotte &gt; Washington &gt; Toronto  Charlotte could only get better despite their losses. If Gordon Hayward stays healthy throughout the season, the team could definitely build some chemistry and be a solid 6-8th seed. A lot of their success would depend on how much better LaMelo would be.   Washington lost a lot of continuity after the Westbrook trade though it would be interesting to see how Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, and Montrezl would fit in with the team. Rui’s development might be stunted if he competes with Kuzma for pt. It’s really hard to see them being a solid playoff contender and I don’t think Bradley Beal will be having a better season. Could compete for a play-in spot if they don’t have any major setbacks.   A lot of people be sleep on the Raptors after a disorderly season not even being able to have games in their homecourt. That being said, securing the play-in spot seems dim for a team that just lost Kyle Lowry and are looking to shop (I think?) Paskal Siakam. They still do have a lot of good players like OG, and Troy Barnes looks promising. They might surprise people, might not, definitely not a better team on paper than Washington or Charlotte."
Nah they gotta put Bradley Beal in Memphis
Soo he’s Bradley Beal?
"I mean he made it work with Bradley Beal for all those years, I imagine he can. Personally, I'd rather they stagger his minutes so that majority of the time he's playing with the bench, we could use a scorer/playmaker running that second unit."
PG - De'Aaron Fox ($3)  SG - Bradley Beal ($8)  SF - Jayson Tatum ($7)  PF - Draymond Green ($3)  C - Joel Embiid ($9)
Bradley Beal.

Bradley Beal
"I mean, that's the narrative that's been thrown around after the high-profile LeBron, Harden, KD, etc. moves  But once you look past those few examples, you have Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Giannis, Gobert, Embiid, Marcus Smart, KAT, all guys who have been on their teams for quite a long time and/or have signed long contract extensions that will likely keep them at the same team for several years.  That's just off the top of my head. Tim Duncan and Kobe only retired what, 5 seasons ago? And Nowitzki in 2019.  Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat's roster.  And the NBA has been incredibly cold and cutthroat at times in other eras.  Jerry Krause cut Phil Jackson loose from the Bulls after he won 6 championships. The Bulls also locked Scottie Pippen into an incredibly low-value contract and refused to renegotiate when the salary rules changed the year after his contract was signed.  And players forcing trades happened in other eras too: Dominique Wilkins refused to play in Utah and forced a trade.  Stephon Marbury demanded a trade out of Minnesota when he didn't get along with KG. Kareem demanded a trade to L.A. because he thought Milwaukee was too small of a stage for him.  Ultimately I don't actually think the NBA is fundamentally very different for the vast majority of players.  There have always been top players who used their leverage over teams, and there have always been teams who didn't look out for their players unless it was convenient.  The main difference now is that it's all happening on social media and everyone's *constantly* talking about it."
"sigh always reddit always. 14% of his shots come from 10-16ft  20-21: 34.9%  19-20: 39.6%  most likely just noise there, but sure 2021 called and wants 2019 tatum back? idk  he also shoots 41.7% from 3-10ft (20% of his FGA) and 42.2% from 16ft-3pt line (but only 8.8% of attempts) while attempting 19.7% of his FGA from 0-3ft.  that ain't it.  you know what 30ppg looks like? Bradley Beal shoots 53% from 3-10ft, 47% 10-16ft, and 45.2% from 16-3pt with 27.4/14.3/13.6% of his attempts coming from those areas of the floor. he also shoots 7.7FT/g compared to Tatum 5.3  so tatum either needs to get on that level or cut out his mid-range game."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Tell you what: I'd love to see him with Bradley Beal. Feel like they'd be a good fit together.
"I'm torn on which of these categories Bradley Beal fits into.   He does his Matrix shit on layups, but also seems to drive AT defenders rather than around them"
"I'm with you, but Zach was balling too  [comparison of their stats last season.](https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/compare/bradley-beal-zach-lavine.php)"
Jaylen brown&gt;Bradley beal
"Bradley beal, Andrew wiggins"
"Yeah even that OKC team was mad stacked. Ppl said the big3 weren't MVP yet, but they were those players 4 years before, so not that far. Also odds favourited the young athletic okc; LeBron had choker reputation upon his head and neither bookies trusted him. That's why for me LBJ is one step ahead of kd in chasing history: he proved he could win with ""those cats"" and redeemed himself. If kd win one with Bradley Beal, I'll consider him too among the goats. But let's be clear about this KD: one/two stars it's ok, but best shooter, DPOY, COY and 2nd best shooters in nba, nah, that won't count"
"People said the same about James harden, and jaylen brown, and Bradley Beal. Remember when people were saying beal won’t be anything more than a 3 point shooter?"
"It was Jamal Murray and Bradley Beal for me, although that was more a couple of years ago they don't piss me off as much anymore. I think it's easy to misinterpret their confidence as arrogance for some reason"
"That’s seems a bit unfair. It’s not like the kings are a bottom feeder like the cavs. They’ve generally finished fairly close to the play-in and were the 9 seed a few years back.  Ben has him beat in defence but playmaking id probably go fox. Ben is a great passer but he’s no scoring threat and doesn’t space the floor at all which are both large parts of playmaking. Fox does those and is an extremely good passer in his own right. And assist wise he has way less assist opportunities via team mates than Ben does.   And the scoring gap is substantial. Very close efficiency but fox has a way deeper bag and averaged a whole ten extra points? That’s comparable to the gap between MPJ and Damian Lillard, or Andrew wiggins and Bradley Beal"
"&gt; the more I think of it, I think they won't extend both Grant and Romeo.   They have to make that particular decision before *this* season starts. There is no way they are going to decide to not pick up their options now just in case Bradley Beal decides he wants to go to Boston next summer. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but Beal will be eligible to sign an extension in a couple weeks. All this could be rendered moot if he signs that."

"&gt; Teams seem willing to work with players on sign-and-trades.  Well they do if keeping their star player isn't possible. Like this article says, Toronto was willing to work with Lowry to sign and trade him because Miami could have renounced players and signed him with cap space, so the Raptors preferred to just get something back rather than lose him outright.   But then when talking about Bradley Beal and the Celtics they point out that Boston won't be able to clear the space to just sign him so they'll need the Wizards to be willing to trade him. But if Beal can't threaten to walk if they don't trade him, will Washington still be willing to do so? I'd imagine in that case the trade return would have to be significantly higher than what Toronto got for Lowry.   With Lowry Toronto couldn't say ""good luck getting this done without our involvement"" because Miami could have done it without them. But Boston won't be able to do that, as the only way they could get Beal is if Washington helps out.  As such it might take a significant trade package to get that done."
"Guys like James Harden, Kyrie, Bradley Beal, and many more will make it off their name alone. It's about notoriety.   Soon enough, young bloods like Lamelo will start making it too."
"And I don't think anyone really wants to shed salary cause there's no real need to have a bunch of cap space. Next year's free agency class is going to be incredibly thin. Right now it's pretty much Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and we don't even know if either guy will really be available. Beal could sign an extension next month."

"there's a ""you know, I'll settle for bradley beal"" somewhere in there"
I’d pick KAT over these guys if I’m building a team from scratch.  - Klay post injury.  - Paul George - Jimmy Butler - Jamal Murray - Rudy Gobert - Bradley Beal - Chris Paul - Kylie Irving
"It’s not about even training with the team guys. It’s about training with a recognized NBA shooting coach, which Simmons  refuses to do.   For example, Embiid didn’t train with the Sixers last year, but he went to train with the same guy who trains Taytum and Bradley Beal to work on his stamina and his mid-range shooting. Cool, no one has a problem with that! That’s a real NBA shooting coach. I think Embiid said something about how Jimmy Butler showed him how important having that coach was.   If Ben had gone to work with Chris Brinkley (shooting coach for KD, Melo, McCollum etc). No one would say anything. He’s a real coach. But Simmons literally refused to work with anyone but his brother. That’s the bigger issue. The Sixers would have paid to bring in any real shooting coach. But Simmons wouldn’t do it. That’s ridiculous and shows he’s more interested in other things than getting better."
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
"watch young bradley beal highlights. he used to FLY.  he still does, of course, but he got better at crafty finishing at the rim and definitely doesn't dunk as often."
"Hindsight is 20/20 but I totally drank the Kool aid on him. I remember thinking ""he's literally going be one of the best wing defenders in the NBA and possibly be in the running for DPOY consistently. If he can develop any type of jump shot, he'll basically be Kawhi."" I also remember thinking Drummond was a steal and Bradley Beal was a horrible reach in that draft, so I was probably just dumb as shit."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
Bradley Beal
"According to what I saw back then and the little I can find still online, Simmons was measured at 6’9.5”. Six inches from that is 6’3.5”, which is like John Wall or Bradley Beal. I don’t know how measurements have changed later, many people seem to have grown from their “unofficial official” heights from 2019, I think Zion, Tatum and Ingram are now listed taller than their pre-season measurements (maybe they grew, maybe teams have started fudging the numbers again, I have no idea)."
"Bradley Beal   Great scorer, but he's gonna make most backcourts really small. Tough against teams like Milwaukee. I'd say he's the 3rd best player on a championship team. Maybe a #2, but I doubt it."
"Bradley Beal is good, but I don’t think he’s top 10-12."
"except ws/48 isn't indictive of actual skill. Look at that list, for the 2018-19 season, and tell me if the results are remotely useful. Javale mcgee is a top 40 player in the league while kemba walker, bradley beal, draymond aren't. Klay thompson isn't in the top 100 players in the league. it doesn't show anything"
Okay he was too high but you're way too low. Name 20 guys better than Bradley Beal at basketball
yeah i mean no offense but last year it was bradley beal and it was so obvious they were desperate for drama that they sunk to him…like as soon as giannis signed the extension the nba media machine was like fuck!
Challenge accepted  * D. Rose's peak wouldn't have been that much better than his MVP season.  * D-Wade at his best was as good as Kobe.  * I'm cool with Iggy winning FMVP over Steph.  * The Raptors will be just fine this upcoming season.  * Never thought that the 76ers were serious contenders with the exception of the 2019 postseason.  * It isn't bad to just be a good/solid team for years.  * Bradley Beal is (slightly) overrated.
"In no particular order and off the top of my head: LeBron, KD, Jokic, Giannis, Kawhi, Harden, Curry, Luka, Embiid, Dame. All of these players are better than Beal. I’m sure someone could name more. In no world is Bradley Beal a top 10 NBA player."
"&gt;Free agents choosing in that offseason is not a problem.   That's all AD did. That's exactly what he promised to do. Would you as a Celtics fan have been happier if he'd kept it to himself that he didn't plan to sign a free agent contract with the Celtics? Would you have been happier if he'd lied to them like Kyrie and said he'd be back if they wanted him only to leave instead?    I feel like you'd come across as more honest if you abandoned this bullshit about how ""it's detrimental to the league"" and just say you were pissed he didn't want to play for your team. You'll be more than happy to welcome Bradley Beal with open arms if he makes his way to the Celtics, just like you were when Kyrie forced his way out of Cleveland, so don't be such a blatant hypocrite."
"Why? He'd have been a free agent a year after that trade no matter what (and even was one after being traded to the Lakers). Every free agent gets to choose where they want to sign. Why is it only a problem for AD?   Was it better for the league that KD waited till free agency and then left OKC to sign with the Warriors? Would you similarly think it's problematic if Bradley Beal decides he only wants to play for the Celtics next year? What if he tells the Wizards that he doesn't plan to re-sign with them no matter what and he wants them to trade him to Boston as that's the only team he'll re-sign with. Still a problem for the league, or would that be OK for some reason? If so, why?"
"Harden and KD won’t play enough games and I’d be surprised if the warriors ask Steph to do what he did last year.   I’m going to guess Luka, Zach Lavine  or Bradley Beal"
"I feel confident about Bradley Beal. He was an inch of winning it last season, and Russell Westbrook was taking 19 shots a game."
Bradley Beal is 100% a primary ball handler and he had the 4th highest usage rate in the NBA and yet Westbrook still put up nearly 12 assists per game.
"Wiggins, Gobert, Simmons (prior to the playoffs), Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, Matisse Thybulle, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal, Butler, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton, Westbrook,"
To team up with former babysitter bradley beal
This is how we know you haven’t watched us play this year.  This isn’t Bradley Beal and a bunch of scrubs anymore. Probably the deepest bench in the entire League.
How the hell did Bradley Beal out-rebound Daniel Gafford?
"I would argue he's barely that.  Him and Bradley Beal barely made playoffs at 4 games under 500? Yikes, that's a pretty low floor."
Bradley Beal with the double-double on 7 for 25 shooting. What A Win!!
Am I better than Bradley Beal?
What is that Bradley Beal outfit?
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"He was in no way even close to his 2016 form so I’m glad you mentioned that   Westbrook played in the 2020 NBA, where Trae Young basically did 30/10 efficiently and Bradley Beal put up prime Kobe numbers.  It’s a joke compared to what was possible in 2016 before space and pace.   And does he really get the benefit of the doubt on his COVID thing when every playoff run before and after was the exact same disaster, and statistically similar?  And it’s not like he was playing smart. Westbrook was running around doing dumb shit in the 2020 playoffs that had nothing to do with injury."
Bradley Beal top 10? Lmaoooo
There isn't a world in which Bradley Beal is a top 10 player
Bradley Beal is a stretch
Bradley Beal was definitely not top 10 last year
He passed covid protocol but he’ll be worked back into shape slowly: https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/rui-hachimura-cleared-protocol-bradley-beal-practices-despite-injury
Rebuild doesn’t have to last that long at all. Make a couple more solid draft hits and trade assets for a star player that wants out. Most teams trading their Bradley Beal level players are typically gonna be looking for picks more than anything else. Get a star and a quality role player through trades to pair with Shai and Giddy (depending on whose trades from their team) and their roster could be upgraded pretty fast
"I got a list  1. CP3 2. Embiid 3. Harden 4. John Collins  5. Kelly Olynyk  6. Blake Griffin 7. Bam  8. Herro  9. Dragic 10. Booker 11. Crowder 12. AD 13. Bradley Beal   Fully prepared to get downvoted by fans of these guys, just can’t stand watching them sometimes."
Bradley Beal does not deserve his all star selections because he can't impact winning.
Yup. He came into a league that was top heavy and an absolute dog shit east back then. AI today won’t even win MVP. He’d be a worse version of Bradley Beal or a slightly better undersized version of Derozan
Bradley beal is considerably better than devin booker.
The only reason he is so popular now is game winners. He would be a Bradley Beal type right now where he gets next to no recognition. Not saying he doesn’t deserve to be recognized for his efforts but the guy is very overrated
"Allen Iverson is not a Top 50 player in NBA history, and in today's NBA he's no better than Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal (particularly since he such was a poor 3-pt shooter, but in fairness that wasn't as necessary in his era).  Elite durability, elite toughness, elite stamina, an amazing player for his size. But his entire offense was built on isolation scoring, so while he would score 30+ points per game, his offenses were regularly in the bottom 10.   The counter argument to that is that he never had good players around him, so he had to do it all himself on offense. My counter to that counter: the only way to win with Iverson was to build the offense around giving him the ball every single time, and he was so bad on defense that you HAD to surround him with defense-heavy players like Eric Snow, Theo Ratliff, Dikembe Mutombo, etc.  The majority of AI's legacy is due to his off-court persona and his one Finals run, and more specifically beating the Lakers in one game, and even more specifically than *that* the moment where he stepped over Tyronn Lue. Without the Finals run, Iverson never got past the 2nd round of the playoffs.  Even that one Finals run was overrated IMO. They beat a bad Pacers team (ok fine, it's round 1), then they barely escaped the 5-seed Raptors at the buzzer of game 7, then they beat the Bucks in 7 in a series that I 100% believe was rigged, and then lost to the Lakers in 5.   Basically I think that Iverson's career played out **exactly** as it had to play out to build his legacy. He has a coach that allows him to take every shot, he has a franchise that surrounds him with defenders and low-usage players to maximize AI's talents on offense, he has a single Finals run through some very lucky circumstances, and then he has an iconic moment in NBA history stepping over Lue. Without all of that, he's another high volume, low efficiency scorer that never could advance in the playoffs.  People just dismiss it as ""you didn't see him play"" -- I'm 35, those were my prime viewing years. And my best friend was an AI fanboy so I definitely watched him a *ton*."
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Bradley Beal is overrated and one dimensional. Other than scoring because he’s the only one that shoots the ball he doesn’t really add anything else
Here's another one: Bradley Beal making All-NBA over Trae and Devin Booker last season was ridiculous.
Westbrook was more important to the Wizards last season than Bradley Beal.  Super unpopular opinion.
Zach lavine is better than Bradley Beal

so he'd be an 18 ppg 2nd star and that's bradley beal?
"it’s like y’all don’t watch basketball, bradley beal??  ai shot from ranges of like 26%-33% from 3.   he’d be a bona fide  russell westbrook, and not a good teammate in modern nba"
"Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, the Love machine."
"I agree that Iverson’s 2001 run is overrated, but I don’t think I can rightfully get behind the notion that any superstar guard at the time would have led the 76ers to the Finals.  Especially when those 76ers beat 2 superstar guards (with comparable help) en route to the Finals.  In the ECSF, the 76ers versed the Raptors with peak Vince Carter, who was playing alongside Antonio Davis. It might sound like a milkman name in hindsight, but the guy was a serviceable big at the time/fringe All-Star type player. VC averaged 30/6/6 on 56.7% TS in their series. The 76ers still won.  In the ECF, the 76ers versed the Bucks with Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, and Glenn Robinson. Those were 3 great offensive weapons at the time, especially Ray. Ray averaged 27/3/5 on 61.4% TS and the Bucks still lost.  Part of why the 76ers were able to get past the East was because of their great team defense (side note: Larry Brown is an underrated coach), but defense isn’t even half the game. The 76ers don’t get past the Bucks without Mutumbo deciding to suddenly play like his Denver self, but the 76ers were only in a position to contend because of Iverson.  That team literally had zero offensive weapons. Tyrone Hill, Aaron McKie, Dikembe…these were all talented players, but they were all poor offensive players even by 2001 standards. Without Iverson literally taking nearly every shot and helping those less talented scorers get open looks by way of his gravity/defense coverage, they had absolutely no chance of even getting past the 2nd round.  Yes, in his MVP year, Allen Iverson shot at league-average TS. But do you think the 76ers would have won anywhere near 56 games that year if Iverson wasn’t scoring 30+ a night and helping his teammates get open looks all game? If your sole scorer is relatively inefficient yet you are still winning a bunch of games, you can’t just chalk it up to good D. Good D can only take you so far.   The 76ers had a +6 increase in ORTG with Iverson on the floor in 2001. Tyrone Hill, the 76ers starting PF that year, shot 49.6% from the field with Allen on the floor and **39.5%** with Allen off the floor. He was their team’s entire offensive engine and they couldn’t have gotten to where they did without him.  I don’t think he’d be better than a Giannis/KD/Steph/Jokic/LeBron, but he definitely would be better than a guy like Bradley Beal, who people on here are comparing him to. He was one of the better guards in an era where scoring from the perimeter/being a successful guard was incredibly difficult given the defensive nature of the league at the time + how offenses were orchestrated back then."
Where ever you put Bradley Beal
"If Lakers fans are upset that everyone shits on them, why don't they start being the positive ones?  It's always the Lakers fans trying to start shit. Example: the guy with the Lakers flair that just made a post shitting on Bradley Beal."
"Fuck Bradley Beal. Little clown boy, take your ass to Walgreens bitch"
"Exactly. At one point Otto Porter Jr (got a max RFA offer sheet) was being paid a higher salary than John Wall and Bradley Beal while on the same team. But somehow the ""others"" are being screwed over in this system... lol  Giannis is only making about $5-10mil more per year than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. He is drastically underpaid bc his salary is capped by the CBA"
Looking like Bradley Beal out there
"What is he gonna do? What is he gonna do that he wasn't able to do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal?   He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's gonna win games for sure but how much will it matter in the playoffs when this is the same Lakers team that sagged off of him during the Bubble Run.  The only way I see him get busy is when you make him the 6th man and he plays with Monk, Melo, Dwight and Ariza while AD and LeBron are on the bench. Even then his shooting inability is a detriment to winning basketball. Even then, I don't think that's possible coz why you paying this dude who never learns $40M as the 6th man."
"Bradley Beal shrugs and throws his arms out waaaaaay too much when he doesn’t get foul calls.  Noticed he started doing it a couple seasons ago but it’s become a thing that **every single time he gets hit on a layup and misses, he immediately turns to the ref and his throws his arms out and glares at the ref like he should be getting a call every single time**"
"Ja Morant wasn't 30 ppg? Hold on... ooh, I was thinking Bradley Beal."
Bradley Beal
People have said Bradley Beal yet but he definitely needs a mention in the conversation
"Your reasoning is so stupid it practically drools. By that logic Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, and KAT aren't good players. None of these guys, Trae included, are winning jackity shit on the Thunder. Have you seen the rest of that roster?  Also, are you suggesting total shooting is somehow a flawed stat? I can't make heads or tails of that comment."
"The game is more than scoring bud, or would you rather have Bradley Beal than a healthy Klay Thompson"
"Go back and read our conversation—I’m not sure where your aggression is coming from, but I think you’ll be pretty embarrassed to realize that you’re completely overreacting to my benign comments.  It is my understanding that 538 is a literal real-time projection that becomes more accurate as the season progresses. Again, I’m not an expert, but I thought that it was widely agreed upon that those projections cannot be used as an indication of the postseason until at least a few weeks into the season. I think that such projections can be useful, I am not disregarding 538, but it is my understanding that there aren’t enough data for the projections to reflect reality just yet.  I said that it wasn’t crazy to assume the Bulls will get sixth seed in the East, which is literally what the Vegas odds you listed project, so I’m not sure where the disagreement there is.  The media is definitely not overrating the Bulls from what I’ve seen—if you can point to some overhyped TV segments or articles, I’d be surprised. I disagree with you about Zach LaVine—I mean, look where Devin Booker was without CP3. And look where Bradley Beal is (and has been) for years. But regardless, basketball teams are generally improved by adding very good players. The Bulls have done that, and we literally have only three people on our team that were there at the beginning of last season. This is not the Bulls team that people are familiar with—they are an exciting, fast-paced, fun to watch team that makes a real efforts on both ends. They have multiple guaranteed scoring options with some killer perimeter defenders. Our bench isn’t particularly deep, but it is better than bad with a few truly good players and prospects. Again, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised where we’re at in a few months! Feel free to rub it in my face if I’m wrong."
"A big knock on Brad Stevens (whom many regarded as a good coach) early in his tenure was the lineups he put out were questionable. People freaking out over Udoka after 2 games need to settle down as things like schemes take time to implement with guys who were so used to Stevens’ system (Tatum, Brown and Smart specifically). Yeah we were getting killed on the boards and turning the ball over too much, it’s gotta be fixed. Could have used Kanter for a bit there instead of Grant at the 5 in the 3Q even if his defense is abysmal, and Tatum/Brown never seem to have good games at the same time. I think it’s reasonable to question their fit if this continues through this year.  In any case, I’m not sure why the expectations were so high when all the Bradley Beal to the Celtics rumors months ago fell through and we ended up with Dennis Schroder, Josh Richardson, Al Horford and Enes Kanter, but otherwise the EXACT same team and people thought these guys would move the needle to push them to the 3 seed? It was always going to be a non-contending year and they 100% have to land a guy next off season or you can start to blame the FO for not getting the personnel they need to contend.  Sorry, but a bunch of guys who are basically 6th men/bench guys hasn’t changed that. It’s going to be another rough year for Celtics fans I think."
"Bradley beal and John wall. Randy wittman was bad enough, then they made it even worse by bringing in Scott brooks thinking that it would somehow attract Durant, when in reality Durant already knew how bad of a coach brooks was and knew he wasn’t a guy he could win with, so you wasted five years of these guys on a stupid coaching hire that did the complete opposite of what you thought it would do, not to mention all the stupid ass personnel moves by grunfeld during his tenure like giving Ian mahinmi 4/64 trading Kelly Oubre for the corpse of Trevor ariza and plenty of other terrible decisions I’ve blocked out of my memory. Grunfeld and wittman/brooks did everything they could to thwart this team and wall and beal still drug them to the playoffs every year. Scott got so thoroughly outcoached by Brad Stevens in the Celtics series when John hit that game winner in game 6 to extend the series that it makes me puke every time I think about it. John played through wear and tear injuries for years and now he’s too broken down to be a consistently effective player, and I’m praying the new management has enough sense to make good on what we have left from beal, returns are positive so far but guh what a waste of mainly John walls tremendous potential"
Bradley Beal
"I think he is. Dude is a bad off ball defender and is late in transition D. He also is inefficient shooting the ball. Russell Westbrook going 100% speed is the only good thing about him in offense (its the only good thing he does on offense other than the obvious kickout to the open man) and even then his passes are reckless and so are his handles. He's a point guard yet I don't trust him in handling the ball compared to other elite point guards. Dude is too reckless and that's just not good.   Don't get me wrong he has upside, but his downsides overweigh what he can give to the Lakers team. He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's been traded three times now and for a good reason.   What's he gonna do now that he didn't do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal? This is the same Lakers team that left him wide open during the Bubble when they eliminated the Rockets. What's he gonna do? Tell me? Distribute the ball and kick it out? How many times will he turnover the ball? And if he does, do you really want LeBron and AD be spot up shooters for him? How many times will he shoot an unnecessary jumper?"
"&gt;*""Russ is a fucking loser, that's what I gotta say about this. It only takes one game when it comes to Russ to know that he's a detriment to the team. He's a detriment to himself...I don't know any other player in NBA history where the only downside to the player IS THEMSELVES.

"""Sir, I would like to speak to the manager. I ordered one Bradley Beal, not a Russell Westbrook."""
Westbrook gonna be traded mid season... to the Wizards for Bradley Beal.
"The best lineup I can think of:   PG: **Trae Young** - lacks the size to be a SG  SG: **Bradley Beal** - too small to be a SF, can't run point  SF: **Gordon Hayward** - most SFs are pretty versatile but Hayward is one of the few who can't really slide to SG or PF, despite having a range of skills  PF: **Julius Randle** - prototypical PF; too slow to be a SF, lacks the skills or height to be a C   C: **Joel Embiid** - you pair him next to any other true center, you're going to have a bad time.   So yeah that's a damn good team that sweeps their way to a championship."
You can't compare 90s game and be like oh Bradley beal averaged more points so he's better. Absolutely ridiculous that you think someone who had never carried a team to the finals is better than a player who has done it twice.

Westbrook shooting is like turning the ball over. A Westbrook shot is equivalent to a turnover at this point. I don't like it.*  &gt;*My arms are literally sitting in my chair CLENCHING every time he touch the ball. I shouldn't watch basketball like that. You shouldn't have to clench every time a man touches the basketball. That's not fair. Why we paying you $40 Million for my butthole to be buckered. That's not fair. I don't like it""*  - [a Laker fan reaction after Westbrook's debut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-DCPU58j28&amp;t=1080s)"

Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
Bradley Beal
"I’m more upset about Lillard over Dwight honestly. This might be a hot take, and I love to watch him play, but Lillard is what happens when Bradley Beal gets an ounce of complementary talent and is able to hit two career-defining shots in quick succession. His resume isn’t the same as guys who got left off this list"
"They need a second scoring option and they can make it work. A vaccinated Kyrie would work, Ingram, McCollum fox would work. There’s a lot of options I bet the sixers would accept that aren’t dame or Bradley Beal but there’s probably literally 0 market for Simmons rn"
"I suspect Morey had some reasonable options over the summer. The issue seems to be that Morey wants to trade his disgruntled star for a player who's even better than him. He wants to turn Simmons into a Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard, which is probably what he wanted to do anyways.   A lot of front offices would have traded Simmons over the off-season. I guess we will see how Morey's approach pans out."
It's gotta be Bradley Beal.
"Yeah ik, it’s just odd to call Beal “Bradley” or KD “Kevin”"
What did you see in Bradley Beal and the Wizards that made you want to sign with them after the trade.
"Bradley Beal has 4 steals, I am glad that he is trying to improce his defensive game."

"Gimme dat Wizards spot  Bradley Beal and the Wizards come into this season with a clear goal: more ball movement, more balanced scoring, and better defense. By trading Westbrook for solid contributors (Kuzma, Harrell, Dinwiddie), our roster has become deeper. Add the return of Bryant, more growth from Hachimura and Avdija, and a smart new coach in Wes Unseld Jr, and this team might surprise with a 6th or 7th seed. The ripples of John Wall's megacontract (and other Ernie-era mistakes) are now officially behind us."
Bradley Beal will drop 60 and y’all will still lose your play-in game
Bradley Beal?
I love watching Bradley Beal play he reminds me a poor man's gary trent
Wizards finally have enough good players around Bradley Beal to have some depth and then they trade them away for a cry baby.
"How do you get:  &gt;Bradley Beal is still uncertain about his future with the Washington Wizards  from:   &gt;Almost every game we play, someone says something"
Kyrie is the most outspoken head case. Did you hear Bradley Beal? Dude is fucked in the head.
"Kareem acting like Kyrie has COVID and is spreading it willy nilly. He’s not the only unvaccinated player, just the only one who’s getting penalties.  Shit, even Bradley Beal can play when the wizards visit NY"
Plot twist! Simmons doesn't play the sixers start the year 3-15 And Embid askes for a trade. Simmons ends up as an excellent partner for Bradley Beal and averages a triple double before proceeding to shoot 22% from the free-throw line in the playoffs as the sixers lose to the Joel embiid wizards. Simmons spends 2022 to 2023 in a body cast after being beaten up by sixer fans. The most chaotic time line!
PEOPLE ONLY TALK ABOUT MY WIZARDS IF ITS A BRADLEY BEAL TRADE.   BUT NOW ITS NOT JUST THAT.       WE NOW HAVE AMBER ROSE. I MEAN KYLE KUZMA.   KYLE.     KUZMA.
Bradley Beal could get 180 million anywhere
They better stop zooming in on him pouting and starting free Bradley Beal tags then
Ben Simmons was the runner up defensive player of the year. He has amazing play making ability and is a great player he just doesn’t fit our system.    There are a lot of teams that could use Ben Simmons and I think he’d fit perfectly into the Blazers with McCollum.    I also think if Bradley Beal wants to leave what better player are they going to get over Ben Simmons and why would that team trade that player?
"I don't think it's unfair to Kyrie, since I feel this should be the standard for all teams/players.  So rather I think it's unfair for other players ""getting away"" with it rather than one player catching consequences (and he still gets half his salary, cry him a river).  But the only part I \*do\* think is unfair to Kyrie is that no one is clowning Bradley Beal or Michael Porter Jr for their similarly idiot stances.  I guess Kyrie's extra special since when mandates rolled around Bazemore and Wiggins went along with it (and that's kind of the point, push holdouts to get it)."
I literally said the reason he wasn’t traded was because we don’t expect him Lillard or Bradley Beal but we do expect better packages than Brogdon and pics
"It’s unfair how unvaccinated players on other teams are allowed to come to NY for away games. Like what sense does it make if Kyrie can’t play in Barclays but anti-vax Bradley Beal is allowed? I understand it’s bc Kyrie is technically employed in NYC but it’s still stupid. Either don’t allow any unvaccinated players in NY of allow all of them  If anything, allowing away unvaccinated players is actually more dangerous because they have to fly in and other cities probably have higher covid cases than NYC"
Brogdon and picks doesn’t increase our chances of winning a championship. The real reason Ben Simmons wasn’t traded is not because we expect a star like Damien Lillard or Bradley Beal but because teams will get more desperate then we will closer to the trade deadline and will trade more than that for Ben Simmons. The starting lineup we have now of Maxi Curry Green Harris and Embiid can win 40-48 games which is enough to get into the playoffs in the east easily. Better packages than Brogdon and picks will come.  Do people not realize that what’s happening right now is the most expected outcome of the situation and the Sixers wouldn’t have agreed to do it if they didn’t expect to happen?
It’s also unfair how unvaccinated players on other teams are allowed to come to NY for away games. Like what sense does it make if Kyrie can’t play in Barclays but anti-vax Bradley Beal is allowed? I understand it’s bc Kyrie is technically employed in NYC but it’s still stupid. Either don’t allow any unvaccinated players in NY of allow all of them
Bradley Beal
"From a NBA perspective, it is unfair that Bradley Beal gets to play at Barclays but kyrie doesn't. It should be all or none allowed at Barclays."
"It does not make sense at all. **Ayton on a 5-year deal would be a great asset**. It's a non-sense for PHX to not give an extension to him. The worst-case scenario, B.Simmons still holds a value for the 76ers because he's locked for a multi-year deal.  For D.Ayton with 4-5 year max deal, there would be a lot of teams that offer king's ransom.  * Trade requested Bradley Beal or D.Lillard would be available for that asset. * Any rebuilding team like OKC or Magic can easily give top picks, young assets for him. An average top 3 pick in draft would be worth less than Ayton."
"Mobley, Lauri, and JA fit great together. I really don’t understand why people think otherwise. Makes no sense. 3 guys who fit well together and can play interchangeably between 2 positions isn’t a problem.  Love will be odd man out. He’s basically a non-consideration in all of our plans and moves.  Also no shit Sexton plays the 2. Astute observation, he’s been the 2 since we drafted Garland. Saying he “just” gets points is dumb as fuck. I guess Bradley Beal “just” gets points so he’s worthless too. Dame “just” gets points. What a bunch of scrubs."
"The best player was Bradley Beal, they were 32-28 with him  They were 30-35 with Westbrook"
"Wait, so Bradley Beal can play in NY but Kyrie can’t?"
Don't be like Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal will average 37 points per game
"Yeah I do think that it is stupid to allow visiting unvaccinated players like Bradley Beal to play, but not Kyrie. Either ban them all or let them all play"
"I’m excited to him in NYC and I think with a different role and 9 mill a year contract he can turn things around, but the wizards game last night made me really believe everything Boston fans have been saying. He got blown by on every defensive possession, he made Raul Neto look like Bradley Beal on offense"
"I'm not a Kyrie defender, but Kyrie isn't antivax. He's being arrogant and apparently wants to make a point about being mandated. He hasn't criticized the vaccine and isn't promoting antivax, like Bradley Beal.  I think he should get the vaccine because it's about protecting others. SAS is making this about basketball, which it shouldn't be."
"Kinda funny to me how Bradley Beal, who is also unvaccinated, managed to completely fly under the radar in all of this."
"I mean, I feel like taking injuries into account for questions like these isn’t fair, because that’s not exactly something easy to predict. Look at Bradley Beal. After they were drafted, if you decided that Dion Waiters would be the better player because Beal couldn’t stay healthy, you’d look like an idiot.  You just can’t assume someone is going to keep getting injured, especially when it’s been reported several times that Zion doesn’t like how the front office takes it so slow with him coming back from injury and feels he could have come back earlier, especially his rookie year."
"Dude the fact that you think Westbrook is a good playoff performer isnt just laughable…it’s ridiculous.  He should have given more shots to umm….checks notes uhh…Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden, and Bradley Beal…oh nvm he’s a better scorer than them, right?"
"Kyrie, Simmons, Bradley Beal, Bazemore, Trey Burke, Kuzma to the Kings for I don't care who.    I want a team that can only play like 50pc of the time max, and the rest of the time they are filling in with G Leaguers. Just to see what would happen.    Marbury to coach."
"I asked the same thing about Bradley Beal, nobody cares about non household names"
"Well that depends on the needs of the team right?   Let’s say you’re a fringe or perennial contender which happens to have high draft picks. Obviously you’ll pick A. (i.e Jimmy Butler) because you’re in win now mode and you want an instant contributor and a much safer option.   But if you’re a trash team, there is no incentive for you to just draft a perennial all-star just to be stuck in purgatory (i.e Bradley Beal on the Wizards) so you choose B in the hopes that you’ll draft a perennial All-NBA/MVP caliber player. (i.e. AD, Embiid)  Note: this hypothetical does not factor in trades and signings when building the team for this situation."
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
I’ve been waiting for this for so long since he did that to Bradley Beal a couple years ago in the off season
thats a weird way to spell Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal

"Rings, as in Curry getting rings with...  KD - Klay - Draymond  Literally get **ANY** max player on that team instead of Curry and he'd also get rings. I call that luck, not an achievement. Proven by the fact Curry has 3 rings and 0 FMVPs LMAO, that's hilarious. Westbrook would have won rings on that team. Or Bradley Beal. Or Booker.   Totally worthless rings. Now replace Giannis with one of them and tell me with a straight face they'd win a ring last year LMAO"
&gt; it doesn’t seem that he’s capped out on his potential yet  Totally agree. But I've been arguing for weeks with people telling me he has the ceiling of a superstar. I don't see that at all. He's too crazy with the ball and he's going off because teams don't plan for him yet. They're all still running at Steph. He doesn't have the handles to be a first option on a serious team. But he is a bucket on this team. His potential is more like someone like Bradley Beal.
"I’ll tell you why.  Tatum and brown are both great but there’s no chemistry there with eachother and the rest of the team, so they don’t win you many games. Let’s ignore the fact that Tatum seems to have hit his ceiling and can’t seem to hit a shot to save his life right now.   Williams is good but nothing too crazy. Smart is a good defender but he’s not a championship level PG, and your bench isn’t deep enough to win you more than half the games you play. Would adding Bradley Beal make you a contender? Probably. But adding Bradley Beal would make half the teams in the league contenders. The real question is how you get him. You’ll never get him in free agency, and if you do it through a trade you’ll have you give up smart + Williams + picks at the VERY least, but more likely you’d have to give up one of your two stars, which defeats the whole purpose.   You’re in purgatory. You’re going to consistently win enough games to be respectable, which won’t allow you to draft anyone good, and Tatum is going to get sick of it and leave at the end of his extension. And on top of all of that, as if it couldn’t get any worse, you also have a shitty front office who let kyrie and Hayward go. There’s nothing to look forward to if you’re a celtics fan, this is as good as it gets. You just have to enjoy your .500 victories while you can, before it gets much much worse."
"Yea theres this thing called playmaking, you know the thing that makes Lebron a better offensive player than Bradley Beal despite beal averaging more points? Curry elevates offenses like no other: https://youtu.be/Qq-ewGMk73A  There is no way a team whos second best scorer is Jordan Poole should  have the second ranked offense in the league but because steph curry is an all time offensive player, the team is able to reach those heights. So yea, the difference between him and Giannis is quite substantial   Anyways If your perception of offensive impact is measured in raw PPG then im not sure we can have a meaningful discussion about this"
"Most points, lol. Good, a little better than Bradley Beal. Or Westbrook. Strong argument for beat in the league."
"Literally nobody claimed we were only good because of hardens passing.. what? The guy you replied to already said Chris Paul is the better passer. I don’t even know what you’re arguing  The rockets didn’t have a reliable secondary ball handler besides the short period chris was healthy. It was all harden. To imply his passing “isn’t remotely the reason we were that good” is fucking hilarious, plop Bradley Beal or Zach Lavine into that role and tell me hardens passing didn’t mean much   He ran point for a full season and put up 29/8/11 in houston and then in Brooklyn he put up 25/9/11 last year. I don’t know why you’re using this season as your only example lol?   Also, yes, Chris Paul is the more efficient playmaker, but not all turnovers are from passes. Peak harden was also giving you 30+ with those 10+ assists so 4-5 turnovers is justified"

Bradley Beal goodness gracious
"If they all reach their ceilings....  Cade could be a constant triple double threat, elite shooter and floor general, probably a top 10-15 player. Luka-lite kind of player   Green could become an upper echelon scorer, capable of averaging 30 and being one of the best 3-point shooters in the league. Bradley Beal-ish player, top 15-20 probably.    Barnes could become a dominant interior scorer, great playmaker and if that jumpshot works out he’s a 3-level scorer with all-defense capabilities. Giannis-type player, probably top 10.   I think Barnes has the most potential, he could really have the whole package with no holes in his game."
Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal extension is the obvious priority for this season.  As for offseason? Trez re-signing would big a good one, especially with the season he’s been having.  As for depth? Hopefully we can get a decent backup guard.  I like Neto and Holiday is ehhh  But having someone who can run the offense when Spence sits would be perfect. Just seems at times we get a bit discombobulated once Spence is off the floor.  Like our bench just turns into street ball plays. Luckily we have Deni and Trez there to keep the bench clicking."

"James Harden,Bradley Beal,Zach Lavine and Deandre Ayton  You never said realistic"
"His athleticism is obviously exciting, incredible athlete who’s so elastic and explosive.   However, Zach lavine is also an incredible athlete and is nowhere near being a top 10 player.   I’m looking at his feel for the game, which doesn’t seem to be amazing. I doubt he’ll ever be an elite playmaker or defender, which will limit his impact moving forward.  Again these are projections and I could be so off, but I see more Zach lavine/Bradley Beal in his game than I’d like to see from a guy people want to project as the best of his class. And that isn’t a guy you can win with as the best player on a team unless you’re stacked from 2-7."
Bradley Beal is the problem with the Wizards and needs to be traded for Hauliburton by the way our thread acts whenever he has a bad shooting night
If the Wizards win a championship we're putting an oversize Bradley Beal jersey on the Lincoln Memorial statue
"...hmmm...  you know how many exciting layup attempts John Wall missed? and how many juke-move circus shot attempts, that Bradley Beal has missed? and multitudes of big-moment shots Gilbert missed? **Those misses did not change how those plays and those moves were still exciting to us fans who cannot do that when we are out on the court playing.**  *I think JJ is just caping for the demise of the 3pt shot*... JJ had no 2ptr game, so of course he's going to be critical of players who exhilarate fans in ways that he cannot do it...  JJ realizes that the past two playoffs have featured Conference Finals &amp; especially NBA Finals, where teams ***won*** by going to the 3pt shot *less* and going to the midrange game far more."

"1. Neither the Lakers or the Nets would reach the NBA Finals. 2. Atlanta and New York were superbly overrated. 3. The 76ers should've traded Ben Simmons, sooner rather than later for the first decent offer that came along.  He'd become more radioactive, the longer this situation went on. 4. Chicago would challenge for the best record in the East. 5. Bradley Beal should just stay in Washington. 6. Zion and the Pelicans probably should have divorce at this point. 7. Both conferences would be pretty competitive, this season from #1 - #7 seeds."
"Hear me out: Bradley Beal. Do the Wizards want to move on from him, that's the question.  Then back to the Wolves the next day. 🍃"
What do you mean...Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal..who are known for all defensive type of defense.  Dame and Steph will be building another Empire state with all those bricks smh.  I'll be surprised if they even get 5 shots off.

"ESPN and TNT’s pregame shows don’t even discuss the fucking game that’s on TV that night. they’re usually talking about some mixture of LeBron, the Lakers, the Knicks and potential trade demands like Bradley Beal.   This is the NBA sub so people aren’t really receptive to the whole “ratings down” thing, but at some point the league stopped even pretending to build intrigue for the on court product. It’s all about catering to social media clicks and weirdos who cling on to rooting for specific players"
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
Second only to Kyle kuzma and Bradley Beal.
"100%. Shit not even just 7th man. In the past month, I have seen more DeAndre Jordan ESPN articles than Bradley Beal."
"I was downvoted for this take a couple weeks ago so I guess it's controversial. Damian Lillard is one of the more hotly-debated picks to be in the NBA top 75 list but he deserves to be on that list a hell of a lot more than Pete Maravich does. This isn't just some ""modern guy is better than old guy"" take - Maravich's career compared even to his contemporaries wasn't anything that would blow you away. His peak was very short-lived and he never did shit in the playoffs.   Lillard has twice as many career win shares as Maravich does. Maravich's BBref similarity scores include guys like Ty Lawson (who nobody would even think of arguing deserves a top 75 spot) and Bradley Beal (who is still only 28 and will blow past that Maravich comp by the time his career is done)."

And the player with the longest active streak of games with &gt;15 points is... Zion Williamson. (Though Bradley Beal is due to pass him in a few days)
"It works when the other topics are irrelevant. Toronto does this with everyone : embid , Giannis, Steph , and even Bradley beal. Make the role players beat you."
Sort of.During a Golden State Warriors Washignton Wizards game a fight broke out between Bradley Beal and Draymond Green.During the brawl Kelly Oubre Junior threw a Punch a Klay Thompson as Klay was playing peacemaker.Thankfully Kelly missed and if I'm not mistaken accidently punched John Wall.
"I don't see why it matters what year Lou Williams peaked. When Klay comes back, Poole will be the sixth man. You'd have to be delusional to think Jordan Poole is going to be top 5 or top 10 in this league. At best, he'll be a Bradley Beal type.

"I mentioned Book and Kobe because they were the highest point totals, but you're right they were the least likely to get to 100. Now that I've had some time, I looked up the 60 point games in the least minutes played (note this is total minutes played in the game, not fastest to 60) and those I think show that it is breakable:    * Klay 60 - 29 min  * Harden 60 - 31 min  * Gervin 63 - 33 min  * Kobe 62 - 33 min  * Steph 62 - 36 min  * Kobe 61 - 36 min  * Harden 61 - 37 min  * Carmelo 62 - 38 min  * Bradley Beal 61 - 38 min  * Add in Lillard x2, Kobe x2, Iverson, LeBron all with 60 in just over 40 min.   From the above, none were trying to break the record. They sat out a lot of time because the game was won and they didn't want an injury. We also have so many 20 point quarters these days, it's ridiculous:   * Klay, Iverson, Zach Lavine each have 10 20 point quarters  * Westbrook and McGrady have have 12  * Booker and Anthony have 14  * Lillard has 19  * LeBron has 20  * Harden has 25  * Steph has 34   * Kobe has 36  Fuck man, Klay got 37 in just one quarter. I'm not saying it's easy or a shoe-in, but it is not unbreakable. You just need someone like these guys to string a few quarters together and WANT it badly enough. Get 60 in the first half and don't sit. Three pointers have helped tremendously in the accessibility of this record.   Imagine Curry goes absolutely bonkers beyond bonkers. He has like 10 games with 11 3s made and again, sits out the 4th in a number of those. What's to really stop him from making 22 one day, then driving for 10 layups as the try to stop the 3, and foul him enough to get 14 FTs."
Fun fact: Kuz is closer in age to Bradley Beal than to Lonzo Ball
That's incorrect. Look it up next time; takes 20 seconds.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/wizards-bradley-beal-still-considering-getting-vaccine-after-saying-hes-unvaccinated-for-personal-reasons/
New York City needs to do this. The fact that Kyrie can't play but Bradley Beal is allowed to enter Barclays and MSG is horseshit
"I’m probably wrong, but I though Bradley Beal was eligible but decided to sign for just two years. Please correct me if I am wrong."

That percentage puts him around CJ McCollum and Bradley Beal. His usage rate is the highest in the NBA so you would expect  lower true shooting percentage numbers.
Along with Bradley Beal?
“We can’t guard a parked car”-Bradley Beal
P76 with Bradley Beal would be respective. 👌💣
I remember when Bradley Beal got his reputation as a good defender for years because one time he guarded Kyle Korver tough in the playoffs 😂
Philly can try to pry Bradley Beal from my dead corpse. He's not leaving DC without Capital One arena burning down like a bonfire.
"New flash, the best 30 players are they types of players that NBA front offices really want.  In other news, NBA player Bradley Beal refuses to request a trade off the team with the best record in the east.   Also, 6ers GM stands and points at something shiny ""hey, look at that shiny thing"", as his team loses 5 straight."
"I do enjoy that Bradley Beal, one of the few media consensus guys is not listed."
-Bradley Beal realizing he got retweeted by Ted Cruz
"Morey is so delusional  first of all he's banking on having the best offer for Damian Lillard when the best return that Portland could get for Damian Lillard would actually be Jaylen Brown which any team would take over Ben Simmons. Also Dame might actually choose to go play for a guy that's looking to bring greatness to a franchise he's been loyal too, much like how Giannis said if he left Milwaukee it would be to play in Portland with Dame. Dame would probably want to play with another lone star guard who has been far too loyal to his franchise..a guy that many know as...Bradley Beal.   Like what if Morey thinks ""Portland has to say yes"" and Dame says ""I don't want to play for Philly"" and Portland is actually on board because they'd rather have picks than Ben Simmons?  Morey better pray he can grab Fox from the Kings, it really is looking like the best possible trade for them."
"Dude Morey thinks ben is enough for Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal or Dame. All of his expectations aren't realistic."

"Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal have all shot worse this year  Donovan Mitchell and SGA have shot roughly the same  Paul George, Anthony Davis, and Trae Young have barely been more efficient.   Again, lol"
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"That's what Hawks fans thought. The team has fixed Bradley Beal, Clint Capela and made Derrick Rose the best player on the Knicks. Westbrook is going to go 4-6 from 3 just watch it."
"Ah yes, Bradley and Schmadley Beal"
"Oh, I see. The Wizards, top seed in the East, are on a 5-game win streak and they've been playing without Bradley Beal lately too. I get it now."
"You want insight? **I can give you INSIGHT**  Wizards are **3-0 when Bradley Beal hasn’t played this year.**  Over the course of those 3 games, Spencer Dinwiddie has averaged…  **28 PPG**  **7.3 RPG**  **8 APG**  **on nearly 50% from the field and 3pt land.**  Better?"
Tbh i am not high on him. Right now he seems like the next THJ for me instead of f.e. a Bradley Beal. Honestly i think the rockets made a huge mistake to not pick Mobley instead of him.
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"Also sort of Bradley Beal, he has missed a few games and will miss 2 more I think because of the death of a family member."
Bradley Beal
"You just tried to say fucking Bradley Beal was first team all-NBA caliber in 2019, that’s all we need to know to close the book on your opinions here."
"&gt;If you use last season too, KD definitely wouldn’t have an argument. The gap was larger last year.  Objectively incorrect. Keep in mind we’re talking about their scoring specifically.  KD last season - 26.9 ppg on 66.6 TS%  Jokic - 26.4 ppg on 64.7 TS%  &gt;Yes, Jokic’s positional advantage matters more than 30ppg. That’s why Jokic at 19ppg was more impactful than Bradley Beal at 30. I don’t think you understand the concept of replacement value.  Objectively incorrect. Jokic was roughly a similar caliber player as Beal that season, and that’s largely due to his passing closing the large gap in scoring.  &gt;Yeah, Denver has so many elite defensive players around jokic. Name 2?  Aaron Gordon and PJ Dozier."

"And ? The Wizards were marginally better with Russ on the floor than off it. Having a top 20 player in Bradley Beal helps, not to mention Toronto’s injuries and having the entire season on the road. What a stupid reply, completely ignoring context"
People were mad someone averaging 29/9 made the all star team. And before people mention how shit the team was Bradley Beal was doing the same with an equally shitty team the year after. The wizards were trash at the all star break.
"The warriors were on a 44 win pace if Steph didn't injure his butt. The dubs were 1-7 without him, and with Kelly Oubre+Wiseman, it's a miracle the warriors achieved the 8th seed. They were also playing an 8 man rotation for like a whole month.  Westbrook also had Bradley Beal, a guy that was competing against Steph for the scoring title. Steph was the only option on the team and was 3rd in MVP voting.  Please, don't be so ignorant. We over 4 million here and some poor takes are bound to happen, but try not to be one of those."
No i actually watch games thats why i said that. Wizards are full of bradley beal and a bunch of super team rejects who cant perform when it matters.
Is there any of the roster the same besides Bradley Beal?
Michael Jordan on the Wizards in his prime for Bradley Beal.  Perfect swap
Bradley Beal playing 4D ball. Why leave when you can just stay and win?
This is extreme recently bias  Bradley Beal didn’t even come into the league as a 20 PPG guy  Give those guys time
"Okay let's see(in no particular order):  1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Curry 4. Giannis 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Harden 10. Doncic 11. AD 13. Butler 14. Donovan Mitchell 15. Trae Young 16. Chris Paul 17. D Booker 18. Jason Tatum 19. Damian Lillard  I guess I'd have him at 20, because everyone else I think of is either a bit young and unproven(Morant) or debatable(Bradley Beal)."
"The magic are a team that you fully expect a good team to take care of, no matter that they’re on the road.  The wizards came in and took care of them. Without Bradley Beal. A game they typically lose.  What the FUCK"
"When did Kyle Lowry have more success than AD as the first option? For that matter, why did you put both Lowry and DeRozan? Russ has had more success than AD as the #1 option? And fucking Bradley Beal?? I feel like you have never followed the NBA before lmao"
"Couldn't agree more. Yeah, the game is changing to favor the three but Ray Allen's almost 3,000 threes is still 10 full seasons of 300 threes, which has still only ever been done by Curry (4 times) and Harden (once). Even 250 has only been done 25 times in NBA history. Steph owns 7 of those and Harden 4. The only other multiples are Buddy Hield (3), Lillard (2), Klay (2), and Duncan Robinson (2). So only 11 people have ever done it.  So unless you get another Steph or Harden caliber three point shooter, we're talking 13+ seasons of a more reasonable, but still difficult, 200-250 threes, which has been done by a lot of guys, but that's still some pretty insane shooting over a very long time.  Going down the list, Curry, Harden will definitely pass him barring (god forbid) injury. Even Lillard isn't a sure thing. He needs to keep his pace up for \~4 more years, and then he'll be 35. I'm pretty sure Lillard will do it since that's his game, but it's not as certain as Steph or Harden just yet.  Lowry, JR Smith, LeBron are too old.  Klay and Paul George \*might\*, but they still need 4-6 seasons of 200-250 threes. That puts them in their mid 30's of awesome shooting. Klay would be looking a lot more solid if he didn't miss 2 years to injury.  KD is probably too old unless he starts shooting more threes.  Going down further, Bradley Beal \*might,\* but he needs 8 seasons of 200+ threes. And all of a sudden we're down to people with half of Ray Allen's total.  You can't just pass Ray Allen with a medium-long career of above average three point shooting. You need to be a superstar three point specialist to the level of Curry, Harden, or Lillard. Even KD probably isn't going to get there. Even with the game changing, we're talking a 12-14 year career with a superstar level 3 point shooting peak or a 15+ year career as a really good 3 point shooter."
Bradley Beal
"For real.  How long is it going to take people to reAlize dame isn’t a champ.  He’s a Bradley Beal low % shooter who can’t play defense.  Count how many times they score 40 and their teams lose.  It’s because they play no d and aren’t that efficient.  Now that dame can’t get his bait fouls, his game is even less efficient.  76ers are more likely to win a chip with their current lineup with an upgrade to the 3 spot for Simmons rather than dame(and you have to give up maxey)."

"Bradley Beal has been in a slump this year, I do not even think this is the best version of the team"
The Washington Wizards are off to a fantastic start. Their chemistry has proven that they are a  hungry team ready for playoff contentions. Players Monteral Harris and Kyle Kuzma have proven from the trade that they are prepared and able to perform their talents. Bradley Beal still leading the team with his 23 points 5.5 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game also shows their ethic. They are leading in the eastern conference. Do you think they are ready to give Washington a championship?

And Bradley Beal has been playing like ass too
He’s shooting 33% from 3-pt range. It’s not like he’s playing as bad as Bradley Beal out there.
"Imagine being so wrong, he isn't Bradley Beal."
"yes, additional FRPs would help you in a trade for Bradley Beal"
"I very well could be day dreaming, the next Koby and Shaq is really unlikely. However, for me, I think this is the best way to have a successful future. I don’t think emptying the cupboard of picks and what little bench depth the Warriors have for Bradley Beal is a good idea. To me that’s how the Warriors end up like the Magic, just year after year of mid to late lottery picks that may or may not Pan out"
"I don’t mean his numbers are empty in a Bradley Beal kind of way.  What I mean is, let’s say the Pelicans play the Jazz in the Playoffs and Zion goes off for 40 or some shit but Jazz still win by 20+. All the headlines are going to be about Zions 40, not the Jazz win.  I’d much rather see him in the Playoffs when the Pels have figured shit out.  That’s what I meant, could’ve worded it better mb."

"Go check that 06-07’ Cavs roster and then look at the Spurs roster. You’re pretty damn close and that’s in the nba man, and he’s MUCH better now lol.   I think you’re severely underestimating nba players. I would even go as far to say that Bradley Beal would drag a 16 seed to a title."
2014 Washington Wizards came very close:  - Bradley Beal (60)  - John Wall (52)  - Andre Miller (52)  - Paul Pierce (50)  - Ramon Sessions (44)
"I feel like Fox, Shai or Demar should have been in the game prover Mike Conley and they only put him in there bc he has never been. and I said Kings PLAYERS get no love the team doesn't deserve love but Buddy, Fox and Haliburton definitely deserve their credit, bc if you think players don't deserve credit for doing really good but having a bad team Bradley Beal, Christian Wood, KAT, Lavine, Brandon Ingram and Zion should get no love either."
"If youre in position to draft a star player, why would you agree to trade down?  Theyll probably just have to hope a Bradley Beal or someone new decided to demand a trade."
"He was great, but being great is something that sometimes happens to other players too, and doesn't make a historic story and a top subject of the day every day for the whole season.   It's not related to how he played, there was just a treatment of a triple-double as some incredible, most genius achievement of basketball wizardry in every possible aspect (for these people, points/rebounds/assists per game of a guy is every aspect of basketball).   10 years ago, *every single* triple-double in a game was deemed noteworthy. It really was something outstanding about a game, it was widely talked about. Let's say the season 2009-10: LeBron had 4 triple-doubles, Kidd and Rondo had 2, and a list of players had one in the whole season. It was such an achievement to havde one - an idea of somebody making it regular was such a sensation. No matter what the other circumstances. It had to be like that.   In terms of the NBA boxscore kaballah, it would be the same if somebody just started averaging 50 points scored per game next season. Let's say Zach LaVine or Bradley Beal would just score 50 points every game. Something that seems not possible before it happens."
weird how his most frequent matchup is bradley beal  it's not even a week you were stanning this guy
"Can you imagine the memes if that happened today? I know it's only been about 4 years, but the internet is honestly a different beast in that regard.   Materials: Beal's girlfriend in awe, Wizards fan with his jaw dropped, Bradley Beal smiling because he was impressed"
"This is not only an embarrassment but a very dangerous precedent if they let it happen.  Post all-star break literally every team with good players should find a way to 'sit them down to examine the players behind them'.  Wanna see Bradley Beal?  Sorry Raul Neto might be a developing rotation player in a few years.  Wanna see KAT? Naz Reid needs to work on passing out of the post, come back next season... and so on."

"Sign Bradley Beal to a long term contract as a free agent, extend Ja Morant to a long term contract with keeping JJJ. Finally, get to a Western Conference Finals in the next five years."
Knicks sign Bradley Beal and win a title
You can't understand that very few players get the opportunity to play with other players who are capable of growing to that level of excellence?  That it's a matter of pure luck from a player's POV who drafts them?    That a guy like Bradley Beal could spend his entire career- go his entire life- without ever experiencing that level of apex basketball if he doesn't leave Washington after this contract?    The same thing that almost happened to KG until he was traded?  No fault of their own- the only difference is that the right organization at the right time traded for KG and Beal hasn't had that happen?  You suggest that some players should refuse to exercise what control they have over their lives to experience once in a lifetime synergy.    It's just silly.  You only get to live once.  It's crazy to tell someone else to forfeit incredible opportunity in service of your personal abstract principles.  Judging people accomplishes nothing.
"It made me wanna watch a movie about Bradley Beal's life starring Bradley Beal playing Bradley Beal at all ages. I wanna see Bradley Beal in a baby bonnet and a onesie in a stroller going ""Goo goo ga ga motherfucker you think I take this shit for granted? This shit earned bruh. My moms work for this drip. And I ain't never forget. Driven. That's what I'm bout to be. Take my first steps then cross a motherfucker over the same day. That's the life I'm about."""
Bradley Beal would help them keep up offensively. They need an all time scorer imo
Fun fact: Bradley Beal has brothers named Byron and Bryon.
Damn Bradley Beal is so damn likeable. Real ass dude.
Hope you had this same energy when LeBron signed to the heat and then came back to Cleveland with Kyrie and Love. I bet most of the people complaining are Lakers fans who were calling to trade for Bradley beal and begging drummond to sign onto the Lakers too. The hypocrisy. Just mad that it isn't your team.
Breaking!! Nets also sign Bradley Beal and Andre Drummond.. LOL
The title transcription for this is ass. Sorry OP. The title should just be “Bradley Beal gives motivational speech to kids in his basketball camp”.
Dillon Brooks can guard Bradley Beal.
But Bradley Beal could hold Bradley Beal to 0 points. DPOY??
Bradley Beal couldn't guard Bradley Beal and he's an allstar
"I can guard Bradley Beal, I have before. On 2k"
"Yea, I think I’d agree more with Wade if he was a lesser star like Westbrook or Bradley Beal, but being a 3 time champion and top 5 SG? Definitely better than being a Jordan Clarkson type."
"If u were building a team and u had to pick a player to build around, would u pick Bradley Beal or Draymond. I don't get why its so hard to understand. Is Draymond probably better than Beal all time? I would say so, but he is an all star role player, while Beal has the potential to be a superstar considering that he is just entering his prime. This post is talking about a redraft and most GMs would pick Bradley Beal as their franchise player to build around than Draymond Green."
"Why would they select Beal over Dray? Youre forgetting a whole bunch of aspects. First of all, it's not about who the better player is rn. It's about 2012, who would they have drafted if they could see the future and what that player could amount to. As of rn, they'd 100% select Draymond Green. A DPOTY, Olympic gold medalist, x3 NBA champion, x3 all nba defensive team, and he's still pretty good to this day. Bradley Beal? What has he done? Couple time all star? Dray's done that. He's never been a scoring champion, he could be this year but the season's not even over yet so you cant give him that. Im taking Dray"
Hey what's Bradley Beal got to do with this
I see more Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal before he improved last year.
"They need a true #1 option. Zach LaVine or Bradley Beal fit the bill imo, but acquiring either would absolutely gut the Knicks roster. So well, I suppose just focusing on RJ Barrett’s overall development is the way to go."
"Rebuild to get what exactly? A player of the quality of say Bradley Beal?   No one is clamouring to join the Wizards. They would be in the exact same place if they traded him, except worse because no Beal and any stars they do happen to draft would know that they shipped out the one All-NBA guy that actually wanted to play for the team when he repeatedly said he wants to stay. Meaning that hypothetical player would be more likely to leave so they didnt get done dirty too"
"To be fair, this is the same NBA that when Bradley Beal fumbles the basketball on the drive and nobody else touches it, decides that because he ""lost possession inadvertantly"" it wasn't a travel when he takes a 3rd step. That was when my confidence was lost with officiating personally and to this day everyone thinks it's bullshit."
"""Well actually THT ranks 3rd in SEMEN behind only Steph Curry and Hassane Whiteside, so he's probably worth bradley beal"""
"I think the reaction depends a lot on the context of the situation, mostly the current state of the team. If Bradley Beal said he wanted to be traded from the Wizards, people wouldn’t be upset because they aren’t playing that great this year (and haven’t really been a top contender during his tenure) and he’s given them so much of his time and effort and got very little in return.   But if Giannis was to demand a trade, people would be upset, and probably with good reason. The Bucks have done just about everything in their power the last 5 years to make that team a title contender, and they are. They just have very bad playoff luck and can’t seem to actually get to the finals. There doesn’t seem to be a reason to force a trade from that team. If he leaves in free agency that’s fine because he’s allowed to play wherever he wants at that point. But if he signs an extension with the Bucks and then just decides to force a trade after a loss in the ECF one year, people would probably be confused and upset. The team was succeeding and was within arms reach of a championship, and he just decides to up and leave after agreeing to a contact extension with the Bucks."
Ok. So Bradley Beal is better than Kevin Durant then.
"From Nov 2020: [John Wall surprised Wizards GM said they’re building around Beal](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2918551-report-john-wall-surprised-wizards-gm-said-theyre-building-around-bradley-beal)  &gt;	On Tuesday afternoon, Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic reported the Houston Rockets and Washington had discussed swapping John Wall and Russell Westbrook."
"Good players like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Matt Thomas and Paul Watson?  You drop him into any bottom dwelling team and he'd look like freaking Bradley Beal."
Bradley Beal. He's getting treated like a superstar but I don't think he's good enough to be a second star on a contender.
"In no particular order:  1.	Lebron 2.	KD 3.	Harden 4.	Kawhi 5.	Giannis 6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Joel Embid 8.	Steph Curry 9.	Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Paul George 12. Chris Paul 13. Luka Doncic 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Not sure if I missed anyone, but are all better and most are a tier above Tatum. Tatum is solidly in 16-20."

I think he meant that he isn't strictly scoring like Bradley Beal and it just came out wrong lol.
Damian Lillard Bradley Beal CP3
Didn’t Warriors already said that they’ll only trade those for either Giannis or Bradley Beal?
Absolutely hilarious that is is called a travel but the bradley beal play isn't called: https://youtu.be/b0auObQeTmw
"The trainer literally tried to play damage control and it sounded even worse coming out of *his* mouth. Now if anybody took the quotes to mean that the kid doesnt care about basketball than that was outta bounds, but the damning remarks  in that article to me were about watching highlights vs full games because they make a lotta sense when you watch him play.  You want a Bradley Beal stepback with perfect balance? I gotchu  You want me to watch a full basketball game to understand all the little nuances, and to understand how a great player controls the flow/outcome of a game? Aint basketball games like 2 hours, why cant I just watch the highlights?"
Bradley Beal is a stat padder scores 30+ points and doesnt generate wins. Harden led his team to the playoffs with Luis Scola as the 2nd best player.
Beal of Bradley sounds like a work of great Roman architecture. Hopefully it doesn’t end up a mausoleum.
"I'm very thankful Bradley Beal isn't on a contender. The man is fucking unreal. If the Wizards make the playoffs, I could legit see him willing them to 5 or 6 games against one of the top teams in the East."
Every time I see Bradley Beal play he always seems to be even better than I remember some how...
"""despite the loss"" Beal of Bradley"
"Bradley Beal: Negative asset, apparently."
"John Wall, Bradley Beal, DeMarcus Cousins, Dion Waiters"
Bradley Beal because it means he gets a rest
"Worth noting too, alot of rookies come in shooting in the lower 40s. Wiggins and lavine came in shooting low 40s as well on the same team. Donovan Mitchell, Bradley beal also came in shooting low 40s, Mitchell still does and Beal took a few seasons to get figure it out/improve. Does that mean edwards will figure it out? No, if he does i won't be shocked, we've seen it before.   I personally would only be concerned if we didn't see an upward trend."
I’ve always been a huge Bradley Beal fan and I don’t know why. Glad to see him going off.  Also I’m Greek so obviously I root for all the Greeks.
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
you think Bradley Beal is anywhere near Steph? lmao
So just fuck Bradley Beal amirite?
bradley beal just being tossed around here on r/nba

Jaylen Brown   23. Devin Booker   24. Trae Young   25. Zach Lavine  Named 25 players I’d rather have, just for you champ. There’s more too."
"I get what you're saying, but it's still nitpicky and completely unnecessary. Let's say Bradley Beal for example? He's averaging 32 points a game on about 24 shots per game. But wait, he also takes 8 free throws a game with making about 7 of those.  So the reality is bradley beal ""only"" averages 25 points on 24 shots per game.  See how stupid that sounds?"
"Imagine giving the MVP to Nikola Vucevic because with him the magic would be in a play in game but without him they would be picking in the top 3 of the draft or to Bradley Beal besause without him the Wizards would only win 8 games vs 30.   When I grew up watching ball, it was about which player was the most important piece on a team that actually did something during the regular season. Somewhere along the line it changed to who has the best stats on X bottom seed that won't make it out the first round."
"I get what you’re saying here, and shooting ability has gone up, but it’s partly about focus.  When the league was more heavy on big man scoring, post footwork was better.  Now it’s less emphasized.  Ray Allen could have been bombing 12 3’s a game and shooting at a higher rate, but it was literally discouraged.  He had to constantly work on other skills because teams wanted him penetrating, hitting mid range and playing elite defense, so he did.  If he could phone it in on defense, let his other skills drop a bit, and focus completely on shooting, you bet your ass he’d be just behind Steph and Klay.  But if he did what Dame does he’d have gotten subbed out.  Dame isn’t an all time great pure shooter, he’s a more complete package.  And I was *slightly* unfair to Trae, and he had improved shot selection (mainly just shooting 3 fewer 3’s a game).  This is largely a function of having more help so he doesn’t need to jack up bad shots in a vain attempt to keep the game within 20.  But he is still not top 10.  The other shooters you listed are better than him and so are:  Jared Harris, JJ Redick, Bradley Beal, Buddy Hield, Bogdanovic, Lavine just to name a few."
Lakers- Add Bradley Beal   nets- Add Andrew Wiggins and Kyle Lowry   Pretty even still maybe edge to nets
Lakers: Bradley Beal  Nets: Myles Turner and Caris Levert back
Lakers: Bradley Beal  Nets: Bam Adebayo and Demar Derozan
I gave you reasons why Steph is overrated and why he’s getting exposed this year. His team is shit because he’s like Bradley Beal where he scores a lot of points but doesn’t do much else to affect a game. Sorry the truth is to tough to tolerate. Block me if you want but Curry fighting for the PLAY IN GAME is embarrassing
"Wizards, you sure you need Bradley Beal?"
Superteam boi hoping for the sixers to all get covid while the nets get Zach Lavine and bradley Beal at the trade deadline smh
No it's simple we just trade Oubre for Bradley Beal and the MN pick for Towns. Oh and Wannamaker for LeBron James.  I swear some of the trades I see suggested on the sub are no better than this.
"Screw this announcer. If I was there. I'd say, ""cool, since we're doing dickhead hot takes"".   ""If you want your best player to be an all star on a sub .500 team. Bradley Beal is your man ... if Kemba Walker isn't available of course""."
"Donovan Mitchell has had a TON of awful shooting nights, and Bradley Beal had a game that he literally went exactly 1-14 from the field on February 5. I won't say Murray is as good as Beal, but you can't say that all-stars don't have shitty games. Averages exist for a reason."
Bradley Beal.  Good player but his stats are heavily inflated by the team he plays on.  He is closer to a Booker-level player than the Lillards or Currys of the league.
"I’m pretty sure if it was as easy as just “hey let’s trade for Bradley Beal” Philly would’ve done that already lol.   Yes they should go in but it’s not like they have some massive war chest of assets to go after another star, and even if they did there are other teams that have assets and could make competing offers"
Why the fuck should we aim for beal. We dont need bradley beal.
What do you mean break it up?   The short ter. Plan is maybe George Hill or something small. TPE in the offseason. Long term plan is Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal is the biggest NBA GM cocktease tbh. I’ve been throwing that cat’s name into the trade machine for years now, but he loves being there it seems and I can’t knock him for that. I know firsthand that bottom tier teams need whatever little victories we can get and I’m glad Washington has him.  I hadn’t watched Grant much tbh, but seeing him the other night made me a believer. I think he’s a perfect candidate to bump a contending team up a notch and I think he’s worth a heavy price. A Jrue-type deal definitely seems possible and is imo worth it for the right team."
"Bradley Beal has much better stats than Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell has similar/slightly better stats and he is on a winning team.  This isn't difficult to comprehend."
"So? Bradley Beal is on a bottom feeder and he's an all-star who's better than Mitchell. Murray's having a better season than spida, just look at the stats. Does team position fucking matter or does it not?"
“I keep telling y’all this kid gonna be a special p...... art of a trade package for Bradley Beal.”
"But other star players of Wilt’s era also had insane counting stats as a result of playing 40+ MPG on teams that were playing 20ish more possessions per game than today’s average team.  Wilt’s offensive game was only ever as impactful as Russell’s defense when Wilt took a huge step back in terms of offensive usage.   Like we understand Bradley Beal isn’t the best player in the league just because he is scoring the most points, and if we knew Bradley Beal taking 40% less shots would result in his team getting significantly better we wouldn’t be celebrating his stats like we do for Wilt."
Is Bradley Beal gonna play tonight against Philadelphia?
"In a situation where Bradley Beal somehow drags the currently 10 games out of the 1 seed, very sad Wizards team to the 1 seed, he would deserve every award that could be given to him."
Bradley Beal.
"I'm not gonna say that one player is better than the other, but Bam absolutely guards 1-5. I've seen him completely lock up players Like Steph and Bradley Beal. I don't really know who is better at defending 1-5, but it's completely ignorant to say that Bam doesn't do that"
"using advanced stats when your team as a whole is garbage at defense isn't exactly fair, another example of that is Bradley Beal, who is actually decent, but was dragged down by the Wizards being a dumpster fire last season (and this season)"
"Dame's defense isn't great, historically that's why Portland has had players like Aminu, Harkless and RoCo to take off that defensive load.  It could also be like Bradley Beal, where his defensive metrics look worse than they actually are because Portland (and the Wizards) defense has been garbage for years.  Mostly it's because nobody gives a shit about the Blazers."
He’s already better than Bradley Beal.  By a bit as well
"well... not exactly, they started with Bradley Beal lol"
"Bradley Beal convinced Jayson Tatum to go to Chaminade High School. They’ve been buddies for years, sadly Ainge won’t do a deal that he absolutely doesn’t fleece the other side."
2 playoff wins is pretty okay. He's gonna be a good player. Might one day become a Bradley Beal type.
The most surprising one is Nelly walked Bradley Beal to school?? What the fuck lol
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
bradley beal?
"Anthony Edwards started playing basketball late.   Lamelo has been playing basketball all his life.   Athletically, Anthony Edwards is like slightly below D Wade.    If he puts it together, he will be way better than current Bradley Beal"
It's easier to get more points if you're doing it all yourself...look at Bradley Beal.
"Our team is not young-ish. Our best player is 35 and he’ll either be traded, sign elsewhere in free agency, or begin to decline within the next few years. Our core of FVV/Norm/Siakam are all more or less in their primes. They might improve marginally but they aren’t making any more major leaps. You’re pretty much banking on OG at this point (who I would want to keep even through a rebuild).  I also think it’s very easy to say we’re 1-2 pieces away from being a top seed without specifying who those pieces are or how we’re going to get them. Like, a “piece” could be anything between a Myles Turner and a Bradley Beal.    I also think you’re ignoring that acquiring those pieces would be difficult to do through a weak free agency class, and would likely require us to give up some of our current pieces which might result in a lateral move or just a marginal improvement. That Kawhi trade was lightning in a bottle. Nothing like that is ever going to happen again."
Is Bradley Beal the greatest Timberwolf ever?
It's crazy to think Bradley Beal scores more than Juancho Hernangomez.
Bradley Beal leads the entire league in scoring so what?
Ben Simmons for Bradley Beal. Both would say yes but both teams are playing chicken with who makes the call.
Bradley Beal
"I know this is meant to be a joke post and all but if you really think about it... if you moved the Jazz and the Lakers to the East and the Sixers and the Celtics to the West, Bradley Beal would still be on the Wizards. Look it up if you don't believe me."
I remember Bradley Beal having a huge smirk on his face
People acting like Klay is Bradley Beal on offense plus the bench is still bad
"Dude, there's more to the game than scoring. An r/nba moment is thinking Bradley Beal is top 10 player for scoring a bunch of points on a garbage team. Tremendous talent but he has quite literally achieved nothing in the NBA.   Either way, I definitely wouldnt take Luka top 5 either.   Lebron/KD/Curry/Kawhi/Harden/Jokic/Giannis are all definitely better.   Luka is there with Embiid/Dame/AD  And then I take PG/Tatum/Butler/Kyrie and Beal after them."
It is jarring to witness how bad the Wizards are other than Bradley Beal. Good god
The difference is Bradley Beal plays shooting guard and Jokic plays centre. It’s a lot easier to hide Bradley Beal on defense. Centre is the most important defensive position and you’re basically drawing dead as a team if your centre is really bad at defense.
"I think of Jokic like Bradley Beal defensively speaking. Both are treated like one of the worst defenders in the league (they are not), but everyone seems to think so. Bradley Beal technically was last year but it was quite obvious he wasn’t trying. I think once those narratives get set people never let go of them. Neither are good defenders but they are playable. If the worst defender in the league averages 8 point he will not get play time. If someone of Jokics defensive level averages 8 points, that would still be a real solid bench piece."
Bradley Beal over kyrie will never make sense. He’s not better at one single basketball skill than kyrie and has never proved to be a better leader than kyrie/#1 option. It just doesn’t make sense.
"By that argument then I think you could also say cj is better than both those guys. I agree that Zach Lavigne should be higher, but Bradley Beal scores a lot more and has been on winning teams before. Same with devin boomer imo"
Bradley Beal.  Take away defense.  Bradley Beal.  JK... my favorite player is John Wall.
Maybe cause Bradley Beal is shooting 25 shots a game and has a worse FG% and 3P% than Steph. Lmao.
"Dipo wasn’t the player he became after playing with the Thunder yet. He even said himself that playing with Westbrook slowed him how to lead a team, hence the all-NBA season in 2017-18. Steven Adams is one of the most overrated player in the league, and he couldn’t do a damn thing without Russ setting him up other than offensive rebounding. And Andre Roberson? Really? You just listed three players that couldn’t create offence to save their lives at the time. Just look at what happened to their leads whenever Russ went to the bench, especially in the playoffs. Grant and Sabonis were both rookies, so I don’t even see the point of mentioning them considering they barely played and weren’t good yet. Mentioning them would be like me saying a few years from now that the 2021 Warriors were actually really good other than Steph since they have James Wiseman. Peak Kanter means practically nothing, dude couldn’t guard a cardboard cutout and once again, couldn’t create his own offence without Westbrook.   I never once said that Russ was better than Curry from an efficiency standpoint. But Russ outplayed him in pretty much every other area of the game.   And like I said, Sabonis and Oladipo would both later go on to credit Russ for helping them improve. Besides, if the offence was “all about Russ” and if he didn’t raise his teammates when he was on the Thunder, tell me why almost every player he ever played with had their best (or at least one of their best) seasons playing beside him? Paul George looked like an MVP candidate for the first (and only) time in his career. Ibaka is a better offensive player now, but he probably peaked with the Thunder since his defence was so game changing. KD was the runner up MVP like three times playing beside Russ, and then won his only award in 2013-14. You said yourself that Kanter and Adams peaked beside him. He also made half that awful roster look like semi-capable NBA players, and now those players are completely out of the league. I don’t think most of this Warriors roster will be out of the league in just a few years. Shit, even James Harden had a monster season last year and Bradley Beal is also playing his best ball right now."

"1. The Jazz have the best roster in the NBA  2. Tobias Harris is the most important player on the Sixers  3. Kristaps Porzingis was the worst value of that trade.  4. Bubble Jamal Murray was, in fact, a fluke.  5. Bradley Beal is a bad team stat padder."

"Even if I love frank and still hold up hope.... That is Bradley fucking Beal, and neither Frank or Knox command that worth."
So Bradley Beal gotta be number 1 in mvp voting.
.... giblert paired with Bradley beal is a scary guard dup that most teams won't be able to content. I'll say top 4 seed in the east and lose in the ecf or ecs
"&gt; easily all-NBA third team  I'm not saying he won't make it, but between the likes of Steph Curry, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Damian Lilliard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, and Devin Booker there's *a lot* of competition (and no doubt there will still be names that others will be throwing out there). Definitely wouldn't call him *easily* 3rd team."
"The last time bradley beal was in the playoffs, the wizards had a starting lineup of John Wall, Beal, markieff morris and Marcin gortat with Kelly oubre coming off the bench.   None of the bulls teams Lavine has played on have been even close to that. Minny Zach is a completely different player than 2021 Zach."
I’m so fucking mad at Jonathan Tjarks for insinuating that a) were wasting Steph’s prime b) that he might leave if we don’t trade for Bradley Beal.   Seriously the man should be fucking fired for that drivel.
i think trading for bradley beal is pretty cool

"He’s properly rated, too inconsistent as of now, he has the potential to be good. Here’s the list right now of at least top 25, in no order, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Harden, AD, PG, Curry, Kyrie, Butler, Tatum, Jayden Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Luka, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Ingram, and I’m probably missing a few. These are the people who could carry their team, or at least have an impact of changing the team to at least a contender. Does Siakam fit in that list?"

"Depends on who you ask.  Mavs fans think they can get him for THJ and a second rounder.  Knicks fans think RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley is an overpay for him.   I am not making this up, these are pretty recent opinions by fans from those subreddits.  Realistically? We aren't trading him and if we are it's gotta be a haul - somewhere around whatever Bradley Beal nets. Beal is better right now but he's two years older and Zach is better at 25 than Beal was at 25 so I would say their value in the long term is similar."
"Dude its actually becoming frustrating. They cant guard anybody. Straight giving up like 120 a game. Whatever scott brooks is doing is just not working. Bradley beal is being cool rn not talking about a trade but washibgton has to give him something. Get rid of scott brooks please. Fuck man how is the front office jusy ok with this shit. Makes some trades too, anything, neto and deni are a guaranteed foul everytime."
"Bradley beal is a volume scorer.  He scores a bit above league average.  Are you really saying in this day and age that ppg is the most important aspect of basketball?  Are we going to ignore efficiency, rebounding, passing and defence?  Or is Beal just a lazy way to make the ""empty stats"" argument?  No beal didn't play anywhere near MVP level this year or last."
Dame time before PG. But if I’m making a fair comparison of position.   Call me crazy but at this point I’d put Bradley Beal above PG13.
Come on bro... Kyrie is better than Bradley Beal at every facet of the game. If Bradley Beal isn’t more skilled than Kyrie at anything there’s no argument for him to be better. At least kyrie as the second option proved to be one of the greatest second options you could have... Bradley Beal was averaging 22 PPG and choking as the second option. Don’t let recency bias and him averaging 30 one of the worst teams in the league cloud your judgment
"Devin Booker- yes, I agree. Bradley Beal is arguable though I'd lean Kyrie slightly. Neither have proven much of anything as the main person on their team, they're just high scoring guards."
How? Where did I even rate him? I never said where I believe he ranks in the NBA I just said he’s clearly better than Devin Booker and Bradley Beal which he absolutely is
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
"What single basketball skill are Bradley Beal and Devin Booker better at than Kyrie😂finishing? No. Mid range? No. Three point shooting? Definitely not. Clutch scoring? No. Rebounding? Beal barely is but he’s taller than Kyrie. Passing? No. Ball handling? No. Defense? They’re all bad.   You literally just said those players are better because you don’t like kyrie😂kyrie is a proven champion. Those guys haven’t proven anything yet and they’re not even better at anything than Kyrie. Kyrie is better at literally everything on offense, and they’re all bad defenders, and Booker and Beal have never led good teams. So wtf are you talking about? These takes are embarrassing"
"This doesnt work like that. Was he jordan furing the seasons before? Is he in a winning team? Do we just assume his efficiency would be much better because he plays today? Would he be on ine of the best defences of the league?   Thing is, what you did before matters, and that is why embid isnt considered top 5 despite being front runner for mvp. Imo if you put jordan on the wizards and call him bradley beal, i think he would be outside the top 10. If you put jordan with all his accolades from before and he is winning games he is probably top 3."
It's a straw poll of media members not ESPN employees. For posterity this was the initial straw poll last season:   ||1ST|2ND|3RD|4TH|5TH|TOTAL| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|48|34|15|3|1|803| |LeBron James|29|26|23|21|1|651| |Luka Doncic|14|25|39|19|2|569| |James Harden|9|16|20|45|7|444| |Pascal Siakam|0|0|1|5|32|52| |Kawhi Leonard|1|0|1|3|25|49| |Anthony Davis|0|0|2|3|19|38| |Karl-Anthony Towns|0|0|0|1|6|9| |Jimmy Butler|0|0|0|1|3|6| |Bradley Beal|0|0|0|0|3|3| |Damian Lillard|0|0|0|0|1|1| |Nikola Jokic|0|0|0|0|1|1|  [Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28219390/mvp-straw-poll-giannis-repeat-works)
1. Steph 2. Jokic 3. LBJ 4. Kawhi 5. Giannis 6. AD 7. Lillard 8. Bradley beal 9. Wetbrook 10. trae young 11. Tatum 12. Kat 13. PG 14. Embid 15. Booker 16. Butler 17. Mitchell 18. KD 19. Kyrie 20. Harden 21. Ben simmons 22. chris paul 23. Cj Muccollum 24. Kyle LOwry 25. Murray
He still puts up +0.9% rTS. His scoring adjusted to pace would be higher as well. So I guess he is gonna be like Bradley Beal with defense. A volume scorer with slightly higher than league average efficiency. I mean where do you rank Bradley Beal is he has first team all NBA defense?
"It's kinda dumb but if you think about it really make sense to give the MVP to a player playing in a better team. Sure, steph is valuable. Maybe even he is the organization itself right now for the Warriors. But is he the ""Most"" valuable one among other valuable players? And that's where team wins carry on. Because if we are giving MVP just base to someone's performance to carry the team then why not give it to Bradley Beal last year? And yep, that's because his performance isn't converting to wins which compared to other valuable players on other teams that actually carries their teams to win. And that's why Giannis was a ""more"" valuable player than beal last year and thus he won the award."
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
i mean what does being like 10th in the MVP race even mean? it’s meaningless. bradley beal is an amazing player but why would he care unless he’s in the top 4 in the MVP race?
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They’ll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn’t fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they’ve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won’t be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"Honestly if I was compiling a tier list of great defender it goes like this:   Elite: luka doncic, trae young, Alex Len, Rudy gobert, and AD  Good: jimmy butler, jokic, KP, Bradley Beal.  Bad: LeBron, dort, isiah Thomas, lamelo balls, London balls, and Kyle Korber.   Just my opinion tho."
"I’m sorry but Bradley Beal isn’t better at anything than Kyrie, Devin Booker, jimmy butler and KAT are definitely not better then kyrie. Devon Booker bro? Seriously?"
"I'll give it a stab.  Jaylen Brown,  Zion Williamson, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, KAT (if healthy), Ja Morant, Kyrie, De'Aaron Fox (arguable, but I would say so), Brandon Ingram (same thing), McCollum until he got injured (this season),  Shai (I'm high on Shai), Maybe Kemba, Probably Vucevic, Lavine."
"Bradley Beal is the worst defender at SG in the league by and is negative in most advanced stat metrics.   Jokic is far from it and is positive in most advances stay metrics. If only Jokic had LeBron, Schroeder,  Gasol and others to help him, instead he has MPJ playing at the 3, 36 year old millsap, Monte Morris, and will Barton."
Where was the lie? Instead of calling names how about you give an actual response. The guy implying rose was happy in Detroit is funny to me. Bradley beal is an example of a player who seems happy with his team. He doesn't request a trade even though he has every excuse to want out.
Right next to Bradley Beal and Jeremi Grant
"In no order:  LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Jokic, Doncic, Embiid, Giannis, KD, Harden, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, KAT.   That's 17 players any sane person would take over him just on the basis of being strictly better at basketball. Then when you factor in his questionable mental state I could add on another 15-20 easily. I would say he's around top 30 at best, top 40 at worst."
"Kyrie ""Bradley Beal"" Irving"
This is just every good teams best player. Besides Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal ? Lmfao
"What is it with Warriors fans thinking their ""future"" is limited to Wiseman and this draft pick who you have no idea how they'll pan out, while simultaneously trying to win games with Steph/Dray/Hopefully Klay/bunch of vets around them. Why can't trading for Bradley Beal be a part of the future when he's 27 years old with a game that translates well to older age."

"They could probably get Bradley Beal or others with a Draymond and Oubre trade. Draymond is just too expensive for the shit he is doing.   Steph has had to carry the team for a season without Klay, and Wiggins is just now getting into the swing. They need to get rid of the people holding them back.   Wiseman may need to go too."
bradley beal has taken devin bookers shine
"It's called a dip and it's not as awful as people on here are saying. It's understandable because coaches go crazy over this. It's a rhythm thing. Players who dip before shooting:   * Steph Curry  * Bradley Beal  * JJ Redick * Jayson Tatum * Kevin Durant * Klay Thompson * Fred VanFleet   Should I go on? It doesn't slow the shot down. I don't understand the logic behind why it's bad. You still have to bend your knees and the dip motion happens simultaneously with the lower body. By the time you raise up to shoot, the ball is coming out an the top of the jump."
"Bradley ""in a blowout loss"" Beal"
Bradley Beal on the Nuggets would be beautiful
That's the Bradley Beal trade package right there and you even fix Washington's gaping hole at head coach
i would take tyler herro for him but we saw that the heat fans wouldn’t even trade him for bradley beal because apparently tyler herro has james harden potential or some shit so i doubt we could get him
Bradley Beal anyone?
"westbrook and bradley beal for lou will, beverley, morris, kennard, 2nd round picks. the wizards wouldnt get the return they would get if they were to trade bradley beal by himself, but they get to offload westbrooks contract and in exchange take a lesser return and then they can try to flip those other guys for firsts"
Even doing it on elite efficiency isn't even much anymore. Zach LaVine is a 27 PPG scorer on .645 TS% and people aren't sure if that's enough to be an Eastern Conference All Star. Bradley Beal is a 33.2 PPG scorer on .586 TS% and his team has the worst record in the NBA.
Bradley Beal dropping 50 pieces and losing by 30 like it never mattered.
Bradley “bill ‘kawhi ‘i’m going to toronto for game 3’ leonard’ bellichuk” Beal has spoken
"Bradley Beal is at 58 TS% for the season, he hasn’t been very efficient considering his volume."
"Seriously. The knicks can easily attract a top tier A free agent. I'm talking Bradley beal, Devin Booker maybe, perhaps KAT, also wouldn't be surprised if they could be in the running for a guy like tatum. Oladipo is great but they can do better if they continue building like they have been."
Bradley beal didn't deserve it. /s
"I mean Jokic, Curry, and Luka all get MVP buzz with mediocre team records (even if they aren't front runners). I feel like Giannis isn't getting any attention. Not even from an MVP standpoint, just in general. I feel like even Bradley Beal and Zach Lavine have more people talking about them"
But Bradley Beal is a starter even though a worse team than the Hawks and Trae is playing better than him?
"1) AS selections are DEFINITELY record based. Several players have been snubbed in the past based on team record, most notably Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker and Mike Conley. Middle of the pack records are often not rewarded with multiple selections even if they have good candidates.  2) Every team has had to deal with missing players, injuries, covid issues, rescheduling etc. That is now an excuse. Pacers didn't have Oladipo for a while, traded him, then lost Levert who they traded for. They still don't have Warren and lose Lamb too often. For that matter is mostly been Sabonis anchoring the team to a revised higher than the Celtics. 3) Sabonis is absolutely a player with All Star worthy stats. 21.5/11.6/5.7 is very much comparable to what Brown and Tatum are averaging. I like Brown and Tatum and I think they're having great years, but you're just stanning lol."
Wtf are you talking about. The Magic are the most forgettable team in the nba this season. How the hell are they getting any all stars from the cellar of the east?!   At least Bradley Beal is exciting and leading the nba in scoring?
"&gt;20/28/29 ppg respectively in their first 3 seasons since 18 years old  I think his PPG will be capped around 30. Maybe early 30's like 32. In fact his scoring is the same this year as it was last year at 28.8 but he might make another jump soon. I doubt he will improve much on this end so he has to improve either his efficiency or defense to compete with the greats.  &gt;triple double machine  Guard/front court rebounding is one of the more pointless stats.  It is usually &gt;70% uncontested which is the case for all of them whether it be Westbrook, Luka, or Lebron.  &gt;shoots okay, his shot selection needs work but really he's shooting from the 3 like Beal isn't he?  His best year shooting the three is the almost as good as the worst year of Bradley Beal shooting the three in the sample size of half a shortened year. Even still, he isn't competing with Beal, he is competing with all time greats and most of them either shot much better or defended much better at an early age. He is on his third year now (on very high volume) in a row where he shoots below league average 3% and below league average ft%.   &gt;He also proved he can perform in the playoffs, the problem is can the rest of his team  They lasted one series. Not sure I can confidently say that as much as you with one series sample size. Jamal Murray put up MJ esque stats vs the Utah Jazz in their series.  Porzingis and Seth Curry were both playing out of their mind shooting around 50% from 3 and they still lost. I didn't buy the narrative that the Mavs were a bad team that was carried by Luka and I am not to surprised they are a losing team so far this year when their really good depth players to FA or injury.  Many think that Luka will improve his shooting and defense when he gets a lot of the load taken off of him. Often Lebron is cited for this. For every Lebron there is a handful of plays that switch teams and never improve defense significantly and actually those players don't mesh well because they are the type of player that needs the ball to be effective. I think Luka is the type of person who needs to have a lot of touches to take advantage of his skillset because he isn't very athletic defender or a very good shooter. I know he has high volume 3 point shooting but even when factoring that in, his 3 point shooting sticks out like a sore thumb. His catch and shoot 3% has been &lt;30% two years in a row now which is unusual and what people often use to gauge how a shooter would shoot if they are more open. Luka did have a good stretch of shooting this year so maybe he can continue that stretch for longer. We shall see."
"They're **individual** awards, not team awards. If you want to do the team thing for MVP, fine, I don't agree but whatever. All Star or All Pro is literally just who are the best players. That's why we have 11th place Zion, and 12th place Vucevic. Hell we have 13th place Bradley Beal starting.   This isn't awards for guys on above .500 teams."
The all star game isn't about the top teams or else Bradley Beal wouldn't be starting for the East despite being the fucking 13th seed.
Top 10 defense but a 14-17 record. The Bradley Beal special
Anyone who says that has never watched Bradley Beal play one single minute of basketball
"If you think about it, every team that Westbrook has joined has made the other superstar better.   OKC - Westbrook helped to elevate KD to another level.   OKC - Paul George had his best, near-MVP season during his time with Westbrook   HOU - Harden had his best statistical year the year Russ was there.    WASH - Bradley Beal is having his best season of his career so far with the Wizards.   Not to say that Westbrook is the *sole* reason these guys played well, but it's definitely not a coincidence that they've all had some of their best seasons the year that Westbrook joined them."
bradley beal is the most unstoppable offensive player in the league right now. you have to double him to stop him from dropping 35+
Holy shit. I did not realize Bradley Beal is still this underrated
"Bradley Beal. I hadn’t seen much of him over the last couple years, but I’ve seen a few games recently and it’s just fun to watch him move. Aesthetically pleasing"
"Ya no problem. Here’s an athletic article that talks about why beal extended. https://theathletic.com/1304598/2019/10/18/how-the-washington-wizards-swayed-bradley-beal-toward-an-extension-path/  Here’s the relevant bits:   &gt; For sure. A hundred percent,” Beal said Thursday about whether the organization kept him more with plans than years past. “This is by far (the most) I’ve been included (with) the decision making they had going on in the front office. They kept me informed on everything draft night, everything with free agents.  &gt;”Everything was smooth sailing. Tommy did a great job of communicating and making sure that I knew about everything that was going on, and that I wasn’t surprised by anything.”"
“Gettin buckets baby” - Bradley Beal 2021
"Bradley ""Despite the ~~Loss~~ WIN"" Beal"
&gt; The Wizards traded Bradley Beal to the Raptors for Pascal Siakam.  😭
hot take! bradley beal is a volume scorer playing hero ball that's why his numbers are always inflated
He still impacts winning more than guys like Jerami Grant and Bradley Beal.

Cue the shots of Bradley Beal crying on the bench and Lakers fans demanding he get traded to the Lakers for a bag of chips and no picks
hmmm do I want developing Hedo Turkoglu or current Bradley Beal? I think Beal.
Bradley Beal might be the only person to dribble his way into the playoffs.  Just impossible control.
Yeah it looks like the team has finally found itself or at least just gotten healthy. Still some mishaps but this is the type of ball I expected from them before the season started.   A team with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook is too good for the start these guys had
"Yeah, and while we're making bullshit statements to undermine the entire value of a player, Bradley Beal is just an undersized 27 year old wing that doesn't defend, has only played two full seasons, and hasn't been in a significant competitive game in about a decade. Total bust for #3 overall.   He isn't even an all star in an average year (3 of 9?). Dude is worthless, clearly.   M I RITE?"

THE BRADLEY BEAL BAG SPECIAL
BRADLEY EMMANUEL BEAL
Bradley 'Julius Erving' Beal
Bradley Beal is something special man.
Bradley Beal says Fuck Ernie's son
"Damn Bradley Beal is real shit, huh."
Guess Bradley Beal just needed to make the all star game for the Wizards to start winning games lmao
Bradley Beal used the force to get that ball back.
BRADLEY FUCKING BEAL
Bradley. Beal.
Yo that was fucking ill Bradley Beal
bradley beal
"Just for the record, on the next trip down, they did the same thing with Bradley Beal.  Markieff Morris had time for a smoke before Beal crashed into him, and they called it a block on Morris anyway."
"I’ve never seen Bradley Beal make a clutch shot, like ever."
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I swear, I've never seen Bradley Beal come up clutch."
Bradley barrel roll beal
Bradley Beal licking his lips on the bench
Bradley Beal
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
"To some degree, that’s every fan base. Fans wanting to believe in their team can convince themselves of anything. I’ve run into this with Thunder fans who are so up Presti’s ass that they don’t understand a trade isn’t realistic. There are fans expecting OKC to trade Hill, Ariza, and Horford and get first-round picks for each of them. And look at any fan base of a team that wants to trade for Bradley Beal and the offers they throw out there. Always ridiculous.  I obviously only know what I saw tonight, but it’s rare for me to see a sub tear down their team’s two best players (Jimmy and Bam) like that sub is tonight."
If Bradley Beal is an all star Zach Levine definitely is.
Yeah it’s nice and refreshing from seeing the Bradley Beal trade proposition posts every time we lose
"Bradley Beal, in a loss, when Westbrook is out"
I would guess Bradley Beal
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"If that’s your logic, I don’t wanna hear NOTHIN about Bradley Beal"
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Luka Doncic 12. Paul George 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Yeah I know I know Joker too high..... stay sleep man.
so bradley beal?
"Let’s go through a list of some notable players who refer to Jrue Holiday as one of the game’s best three defenders or as the league’s most underrated players:   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, Joe Ingles, JJ Redick.](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2020/9/9/21428836/jrue-holiday-giannis-lebron-james-ja-morant-all-defensive-pelicans-bucks-clippers-beverley-bledsoe)"
Why is Luka being a starter an uproar but not Bradley Beal?
"I kinda like these tiers.  Destroyer Class: Lebron, KD, Kawhi, Steph, Harden  Wrecking Crew: Bradley Beal, Zach LaVine, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker"
"Welp, I guess we'll be getting the Bradley Beal trade sometime next week."
But I thought he was a net-negative playing like a rookie like all the Bradley Beal fanboys was chirping earlier?
How did we win a game where Bradley Beal was playing well
Quick question are you mad that Bradley Beal is a starter than?
It’s mostly a minutes thing. I think he overtook Bradley Beal a few games ago and is currently the best second half scorer in the NBA
"RIP to one of the Top 3 Bullets/Wizards players in history, WES UNSELD!  Westley Sissel Unseld or better known as WES UNSELD, ranks up with Elvin Hayes and John Wall as the greatest D.C./Baltimore mainstays in history. We can cover some of the famous feats like his Rookie-MVP season in 1969, or the championship ring he muscled his teammates to in 1978, but I'm going to cover his accolades making the team's age squad, in typical age-squad-guy fashion:  •	Wes is easily the best Center in franchise history. He is their best Center at the ages of ... 22-24, 26, 28-29, &amp; 32-34, and made the 30-31 squads as a 6th selection.  •	Wes is absolutely the BEST franchise player from the ages 22-24... let's highlight why:  •	In this period, Unseld received the MVP award in his rookie season, received the 8th most votes for the award the following season (1970), and then made his 2nd all-star game the year after (1971).   •	Wes racked up 31.9 Win Shares in his first 3 seasons (still age 22-24 folks). Of the 28 players to rack up more than Unseld in this span, only Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, and Wes have a majority of those win shares come from DEFENSE.  •	Usually with young stars, they are dumping out astronomical stats on cellar dwellers, but Wes' Bullets were 57-25 in his rookie season. By his 3rd campaign, they ran roughshod through the regular season at 42-40, but still ended up making the NBA Finals! (Unseld would make 3 more Finals after that).  •	The only player to put up better numbers during a similar age-frame was Walt Bellamy who played during the infamous 1962 surge and for a miserably failing Chicago Zephyrs team (where the Wizards originated).  •	John Wall, Phil Chenier, Chris Webber, Terry Dischinger, Earl Monroe, Bradley Beal, Gilbert Arenas, and Walt Bellamy are all special players for the Wizards in that particular age-frame, but none touch the Wide U."
"In some areas. I think the game has changed so much with the 3 ball. Kobe did so much in the post, but pretty much no guards do that now. Alot of pick and roll now which is cool too. Although bradley beal does so many moves and hard step backs like cj to get his shot. Hope both of their legs and knees last"
Bradley Beal is very overrated honestly. He's a garbage defender and a below average shooter  that just takes 24 shots per game in a terrible team
How and Bradley Beal has a worse record than the Bulls with a veteran named Westbrook on the team?
Yes give me Caruso over Bradley Beal as well haha
"Because ppg entirely represents a player's production on the court. Bradley Beal is currently better than Harden/Lebron/Curry/Jokic/Embiid lol, you just get more stupid with each comment."
Bradley beal is a starter and his team record is ass. Lavine will get in no question
It not that bad we're 12-16 and 9th in the east. If Bradley beal is a starter with a shit record zach lavine is definitely gonna be an all star.
"nope. In fact once you trade a player, you can't legally reacquire him for a year  Being able to loan players would make the NBA tank race insane. People whine about it now? Wait till the Wizards loan out Bradley Beal to the Lakers for a couple future picks for a playoff run. It can't work in the NBA."
LaVine is deeply entrenched in that Bradley Beal territory where he continuously improves every year for like half a decade before he finally elevates to the point he can’t be ignored and underrated anymore. Brad Beal just finally got his due respect this year after being an offensive juggernaut for several years.
Paul Pierce got the Bradley Beal treatment for being on shitty teams
Can't wait for Bradley Beal quotes after the game.  *We couldn't guard a locked bicycle*
Damn he’s older than Bradley Beal and entered the league 4 years after Brad.
Bro I ain’t even going to cap an argument with you but did Bradley Beal fuck your girl or something? You’ve been dogging him this whole thread. Let the man play in an all star game. There are better efficiency players in the East who could have started over him but you’re acting like it’s Wally Szczerbiak starting over prime Kobe in the all star game. It’s really not that crazy that Beal is a starter.
"He literally did say he evaluated his options, I’m not denying that. There was a report that said if he left, it would’ve been to the Blazers. Ultimately he chose to stay because he’s happy here and has a connection to the city  If you think he was pressured into it, you’re wrong. He already said he could deal with the pressure, he just didn’t want it to bother his teammates. Essentially he viewed waiting another year to sign as a wasted year, because they would get nothing done.  I seriously don’t get why people want players to leave their teams as soon as they meet any kind of adversity. Same shit with Bradley Beal, he says he doesn’t want to leave yet you always see these bullshit trade packages for him everywhere to “FreE HiM”"
Bradley Beal!
Bradley Beal is leading the league in scoring....you’re putting harden on based on name?
"Keep that same energy when talking about Luka, Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine"
"Because James Harden has the bigger impact but forced a trade early in the year and apparently this is code for “well now you can’t start the all star game because you look like a big fat jerk” and Bradley Beal is getting his comeuppance for being righteously snubbed last year. Have a hard time thinking the reserves won’t be harden, brown and LaVine."
Hornets and Nets are exciting. It’s fun see Bradley Beal play 2K ball too. Pacers are boring to me. No one is flashy and not much exciting seems to happen aside from watching Turner get 4 blocks lol.
"Why not both? Be an all star and win a rings. That's how you stack up as being the best. At the end of Kobe's career, he won 5 ring and was a 17 time all star.   Also you're saying the all star game is meaningless, I bet you it generate a shit ton of money for the nba and it's an honor for those that make it, especially for Bradley beal."
"""Oh (...I thought you meant disappointed in this season).""   -Bradley Beal"
Who are you taking off to put Demar Derozan on? Who are you taking Bradley Beal off to put on?
Bradley Beal I wasn’t expecting but damn good for him
"Your flair is making me feel like we should be making each other’s comments. Has Harden had a better season - yes. Is it unfair that he has a bias due to the Houston debacle and being the last addition to a team with 2 other super stars, also yes. Does Bradley Beal deserve to be an all star, yes. At the end of the day they’re both going to be all stars. If Harden doesn’t make the all star list at all, or if this was regarding all-nba, then we’d be having a much different conversation.   It’s not that deep dude, let’s just watch our teams play each other lmao."
About time Bradley Beal gets in. Long overdue
"Lmao don’t get me wrong here I don’t believe that Beal is having a better season by any means.   What Beal does have is the fan and media narrative backing, along with stats this season that would justify a selection. It’s very telling looking at the media and fan voting that they have been biased against the Nets.   Does he deserve the starter spot - yes, but Bradley Beal being the selections is acceptable in my mind since both were most likely to make the team either way."
"Stats wise aren't they just about the same but with Luka almost averaging a triple double? And are we really holding their team record against them now? So by that logic Bradley Beal shouldn't be considered for the game either since both of their teams are in the negative. And objectively certain players will make the game regardless of record.  Guys like dame, steph, LeBron, AD, etc. could all be on teams with a less than .500 record but still make the all star team easily. Look at Trae Young making the starting lineup last year on a bottom feeder tea.. for fucks sake.So winning basketball isn't as relevant as you seem to think it is. Unless we're talking about non-supererstar players. Thats a bad argument."
Bradley Beal is my father.
Well you have Bradley Beal this year who is playing for the 9-17 wizards. You also had Trae Young who started despite playing for a low seeded hawks team.
giannis is the new bradley beal
Bradley Beal is an all star starter lol
he asked out before this season even started. still showed up and even while dogging it produced more wins than all-star starter Bradley Beal.
"He's basically half white Bradley Beal. An elite scorer, top 10 in the league, plays at a high level every game, but gets little recognition because of a weak team backing them."
"I don’t think Beal is a better playmaker than kawhi, I’m just saying that you can be a great scorer and not automatically a great playmaker because of that, case in point, Bradley Beal"
Bradley Beal hasn’t skirted COVID protocols. He showed up on time to training camp. He’s in shape. And he isn’t shittalking his teammates.
"Because Bradley Beal ain’t have a good team since 2017, the team Harden had in Houston way better than the Wizards right now"
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"Eric Gordon, Wes Matthews, Bradley Beal, and (so far) Patrick Williams. I’m running a mostly guard lineup bc shaq can carry defensively when needed and they’re smaller and faster than the bigs. Also I’d only really be lacking at the 4 position."
LeBron bouta snatch Bradley Beal
"All-Star voting is also heavily narrative and popularity based. S When Bradley Beal is struggling to get named an All-Star scoring 30ppg in the less competitive conference, RJ would have to be putting up world-beater numbers to get a look."
"Yeah but now you have both Harden and Westbrook in the East, Bradley Beal playing even better than last year and with the focus on him after being snubbed, and Butler, Trae and Simmons all with massive personal fanbases. RJ and Herro would both have to take pretty drastic leaps to break that rotation"
Yeah Bradley Beal and Westbrook have really lit up the playoffs the last few years
"Naw he won’t be forgotten. He’s too recognizable and iconic. Same reason how Westbrook won’t ever be forgotten. I worry guys like Bradley Beal, or maybe Dame Lillard will be forgotten"
"I agree he has offensive limitations and holds back the team in that way. But in no way is oladipo + 7 picks better than what the sixers were going to give them.   Even if somehow starts to shoot, that won’t automatically win them a chip. It’s starts with him being aggressive and looking to drive and score. Bradley Beal shoots but he’s not a winner. Gotta look at everything my guy"
Bradley Beal cheaper
"You’re getting raped when he’s on the floor, and last year was barely better.  All impact metrics show him as a complete negative and he has a 12 PER, again. Which goes to my point about pace and the current league.  Bradley Beal is just causally doing 35 a game efficiently. Trae Young was a 30/10 guy last year.  Our brains have not caught up to just how crazy this era is offensively.   And Herro is like, Aaron Afflalo in this era so far and nothing more. Just a lot hype due to whiteness and Miami, and Jimmy and the playoff run.  To make him the barrier between a true rare talent is insane, and it’ll be known by EVERYOBE by the time the playoffs start and people will look back on the undervaluing of Harden like his missing the All-NBA teams that one year."
"Smart and snarky comment!   Which is why you see superteams forming to beat Bradley Beal and Devin Booker right?  If the nets win the chip will your reaction be “ good players can win games, more news at 10”"
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
"Found someone who clearly wasn’t watching back in 2009 and is basing it off stats, Kobe and Lebron were regarded as the two best players and Wade was a distant third at that point this is revisionist history.  Lebron was the king of the regular season, meanwhile Kobe was in the middle of a 3 year run where he made 3 finals, won 2 championships, 2 finals MVP and an MVP. His stats were lower because he was leading a team that was winning 55+ games in the triangle offense. Look at how his stats went up in the playoffs every single year, dude was averaging around 30/5/5.   Dwayne Wade put up those numbers and barely won 43 games, the year before he lead his team to 19 wins. What you’re doing right now is like someone in 10 years saying Bradley Beal is better then this years Lebron based off stats. Wade finished behind both Kobe and Lebron in the MVP race also."
"""Bradley Beal""   In the words of flight reacts ""AND THE REST ARE NOBODY'S!!!"""
Bradley Beal doesn't want to leave Washington though
beal at least made it to he playoffs w/ wall at least and there was one season where wall was injured for the majority of it too 2018. THis was when Bradley beal took it to the next level. Kyrie's cav were terrible.
"John Wall, Bradley Beal, and DeMarcus Cousins sounds nice and actually make sense"
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
I apologize. Bradley Beal averages 9 more points on 54%EFG and Kyrie averages 26 on 56. Who has Kevin Durant on his team.
Bradley Beal was really unlucky to have Westbrook back with him.  This will not allow him to go one more step forward collectively.
"Yeah I’ve seen AD improve even more this year on his offense and shooting, I think he’ll still easily be top 5 and get the super max when his contract runs out in 2024   Curry is about to turn 33 and has also had lots of health problems but he’s still a top 5 player and looks very fast on the court  Embiid is also 26 and very good, Bradley Beal is 27, Lavine getting better and he’s 25, Trae is 22, Donovan Mitchell 24, Ingram 23, Zion 20~ the nba has a lot of talent and some of these guys are improving a lot and I wouldn’t be surprised if in 5 years half of them are also better  The top 5 is usually also based off of playoff performance and history so if some of these guys make it to the finals or win a chip before him the conversation gets clearer"
"As a Bradley Beal fantasy owner, this is less than ideal"
"Bradley Beal: ""I want to stay in DC""  Tommy Sheppard: ""Beal isn't going anywhere""  NBA media and r/nba: ""Tyler Herro, a bag of chips, and a 2nd for Beal who says no?"""
"Put another way:  Teams have been interested in Bradley Beal for a couple years now, but Harden going to the Nets now reduces the list of potential suitors by one."
Bradley Beal makes 200K too much to be part of our TPE and that makes me sad.
bradley beal doesnt suck on defense smfh
"Don't put that on Bradley Beal, we have enough issues in Washington,  yet alone basketball"
Not with Bradley Beal in the eas... oh wait
Man his style like prime draymond green. You can't win with that when you can't score points  I know they can't be one dimensional but he needs to be the third option like the dude said  What philly needs is bradley beal honestly. I could see them making the finals with him. Without no way they ever get past ecf. You shut down embid and you think simmons going to win you the game? He literally can't score enough points
Why tf would anyone in their right minds trade Bradley Beal for fkn Kyrie?
Bradley Beal would be a way better fit schematically for the Nets then Kyrie is.
Bradley Beal finna pull Godric Gryffindor’s sword out and put in work
"I mean just going by numbers, Bradley Beal is more efficient on both sides of the basketball. I too would love to have KD on my team to help carry me."
Am I insane for thinking Bradley Beal is better than kyrie?
The Mavericks will happily take Bradley Beal
"Right, and that's why I said he can be Draymond on steroids because he has a better offensive skillset. In my mind, a more aggressive Ben can be Dray with more dynamic playmaking, better driving and layup package, with comparable defense.   Like many others I think Ben's skills would look better next to a real shooting threat. Like a guy who scores on higher volume than Seth Curry. Those Bradley Beal rumors, however unrealistic, had me excited to see Ben's maximized potential."
They are exactly 1 Bradley Beal away from fighting for a top 4 seed in the east.
WIZARDS SIGN IAN MAHINMI AGAIN AND WAIVE BRADLEY BEAL AFTER RE-HIRING GM GENIUS ERNIE GRUNFELD....   FFS.....

2022: Simmons for Bradley Beal? 👀
Bradley Beal is not a happy man
Bradley Beal still just wants to make an all star team though.
Feel like I've just been edged for all too long for no payload. Hoping we can get Bradley Beal or something.. Embiid is having a breakout season and I'd hate to waste his next few years with just above average supporting cast.
&gt; Bradley Beal will be traded for Dennis smith jr  what is wrong with you lmao
To the Wizards for Bradley Beal.
"&gt;If Harden wants out that's one thing, you can do that without playing like dogshit and throwing your teammates under the bus.  I mean, he's still played every game. Averaging 36.5 minutes a game. Leading the league in assists, grabbing almost 7 boards and scoring 25 a night. You are making it seem like he is pulling a VC.   &gt;Off the top of my head Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Giannis and Bradley Beal are all superstar players who can do what you seem to think is impossible for James.  1. If Harden had the supporting cast that Steph had his entire run, he'd be sitting comfortably with the same amount of chips and wouldn't care about how the Rockets are now because he'd have his. But he didn't. CP3 got hurt and he never got his chance to get his again because his teams never had the same talent as the other contenders.   2. Giannis JUST signed a supermax. It's the next one that would be comparable to Hardens tenure with the Rockets. Same for Beal. His rookie deal he has no say in. Harden didn't ask to be traded from OKC.   3. Yeah, Dame is special and there's a reason he's so loved by that city. But he's also not on Harden's level and has lower expectations (and is held to a lower standard)"
"If Harden wants out that's one thing, you can do that without playing like dogshit and throwing your teammates under the bus.  The way Harden is choosing to go about this is incredibly selfish and disrespectful to his team.  Take the PG-13/Westbrook route and quietly go to management to tell them you want out, play like a pro while they find a deal and handle your business like an adult.   Off the top of my head Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Giannis and Bradley Beal are all superstar players who can do what you seem to think is impossible for James.  They've all stayed with their teams and are committed to setting the tone &amp; creating a culture for their organizations despite challenges.  You say that LeBron hasn't stuck around a single team for 8 years, but he's also never done anything close to what Harden is doing right now with 2 years left on his deal.   CP3 played more off ball and transitioned to being a secondary piece pretty well when he was in Houston.  Can he be prickly &amp; rub some players the wrong way? Sure, but in retrospect let's look at who those players are &amp; what their make-up is.  I'm more inclined to side with CP3 on this one, it's hard for a team to function when your superstar stands around any time he doesn't have the ball."
"Theres a Ringer podcast with the title ""Bradley Beal, We're begging you to ask for a trade"" and it just rubs me the wrong way.  I don't think I'll ever like the vultures trying to pick stars off of teams like they did with AD, tried to with Giannis, now Beal."
Wizards for Bradley Beal
"The NBA is really falling short on common sense areas right now.   1. Space out the games more. You get these mass breakouts because teams are playing 3-4 times per week. One infection can spread to several teams very quickly. The NBA should know this because of the first Rudy Gobert outbreak.    When games are packed too tightly together, the virus spreads quicker.  2. Have the tests in earlier. A huge chunk of the current covid cases / potential covid cases come from Seth Curry (not that it's his fault). Seth was playing sick and they pulled him midway through the game because they got a positive test result.    The question the NBA needs to ask is, why was Seth playing if his results hadn't come back yet?  3. Be more honest and realistic about who is at risk. Bradley Beal had to isolate because he spoke to Tatum at the end of the game and Tatum ended up being positive. If Beal speaking to Tatum is enough to put Beal at risk then everyone on the Celtics should be considered at risk too, because they've all spoken to Tatum and shared a huddle with him during the game.    Right now the NBA is trying to isolate as few as possible and it's clearly not working.   None of this is rocket science. The world has had a year to learn about and understand this virus. This is simple shit."
Nah not everyone. Dame and Bradley Beal ain't afraid of the grind
Michael Jordan  CJ McCollum   Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal for Harden?!
"I don't feel bad for wall. He's been a selfish and immature player his whole career. Now at 30, I have to listen to him on his cloud of judgement handing out life lessons?  If you want to feel bad for someone you can feel bad for Bradley Beal."
I perfer Bradley Beal
Watson wants out because the Texans are a absolute shit show of a organization and a guy named Bill O Brian who was the GM and fucked the team over. They had Deandre Hopkins who was a top 15 player and the best wide receiver in the league and was the second most valuable player in the Texans and about to enter his prime. They traded him for a washed player on a horrible contract and a mediocre pick  The nba Equivalent of the Hopkins trade would be like Lemarcus Aldridge and the 20th overall pick for Bradley Beal  As for his player comp I’m gonna say Ben Simmons or Trae Young (Top 20 young star)
He'd be bradley beal if he played like he's playing now for 5 years
he'd be bradley beal
Bradley Beal and Davis Bertrans
Kyrie for Bradley Beal who says no?
"I don't see why we would trade Zach Lavine unless he wants out. If we're bad enough that Lavine doesn't stay, then trading him for James Harden or Bradley Beal probably just leads to them asking out now.  If we were going for a trade, I'd trade him for future draft assets. On that note, the Pelicans, Warriors, and Thunder become the instant trade partners to look at. I think the Warriors have the most prime draft asset with the Minnesota pick, so I'd go after that.  The most reasonable trade is probably something like Kelly Oubre, Kevon Looney, Damion Lee, the 2021 Minnesota pick, 2026 Golden State pick (converts to 2nd if it conveys to Memphis), and 2028 Golden State pick, and maybe a pick swap or two for good measure."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"

I get what you're saying...but Bradley Beal has been pretty damn consistently great so far. His worst game of the year he still put up 27/10/5...
"Well the usual superstars plus Booker and Bradley Beal  ..Ingram But players who we wouldn’t expect to make it I’d say. Brodgon, and I say someone from utah makes it also Zion but I doubt the nba gives Pelicans 2 all stars."
We need a go to scorer. Bradley Beal or Zach LaVine would elevate this team so much.
Bradley Beal is super annoying this year!  Stop making every shot and calm down.
"That's Bradley ""You Suck"" Beal to you."
with Bradley Beal off the bench? Book it.
"I know he had a 60 point game a few days ago, but this is equally impressive. He was in complete control, making plays for others, and getting it done offensively all night. Bradley Beal is having himself a pretty good season so far and I'm sure it feels great to finally get another one in the win column."
Terrible Washington Wizards are doing it now. Bradley Beal putting up unreal numbers breaking team records in losses.
Bradley Beal is insane. Literally insane.
Bradley Beal with a 30 pt lead ain't losing
bradley beal is so fucking good. his game is so fun to watch
"I've been saying since last year that the Nuggets need to shake it up to really contend, and we're all seeing their deep seated issues so far this season. I think Washington needs a shake up too, they have good players but they just don't fit together well. I came up with this trade, which works on the trade machine:  Denver gets:   * Davis Bertans  * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * Jamal Murray  * Paul Millsap  * Bol Bol  * RJ Hampton  * 3 1sts (2021, 2024, 2026)  * 2 pick swaps (2022, 2025)  Denver runs Beal/Harris/MPJ/Bertans/Jokic, great spacing for Jokic to work with, and Beal adds consistent star power, which Denver needs to pair with Jokic, he's not enough by himself. Second unit of Morris/Campazzo/Barton/Green/Hartenstein  The Wiz get a very promising young PG in Murray, two talented projects in Bol and Hampton, Millsap is expiring financial filler who provides a veteran presence for a year, and several picks/swaps to help the rebuild."
I've been a huge Malik Beasley fan since he filled in for (I think) an injured Gary Harris a few years ago in Denver. His game reminds me of Bradley Beal before Beal started playing off the dribble. I think Malik can have a Beal-esque jump and imo will average 25-27ppg one day (not this year).
"no use in arguing with someone who thinks the Celtics could trade Marcus Smart for Bradley Beal or comments ""this is why I stay away from the game threads"" and then has 75% of their comments in game threads.  Best of luck to you, pal."
"It’s simple, siakam is a good player but he isn’t a number one option, give him a number one option like a Bradley Beal or James Harden for example, siakam will flourish"
"Kevin Durant: in contact tracing for 5 days because he was with an unknown person who is positive  Bradley Beal: in contact tracing because he chatted with Tatum after the game  Joel Embiid: rubbed his hands on face after dapping up Seth Curry, sat next to him on the bench, shared a locker room with him, not in contact tracing   &gt;just going by the standards they set up bro"
Their league worst defense is a lot on him tbh. Also Bradley Beal keeps scoring 40 and they keep losing
"For a superstar, defense doesn't matter that much.* Offense matters significantly more. For a role player, defense matters more than offense. If you're role player is a superstar on defense and you end up paying him a max, you're essentially paying an overpaying role player.  *Superstars have to hit a minimum level of defense though. Can't be Trae Young or Bradley Beal."
&gt;Bradley Beal going for 60 and the only thing stopping him wasn't ben but a 2nd year player in Maxey  A lot to process here
"yeah the protocols are a complete farce with 0 consistency. their logic is basically:  sweating, breathing, yelling, touching each other in contact sport that lasts 2 hours = acceptable  post game chat for 30 seconds with Tatum = to the gulag for Bradley Beal"
Bradley Beal was already great before last season tho.
Nice try Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal is this year’s Bradley Beal.
So by your logic Bradley Beal isn’t an all star player either right?
"Bradley beal: ""pain"""
Joining Bradley Beal
"worse than Bradley Beal, that’s foresure"
Hope they start winning games. I don’t want him to become a Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal type where he puts up a show but it all gets wasted with no postseason appearances.
or Bradley Beal last season
He's this year's Bradley Beal.
"At this point it absolutely be paused. The rapid tests are not really accurate as we know, several teams now should be quarantining. Bradley Beal had to quarantine (only him) bc he talked to Tatum at some point, but guys breathing all over each other and sweating and touching them touching their faces to wipe sweat or lick their hands etc doesn’t require sitting out?? Their protocols make zero sense. Even worse, the Sixers had a guaranteed loss yesterday and had to play 7 guys with 3 of them being rookies in the nba and a 4th who has barely ever played in the nba before. It’s looking more like that game went on only bc it’s national tv, it’s a joke. How can the standings and integrity of the games really be upheld as legitimate when teams are gonna have to play w 7-8 players for 7-10 days when they get outbreaks??   Fans wanting basketball should literally have 0 weight in their decisions on how to handle this tbh. We’re like 2 weeks into the season with the country continuing to have record highs almost daily with cases and deaths. This isn’t like a guy getting a muscle injury and having to miss 3 weeks, whole teams have to be isolated here"
ur right. scroeder kuzma and anthony davis for bradley beal is a good trade
"honestly bradley beal is already the best scorer in the league, but is the worst defender and worst playmaker in the league so it evens out making him an average player."
"I'd say Jokic is a better passer which is huge praise in itself. He's the only player in the world that has no discernable flaw on offense, other than LeBron, and he does it as a 5 which creates a matchup nightmare for every team in the league. The best player he's ever played with is a borderline all star and he led a 3-1 comeback against arguably a title favourite. Give Jokic a Pascal Siakam or Bradley Beal type player and he could average a triple double on a championship team. LeBron is top 3 at the absolute worst all time but in 2021 Big Honey has it all.  As for Giannis, he reminds me a lot of young LeBron. If you can't knock down your free throws and if you can't score at 3 levels, you can't be the best player in the world.  I think that LeBron, Jokic, Kevin Durant, AD Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry have an argument for being the best player in the world. Doncic is knocking on the door. Everyone else either has a major flaw (Giannis, Harden) or is just not as good as someone else who does the same thing (Lillard [Curry] , Embiid [AD] )."
Bradley Beal is a terrific player. But tbh this is basically what he signed up for. So not sure why he’s so frustrated.
Because in 2021 Bradley Beal is better than John Wall. Y'all gotta let 2016 go
I’d take Brown over Beal tbh  and that’s not a slight against Bradley
"""Local Intermediate Rec League Team would love to have Bradley Beal""  Well no shit, but he's not going anywhere."
"Karl Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, and Tobias Harris."
That would not even be enough to get Kyle Lowry let alone Bradley Beal
Lakers can trade the Wizards advice on how to draft their next few picks.  They seem to value our scouting.  Jessie Buss for Bradley Beal?
29 teams are interested in acquiring Bradley Beal.

"Most people don’t watch games. They just look at the box score. Replace Bradley Beal with John Wall and the Washington Wizards aren’t 3-11. Bradley Beal is a better player, but John Wall is a much better leader.   Bradley Beal can’t be the only All star caliber player on a team. He’s a third option at best on a championship team that has an elite defensive big."
Rockets are better than the Wizard  Beal is better than Wall (right now)    I’d be in on this post pre-injury but until Wall is back for a while and if he starts playing better than Bradley (he’s not) then maybe.
Bradley Beal is considered to be better than John Wall because he is better than John Wall
Unless you are called Bradley Beal
"Even if the wolves have the worst record in the NBA, they still only have a 40% chance of going top 3. Even then, I don’t know if they’ll be good enough to be out of the lottery by next year anyway.   So basically we’re talking about a pick with a 60% chance to be really good, and then that remaining 40% has about a 20% chance of being a top 4 pick, so we’re taking about roughly a 68% of the pick being high value.   So is Bradley Beal worth Wiseman + a 68% chance at a high pick? I’d say so"
"I'll do you one better...I'll trade my broken Xbox 360, a $5 lottery ticket (already scratched and worth $5), and half a bag of Doritos (Nacho Cheese) for Bradley Beal.  It's a clear win/win for everybody and will surely help my pickup squad...whenever we can play basketball again."
FREE BRADLEY BEAL.
"Yeah I think so too. I don’t think Wiseman is very good. Steph is about to turn 33, losing the Minnesota pick hurts, but if that pick turns into Bradley Beal, I’d be thrilled"
"I wanna fight this but I can’t. Teams that are 7-11 shouldn’t have all stars. All stars play winning basketball, unless your Bradley Beal..."

"""Bradley Beal is the first NBA Player to lose 10 straight 40-point games"""
"I also don’t think those guys you mentioned will be included in any trade as with a player considerably better than Beal in Harden the rockets did not get a player back that is as valuable as JJJ. They got possibly 1 year of Oladipo, two players worse than any of the players Memphis will offer and a bunch of picks and swaps. I would take Memphis’ young pieces with team control for longer than Oladipo and maybe 2 less picks/swaps over the package for Harden and that’s James Harden we’re talking about not Bradley Beal.  I understand the whole ticket selling perspective, but I think in 1.5 seasons or so you can have that right back with someone like Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Chet Holmgen, Patrick Baldwin, Emoni Bates, etc."
Wizards are going to trade Bradley beal for Burks Noel Knox and 2 firsts and enjoy every moment of it.
at this point. beal to gsw for wiseman and picks. wizards will tank this season and rebuild. at the same time give bradley a fighting chance for a ring
*insert Bradley Beal meme face here*
"You might get downvoted like crazy, but if people aren’t giving the recognition to Bradley Beal that he deserves solely because he’s on a losing team (ie, has no support around him), then they should also hold it against players like KD who are on the complete opposite end of the spectrum and have a great supporting cast."
"[“I respect the fact that they drafted me, that’s first and foremost,” Beal told Haynes. “Just being in one spot for your whole career, having your jersey in the rafter one day, being that important to an organization, those were all things that drew me.”](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/bradley-beal-signing-extension-wizards-last-year-im-franchise-here)  Yeah he chose to stay. He got the bag and be knew what would come from it. Nothing wrong with that."

ALL NBA TRADE RUMORS: Every NBA Team would love to trade for Bradley Beal
"Even a quick glance at bpm for last year shows a ton of discrepancies that are pretty irreconcilable.   For example: Steven Adams, Bradley Beal, Montrezll Harrell, and Mitchell Robinson all have a 2.9 bpm and that's a wide range of player value right there. They all have a lower bpm than Whiteside, and from what I heard he wasn't positive value for Portland last year. It's full of stuff that contextually makes no sense. Jaylen Brown had a 0.8 bpm while Hayward had a 2.7, Smart had a 1.4, Tatum had a 4.0, and Kemba topped them off at a 4.6. Not only is that wrong, I'd go so far as to say it's pretty much completely off in terms of which players played the best and which players had the most impact"
closest is Bradley Beal. But Trout is a better baseball player than Beal is a basketball player.
Don't worry they getting Bradley Beal /s
When you think about arguing why Jerami Grant deserves to make it just think about how Bradley real deal Beal got snubbed last year. There is zero chance Grant makes it. Or are you saying honorable mention?
"I feel you, and while I don’t necessarily think record should play a role in all star spots, it always does. See: Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, etc"
"Imagine Bradley beal had Wiggins, Oobre and Wiseman. What a team"
I think Bradley Beal should demand a Bradley Beal trade if he really wants out
Why would Bradley Beal start? Bradley Beal is so overrated. He might not even be a top 20 player in the league.   Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown deserve to start over Bradley Beal. They’ve both been better and have been winning games.
"Bradley beal for a dumptruck ass and first round picks, who says no"
He is gonna get Bradley Bealed this year. Beal really can’t get Bealed again with those numbers
Especially when they're probably going to add Bradley Beal.

"The results of a team being worn down by injuries and COVID. Jimmy and Bradley got COVID around two weeks ago after playing the Wizards the day Beal had to be taken off the court pregame. We played two games with 8 guys who were mostly end of bench guys, which resulted in Herro straining his neck. Then the last Brooklyn game Dragic got hurt as well. So we played today without Dragic, Herro, and Butler. Our team is already thin on perimeter playmakers, and it’s even worse when we lose our three good ones. Teams kinda demoralized right now tbh.   TLDR: Fuck the nba for making us play the wizards game."
I don't know why everybody's feelings come into it when a player gets frustrated with losing.  Bradley Beal deserves tens of millions of dollars *and* a fun job?  Eff that.
I feel like there is a very clear line where centering your offense around one player is bad for the team and Bradley Beal seems like a great example. Its sorta like the Kobe dilemma. Every team wants to develop the next Kobe but if the player isnt that level you are better off with an unselfish team oriented approach.
lol ik we're on the fuck bradley beal he got his money wave right now. my diagrams show that the pendulum will swing back the other way approx. 1 week before the trade deadline
"No ones reading all that and can we please stop this ""We should not say free bradley beal he signed the extension"" there have litterally been 12 of those posts already"
Bradley Beal.
bradley beal isn’t as good as lebron more news at 6
Kevin Love is the most overrated 3rd option of all time. LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were by far the best duo in the NBA in 2016.   I want Bradley Beal to end up on the Los Angeles Lakers. It would make the Los Angeles Lakers a lock to make the NBA Finals and the Finals would be competitive.
Bradley “pls send help” Beal
"They're a game out of 8th, 2.5 games back from 6th, and will be getting Herro, Butler, Dragic, Bradley back.  Their next 8 games are LAC (missing PG/Kawhi), Sac, Charlotte, WAS x2, NYK x2, HOU.  I think they'll be okay.   Biggest issue I have is the decision to give Meyers the money he got instead of re-signing Jae, or going for another player that would actually produce. The idea was obviously Giannis, but it just seems kinda insulting to the players on the team if you're willing to re-sign a player just to be used in a trade package.   They'll look to go for Beal or Oladipo I'd presume, but I might almost prefer they go the cheaper route and try make a play for Lonzo."
"it's night time right now, bradley beal is elated with the wizards"

"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
Id prefer to trade Sabonis because he could net us something better. He could be the potential centerpiece of a bradley beal trade maybe. Myles would not get something back as impactful as Myles.
Tf bro? Just bc Beal didn’t sign with the heat or the Lakers doesn’t mean he originally chose to play on a bad team. a player of his caliber can reasonably expect his organization to put a winning team around him. and he made this “choice” (even tho he was RFA) multiple years ago- people are allowed to change their minds dude. Bradley Beal is too good to be at the bottom of the league. Idk why anyone is trying to refute that.
"""As Bradley Beal stands with his former teammate, in John Wall, against the hellish fiend that forcefully tore them apart, Russell Westbrook. It was clear Beal despised his new teammate."""
&gt;Bill Simmons: I thought Westbrook was going to Washington. And I had heard that Bradley Beal was driving the Westbrook thing and that they were actually going to include a pick potentially and it wasn’t just a one-for-one that they were actually putting in more.  not concrete evidence but I did hear it a bit
If Scott Brooks outlasts Bradley Beal I swear to god...
No it doesnt Washing sucks id love to see him compete in the playoffs.  Imma keep cheering for Bradley Beal to go to a proper team.
"I think people are overrating Bradley Beal. He's not going to turn every marginal playoff team into a title favorite. Unless their only flaw is that they need a better high scoring guard.  Like... he's better than Murray, but would Denver getting Beal really make them the best team in the West?"
"Bradley Beal is probably gonna have quite a bit of ""knee soreness,"" ""covid 19 protocols,"" and ""DNP - personal reasons"" this year"
"And media pundits who want him in big markets.  Talk to any espn outlet and they'll tell you Devin Booker wants out of Phoenix, yesterday.  Talk to Devin Booker and he'll tell you he wants to spend his career in Phoenix. Shit, you can't even use the ""Sarver bad"" argument to say he'll get pushed out because Booker is like one of the few Suns (much like Nash) who has a fantastic relationship with the owner. You can point to LMA, John Wall, but that's not a fair comparison when Booker is much closer to Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal than he is to either of the aforementioned.  Same crap with Beal, Lavine, and I promise if the Mavs don't put together a .650 team around Luka, he'll be the next subject of criticism. Hell, people still expect Dame to want to leave when he's dropping 50+ in losses as if his entire team isn't out for injury."
How is Bradley Beal better than Kyrie and PG  😂
"Historically nobody besides Lebron and Mj has 4 rings AND 4 FMVPs.(KD would be only the 3rd)  Historically no player with 3 FMVPs is sitting outside the top 10  I would gladly put KD ahead of Duncan, Shaq and Kobe(love Kobe) if he accomplished that. He would be probably add in another MVP and he’s second in scoring this year behind Bradley Beal, who I don’t believe is going to keep that lead, so KD would add his 5th scoring title.  It would be extremely hard to argue that resume(especially since his resume is already long as it is) if he adds in those accolades. The hate for his warriors run would subside much like when people said they don’t count Brons rings and he had to “go to Dwades team to win”. Bron in Miami was much more hated than KD with GS"
"If players like Lebron and Steph don’t get no trade clauses in their most recent contracts, what makes you think Bradley fucking Beal is gonna get one?"
"Nah, man. Free Bradley Beal. He’s too good of a player to have his career wasted away in a axe where he won’t play any meaningful games. I want to see him on a contender where he can make some noise in some important games."
"I think it entirely depends on Bradley Beal at this point. If he wants out, then Wizards would likely go into a rebuilding phase with Westbrook as their tank commander."
You're not allowed to win MVP if you have another top player on your team. Sorry but those are the rules established in 2017. Bradley Beal is the MVP

If the Clippers can build a playoff team around Lou Williams I'm pretty sure there's a way to build a good team around Bradley Beal.
"I'm just gonna throw this trade idea out there...  Warriors get: Bradley Beal, Thomas Bryant  Wizards get: James Wiseman, Andrew Wiggins, Minny's 2021 pick, and some other draft assets"
"It is kinda interesting to think about players' scoring outside of just a plain per-game average.  Here's the current top ten players in PPG with their scoring standard deviation.  I added columns for their PPG plus and minus their standard deviation to give a sense of range.  Then I added their median score just for fun since I had the numbers there.     Player | PPG | STD | PPG+STD | PPG-STD | Median ---|---|----|----|----|---- Bradley Beal | 34.4 | 9.1 | 43.5 | 25.3 | 31.0 Kevin Durant | 30.4 | 5.9 | 36.3 | 24.5 | 29.5 Damian Lillard | 28.7 | 8.9 | 37.6 | 19.8 | 31.5 Stephen Curry | 28.4 | 11.7 | 40.1 | 16.7 | 26.0 Joel Embiid | 27.7 | 10.7 | 38.4 | 17.0 | 28.0 Jaylen Brown | 27.3 | 7.4 | 34.7 | 19.9 | 26.0 Luka Dončić | 27.3 | 8.5 | 35.8 | 18.8 | 27.5 Giannis Antetokounmpo | 27.0 | 8.4 | 35.4 | 18.6 | 27.0 Zach LaVine | 27.0 | 9.5 | 36.5 | 17.5 | 25.0 CJ McCollum | 26.7 | 7.4 | 34.1 | 19.3 | 26.0  I don't have any takeaways from this really, but it's interesting."
"Outside of Brogdon, I'm thinking about Lauri Markkanen, Zach Lavine, Aaron Gordon, Scary Terry, and Bradley Beal.  They bot peaked much imo but they was either underappreciated or simply overlooked."

You're not wrong but that is my point it being a truly 50/50 relationship between the two. Anthony cannot consistently and or efficiently initiate the offense for others and himself if at all. LeBron couldn't run the PNR to such success with a lesser player in addition to the many deficits that Anthony can mask for him.   Anthony may well be more important but the car isn't getting out of the garage without LeBron. They may be the most complementary duos in NBA history.   Bradley Beal and Anthony don't even reach the WCF last year.
"The guy himself has literally been preaching patience to the warriors fanbase and still there are people like you who complain about his championship window.  They won't win a championship with 35 million sitting injured on the bench AND they won't win a championship with this salary fucked team without a bit of lucky development from young talented players. A Bradley beal or a Zach lavine doesn't move  them into that contender status, considering how much they'd have to give up. Wiseman is raw, yes, but his freak athleticism, size and skillset is undeniable. The sky is the limit for that guy and he has the motivation to reach his potential. IF Wiseman can realise his potential and guys like Jordan Poole and the dubs' Minnesota pick can all become solid bench guys to contribute in the playoffs, the warriors could contend for a championship again. Yes, Steph would be about 36, but you're not winning shit with 34 year old Steph, klay, beal, draymond and a corpse of a bench."
"&gt;Why does team seeding affect the individual MVP Award? This is a genuine question, no one explains why it does only say it does.   it's almost like winning = good  &gt;Currently I believe Steph Curry is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Warriors from being the worst team in the league. (Source 1-7 with him injured).  Currently I believe DeMar DeRozan is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Spurs from being the worst team in the league.  Wait, no... that doesn't work. I forgot you have to score more ppg to be eligible and 21 aint gonna cut it.  &gt;Everytime his name arises everyone shoots it down because 9th seed.. Why?  because they are the 9th seed.   Bradley Beal is averaging virtually the same stats and is sitting at the same seed and nobody is bringing his name up in MVP conversation.  I wonder why?  &gt;Leading the conversation however is Nikola Jokić who is putting up amazing stats but is also on a better team.  hmm... almost like Jokic is giving a very compelling reason to be at the top of MVP conversation.  &gt;This leads to another question, why is there no Offensive Player Of the Year Award when there's a DPOY award?  there is. it's called the MVP (or 6MOTY if you're on the bench).  it's not that Curry isn't valuable to his team, it's that other players are having a more impressive season and largely the reason they are in the seeding position they're in.  the Warriors are in the position they're in and aren't a better seed because Klay is injured, and if Steph was as valuable as you say he is, the Warriors should still be comfortably in the Playoffs.  i didn't see LaMarcus Aldridge be given an MVP in 2018 for carrying the Spurs to the Playoffs was Kawhi was out essentially the entire season."
I think he plans to retire there honestly. But can you believe Bradley Beal is still with the Wizards? Cuz I can’t.
That's a team with Bradley Beal who is contending for the scoring title. Wizards are underperforming this year.
The Heat are a Bradley Beal away from being a team that's a player away.
"Listen, we can give Russ all the love in the world and not disrespect Bradley Beal. Both those things can happen. They’re both great. Beal is of course better though"
"Klay, another full offseason to get a better bench, I can 100% see it. Especially if the Minny pick conveys and they have someone like Jalen Green off the bench.  Or if they trade all those assets for a Bradley Beal or something, I can absolutely see them being contenders"
Yep. That stat annoys me so much because there is an overwhelming amount of people who don't understand the number of assists a person has does not *necessarily* indicate if they're a playmaker or not. Imo people (for example) will come and say Bradley Beal is more of a playmaker than Campazzo because one has 4.7apg and the other has 2.9apg. tbh the best way to determine who's a true playmaker is the eyetest
Fellow unbiased opinion  MVP - Bradley Beal  DPOY - What’s defense  6MOTY - Davis Bertans  MIP - Daniel Gafford  COTY - Russel Westbrook  ROTY - Anthony Gill maybe Deni Avdija
"Jalen Green is a monster. His offensive skillset is larger than most NBA players let alone rookies. Think Bradley Beal with Zach Lavine athleticism. He’s 100% gonna win at least one scoring title, and his defence is very solid too. I really really hope we (Pistons) draft him.   Evan Mobley is also someone you should keep an eye on, he averaged nearly 4 blocks a game in college, his defensive presence &amp; IQ is off the charts. He’s also shown some playmaking, midrange, and three; along with posterizing dunk after posterizing dunk. A very very tall long defender that can make an impact right away.   Every single one of this year’s top 5 would go #1 last year, it’s a loaded class"
"Yeah, I was at Klay's 37 point quarter. I watched OKC game 6 live. Curry is obviously one of my favorite players of all time and an absolute beast, I'm a total homer that way, but I can't let this Klay disrespect stand. He's a borderline superstar himself and I put him right in that Bradley Beal tier, his skill set also *perfectly* compliments Steph.   Sure that 15-16' team didn't have another top 5 (or 10) player and that's what most championship teams have, but it was a complete team from top to bottom. They came back with mostly the same roster and ran up the best regular season of all time the next year! And they came hot out of the gate like that because of all the disrespect they felt they were getting as a team!"
"Oh ok so I see you think ppg determines everything. Your the type to ignore literally everything else like rebounds, assists, steals, clutch performance, assist to turnover ratio, offensive rebounds, and blocks because one player shoots more than the other. And yeah Russ isn’t the best player on his team. So what? Fox doesn’t have Bradley Beal on his team."
"Bradley Beal?  I agree putting Lavine in there though, but 3rd team is tough for me between Kyrie and Lavine."
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
Unpopular opinion: Bradley Beal is worse than his stats tell  And Dereck rose is better than his stats show
"I just want to know who KP is better or more talented  than Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD, Dame, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Luka, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Bradley Beal, Russ, Lavine, Vucevic, Mitchell, Gobert, Booker, CP3."
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
"&gt;Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD, Dame, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Luka, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Bradley Beal, Russ, Lavine, Vucevic. These are the players at the top of my head that are all better than KP  Mitchell, Gobert, Paul, Booker, KAT"
"Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD, Dame, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Luka, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Bradley Beal, Russ, Lavine, Vucevic. These are the players at the top of my head that are all better than KP"
"Bradley Beal being 6'3, I always thought he was 6'5. Even in pictures standing next to John Wall he looked noticeably taller, but maybe that was because he was closer to  the camera. He definitely plays bigger than what he actually is."
"I always thought Bradley Beal was 6'5-6'6, i was surprised that he's obly 6'3. Also, I swear to god that on past 2k and nba live, ray allen was 6'8, just recently learned that his official height is only 6'5"
Wow that's cringy. Yeah dude I'm bawling. You really acting like anybody outside Gafford and Neto on the wizards were anywhere close to being offensively efficient lmao. Y'all are so good man bradley beal first team all pro!!1!11!
"26 points to 30 points is not miniscule. That's four more points. Which is a hell of a lot at that level. Bradley Beal leads the NBA at 31 ppg, if Joel scored four more ppg he'd average 34 ppg and would which is James Harden MVP territory.   You can say Jokic is more valuable on offense due to his role as primary facilitator in the Nuggets offense. But there's no need to act like Jokic scores at the same rate as Embiid, either throughout their careers or this season.   Also as I'm going to start doing whenever replying to a Nuggets fan about Jokic, this is a friendly reminder that Jokic will win the MVP and there's nothing anyone else can do about it. Congratulations."
"Yet he got an MVP playing on the worst playoff team in the league that year. Definitely gets no credit, has never once been given any credit for his seasons he averaged triple doubles. No one ever talks about those, nope. Not even one time, it's sad really.  He even has a better team than the warriors do talent wise, especially considering Bradley Beal is fighting steph for the scoring title. Next best offensive weapon on the warriors? Wiggins, and we all got to see how good he can be in this game.  Lol, you clearly riding Westbrook because he played for the thunder. How many rings y'all get with him? Ah that's right"
Just watch wizard games. They'd be top 5 in east if fucking Bradley Beal and Scott brooks knows how to close games.

&gt;bradley beal is way more of a first option right now than russ anyway   And yet Westbrook is still the best player on that team
You mean what he said when he left? Im assuming he just said that just so he can get out. Like bradley beal is way more of a first option right now than russ anyway
Basically Bradley Beal. Just another star caliber player that can be a top offensive option. And a PG that can run the offense and be a primary ball mover/play maker.
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He’s better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn’t easily."
I've never understood this reasoning. Some of the Celtics community is confident that Bradley Beal is going to demand to be traded to Boston so he can play with that kid he babysat back in Missouri.
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
Bradley Beal
"""you ppl"" LMAO that's how I feel when laker fans start off their trade discussion with THT, Caruso, and Kuz for Bradley Beal lol"
"If by timelord you mean Robert Williams 3, yes he is absolutely better than Caruso (a meme) and THT (an overhyped bench player that lakers fans will delude themselves into thinking is a key part of a Bradley Beal package after KD sweeps them).   He’s still probably a below average starting center in this league."
Bradley Beal shoots a shit ton more and a little more efficiently without Westbrook on the court.   We don’t need to treat this as some big mystery. Westbrook is extremely ball dominant and extremely high usage and extremely inefficient.
they are no limited in there touches..These guys are all number 1 options on there teams. YOu think Kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal or Booker never touch the ball. All it means is when ever they get the ball they shoot it.
"I see Zion smile a lot in games, I’m not sure how that wasn’t mentioned yet. Bradley Beal too"
Bradley Beal is averaging a negative +/-  Are you saying Bradley Beal is a G League player?
"Yeah it's kinda wild these arguments are based on scoring (and not the rest his offense, winning, etc)  By this logic wouldn't Bradley Beal have been at the top?"
"In all honesty this is one of the better all nba team predictions ive seen in the last month or so, but I have a few comments.   1) Although producing like an mvp candidate when he plays I dont even think KD is illegible for All NBA because hes played so little games (24 of 57 possible games) but i could be wrong on this bc of the season only being 72 games. It really depends on how he finishes the season in terms of games played.   2) With that \^ being said who would be his replacement? When it comes to the forwards in the NBA this year its a tight race and I think it's going to come down to an even split of games won (standings) and personal stats. I agree that zion should make one of the teams (not necessarily saying hes KD's replacement on the second team). If Jimmy Butler keeps the same stats and wins 70% of the remaining games I can see him making the third team but I have to admit that I would personally put Julius Randle and PG ahead of him. Julius Randle is putting up 23, 11, 6 on great shooting and his team is a couple games above .500. PG is puting up 23 6 and 5 as the second best player on a team that has twice as many wins as losses. After that the forward position isn't that competitive.   3) All your center selections are right on the money, its a shame that embiid is going to be on second team. the NBA really needs to modernize all nba selection to 2 BC and 3 FC like the all star game.  4) LeBron is an x-factor in all of this. If he plays the remaining games he can lock the first team over Kawhi but I can see some media voters choose kawhi over Lebron if he doesnt play any of the remaining games (Lebron would have played 41 of 72 games).   5) With the streak that Curry is on I can absolutely see him making the first team \*edit: in all fareness his streak wasn't this long at the time you wrote this\* I know that some may disagree bc his team currently sits 9th in western standings but Anthony Davis has made All NBA first team once or twice without making playoffs in the same season before. Regardless though I agree with all 6 of your guards. If bradley Beal wins scoring title this year it might be the first time EVER that the scoring champ doesnt make one of the all nba teams in the same season."
6 assists a game on one of the highest usages in the game is not good passing. he’s barely passing better than Bradley Beal who plays on just as shitty of a team   De’Aaron Fox is the line of when you become a good passer and he’s clearly above steph rn   steph can’t defend either
Mr Curry can lick my hairy taint. Bradley Beal baby!

"If you want Curry considered, then you also be out here advocating for Bradley Beal. Literally no one has said his name in MVP conversations, so we need to stop all the generic Steph praise. Yes he’s amazing, I’m not knocking that, but this just isn’t how MVP works."
So should Bradley Beal be considered?
"I also enjoy watching Bradley Emmanuel Beal play the sport of basketball, fellow NBA friend"
Yeah too many variations of the same stats everyday. Bradley Beal and even Harden's explosive stretch 2 years ago didn't get this amount of posts. Maybe Steph is just too likeable.
"Lmao the hot takes of this subreddit is great after one or two good games. Real talk though, Bradley Beal MVP no debate."
Lmao Bradley Beal putting up empty calories. Steph has gravity that Beal lays in bed at night dreaming about having.
Cool his team isn’t in the playoffs. This is the definition of meaningless stats. Bradley Beal is doing the same
Yeah you're right Jamison was pretty one dimensional.  But Marcus Camby was the defensive backbone on some pretty good Nuggets and Knicks team's.  And Bradley Beal is putting up big numbers on a bad team but I wouldn't say he's one of those bad team big numbers guys like Dion Waiters or one of those guys I think he's really good
"Again, that doesn't say Embiid is better on offense. Scoring more points individually does not make you a better offensive player. No on thinks Bradley Beal is the best offensive player in the league."
"&gt;Lebron is a consensus top 3 player all time and arguably top 1 lolz. The reason he is so high is because his passing AND his scoring are both so good.  Yes the point is that Durant doesn't have the playmaking chops to place him safely in the top 20. Harden, for example, has one or two faults, like every all time great, but doesn't crater the moment he has to handle the ball and create for others.  &gt;Playmaking??  Yes: there is a deep correlation between ***team defense*** and playmaking as they both have to analyze the court and adapt to the flow of what is happening. Again, Durant has never graded out elite aside from 2017; he's never had the primary perimeter or interior responsibility defensively.  &gt;Also KD has had a positive DBPM every year since 2011 and his DWS have ranged from ~3 to ~5 every healthy year of his career minus his rookie season so what stats are you looking at  Those are box-score stats; they aren't telling us anything about impact. If you want check out RAPM/RPM/RAPTER/PIPM then you might change your perspective.  &gt;Yes, he's a SF not a point guard/facilitator. How many top all time SFs do you trust and want running the point full time without a playmaker at guard? Even Kawhi, for example, only ran the offense last year in his whole career and still ran into a lot of issues eventually.  You're again conflating the issue. the issue isn't about positions, the issue is about *skill set* as they define the player more than a strict 1-5 position. Harden is more of a wing than Durant is: Harden can score better from anywhere on the court something an elite scorer can do. people like Larry Bird, Lebron James, Jordan, Kobe all fit the wing archetype and they were able to *create* unlike our dear friend Kevin.  &gt;KD's stats were worse in okc's postseasons but he still put up good numbers overall (minus 2016 when he choked). In 2012 for example he went to the finals and completely pounded.  Why did Durant collectively shoot, and respectively in chronological order, ***54***, 57, 57 TS% in his last three OKC post seasons? You realize this is below league average and his drop off is astronomical compared to other superstars--until he went to golden state. 2012 is his only really good run in OKC and even then he wasn't the focal point of the opposing teams' defense: that was harden and Westbrook where the coaches outspokenly said they were planning for those players. Durant got shellacked by Lebron on the biggest stage while putting up good stats, but again, here we see the lack of impact from his success: he doesn't make his teammates better compared to other stars. Don't believe me? Look up any of the serious adjusted plus minus data or teammates shooting efficiency   &gt;This is where i know ur dumb af lol. KD not only is scoring at above league average efficiency, both in the RS and in the playoffs (and I'm only counting his OKC years, not even GS), he's winning scoring titles so he's doing it at much higher volume. Even if he was scoring at league average, if he's averaging 27-32 ppg that's still very good. But doing it at above league average efficiency is what makes him so good.  If you're only counting OKC years, why are you ignoring the plethora of data that shows he shoots league average (55 ts% is roughly league average) or barely above league average when he shot 60+ TS% in the regular season? That's historic and one of the many reasons why analysts like Ben Taylor don't value KD as highly as your average ESPN clown  &gt;List of other all-timer players who also average similar or worse assist/to ratios lmao:  Once again, you yet fail to realize what I am saying. The fact that you're lumping in Tim Duncan with someone like Bradley Beal speaks volumes. You will immediately cry about assist%/TO. That's not the issue: the issue is that Duncan, for example, anchored some of the greatest defenses of ***all time***. By mentioning those other players, you'd realize that your only proving my point: in order for those players--who are not top 20 players (maybe Manu)--to succeed they needed all time great creation or anchored a defense so good it won championships like Duncan has. Durant lacks playmaking, he lacks defense, he lacks general basketball IQ, his efficiency craters the moment he has to increase his volume or ball handling responsibilities etc. That's a huge knock for someone who is considered one of the best scorers of all time, which is quite frankly pathetic. No way Durant is top 20 when he never has won being the primary engine of the offense responsible for its wellbeing"
"Antawn Jamison, Bradley Beal, Marcus Camby, Valanciunas"
"&gt;Why? Because lebron has done both of those things. Durant has never done either. Isn’t Lebron James a SF? Really makes you think  Lebron is a consensus top 3 player all time and arguably top 1 lolz. The reason he is so high is because his passing AND his scoring are both so good.  &gt;Then why do the things that tie defensive ability—like playmaking and defensive impact metrics—paint him as average or below average as a defender? The argument that he’s tall and lanky is a “”””terrible tale lmao”””””  Playmaking??  Also KD has had a positive DBPM every year since 2011 and his DWS have ranged from ~3 to ~5 every healthy year of his career minus his rookie season so what stats are you looking at  &gt;Is it dumb? Or are you just completely missing the point? Seems like the latter. In order for him to score efficiently, he needs an all time great playmaker to create shots for him and to do all the heavy offensive lifting.  This is patently not true because KD scores a lot of his points from iso which by definition does not rely on a point guard  &gt;The issue is running a historic offense. He can’t do it by himself unlike other players who can create on ball.  Yes, he's a SF not a point guard/facilitator. How many top all time SFs do you trust and want running the point full time without a playmaker at guard? Even Kawhi, for example, only ran the offense last year in his whole career and still ran into a lot of issues eventually.  &gt;Maybe you should take off your golden state blinders and look what happened when Durant was the primary focal point of the opposing teams defense: he becomes a turnover machine and his efficiency craters.  KD's stats were worse in okc's postseasons but he still put up good numbers overall (minus 2016 when he choked). In 2012 for example he went to the finals and completely pounded.  &gt;A player that shoots league average,  This is where i know ur dumb af lol. KD not only is scoring at above league average efficiency, both in the RS and in the playoffs (and I'm only counting his OKC years, not even GS), he's winning scoring titles so he's doing it at much higher volume. Even if he was scoring at league average, if he's averaging 27-32 ppg that's still very good. But doing it at above league average efficiency is what makes him so good.  &gt;averages a turnover per assists  List of other all-timer players who also average similar or worse assist/to ratios lmao:  AD  Carmelo  Paul George  Tim Duncan  Bradley Beal  Julius Erving   Ginobli  Paul Pierce   All system players, of course!"
Bradley Beal went for 30.5/4/6 last year and didn’t make the all star game. You would need to be on a trash team and put up crazy stats and hope for all the best teams to be like the jazz with out a superstar.
I will say it again I doubt bradley beal really cares about winning he can be on the worst team in the nba get his all star appearances and get paid big bucks with no expectation on him for his whole career because he was loyal to the wizards
"Westbrook would probably be the first person to tell you he wasn’t playing well to start the season. I get that he was fighting through injury and the entire roster was shit, but he’s a high-usage PG so when he isn’t 100%, the team suffers. I’d have been fine with Neto or Ish taking those minutes until he was healthier.   &gt;singlehandedly developing your young guys and was the only reason you were winning games.  See, now I know you weren’t watching the games. Bradley Beal is STILL the leading scorer in the league and was averaging over 33ppg to start the season. Singlehandedly is a reach, especially since Russ fell of a cliff from the FT line and was really inefficient at the beginning. His leadership though? I can’t take that from him. I think that his mentality and how he helps our young guys is probably the best thing he bring to the table for us because god knows Scott Brooks isnt gonna develop anybody. It shouldn’t even have to be Russ’ responsibility to do that, but I love him for it.  I think you’re reading too much into me saying that he was slumping because I didn’t qualify my statement to say that he was also injured. If that’s the case, my bad, but I’m not gonna pretend like Westbrook’s performances at the start of the season weren’t an issue. We were 3-12 and he was jacking up horrible shots with 19 seconds left on the clock in winnable games, not finishing at the rim, turning the ball over... I’m glad he’s healthy now because THIS Russ is killing it. He’s always been a problem, but that doesn’t mean he’s beyond critique. HOFer no doubt, but there’s gotta be room to at least acknowledge flaws in his game."
Bradley Beal would like to have a word
probably at the level of bradley beal
"I don't agree. Harden only needed to have the keys lf the team. When he went to the Rockets, he averaged 26/5/6. He had the talent, but not the shots.  It would be the same as if you put Klay on a bad team. He can average more than Bradley Beal?? I think so.  Big Z, Old Shaq, Jamison, Mo... Didn't have the talent to be greats. I would even say, LeBron carried some of them, like making Mo Williams an all star.  I think a good case would be Ginobili. Ginobili was SUPER important in those Spurs teams. But stats don't show all his impact. Put Ginobili as a first option, and may be he can give you 25ppg.  Old Shaq, Big Z or old Jamison are not giving you shit"
"&gt;And yeah quite a good perimeter defender, uses his core strength and lateral quickness.  I guess I'll take it.  We can't 'guard a parked car,' to quote Bradley Beal."
Here is the full list updated on the season:  Julius Randle: 7/22  Kyrie Irving: 4/14  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5/13  Devin Booker: 3/11  Steph Curry: 1/5  LeBron James: 2/8  Bradley Beal: 1/7  Domantas Sabonis: 2/6  Jayson Tatum: 2/6  Jaylen Brown: 2/6  John Collins: 1/7  DeAaron Fox: 1/6

"He never sucked at any point duing the year. He took a back seat to Bradley Beal when it came to scoring (which is hilarious considering all the people that call him a stats chaser) but he has averaged a triple double the whole year. Beal has been sub-par or injured since March and Russell stepped up to fill his shoes so his stat line has gone up, but he's been playing well the whole season.  The people who were already hating on Westbrook decided that since the Wizards didn't immediately become a winning team on day one it meant he wasn't a good player, which is wrong for a number of reasons, and that's why he didn't make the All-Star team."
"Bradley Beal for Simmons, let’s make this happen"
Jesus lmfao do you not know who Michael Jordan is? Did you ever watch him play? Do you think he just slowly walked to the paint for layups against 6’1 150lb guys or something? MJ’s Wizards years were after the Zone Defense rule change when he came out of retirement at 39 years old and was still 7th in the league in scoring right behind Kobe and Duncan who won MVP that year. AND THIS WAS AT NEARLY 40 YEARS OLD AFTER NOT PLAYING THE SPORT FOR 2 YEARS.     How do you honestly believe that Michael Jordan wouldn’t find a way to score as much as fucking Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine?
Welcome to bradley beal world
I believe Bradley Beal is still in the lead (he scored 37 tonight):  Beal - 31.10 ppg  Curry - 31.04 ppg
He’s coming after my man Bradley Beal
"You put Harden with Bradley Beal, suddenly the same team is 4th seed.  But tell me more how Beal is trash, go on."
"If you put Harden on that exact team they are in the playoffs picture easy.  I don't care what they say, you can't tell me that the Nets with no KD or Kyrie are way better than the Wizards with fucking Bradley Beal in the lineup. And Harden won a whole bunch of games with the former.  It's just usual ""Everybody but Westbrook is at fault and all of his teammates are trash"". Beal out there as a league leading scorer on elite efficiency but suddenly he trash too."
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i´ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren´t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"
"First of all, he has the best PPG in the game on his team that’s Bradley Beal. 2nd of all, you act like he’s playing winning basketball. The wizards are a bottom level team. Lol. They can get the same record playing elfrid Payton. He ain’t carrying shit if they keep taking Ls."
"They are paying Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, BY FAR their best players, 70 million dollars for the next two years and you want them to focus on player development of a player that most likely will be just a decent starter in the future?  In case you haven't noticed, the Wizards aren't rebuilding, they are bad because they have zero good shooters aside from Davis Bertans, because they have one of the worst coaches in the league and because they can't stop anyone, they aren't bad on purpose and building young talent isn't their priority when they have two All-Stars on their payroll.  The Wizards are STARTING five players that shoot below 33% from 3 and they can't guard a parking car, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know why they are 22-33. Russ and Beal are the least of their problems, if they didn't have one or the other they might've won less than 10 games this year."
Saying Bradley Beal is better than Russell Westbrook in 2020-2021 is in no way “hate”
Kd would turn into Bradley Beal with a better finishing package
Bradley Beal Stats: 31/5/5 on 59% TS%  CJ McCollum Stats: 23/4/5 on 57% TS%  The gap between them is pretty big. Saying he has CJ to bail him out doesn’t mean anything when Russ has Beal on his team.
Does he not have all star Bradley Beal or am i missing something
They needed to do that considering what we saw in wall right now.  Wiz arent gonna tank when they have bradley beal on the team. Westbrook for all his lows is still a damn good player especially with how he is playing this past month.
"He one time promised Bradley Beal an All NBA vote after snubbing him out of an all-star vote last year before they did a show. Apparently he apologized to Bradley Beal and said he should have voted him an All-star and was going to give him his All NBA vote and then proceeded to not follow through with that, Bradley Beal even tweeted at him about it. I think he promised Beal an All-star vote snubbed him, then promised him an all-nba and snubbed again Lmao. Only controversial thing I can think he's done."
"This is great and gafford is exactly what they need, but bradley beal need to start doing more playmaking, he keeps driving right into 3 defenders and still tries to shoot, like 3 straight possessions down the stretch. And maybe no threes hella wasted possessions. Rui need to get some weight on and get aggressive"
"PG: Gogan Dragic (offensive creator + shooting)  SG: Bradley Beal (shot making + primary ball handler)  SF: OG Anunoby (defends, shoots, and athletic)  PF: Jerami Grant (effective role player + two way)  C: Bam (same reasons as OP)"
3rd picks are blessed though  2020: Lamelo (most promising rookie)  2019: RJ (good but not Zion level)   2018: Luka (MVP potential)  2017: Tatum (Best player in draft)   2016: Jaylen Brown (All star)  2015: Okafor (bust)  2014: Embiid (Superstar MVP candidate)  2013: Otto Porter (Ok player but also weak draft)  2012: Bradley Beal (Star)   And then dudes like Harden Melo and Jordan were also the 3rd pick when the 2nd pick was a bust.

Not if Bradley Beal has something to say about it
Kyrie “Jacob “Stephen “Bradley Beal” Curry” deGrom” Irving
I think bradley beal doesn't care about competing and is only in it for the money so I doubt it
Seems like have the best records is irrelevant then.  Might as well give it to Bradley Beal.
He really went from backwards James getting him the assist to pass Oscar in a season to Bradley Beal getting the assist to tie Oscar all time lmao
You commented about what you would do if you had 2 million and your assets wiped. No one cares and no one needs you to make a point. Bradley Beal makes 2 million in less than a month.   Reddit…
"It's going to come down to the wire to crown the scoring champion this season. Scary how close Beal and Curry are.

Free Bradley Beal. He deserves better.
"""Happy Mother's Day, I didn't play like ass, just for you, Mom!""   - Bradley Beal, probably."
I wouldn’t necessarily call his teammates amazing outside Bradley Beal.   But yes it does help to have the top half of your roster available.
You mean the 4 games Bradley Beal missed? And Rui missed two of them?  Those 4 games?  Maybe it’s 19 games cause that’s when this team finally got over their injury plague for the most part.   Rui’s missed 15 games this season. Bradley Beal missed 10. Thomas Bryant has only played 10 games this year. Bertans has missed 17. Deni is currently out and has missed time/development.
Steph and Bradley Beal.

"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."

"Bradley Beal/Terrence Howard: ""We're in the Funvee now."""
"Whole lotta guys that blow our minds today, there won't be room in the history books for them. Anyone really gonna talk about Jimmy Butler? He's so godlike that the nba-viewing world collectively apologized last year for not treating him like a god. It'd take a quality documentary or else I predict that whole episode gets forgotten. On the other hand, he can and should do great things post-career. I trust him more than any other NBA player to have himself a strong second half.  I'm having a hard time envisioning a future where people spend any time talking about Zach LaVine, Bradley Beal, or KAT. But they have time left to change that. Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are currently getting themselves off that list, so it's a thing that can be done."

"Russell Westbrook was coming off of covid and injury in the beginning of the year. Plus injury with Bradley Beal. I mean they should’ve been near 7 at most 6, but Scott brooks is a huge problem, if they didn’t have the injuries plus no Scott brooks, at most 3 seed and at least 5 seed"

Bradley Beal /s
"&gt;but apparently we have to temper that by specifically mentioning ""for his time"" or some shit.  Yes, you do. Unless you're suggesting that Bradley Beal (31.1 ppg) is a better scorer than prime Shaq (29.7 ppg), Carmelo Anthony (28.9 ppg) and Vince Carter (27.6 ppg), and is on the same level as prime Allen Iverson (31.4 ppg), LeBron James (31.4 ppg), and Karl Malone (31.0 ppg).  This isn't randomly taking away stats from old players, this is noting the irrefutable fact that the game has changed throughout the years and that changes in pace and rules can inflate or deflate stats. Old numbers that look impossible to replicate in the modern game are probably the result of the game being much different back then more than they are the result of basketball demigods descending upon the earth to play basketball at a level so far above even the greatest modern players that the comparison is laughable."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
I think his comparison really is Bradley Beal. You think of Beal as this sharpshooting threat but most of his FGA come at the rim or near it.

“Single handedly”  I forgot Bradley Beal is basically a g league player  Watch the first half of this season again and tell me how single handedly he’s winning.
They’re a bottom 3 team in the NBA without Westbrook lol. Bradley Beal was crying for a trade while Russ was hurt
"I am a Kings fan. :(   1. Knicks. Their suffering is my suffering. If they win, we could stop heari the ESPN studio talk about all of the trades that they should make, pulling talent to the big stage.   2. Suns. We are brothers in suffering.   3. Charlotte. We are all Bobcats inside still.   4. Washington. More Bradley Beal."
"Consider also, the NBA forced better measurements. A lot of players have shrunk in the past couple years. E.g., Bradley Beal is no longer 6'5"". He's 6'3"". Robert covington was 6'9"". Now he's 6'7""."
"you right. following tweet from Marc Stein  &gt;The same thing applies to statistics: Play-in games will NOT, for example, impact the Stephen Curry vs. Bradley Beal scoring race because they are considered a separate entity ... they are not regular-season games and not playoff games.

"Bradley Beal is third in the league in clutch points this season with 124 (behind DeRozan 129 and Lillard **149!**). That's on 44-26-86 shooting, so granted he misses a fair few threes, but to say ""most fourth quarters"" when he's top 3 in the league is fairly disingenuous. Or straight-up uninformed nephew.

Bradley Beal
Is Bradley Beal a top 20 player tho
Bigger Bradley Beal with more two-way potential?
"Bradley Beal is about as good as it gets, tbh"
"Yeah he's only played with KD, Harden, Paul George, Bradley Beal, Carmelo Anthony, Oladipo, Sabonis, Ibaka, Derek Fisher and who knows however many other all time greats"
"Westbrook has played with KD, Harden twice, Paul George, and Bradley Beal. Stop making it seem like he played with scrubs. He's had ample opportunity to play with elite, creme of the crop players. Meanwhile, Dame best teammate was LMA while Giannis only has Khris Middleton. A good number of guys would kill to have the teammates he's had."
"The author makes that point well in the article:  &gt; Westbrook has played with two full-fledged MVPs in Kevin Durant and James Harden. Paul George finished third in one of his seasons alongside Westbrook. In fact, it could be argued that outside of his 2016-17 MVP season, Westbrook has never even been the best player on his own team. Bradley Beal holds that distinction now in Washington."
"Persoanlly, I don't want to downplay how good Russ is.  I don't think he deserves the hate from fans.  However, I do think Roberson is wrong.  Russ has played with Durant AND Harden.  Then he played with Harden again, and is now playing with Bradley Beal.  Now, Washington has a mountain of problems, but I would think that having one of the best scorers currently in the game plus his own greatness would at least put them in the top 6 in a very weak East this year, but it didn't.  They are only a playoff team this year because of the play in tournament that no one seems to care about.  Besides that, the fact that him and Durant, plus Harden off he bench couldn't get it done is a travesty.  And Houston was good enough to get it done as well, they just didn't.  A 4th triple double season is extra ordinary.  But Russ has had talent around him.  Besides for a few years while he was by himself in OKC, he has always had talent around him.  But for how he plays, for all his stats, for all his greatness, it doesn't translate into him winning.  That's the problem.  Also, I would add that triple doubles is an extremely arbitrary stat.  Besides for them being nice round numbers, what does 10's really mean?  And besides for them being nice round numbers, what do them really mean when your team doesn't win?  We seem to fixed at the number 10 in this league and I don't really get it."

He has insane scoring potential im thinking Bradley Beal in his prime
"I think its just an experience thing too, knowing how to show the ball or open yourself up to the contact so its an obvious foul. Some players who are acrobatic/finesse finishers (like Kyrie Irving or Zach Lavine) have trouble accepting physical contact but Ant is a power finisher who's gonna draw a lot of calls in his prime.  Bradley Beal went through the same issues but now he's like a FT magnet."
&gt;Bradley Beal has passed Gilbert Arenas for most 40 point games in a Wizards uniform  Beal already had this record. Arenas scored 43 wearing a *Bullets* uniform (throwback) against Dallas in January 2005.
"Steven A Smith insulted westbrook and he has played out of his mind ever since.  Bradley Beal has all the motivation in the world to prove why he wanted to stay in Wash.    They have the proverbial chip on their shoulders to push them past Boston or Indiana or Memphis, and probably Miami the way they have played lately, with Miami the only one that I think is more of a toss up"
"He's one of the reasons the game was kept close along with Bradley beal, the loss isn't on him"
"Bradley Beal showed up in the clutch, but not enough. Wizards just don’t seem to win when he scores 40+"
Bradley Beal is to us what Middleton is to Celtics fans
"Not sure why you got downvoted because being a contender in the next few years is a legit possibility. Maybe not “superteam” but they have a buttload of cap space and there are a handful of max players who would fit well with them.   Like let’s say in theory they land CP3 and DeRozan next summer to pair with Randle, or even someone like Bradley Beal a year down the road. Not quite a superteam but definitely not a team you can overlook."
"That’s 2 MVPs of the recent 4. You would have said Beard would be Bradley Beal at most after watching his rookie season on the bench and Westbrook would just be a hustler like Marcus Smart after watching his rookie season as well. That’s 4 of the 4 recent MVPs who you think wouldn’t be superstars after watching them as rookies.  If you’re not expecting any of the MVPs to be superstars then there’s something wrong with you. Lol. You’re just a wrong hater. Look at yourself.  Oh btw, Beard and westbrook also had worse rookie seasons than LaMelo. Just to show how much of a hater you are."
Not in a order: Steph curry Bradley beal Nikola jokic Joel embiid Damian lillard Luka doncic Zach lavine Giannis antetokounmpo Zion williamson Trae young Jayson tatum Kyrie erving Idk
"He's taken that ""despite the loss"" crown from Bradley ""despite the loss"" Beal."
"Yes and in the years prior it was Lilliard, Bradley Beal, Lebron for a couple years in a row and Carmelo."
How? Neither coach is the reason these teams are doing decent. Both have either former or current mvps and other all stars. The wizards aren't even going to make the playoffs with bradley beal and westbrook in the EAST. Scott brooks should be fired not celebrated.
"I'm always fascinated by comments like this because I just don't see it. There really just isn't that much to say about basketball.     Top posts right now on /r/nbadiscussion:    * Russell Westbrook is underappreciated.  * Should top 3 seeds pick their opponents * List of players Who Have Led the NBA in 2 Major Statistical Categories In the Same Season   * Bradley Beal could be having the worst season by a scoring champ.   * Why Isn't Kareem Abdul Jabbar Considered The GOAT? * Why are the corporate sponsor logos on jerseys iron-on stickers and not embroidered?    I mean, I could sort by new here and get a lot of the same shit."
"Ironic statement about a guy who averages the most assists in the league and has less of a usage rate then Luka, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving Damian Lillard, and about 10 other guys."
Is curry the new Bradley Beal??? Find out more at 6
"&gt;You just want to look at the metrics that you handpicked to be important to you. My point is that anyone could do the same thing. There's probably a guy out there still raving about how Bradley Beal is the best player in the NBA because he scores the most points per game  using PPG is just as dumb as the triple double shit that you're doing. all-in-one impact metrics &gt; both. and no, im not nitpicking them. you can use the four most prominent. id say five but im not sure what the fifth would be.  &gt;Remembering any conversation I've had on reddit is not common for me, no. I don't hate LeBron, criticism does not equal hatred  guess it's just a memory thing. and you submitted a misleading post devoid of context designed to fuel an anti-lebron circlejerk. lol."

"The most impressive aspect about this is that Bradley Beal didn't have a monster night and no one else really lit it up either. This was truly an Everyone Eats night in DC.  Also, this does not bode well for the Pacers in a likely matchup between these two teams in a couple of weeks."
The downvotes on this are ridiculous. I whole heartedly agree I’ve been a bucks my whole life seeing as I have always lived right by the Bradley/Fiserv. Khris Middleton is only a #2 guy because he plays for us he’s a #3 guy on most top teams. If Giannis had a legit guy like Dame or Beal the sky is the absolute limit for the Bucks. Khris always shrinks in the playoffs if we don’t play the Celtics lol.
I've always said that Bradley Beal is this generation's Elvin Hayes
"Argue semantics all you want but prime Kevin Durant is more valuable than Rudy Gobert, exponentially.  Ever since KD left Westbrook has won been a routine first round exit in 5 games. He has done less with more his entire career than Iverson.  Iverson wins a championship if he gets to play with Durant, Harden, Paul George and Bradley Beal throughout his career"
They’re the 10 seed and well below .500.   They’re undeniably a bad team. And I don’t know man. He plays next to Bradley Beal.
"John Wall- No chill Gil- Beal of Bradley Dude- Elvin Hayes- Wes Unseld, kinda underrated but for all time, it is underwhelming"
"Don't get me wrong, Harden's a great player and if he were playing 1 on 1 vs Jokic, I'd take him to win - but in a 5 on 5 game with a similar team surrounding them of replacement players, I'd bet on Jokic.  But if I were building a team as a GM, I'd probably rather take Harden on my team, because it'd be easier to build a team around conventional pieces.  If that's confusing, read on!     I've been watching the NBA long enough to know that James Harden's archetype, the ""star swingman shooting guard"" has existed in multiples in the league as far back as I can remember; like if we went into a time-machine to a random place in the leagues history and had to bring a player back to replace Harden on our team maybe we can drop in a Tracy McGrady, Dr. J, Clyde Drexler, Brandon Roy, etc, etc. - our team dynamic won't change too much.  Now try the same exercise with Jokic, and you'd probably have to dial your time machine in to a very specific time and place to find a remotely similar player to plugin; maybe a Bill Walton, Arvydas Sabonis, Vlade Divac even.   Same thing would happen if you were comparing box scores anonymously from all the starting centers on a given night and trying to find Jokic, you'd probably be more able to do because of its uniqueness... you might even get more right than if you tried figuring out whose box score was whose between Harden and Bradley Beal for example.       TL;DR; Jokic is a cool, unique player, but I wouldn't want to build my team around him because he's too hard to replace if he goes down"
"The Mavs also have 20 mill in cap space after Redick and Hardaway expire. They can sign a big free agent this year and still keep Luka because restricted free agency. Then they could trade Josh Richardson, Josh Green and a few firsts for Bradley Beal. Doncic/Beal/DeRozan/Kleber/Porzingis is a team that could happen. Lebron and the Nets are both aging so this team could be the next powerhouse of the league."
I hope so. The NBA is better when Russell westbrook and Bradley Beal can compete
"Again, it's Bradley Beal  If we stuck DFS on him all game DFS would probably end up in bad foul trouble, wouldn't be able to slow him down for too long  J Rich has had plenty of good showings on defense, individually and team wise  Don't let his offense color your opinion of his defense"
Bro you have Bradley Beal on a shit wiz team his whole career stop 😭
Dude.. it's Bradley Beal lmao   Dude is literally the leading scorer of the league rn  I'd hardly hold Beal playing well against Richardson
"Not in the same way that the Rockets were Harden's team. Not to talk shit, because obviously mad respect to Bradley Beal, but when you have playoff success I think you develop more credibility/permanence as a leader especially when you have someone like Russ (former MVP/made it to the finals) coming in. Also, could be a bit of that Wade/Lebron situation in 2011 where Russ and Harden were close and Russel wouldn't want to overstep but that doesn't necessarily extend to Beal as well."
"I mean, I'm totally with you on everything you said, but y'all also have a dude literally dropping over 30 a night. John never got to play with anything close to the Bradley Beal that Westbrook is playing with, and I think the rest of your squad is pretty decent, too.  Granted, you definitely needed the Scott Brooks whisperer or it didn't matter what else happened. How Brodie makes that man seem like a capable coach is beyond me."
"TIL Bradley Beal is only 27, could’ve sworn he was 31/32"
"Across a large sample, 3% TS is large.  Also you're hilariously rounding up Westbrook's numbers while rounding down league average.  And yes, 59% is extremely efficient. Bradley Beal is extremely efficient for a guard."

"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
"Damn, Bradley Beal was only a few TOs away from holding this record first"
I see Bradley Beal in Portland’s future
"Also, as a bonus, do any of you think that any of these guys are better or close to Bradley Beal and Jayson Tatum?"
"For sure. Basketball reference has an adjusted shooting section that attempts to do that. I just did the math myself and depending on if you use raw numbers or percentages, Kobe's TS% of .548 in 1997-98 is equivalent to about .596-.598 this season, which is slightly above Luka, CP3, Jamal Murray, and right around Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, and Jimmy Butler."
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.

"It’s sad that I have to break this down, but ok. Bradley Beal, has averaged more shots per game this season than any player in the league... of course he averages 31 a game... he gets a green light on an average at best team. The point is, that has Shai not been injured this season, he too would have the green light on an average at best team, and he too would see the benefits of an inflated stat line."
Huge bucks fan. I love me some Bradley Beal as well
"Yeah, I'm reasonably close to your age and that's how I remember him.  He basically peaked at a Bradley Beal level - and a had a very short peak. Which makes him a good, but relatively insignificant player in the scheme of basketball history."
Lmao im just kidding dude i actually do watch the wizards and was supporting them in the play in. Bradley beal is my favorite shooting guard in the league. But still firmly believe Gibson better than Lopez
Closest present day comp is ironically Bradley Beal with a better handle.
"He was a high volume sniper with an eclectic personality that endeared him to fans.  Think Bradley Beal with more emphasis on the 3 ball.  As a young fan, I really wanted his Adidas shoes too.  IIRC, injuries started slowing him down, and then he really dun goofed by bringing firearms into the locker room during a mini-feud with a teammate (and maybe other moronic actions).  He quickly fell out of favour with the NBA and the public eye, and the NBA and media have seemingly remained as distanced from him as possible to this day."
"People heavily underrate iso-style play because it's not as ""efficient""  But the ability to create their own shot is why players like Bradley Beal and Devin Booker so good offensively despite shooting ""average"" from 3 and taking a lot of midrange shots - Fighting double teams and traps for tough buckets is what creates wide open opportunities for teammates"
"Ben Simmons defended Bradley Beal for 28 possessions in game 1, he allowed only 2 points on 1-6 shooting, while forcing 3 turnovers.  Thybulle defended Beal for the next most possessions, 10 of them, he held him to 2 points on 1-2 shooting, blocking the one miss, and forcing two turnovers."
"Beal should be worried about them both equally.    Ben Simmons defended Bradley Beal for 28 possessions in game 1, he allowed only 2 points on 1-6 shooting, while forcing 3 turnovers.  Thybulle defended Beal for the next most possessions, 10 of them, he held him to 2 points on 1-2 shooting, blocking the one miss, and forcing two turnovers."
"Ben Simmons defended Bradley Beal for 28 possessions in game 1, he allowed only 2 points on 1-6 shooting, while forcing 3 turnovers. Joel was in foul trouble for most of the game and Ben was funneling Beal to Dwight in the midst of his worst defensive game of the year."

I love me some Bradley Beal. Hard to hate the guy.
"There's this weird narrative about Trae being basically the worst defender of all time. And don't get me wrong, *he is pretty bad*.   But he's not even bottom 3 on his team. Not a very high bar, but the whole ""Trae is actually a net negative because the defense is historically bad"" is crazy. He's 169th out of 500+ in DRPM. You know who is lower? De'Aaron Fox. And I'm not hating on Fox, I love him and think he is amazing and fun and a true talent to build around. It's the narrative that is weird to me. Other notable players with lower DRPM than Trae: KAT, Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Ja Morant. Even players like Alex Caruso have a lower DRPM than Trae.   So then you say ""DRPM is a flawed stat"" to which I reply ""absolutely"", but it is the stat that gets thrown around to shit on Trae all the time.   Trae's defense isn't special bad. It's just regular bad. If he was a guaranteed bucket every single time, it would be punished a lot more. People just really really hate him."
"As a Knicks fan who watched basically Houston's entire Knicks career-- I think he'd be better than Hield but not Klay-level, and closer overall to Hield than Klay. He didn't have Klay's level of off-ball movement or lightning quick release. He had a great midrange game and could create his own shot, which would make him a bit more versatile than Hield.   Houston's game would have really benefited from the modern NBA style. He didn't shoot all that many 3s back in the day-- for his career he was a 40% 3 pt shooter on an average of only 4.1 3s per 36 minutes. In today's league he'd take that shot a lot more frequently and no doubt be deadly with it, which would also open up the rest of his game even more.  Houston also never played with a really top-level playmaker and passer. Playing on a team with LeBron's playmaking and Davis's absorption of the defense's attention would really bump his game up to the next level. I think he could play a bit like a lower-usage Bradley Beal in that context."
They should trade him for Bradley Beal
I can’t wait to see Bradley Beal leave in the off-season. Russell Westbrook is the most overrated PG in history. The man is certified trash.
Bradley Beal is a very good basketball player
Bradley beal was standing there since 1 hour ago doc. Challenge fail
Bradley Beal has died
Bradley Beal and Dame are my favorite players rn.
Get Bradley Beal some help
Bradley beal is fucking garbage down the stretch
Refs and worstbrook vs bradley beal damn gotta feel for the guy
What the fuck are you doing Bradley Beal
Can Bradley Beal stop throwing the ball away
bradley beal is good at basketball though.
I am absolutely subscribing to villain/heel/troll (if the kids still say this) Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal 1 Embiid 0
It's impressive that Bradley Beal could at least scored on Thybulle bc the homie made Fox forget how to drive to the basket when we played Philly. Completely sonned him.
Bradley Beal showboated for one second and got creamed on by three threes in a row.
I'm just salty because it's the playoffs but fuck Bradley Beal
Thank God for Bradley Beal for holding them off another quarter
BRADLEY BEAL IS A BAD BAD MAN
Because there isn't if Brooklyn is healthy. Not with Simmons being afraid to post up Ish Smith and Bradley Beal. The dude can pass but he ruins their offense
Paul George and Bradley Beal  BFF4eva
Bradley Beal just straight BRICKS in the playoffs
"Its pretty simple - Any team that doesn't have championship aspirations will have players who take it seriously, it might be their only chance to gain a national spotlight that season and engage their fanbase. The games will sell more tickets than a normal regular season game with 0 stakes.  Dame wouldn't rest. Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal would not rest. Zach Lavine wouldn't, Julius Randle wouldn't. Zion, Lamelo etc all these dudes on non-contenders will go out and hoop with that spotlight on them. It might help some of these guys with All-Star voting too if it takes place before February"
Bradley Beal needs to take at least 30 shots tonight
WIZARDS YOU HAVE BRADLEY BEAL IN YOUR TEAM
I mean they can’t at this point.  But if this had been Bradley Beal I’m sure as shit he would have been missing Game 1.
steph doesn't have bradley beal lmao
"Top tier:      Lebron.    KD.    Steph.    AD.    Harden.        Second tier:      Kawhi.    Kyrie.    Luka.    Dame.    Giannis.       PG is on the Bradley Beal tier. Bottom of tier three or top of tier four. A good secondary player when they play well, but no-one you would build a team around or can rely on 100%."
"I mean, that's the point of a super star? Like Bradley Beal gets doubled teamed every game, he's the second highest scorer in the NBA. Teams legit form a wall in the middle of a paint to stop Giannis/lebron. Don't even get me started on James harden. Like what's your point with the double team, triple team argument? Gsw lost because Kerr can't coach."
"On paper Philly should smoke the wizards, but that's on paper. I would not be surprised if the wizards stretch the series out to the max. Russell Westbrook is an amazing talent. Bradley Beal is nothing to sneeze at either. Bertans has been a sixer killer the last few seasons as well. I'm not taking the wizards as lightly as some of my other friends that are sixers fans."
"Honestly the real answer is take the top 5-10 best players on the All Star team and those are the superstars.  They are the guys that completely dominate every game they are in and can’t go unnoticed.  I think the key part is every game, superstars are usually very consistent and play at an MVP like caliber every game never have more than one bad game in a row.  Not hating but an easy example Lebron vs Paul George.  Obviously Lebron is better, but it’s because of his extreme consistency at the highest level.  You’ll very rarely see Lebron have a true bad game and he has the longest streak ever I’m pretty sure of scoring 10+ points.  These guys take over late in the game and in the playoffs the ball goes into their hands.  Look at his playoffs history and the only bad series I can think of is against the Mavericks, maybe the Spurs but not really.  Then take Paul George, a guy with extreme talent, signature shoes, All-NBA awards, but he will have a bit lower of an impact on the game and will give you a 9 point game way more often than Lebron.  A superstar needs to play like a top 5 player on any given game and do it consistently, the standards are extremely high.  Most of the All Stars are not superstars.   To answer your question about the guys on the bench, I don’t think this happens too often because if they had true superstar potential they would probably show it on the court in the limited minutes they get.  It goes by more of an eye test than looking at stats.  For example, Bradley Beal was second in scoring but everyone would rather have Luka on their team instead."
"No. Jordan Poole and picks is not gonna get Bradley Beal.  &gt; If Beal requests a trade and threatens to sit out (unlikely), idk what team that is ready to compete can beat an offer like that.  Literally any team that could give a better player than Jordan Poole and give the same picks."
Russ also is playing next to Bradley Beal lol
That just goes to show how amazing he actually is.    He put up Bradley Beal type numbers with less of a supporting cast.
"You better not be talking about this season Russell Westbrook, the wizards were four games under 500 in the east and he played with Bradley Beal all season.  GSW would've been the sixth seed in the east."
Oh and you can’t forget one has Bradley Beal next to him and the other has Andrew Wiggins
Where’s Bradley Beal for the Warriors? Anti- Curry coming out strong today
but beal and vucevic last year werent as good as curry this year. He did have a great season bradley fucking beal isnt giving you 32 points on 65% TS.
Should Russell been a finalist in 2015? Bradley Beal last year (and this year)? Vucevic last year?
Draymond is about to call Bradley Beal from the parking lot
He’s not a positive to change culture on a team. He basically burned his bridges on the way out of DC. Demanded more touches and started to ball hog. Started to cuss out brooks  https://basketballsocietyonline.com/report-wizards-john-wall-and-kelly-oubre-cursed-at-head-coach-scott-brooks  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/10/30/18039814/washington-wizards-drama-john-wall-bradley-beal-history  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/27/wizards-are-starting-their-annual-meltdown-early-this-season/
"he can break the scoring record tbh. I swear we have probably a winning record against guys scoring 50+. Just off the top of my head we beat Blake when he scored 50 and we beat Kemba when he scored 60, and obviously we beat Bradley Beal when he dropped 60"
"I agree, Elfrid Payton is the next Bradley Beal"
"As a fellow 28 year old, we are also older than most of the top guys in the 2012 draft, including Anthony Davis, Bradley Beal, and MKG"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

Russ is an all time leader behind the scenes. Oladipo credit’s Russ’ work ethic for how he was able to transform his body over the summer after his OKC year. And there was an article earlier this season where Russ had every player on the team define what they think their role is and how it revealed why there were so many holes. So they laid out what everyone should be doing and they went on like a 5-game run after that.  https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/team-meeting-led-russell-westbrook-and-bradley-beal-helped-spark-wizards  I wonder if this was the same meeting.
You've got to give it to the Wizards. Had a terrible start to the season. Bradley Beal scoring a lot of points and they were still losing. But they bounced back especially with the leaderahip of Russell Westbrook who made triple doubles left ang right. The Wizards may not win in the playoffs but just getting into the playoffs is already a feat on it's own. Well done Wizards.
Rest Bradley Beal now pls
FUCK YEA HAPPY BRADLEY BEAL

Shroder getting cooked by Harden is like Bradley Beal getting cooked by Kawhi. Shroder and Harden don’t play the same position despite Harden being called a PG.
Bradley Beal has entered the chat
do you think Bradley Beal would finish 2nd for OPOY? Clearly you can tell the difference between these two awards.
"There’s no room for nuance in those tho. If a few games go differently Bradley Beal is the scoring champ, but nobody would say he’s even a top 5 OPOY candidate. There’s more to offense than stat totals that ought to be recognized"
That wouldn’t shock me but that would require him making another leap. Bradley Beal is really good and doesn’t get the love he deserves because he plays for Washington and a coach who should be fired for borderline malpractice
Random Knicks thought - this offseason they should have an all out blitz trying to either add CJ McCullom or Bradley Beal to their roster. I think adding either of them turns them from a good story as a 4 seed to a borderline ECF contender instantly.
They have money for another star and I’m liking DeMar Derozan or Bradley Beal over there
My fav part was like 2 min into the game he said that Bradley Beal was significantly younger than Tatum.
I feel like Bradley Beal is low key Demar Derozan with just a little more shooting range
Maybe on the Jazz? A Donovan Mitchell/Bradley Beal tandem would be scary.
"I agree there are too many variable which is why I should’ve prefaced this with IMO lol but I will say this. Bradley Beal has played with a player who was just as good as him maybe a little better and at best made it to the semis in the East. AD never had that type of player and made it to the semis in the west. By himself he carried a team to the playoffs in the west twice. Most other seasons he was hurt as well. Beal has never done that and has had the chance. I would also say that ADs teams that he won with weren’t world beaters. So if Brad was on the same level as him he should at the very least carry one bad team to an eighth seed in the East. Listen I think Brad is a great player. But I don’t think he’s a 2nd tier guy which is completely fine. Dude is still a top 20-25 player in the league. He’s on the same level as Murray, Klay, Gobert, Devin Booker, Sabonis, CJ, etc. Those are all star level guys but they aren’t going to drag your team to a playoff spot. In a great system with a better player they can parade as a 2nd tier guy(looking at you CJ). Which is what happened when Wall was there. But even then he wasn’t that consistent and wasn’t the clutch guy they needed him to be."

Mitchell is a better tier player than Bradley Beal??? Wow lol
Marv Albert said Bradley Beal was younger than Jayson Tatum at the beginning of the game lol.
"He looked injured. His running gait has returned to pre-Patrick Beverly form. He adjusted his gait after that injury to prevent injuries by keeping his knees on top of his toes in his stride. All night he was running while leaning forward with his legs in front of his feet. It means he is compensating because since the injury he has made it a point not to do that.  Bradley Beal was also compensating his hamstring, leaning to the other side, and I was legit worried for him to the extent that he shouldn't have even been playing. He's at serious risk for injury if they make the playoffs and he continues to compensate the injury with a high usage load.  I feel the same about Russ, but Russ will play through an injury, and knowing that his BFF's job is on the line he is absolutely going to play through that injury. It is what it is. Honestly, they should call it quits on the season and heal up before the worst happens."
Because you’re inside the mind of Bradley Beal right ?
future boston celtic bradley beal
Bradley Beal play candy crush
Bradley Beal is the 3rd guy on a championship squad
Bradley Beal and the questionable no calls tonight
Is Issac Bonga allowed to play? Seems like having ish smith and Bradley beal guard Tatum isn't working very well
Tatum is on the same level he’s just an unbelievable mismatch against a team with zero replacement level wing defenders. If Tatum gets to iso on Bradley Beal that should be the end of the game
"Announcer: ""I thought Bradley Beal was fouled, but refs are letting them play""  Me, watching the game and checking the box score: ""They're certainly letting one team play"""
Bradley Beal playing for the Wizards is like working for a shitty start up that is losing money constantly but somehow still afloat and just needs one or two good developers to help but you’ll never get them because who want to go into that situation.
everytime i watch bradley beal he plays like shit
Lmao that Bradley Beal reaction about to be a meme
Lmao at Bradley Beal thinking he didn’t foul Tatum there he gave him no space to land
Bradley Beal is so fucking good
"""MF'ers out here injuring themselves rolling ankles trying to guard Bradley Beal""  -Kent Boozemore probably"
This Wizards team with a healthy Bradley Beal would've mopped the floor with Nets first round. Nets the luckiest team in the league.
"For no particular reason I think a ""duo"" of a pass first veteran point guard, Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, and Robert Williams would be awesome HAHAHAHA jk but what if?"
Bradley Beal is actually playing good defence 😳
"I get it. People get mad at guys like me for not seeing all the regular season games from every team. I'm a Warriors fan. I watch the Warriors games and the playoffs. The best players are the ones that show up big in the playoffs. Like Booker just did. Players like Bradley Beal are nice. Giving you 30 PPG but he's going home. The top players in the NBA play their best against the best. Booker has just taken that leap. Just like Jamal Murray did in the bubble. Or even Jimmy Butler. Before last year, Jimmy Butler was just another Paul George type player. Great but not when it matters."
"hey chris!  during your career, who was one player (could be from past or present) that you've always wanted to play with? im asking this because are a 7th grader wanting to become a pro basketball player, ive always wanted a few teammates ive wanted to play with. like kyrie irving, bradley beal, larry bird, etc."
"I don't think they did.  I mean, when guys like Paul George and Jimmy Butler went West I didn't here anyone dismiss them as being from the ""weak"" Eastern Conference.  Not to mention no one writes off guys like Bradley Beal or Trae Young as only playing in the ""weak"" Eastern Conference, not to mention Jason Taytum and the Celtics.    Really it only sounds like the East was considered weak because Lebron kept winning there."
Kobe made his teammates throw his shoes away and constantly bashed them when they underperformed? and we all know what Jordan did to his teammates wym? Lebron quit on them because Kuzma getting 22 mill a year to be trash AD injured was better than Kuzma been since his rookie year. Lebron needs to get another star. Better hope they can get a Rozier or try and call up Bradley Beal
A guard who can playmake when lebron is best as the playmaker and worse offball? Sounds like tb He opposite. They need a shoot first guard who can actually score like dame or bradley beal.
"I'm not saying Blazers wouldn't be better if they somehow swapped CJ for Beal. I agree that Beal is better offensively, especially his movement off the ball / through screens / handoffs. I just don't believe it would move the needle enough for their championship aspirations. Having your two best players be 6'2"" and 6'3"" is just a tough ask. Blazers need a versatile wing who can switch easily, not another small guard.  Advanced metrics don't mean everything (particularly on the defensive end), but Beal's defensive metrics do not rate well. He exerts so much energy on offensive that his defense suffers as a result, which isn't helped by his team being poor at defense as a whole.  Here's what a Wizards (Bullets) fan site has to say about him (note the defensive section): https://www.bulletsforever.com/2021/4/6/22368048/discordant-discourse-our-differing-opinions-on-bradley-beals-performance-this-season  He ranked dead last in [ESPN's defensive RPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/year/2020/page/4/sort/DRPM/position/2) for SG, 518/520 amongst all players, and also near dead last in [Basketball References](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html) DBPM stat in the 2019-2020 season. Wizards were terrible last year so that's a huge part of it, but this year his stats don't fare that much better. The Wizards are were 10.9 points better per 100 possessions defensively with him not in the game, and this year they were 8.4 points better. He's obviously still a plus overall since his offensive is great."
Knicks had a very stagnant offense. Yes they couldnt do anything against the hawks because hawks had good iso defenders. It also felt like knicks didnt target trae young on defense. Trae young should be the weakpoint of the D and the goal should be to tire trae young as much as possible.  The sixers also do a good job at making it difficult for the best player to get the ball. Bradley beal had to fight to even get possesion of the ball. Because simmons was hounding him.
&gt; Bradley Beal is available
"I think it was on first take lol, but I definitely had some lakers fan friends in my own life who really thought that it was going to happen. I imagine the THT for Bradley Beal rumors will be starting soon lmao"
Devin booker: be legendary  Lebron: where should I go next year? Bradley Beal available? Gonna text him
\[Woj\] BREAKING: Bradley Beal has signed with Klutch Sports
Bradley Beal gonna look so good in a Lakers jersey.
Lol what happens when Bradley Beal is a Laker?
"He's gone or he's retiring without a ring, their only option is to trade CJ and they won't get a better player in return. No free agent could help them (Except Derozan). Maybe they get Bradley Beal, but he provides the same thing CJ does."
I always saw the Blazers like a mirror of the Wizards with John Wall and Bradley Beal. Both with fantastic point guards and with shooting guards that can easily pick up the slack and can even be the number one option. But always seem to be never good enough.  Both teams also mirrored the Raptors when it was run by Derozan and Lowry.  The might also need a new HC and to trade one of their guards to really make things work.
"For reference, also compare Kobe's stats with other players such as Bradley Beal. You can't tell me Bradley Beal put up the equivalent of Kobe's 2nd best season in terms of scoring. Someone looking at the stats today would look at Kobe's numbers and think he would be a top 20 player currently today rather than the top five Kobe was for the majority of his career. The players today simply have more opportunities to generate higher stats on paper but we do have to respect how the game was played even just a decade ago when games were more of a grind-out process than an exploding boom of offensive scoring."
"But my response was more about him needing to do that due to the teams hes on.  Thats the real question.  Is he a detriment, or a product of the teams hes been on lately?  When I watch the wizards play, it seems like the Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook show."
"Kerr ain't lying, once they trade Wiseman for Bradley Beal he'll have helped them win more games"
"It's an exaggeration, but I see his/her point. We have Bradley Beal all of a sudden start competing for scoring titles? Beal has been in the NBA for years and was not a late bloomer. Everything has to be looked at as before the 18/19 season and after the 18/19 season when it comes to these records. It really started in the 16/17 season, but was pushed into overdrive in 2019."
"You're not wrong. I just assumed since they're both ball dominant players, is it even worth taking away from Luka's usage when cp3 is more of a facilitator than a scorer. He's also getting older so what timeline would you be looking at?. Imo, Bradley Beal would be ideal to play alongside Luka."
"KCP, and Kuzma is a very good defender now but has troubles scoring with LeBron. People clown the Lakers but they actually have assets that would be attractive to front offices. It’s nothing that could get Bradley Beal, But definitely enough to get an aging star on a bad contract"
We need an offensive coordinator and Bradley Beal. This needs to happen. Or Zach Lavine to compete with the nets next year.
It is completely different lol. He had an affinity for Cleveland *and* they were championship caliber.   Bradley Beal (apparently) has an affinity for Washington yet they are nowhere remotely close to contention
"&gt;Does Bradley Beal Want Out?  - ESPN later today, likely"
Bradley Beal is going to get traded to the Celtics for Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown. Mark my words.
Bradley Beal has been traded the most times ever without actually being traded
"Wiseman, Minnesota draft pick, and Kelly Oubre for Bradley Beal. Play Bradley Beal at the small forward, Play Andrew Wiggins at the power forward, and Draymond Green at center. That’s a fucking amazing team."
"Wiseman, Minnesota draft pick, and Kelly Oubre for Bradley Beal. Play Bradley Beal at the small forward, Play Andrew Wiggins at the power forward, and Draymond Green at center. That’s a fucking amazing team."
"Trade Paul George for Bradley Beal, who says no?"
Khris' middleton and donte divincenzo for Bradley beal
"Kuzma, Shroeder and average draft picks is nowhere near worth Bradley Beal. Wizards crack up, hang up the phone and block the number"
&gt;I think prior to this year the easy answer was James Harden  TIL: James Harden + CP3 &lt; Dame + CJ  or  John Wall + Bradley Beal
Nobody is arguing that. If it’s just the 2017 backcourt it’s not even top 10. But a 2017 John Wall who put up 23/11 and then 27/10 in the playoffs with a Bradley Beal scoring 32 a game is better than Dame/CJ and current Russ/Beal

Bradley Beal was drafted ahead of green in the same year.
Lol come on Bradley Beal is a fringe top 10 player. Trae is good but he's not better than Beal rn
Imagine thinking Bradley Beal is a needle mover.  Dude cant even beat a Embiidless SIXERS team.😂🤣
"Bro, seriously did you start watching NBA basketball a month ago? Bradley Beal has ***never*** been very good at defense, that's always been the case-even back in college when he played for Florida. He doesn't have a much higher defensive rating than Steph Curry or even Tobias Harris, for that matter. Beal's game is based on putting up points and, to a lesser extent, facilitating. Hell, even on our own teams, John Wall in his prime was a floor raiser, but Beal is too 1 dimensional of a player to do so. Look at our roster, aside from Beal and Russ, it's legitimately AWFUL (I'm including young guys like Gafford and Rui who still need a lot of development to be consistent starters). If the Sixers lost a game to us with fucking Scott Brooks coaching, that's a BAD sign for you guys. Ball don't lie so please think of this conversation when you watch your team getting bounced this playoffs, I'll be here to say ""I told you so."""
Magic Johnson fast breaks with Bradley Beal is absolutely salivating. He’ll definitely love the 3 point shooting. Ben Simmons will sob trying to defend Magic. That offense is juicy and the best that’s not Brooklyn.
"I’m honestly worried that the wizards expose the 76ers as a soft ass team and pull off the comeback and advance to the next round, thus ending the Embiid era in philly . I think anything is possible with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook’s drive!!"
"I mean, if he can, why won't he just do it? Not everybody can run a pick and roll just because they can handle the ball and they can shoot pretty good. Bradley Beal is another example. He's a better scorer than CJ, and has better assist numbers in a lot of seasons, but he simply is not a very good passer. Can't read the defense or know the timing of his pass at the same level Harden does."
Bradley Beal like 5 times a year
"I agree with this just cuz Kuzma has had decent talent around him, and Bradley Beal doesn’t, It doesn’t mean that Beal is the better player"
"For real. I remember this one time I was expecting my team to have a respectable record, but then they only ended up winning 7 games and clinching the worst record in NBA history. But in my head, I was thinking well at least we got the 2nd pick in the draft! Turns out that instead of drafting Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, or even Harrison Barnes, we ended up drafting a guy whose shooting form looks like a pretzel.    Oh wait that's not my team..."

"They used to call the Blazers, the Wizards of the West, but god damn CJ McCollum is no Bradley Beal.  I don't know what it'll take, but Beal and Dame need new teammates."
"Just yesterday, I was thinking about [this stat](https://www.sportingnews.com/au/nba/news/bradley-beal-passes-gilbert-arenas-franchise-record-wizards-lose-bucks-beal-40-pt-games/1nxctm3nryxk91jd7yxv29lky4)...the firsthand experience is partly why it stings so much haha"
PG&gt;CJ.  Pg on his game is a top 15 at minimum player. Cj is the wish version of Bradley beal.
"If we're talking regular season games, have you ever heard of a guy named Bradley Beal?"
"wouldn't mind it but I don't want to give more than 2 year deals to either of em.  I dont think that puts us in championship contention  we need a real big impact player like luka or zion or kawhi to really push us into contender teir.   not that i'm expecting to get any of them, just that's the caliber of player we would need  hoping we make an offer to bradley beal and then next year zach lavine"
"Ben probably would only be traded for somebody like Bradley Beal, etc."
Ant - Bradley Beal
You don’t have Bradley Beal being an all star next year? That’s def a hot take
Bradley Beal clearly /s
Would Bradley Beal be his L?
"Obviously yes. But on Brooks' team, that's the job of roster spots 3-15. The top 2 guys don't have to do it if they don't want to.  Bradley Beal has been one of the worst defenders in the league for most of Brooks' tenure. Like Tre Young rookie year bad. And he was average to start his career, a guy with plenty athleticism, size, and instincts. Scoring and usage is way up, off-ball effort and defense are waaay down.  Scott Brooks is a perfect coach for stars like Carmelo that want to shoot and do nothing else."
"Exactly. Just call out that dumbass fan and keep the media pressure for that idiot to get jailed.  Inviting others when you are Bradley Beal, not Ben Wallace is not smart. You might end up like Nate."
"&gt; How would you know Beal is right? Why are we just assuming that every basketball fan out there is a 5 foot 5 skinny nerd?  To be fair Bradley Beal is a 6 ft 3"" 200 pound athletic freak. I know people meme about Nate Robinson but he's literally one of the smallest guys to ever play in the NBA, he's 36, he was up against a trained fighter who was bigger, and there were rules.   The odds that some random basketball fan would have enough advantages to win in a street fight against an NBA player in their prime is not high at all."
Bradley beal looks like a guy that punches with his eyes closed. These duds listen to hip hop and think they are some gangster fighters when in reality they have probably been involved in &lt;3 fights in their lives.
"Were those legit rumors, or those lame fan sites being like ""Yo! Imagine trading Obi Toppin for Bradley Beal""?"
Westbrook shot 3/19 yesterday with Ben Simmons in foul trouble the whole game and Matisse playing little.  Westbrook is the most overrated player in history. Put some respect on Bradley Beal.

LOL can we just all admire the layup attempt by Bradley Beal? What the hell was that?
"I don't think the Wizards did anything particularly special in those final 3 minutes. Bradley Beal hit a very tough shot to start the run, which is something he can do because he's a walking bucket. Then Westbrook found Gafford under the rim for a 1 foot dunk. After that Westbrook missed a tough shot, Gafford got the rebound (no Embiid on the floor really hurt the Sixers on the glass) and he got fouled and proceeded to hit 1/2 free throws. On their next possession Westbrook found Hachimura under the rim for a 2 foot dunk. Then Beal found Hachimura in the corner for a wide open dagger 3 in the corner. None of that was super unpredictable or hard to repeat."
"Robinson like 5'6 and the next fight that kid had with the MMA fighter was so obviously fixed it was pathetic. I really don't think an average joe wants to meet certain players on the street. Someone like Bradley Beal though, I don't really buy it. He seems more like a lover than a fighter, but you never know."
Bradley “Braun Stroman” Beal.
"Dumb statemenr tbh. Like dude there are mentally dumb people out there, they don't care if you Bradley Beal or Davis Bertans."
"For the Wizards:  - No Alex Len, less Raul Neto minutes - No more Wizards 3 guard bullshit in the lineup - Hitting threes   - Better Westbrook shot selection - Bradley Beal shows up - More hack-a-Ben  For the Sixers: - Embiid out for series - Sixers cannot replace production of Embiid (see Tobias Harris chuck fest tonight) - Doc Rivers plays Mike Scott more than Dwight - Big men foul trouble - Lakers Danny Green reincarnates  - Ben Simmons continues to go 1-2 from the line every trip  Think I covered everything. This series is over in 5, maybe 6 if the Wizards get lucky."
They should’ve made a package and traded him for Bradley Beal this year. Then next year try to add one more piece like Demar Derozan in free agency.
If the Wizards come back to win this series I will get a Bradley Beal tattoo
“The Penetration of Bradley Beal” coming this summer to Lifetime
Real deal Bradley Beal
No one has ever called Bradley Beal a spot up shooter.
Who the hell called Bradley Beal a spot up shooter ?
"I feel like Bradley Beal is too stubborn, he wants to always attack no matter who's defending him"
"Kiki Vandeweghe or George Gervin  Modern players, a taller Bradley Beal."
"So is Dwight Howard, does that mean he was better than Bradley Beal this year ? What a stupid take."
Might have to put Bradley Beal in there over someone
"Put your hindsight aside. *Context matters.*  ATL was 11th in the East before the ASG.   Also, if you want Trae in, pick one of these guards to substitute at the time of the All Star Game.  - Ben Simmons - Jaylen Brown - James Harden - Zach Lavine - Kyrie Irving - Bradley Beal  Personally, I'd have swapped Jaylen for Trae. But that would've been incredibly unpopular before March 8th LOL."
You might be right and you might be wrong. There's really no historical support for so the entire thing is speculation and pretty pointless to argue about.   It would be like trying to determine if Damian Lillard + Bradley Beal should be a more successful combo than Damian Lillard + Jayson Tatum.
"ahh yes because that's how offensive impact is measured.  [Trae is more impactful](https://craftednba.com/players/trae-young), than [Bradley Beal](https://craftednba.com/players/bradley-beal). This backed up on basically any site across the internet. The eye tests supports that as well.  Hell the playoffs further highlight this as Trae has been responsible for more than 50% of our points scored.  Also team record fucking matters for these awards as has been shown time and time again.    &amp;#x200B;  I get it you don't watch Hawks games so you don't get it but seriously Beal has absolutely no place in the All-NBA team over Trae."
+/- really should be looked at as a long term stat for this reason. Bradley Beal doesn't hurt WSH when he's on the floor
Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal will only be 33 so i think he’ll be an all star
bradley beal is the most obvious upgrade
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
Bradley Beal looked defeated after he failed to strip the ball away from George Hill there lol
Tobias you’re getting locked up by Bradley Beal bro ? Wtf
"Scott brooks getting fired won’t fix the problem that u have a bad roster. Rusell Westbrook and Bradley Beal isn’t a good mix, and you guys have barely any shooters and a weak ass defense"
This is such a comedic level of bias. When the 76ers sweep the Wizards does that somehow become proof that Tobias Harris is a better player than Bradley Beal?
“He has the potential to be as good as Bradley Beal”
"I've been watching the NBA forever 50 years unfortunately has a bullets wizards fan.  I'd have to disagree with you about free third disparity meaning nothing.  Certain players and I think this is inarguable get far more free throws in anyone else. James Harden isn't my mind the best example or the worst example of this.  He drives a lane throws his head back and a foul is called.  He's been doing this from his earliest days in the league with Oklahoma City, And it's got more pronounced and now the refs just give it to him.  Michael Jordan got more fouls than anyone else.  Shaquille O'Neal who was pounded more immersively than any player I've ever seen got far fewer free throws and he was a bad free throw shooter too.  Has a bullets and wizards man I will tell you that Alvin Hayes got a lot of foul calls and he shot a fall away but he had that same little quirk that James Harden did a falling back or throwing his head back as if he had been struck.  Early in his career Michael Jordan did not get a lot of fouls called but Phil Jackson put together two years worth of tapes and sent them to the NBA offices showing all the times Jordan had been hit and didn't get the calls and from that day forward he led the league in free throws.   In my case watching wizard games the last six seven years Bradley Beal and John Wall continuing excessively drove the lane contact was evident yet frequently no fouls were called.  One of the other unseen and important issues with the referees calling more fouls for one team in the other is a diminishes the depth of the team that is getting called for more fouls.  You wind up sitting important players because they picked up two or three fouls early.  This year because several veteran referees retired and because there was a covered out break among referees ( you should read up on this), more younger referees were called up from the minor leagues ( G league,etc.  More than 7 right now).  The difference in the speed and the size of players in the NBA and those in the minor leagues is not unlike the difference between professional baseball and hockey minor leagues.  This has been the worst year for referring I've ever seen.  It was interesting to watch the playoffs last year in the bubble when they had the same veteran cruise working all the games and it was some of the best and cleanest basketball you'll ever see, professionally."
"I can't roll my eyes hard enough at this  Next, you should make a thread and use shooting splits to show that Bradley Beal is a better scorer than Michael Jordan"
Without Draymond?  The Wizards having fucking Bradley Beal
Should’ve traded KP in a package for Bradley Beal when you had the chance.
"The softest thing I've ever seen  &gt;Then, Bradley Beal then proceeds to look at that official, and in protest of that call, he waves him off, which is a respect for the game guideline and a technical foul, an automatic technical foul. We’re taught to give a technical foul, so that was his second technical foul. So, it’s the double technical foul for the taunt, second one for the wave off to the referee.”"
"Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Jaylen Brown made the All Star game over Trae. Julius is a Forward."
"Mavs, Clippers, Blazers Celtics, Heat are all one good player (not Lebron because he can carry almost any team to the final, but like a Bradley Beal) away from reaching the finals. I think the Heat were lucky last year, they were good but others fucking up allowed them to overachieve.   Other teams I already consider contenders are the Lakers and Nets (obviously), but also the Bucks, Nuggets (with Murray, Barton and Dozier), Jazz and Suns and Sixers (these 2 might be one player away too but maybe a borderline all star)."
"And? Still a game high +15. I guess you’d probably rather have your Bradley Beal at a game low of -22 though. Duuuuumb ass take, fam."
"Simply put, Jimmy is not having a good series. Jrue Holiday has been the difference… as Bledsoe isn’t there to give the heat some possessions off this time around.  I hate the direction this team took letting Kelly, Bradley, Crowder (started last postseason) go and putting too much value in Tyler Herro. He should’ve been a part of a Harden, Beal, or even a Vucevic type offer this season.  Oladipo would’ve made a little difference on offense, but Bucks traded the assets necessary and it shows."
Bradley Beal *sells* the foul.
"this... not true at all. Seth is good at 8 million. But there's Jokic at 29 million, Sabonis at 18 million, Christian Wood at 13 million, Chris Boucher at 6 million, Richaun Holmes at 4.8 million. Honestly, even some of the big contracts like Bradley Beal at 25 million give significantly more value. Hell, his brother is way better value per dollar at 40 million."
"No, this team however does have Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Damian Lillard, and Bradley Beal so it's not like Luka would be the most important scorer on the floor by far if at all."
"PG - Slightly more polished offensively, better defensively.  Tatum - Slightly worst offensively but *significantly* better defensively as well as having great athleticism  Trae - One of the best shooters in the game + a game breaking playmaker, as well as not being that far off Booker defensively even with the size difference  Mitchell and Butler is debatable, but the other three are not. Also forgot to mention that Bradley Beal exist."
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull, and Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
"I'm hoping the Wizards will. They'll be getting their starting center Thomas Bryant back who put up solid numbers before his acl injury and Rui Hachimura could be on track for a breakout season, and of course they have a great backcourt with Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal leading the way"
He did not in fact have to choose 1. We got Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal bringing nothing but scoring. You think if Steph was down to go they're leaving Dame at home?
Bradley Beal knocked down Nick Kay and he gets the foul for draymond tripping over him
"Bradley Beal, DPOY?"
He can do what pretty much no other player can do.  Someone like Bradley Beal scores a lot of points but other players do that too.
Did Bradley Beal just make that? Lol
Bradley Beal just threw up a skyhook and made it lol
I don’t think we could. We’d need someone like Bradley Beal/Zach LaVine to come to the Lakers in 2022 free agency.
"Yes. He's just not in the same tier as other ""elite"" players. There is Tier 1 Elite - guys that terrify other teams (Steph, KD, Kawhi, LeBron, Dame, Giannis, Harden). To me, he's like Bradley Beal. Elite player but you don't put him in the same class as the guys mentioned above.   To argue he's not an elite player seems like it would be difficult. This is just the first year the others around him are playing at an elite level."

"so many to name  Kyrie. Kobe, T-Mac, AI, VC, MJ, Melo etc  Even the likes of Bradley Beal has aesthetic games  &amp;#x200B;  Def not Lebron though"
Bradley Beal game is smooth!
"It’s not even just that.  Our stars played like Kentucky Fried Ass.    Kevin Durant, who is hailed as the most unstoppable scorer on the planet, shot 30% from the field against guys who wouldn’t be dominant in the NCAA.  Bradley Beal, the man who until the last game of the season was giving Stephen Curry a run for his money for the scoring title, shot **14%** from the field.   I didn’t even know that was possible.  I assumed that if you shot that bad they just stopped counting like Warriors fans do with Draymond, who incidentally was one of the only players who didn’t play like they wanna be waived next season.    Jerami Grant, 6 points on 6 shots, but I don’t count him because who the fuck even is this guy and why did he play the same amount of minutes as Bam Adebayo?  If they don’t put on some Dream Team level shit in the olympics, they along with Popovich should be walking home.  From Tokyo.  Through the ocean."
"CJ McCollum rocking back and forth. Booker's ability to stop on a dime and go up for a jumper, picture perfect and under control. Bradley Beal somehow going from standing still to casually attacking the rim in a blink. Joe Ingles catch and shoot three while never bringing the ball down. These are a few of my favorite things."
Bradley fuckin’ Beal
"Agreed…it’s a shame pop couldn’t recruit Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Bam and Dame to make the trip with him"
Bradley Beal
people don’t consider how big opportunity and role play in performance. Patty Mills will look like a better than player Bradley Beal in a majority of the games but in the NBA Beal is a max player and Mills is worth no more than like 8 mil nowadays
Bradley Beal on Pop’s comments:  “I loved it... I’m ready to go”
Is that the USA roster? Bradley Beal had 2 points?
"Hopefully KD gives a fuck for more than the final 2 minutes next game. Also, Bradley Beal was truly embarrassing. How are 2 players like that shitting the bed to anyone? Just embarrassing."
"Our sub is having an extreme delusion on Bradley Beal but if he plays like that, like Westbrook hero ball level then I dont think he will make much difference. Of course, I cant also judge a player on one game but he is forcing it and its making my eyes sore."
Imagine being a perimeter defender against this lineup and your best case scenario is you get matched up on... Bradley Beal? yeesh
Bradley Beal dump truck may bring him…
"I wish your candidates list was full of actual candidates, most of those players have no chance of getting traded(Lebron James? Really?). To answer your question, I think Zach Lavine has a good chance of getting moved, maaaaaybe Bradley Beal as well, but that one's a little more sus."
I’d say Bradley Beal or Russell Westbrook if Washington decides to blow it up. But I could also see the Mavs parting ways with KP.
I would’ve thought Bradley Beal was somewhere up in top 15 but looking at this list I guess it makes sense that he’s not
Bradley beal
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
Bradley Beal or Kyrie Irving
Championships won by Bradley Beal: 0  Championships won by tall first overall picks from Melbourne who play for the Warriors: 1
"Sixers receive: Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Wiseman, Wiggins, 7, 14  Warriors receive: One tall australian boi and a kiss on the cheek"
"Ben Gordon, the spiritual bridge between Rip Hamilton and Kemba Walker, an undersized Bradley Beal with the scoring ability of a Montae Ellis Donovan Mitchell hybrid, with CJ McCollums shooting on Jamal Murray type range, would’ve been the ideal pairing for a guard like prime d-rose in today’s modern NBa."
Isnt Bradley Beal 28 years old?
"How does this team get better tho? The Nets took them to 7 without Kyrie and a hurt Harden. I think it’s safe to assume the Nets are a better team than the Bucks. You probably give them 1 more year, and fire Bud. I would be listening to offers for everyone except Giannis, but who you getting for Middleton and Jrue Holiday that makes you better unless they just gather assets with trading those to for a Dame Lillard, Bradley Beal trade. I don’t think they could get enough assets maybe if they trade everyone, but then it’s Giannis and Dame/Beal with no depth at all. That’s only if they get swept tho you keep the team if they show good fight and go 6 or 7"
"What fair reasons? Two great defensive teams built a wall to stop a guy who has no reliable jumper or post game? If Bucks had a Bradley Beal as a 1b on offense in 18/19 and 19/20, things would have been very different."
"steph curry is a superstar and he didnt even make the playoffs, so im asking you again is bradley beal a superstar"
do you consider bradley beal a superstar for putting up over 30 ppg?
"The bucks currently have a first, third and fourth option on their squad. They need a bonafide star to help giannis out. Whether that be a Bradley beal or some other dynamic guard idk."
"You’re right. It’s not like they need Westbrook in return so that both teams get a change. They need like a Bradley Beal who is literally just a better version and khris isn’t even cheap. Yea they might be fucked   That said, dirk didn’t go to the finals for ages but still a better fan experience than 90% of the league. Maybe fucked is a little harsh"
"Bradley Beal or Siakam is the ceiling with this package. Blazers would need more guys (see Looney, Poole) for Dame."
Imo Bradley Beal is better than him and he's still pretty young himself    In 5 years assuming he's healthy I can still see him being a scoring champ threat hopefully on a winning team
I don’t think Bradley Beal is a winning player and the wiz blew it by not trading him in the last 2 off seasons.
Camera guy to Bradley Beal: “You suck!!!!”

that bradley beal smile just makes me warm and fuzzy
"Great, now I'm wondering if Bradley Beal has a nice ass...thanks Pop 🙃"
"That’s exactly his point. The relentless coverage and slobbering over just a very few eg; Lebron, Steph, KD…is what is bad for the league. There are other guys who could and should be put in the spotlight as well. I’m fairly certain if the NBA/media would try to include more of these guys and not actively shove them aside for superficial reasons it would be better for the league overall. I’m 37 and remember when guys put up numbers that probably don’t even compare to some of these guys at least got some sort of recognition. Bradley Beal is a great example right now. Just look at his numbers, even if you want to call them empty and then think about how much the guy is actually (mis)marketed. This is true of many of the supreme talents in the league. The NBA and their media should should be pumping us up about these guys. Instead we’re always coming up with reasons they aren’t really that good. That’s what is hurting the sport. The obvious answer is they haven’t won a championship. Well neither did Barkley,Malone,Ewing,Drexler, etc. Yet we all look at them as legends because they were and have been treated as such. TL;DR push your players and for the love of god stop comparing them to to past legends and their legacies when they’re only 2-4 years into their careers. Let them play and appreciate them while they are here."
"Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 1996-97:   MJ 14.7, Terrell Brandon 11.1, Mitch Richmond 11.0, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 9.6, Karl Malone 9.5, Glenn Robinson 9.4  Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 2020-21:   Russ 6.1, Brandon Ingram 5.8, Julius Randle 5.8, Bradley Beal 5.6, Joel Embiid 5.6, CP3 5.5  That's a 45-50% drop, dude. And BTW, ALL of these dudes are noted standout offensive players."
Bradley Beal / Torrey Craig
Clickbait news tomorrow: New SECRET from Gregg Popovich… He likes Bradley Beal… said he is “THICK”!
"Pop on Bradley Beal: ""He's thick""."
"&gt; They need a ball handler, a bucket getter  So... Bradley Beal lol."
Bradley Beal.
Jaylen Browon + Marcus Smart for Bradley Beal. Who says no?
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed “Playoff Rondo”.  KCP: “Binary Mamba” for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers’ Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe’s word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers “ain’t the one”. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become “washed”. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to “good” teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, “to continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation”. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. “FOR KOBE” is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a “bubble” as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets’ bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a “mickey mouse ring” or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  “Job’s not done”  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
The tenth USA player would be like a Bradley Beal at worst. Tenth world guy might be like an OG Anunoby. Team USA is both top heavy and has depth.
Because when tf has Bradley Beal been the clear best player on a 1 seed team.
"I think they’d be competitive for the first half or three quarters of games 1 and 2. I honestly think Team USA sweeps.    Team USA’s sheer depth is insane. On a 12-man roster of their best players, their worst player would be someone like Jayson Tatum or Bradley Beal.    Luka, Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid can’t play the full the entire game. Their fit isn’t exactly great either—especially compared to Team USA."
"Unless they’re willing to deal Klay, Steph, or Draymond (which I’m sure they’re not), the warriors should be looking more for a Gary Harris than a Bradley Beal"
"Even with the questionable player evaluation they’ve had in the past still 0% chance they trade Fox, he’s their Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, etc."
"Even if you don't think he's a staple there, I'd certainly put him in the top 3 for perimeter defense. For the record, Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Paul George (all outstanding offensive players) have all suggested he's a top perimeter defender. Holiday flies under the radar even when he's playing like a madman."
"1. Cade - less athletic Grant Hill  2. Mobley - more defensive minded Chris Bosh   3. Green - 75% of Bradley Beal, better defender   4. Suggs - Tall, athletic Lowry with less ass   5. Kuminga - Very athletic Harrison Barnes   6. Barnes - Diet Draymond Green   7. Moody - TJ Warren with better defense   8. Keon - Shanon Brown with a better jumper  9. Sengun - Sabonis lite  10. Mitchell - offensively competent Kris Dunn   11. Bouknight - Nickiel Alexander-Walker   12. Kispert - Doug McDermott  13. Giddey - Unathletic rookie Lonzo Ball"
I thought it was bradley beal until he fell on the ground
Damn any more Reddish buckets and people are gonna go back to calling him untouchable in potential Bradley Beal discussions again.
"I don't think that Jaylen gets traded this offseason even if it was for Dame. That would be a horizontal move for the Celtics. It would be subtraction by addition. Brown is on a team friendly deal, his 24 years old , and his numbers looked like this:  **JBs Stats 2020-21**  PTS 24.7 TRB 6.0 AST 3.4 FG% 48.4 FG3% 39.7 FT% 76.4 eFG% 55.8  **Dames Stats 2020-21**  PTS 28.8 TRB 4.2 AST 7.5 FG% 45.1 FG3% 39.1 FT% 92.8 eFG% 55.4  **JBs Cost 2020-21        2021-22        2022-23         2023-24**  Boston Celtics $22,991,071 $24,830,357 $26,669,643 $28,508,929  **Dames Cost 2020-21        2021-22        2022-23          2023-24        2024-25**  Portland Trail Blazers $31,626,953 $43,750,000 $47,250,000 $50,750,000 $54,250,000  Also why trade for Bradley Beal when Jaylen is almost statistically identical to Bradley Beal at this age in development.

"Russ wasn’t an efficient scorer this year, and the offense was actually better with him on the bench. The only truly elite scorer you guys had this year was Bradley Beal   Plus how do you explain last season with IT as the PG? You guys had a strong offensive rating that year too  Im just saying brooks could excel in a collaborative role with high caliber tactical minds like Vogel. Im sure he’d be awful as head coach"
"You’re argument seems to be that Scott Brooks is a terrible tactician and head coach, i agree. But ive seen terrible head coaches make great assistants. Its a completely different job description   If you’re offense featured tons of isolation then that probably means that on some level brooks is able to install strong spacing principles and counters for defense’s over helping that allows guys to maximize how easily they can score. Ty Lue also runs an iso heavy offense if you would like a reference point  Lakers aren’t bringing him in for defense  How do you explain the 19-20 Wizards who started the corpse of IT for 37 games? Its like he had super teams, Bradley Beal was the only elite scorer on the team."
Shaquille O’Neal and Bradley Beal  Andrew Wiggins and DeAndre Liggins
The two names are: Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard
Rajon Rondo  DeMar DeRozan  James Johnson  Kyle Kuzma  Clint Capela  Ricky Rubio  Bradley Beal  Bojan Bogdanovic  Al-Farouq Aminu  Kosta Koufos  Jarrett Jack  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Kyle Korver  Gerald Green  Markieff Morris  Marcus Morris  Bismack Biyombo  Tristan Thompson
"I mean he headbutted Wagner in the bubble once and that's all I can remember. Even when he gets into somebody's face like he did with Bradley Beal awhile back he will very quickly just run away.   Like, the Enes Kanter thing Giannis just walked away even though Kanter was all over him. I really don't think he's ""absolutely"" confrontational or anywhere near that. If he was then he wouldn't have let Collins think he punked him"
"They're not getting Bradley Beal. Even with Simmons and Picks, there's just no way you can build a team around Westbrook and Simmons, and the Wiz aren't even picking up the phone on Beal."
Trade him for Bradley Beal or Russ if the money matches up.
And then Bradley Beal went right after their pick
You could also say Bradley Beal is the Adrian Dantley of this generation.
"It's been obvious for years. Holiday is an elite role player, that's it. He is not a star. The same with Middleton, he has talent and can have some big games, but is not consistent enough to be a number 2. He is a solid third option on a championship team. Bradley Beal would be so perfect as a number 2 for this team."
I only know of him because he is really good friends with bradley beal.
I don't even understand why people act like Bradley Beal is old or something. He's just hitting his prime lol.
"&gt; The source told the Daily News that the Knicks are interested in packaging rising star RJ Barrett in a deal for a star guard, like Portland’s Damian Lillard or Washington’s Bradley Beal. If both the Trail Blazers and Wizards are uninterested in a deal, the source says the Knicks are also monitoring Cleveland’s Collin Sexton, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Charlotte’s Terry Rozier as younger guards the franchise can fold into its plans for the future.  Rozier is like 9 months younger than Beal."
"&gt; Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Yeah, no."
Bradley Beal and I have no idea why. Just completely irrational and uncalled for on my end. I think someone abused him in 2k against me one time and since then it’s been a wrap for me.
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"

I made a post about Bradley Beal to Hawks. Demar would be a downgrade imo.
If Bradley Beal can score 30 plus pts a game then MJ could do whatever he wanted to.
We don’t need Bradley Beal.  We have K’von.
kyrie is extremely overrated and Westbrook is a much better player (Wall was better too until the injury). Bradley Beal is the best Shooting guard in the league.
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
"They've been linked to Lonzo and Patty Mills I think. Fournier will also get a decent contract. Or if this is long-term, hoping for Bradley Beal next year?"
"&gt;The Lakers had an alternative close to the finish line, sources said: Kuzma and Harrell to Sacramento for Buddy Hield. In that scenario, they could have kept Caldwell-Pope and re-signed Schroder. The Westbrook deal came together fast. At the beginning of draft day, Tommy Sheppard, the Wizards' GM, was discussing other deals based on the premise that Westbrook and Bradley Beal would be together in Washington, sources said.  &gt;Luxury-tax concerns may have played a part. The Schroder/Hield/Caldwell-Pope pathway might have ended up more expensive than this Westbrook option, depending on Schroder's salary and other factors. Schroder also could have just walked in free agency. This may have been more like an either-or between Westbrook and Hield.  &gt;There is some beautiful-mind framework in which the Lakers might still sign-and-trade Schroder and acquire Hield. It's just hard to find it. The Wizards and Kings don't want Schroder, sources said.  &gt;If Hield is out of the picture, the Lakers can and will try to turn Schroder into one or two other players -- though that requires Schroder's cooperation. It would be nice if one of those players could shoot 3s.  &gt;Look: Spacing isn't everything, and doesn't matter in transition. The Lakers were a dangerous fast-breaking team in their title year, and lost some of that verve last season amid injuries and malaise. Westbrook is verve incarnate. He will rebound and rampage.  &gt;The Lakers' half-court offense is their bellwether. They ranked 23rd in points per possession in the half court last season, and 17th in 2020, per Cleaning The Glass. They won it all in 2020 in large part because their half-court offense performed at league-best levels in the playoffs -- often amid blah spacing. Can they do it again?  &gt;There may be no practical difference between the Westbrook Lakers and the now-theoretical Schroder/Hield/Caldwell-Pope Lakers. They may win about the same number of games, and have about the same postseason chances. James and Davis drive everything.  &gt;The Schroder/Hield/Caldwell-Pope route just feels a little safer. It brings fewer fit questions. James is maybe the greatest problem-solver in NBA history, both on a possession-by-possession basis and on the zoomed-out level of an entire season and roster. Let's see how he approaches this fascinating new puzzle."
"No, not really. He’s consistently awful in the playoffs where he chucks tons of inefficient shots, which is awful for offense. Also, we would have had Danny green on Trae young, which thanks to doc, we saw was a disaster in game 1. Russ certainly couldn’t guard him.   If Westbrook is so much better in the playoffs than Simmons, I’m curious how a embiidless sixers beat a Westbrook team that has Bradley Beal on it in the playoffs in game 5 (btw in that game Simmons led all players in plus/minus, I’m sure you can guess who had the lowest)."
"So you’re including teams where the player hadn’t won MVP yet?   Then the 2021 Washington Wizards, with future MVPs Bradley Beal, Deni Avdija and Daniel Gafford."
Yeah but Westbrook lead a team with Bradley Beal almost into lottery territory. Not to mention he played through injury and also sat on every Back 2 Back. I’m just skeptical that they’ll be in a good spot if all three of them aren’t playing most of the time. If Westbrook is running a bench unit with no Lebron and AD they’ll be worse than the Wizards were last year. If it’s Westbrook and just one of the other two I’m also skeptical that they’ll be much better than Wizards last year. I’ll have to see it in action but it seems risky. Seems like they should have gotten more depth and better shooting then going top heavy on an iffy aging pg.
"Suggs is gonna have to the pull up shooting of Devin Booker or Bradley Beal to be a high end player in this league considering some of his existing limitations in finishing. I was actually hoping we take Suggs if we project his jumper to develop into that level. But if he really was bombing empty gym catch and shoot drills then I guess I’m fine with the Raptors not taking a chance on him.   Barnes on the other hand just have to be competent enough shooting the three to attract some close outs, considering what you know he can do with his size, passing, and defense. That player is still not number one option but can be a major piece on a great team if we get another first option.   It comes down to I can see justifiably passing on Suggs if you think he tops off at just an okay jumper."
"That site has Westbrook as the worst WPA player on the wizards last year lol. Literally the worst.  That list is sorted by total number of shots taken in the clutch, not on efficiency. In fact if you look at the chart the player immediately following him, Chris Paul, is a much more efficient clutch player. And the player after that, Bradley Beal, and the player after that, De'Aaron Fox, and the player after that, Jayson Tatum."
"Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook spent nine and twelve seasons with OKC, respectively. Bradley Beal has spent his entire career with Washington and he still wants to play for that shithole team. Damian Lillard has played with Portland for a decade thus far. Anthony Davis spent seven seasons with the Pelicans before demanding out. This whole shit is overblown."
"I'd say Ja is more of a playmaker than Green is. Ja is a score first guard but still does a good job trying to set teammates up, I don't see Green as that type of player. Green will be asked to fill it up and do a little playmaking on the side kinda like Bradley Beal. I think Green has a higher ceiling than Ja due to his size and shot making ability, we'll see if those skills he displayed in the G League show up in the NBA."
"Yes the reporting is wrong. There’s been so many false rumors lately that have been getting swept under the rug simply because of all the chaos of the offseason. The SGA + 6 rumor for pick 1? False. Bradley Beal wanting out? False. Jalen Suggs to the Raptors? False. Dame wanting to give up his contract? False. The media will report anything and everything that fits their narrative. I highly doubt we’re shopping Siakam, but he’s obviously not untouchable. This report is pure speculation."
"the heat are interested in every free agent  i dont know how they will pay bam, jimmy b, herro, duncan, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie, bradley beal, pascal siakam, and kawhi leonard but ive been wrong before"
Goodwill Bradley Beal
Washington is admirable in its attempt to please Bradley Beal with such a dearth of assets. Just scrap it man.
What better player than Bradley Beal are you imagining to come on the market that you’ll be able to get with that package?
They shouldn’t  trade them at all until there’s an available player that will indubitably increase the chance of competing for a title.  That player is not Bradley Beal or Ben Simmons btw.
"Couldn't have ended up better for Westbrook. He literally gets everything he wants:  Back home, joining a championship contender playing with two top 6 players in the NBA, and still keeps his lucrative contract.   Time for Westbrook to prove he can win a title. If he can't win with Bron and AD, the amount of damage his career will take would be immense.   He would have played with: LeBron, AD, Durant, Harden, Paul George, Bradley Beal."
"Paul george and Bradley Beal both had career years next to Westbrook, he is a star player. Look at [this analysison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhBVMAjAmA) Ruus"
"memphis and charlotte being examples of teams that rebuild for a couple years??? memphis has been pretty ass since the grit and grind days, Ja is good but hes not bradley beal.  &amp;#x200B;  charlotte is a joke of a franchise, generally speaking."
"Wouldn’t be hard to sell em either. “Hey trezz, look the Lakers are going to move from you regardless but they’re looking at the Wizards for a deal right now. You can compete for starting C and play with Bradley Beal, just gotta opt in”"
"Look at the players he has played with. You act like the guy is a one man army. He hasn't escaped the first round since KD left. Paul George, James Harden, and Bradley Beal. Those are some great teammates and he hasn't produced any results.  You're making excuses for him at this point. 'Triple double.' None of which matters to Lakers fans. Or don't you remember the time when he intentionally refused to score because he wanted an assist to get his triple double? That isn't championship or winning basketball. He's gonna have to figure out how he can plug his game into the Lakers because he's the one who is benefitting the most out of this trade."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
well then he should have been called over bradley beal.
Report: Bradley Beal has 'no desire' to leave Wizards.
They’re not going to move on from Bradley Beal until Bradley Beal moves on from them.
"Westbrick is 2-10 without Bradley Beal while Beal is 4-3 without him, so he didn't lead them to shit. Also played against injured lottery teams and still barely scraped by."
Bradley Beal was 2nd in the league in points per game.
"Haha so you're gonna use last year as hard evidence that the Jays need Bradley Beal? Most games missed due to injuries and covid, with 50% of Kemba Walker as our starting Point Guard? Maybe if we didn't have to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for 20 MPG, and start Tristan Thompson for 43 games, things would have been different. Our best 5 barely played together last year. If you think the Celtics were a Bradley Beal away from not being a .500 team then I don't know what you were watching."
"Bro the Wizards had a negative record. If that’s a positive for Westbrook, it shows just how bad he is nowadays.  PS: The Wizards made the playoffs because Bradley Beal played like a damn stud for an entire season, not because of Westbrook finally having good games from February onward.  They were in a big hole because of him to begin with"
"Westbrook winning a ring as the 3rd best player doesn’t make much story line really.  Westbrook has never advanced past the 1st round since KD left, not even when he was on his MVP season, not with Paul George or Bradley Beal"
And that was with Bradley Beal
17th sounds like a problem to me. Bradley Beal was 1st or 2nd in scoring for the whole season and they could only manage 17th?
"Again, didn't John Wall lead the Wizards to the playoffs year after year a few years ago with a shitty bench and a less seasoned Bradley Beal?  Westbrook didn't do shit."
"indeed from the ticket selling POV, TV rating, and showtime this will be great. just wished they get someone like  Bradley Beal"
"'Single handedly' is a bit strong. Russ was balling for the Wizards, but he could not have dragged this team to the playoffs without Bradley Beal putting up 30+PPG."
Who is the loyal All Star guard from the 2012 lottery who's a great scorer and not a very good defender?  Of course it's Bradley Beal. Who else were you thinking of?
"&gt;They could've traded those guys for something else.   Who? Cause those guys weren't gonna get the Lakers Bradley Beal. Who specifically do you think the Lakers missed out on?  Also, I want you to consider that [this trade can't officially go through until August 6](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1420901177512845317?s=19), which means this trade could still be altered and added to between now and then. Already Washington altered it by trading the 22nd pick to Indy. The Lakers free agents (Schroder, Caruso and THT) are not able to be talked to or about until free agency opens, but once that happens, they too could get included along with additional teams. Looking at it like this is all the Lakers will do this off-season is a mistake. Free agency has not even started yet."
Bradley Beal was putting up 30 PPG in his sleep last season. Miss me with that disrespect.
"&gt; All I know is the Wizards were the laughing stock of the league and Russ willed those clowns to the playoffs.  Bradley Beal scored 9 more points a game than him on way better efficiency on four more shots a game lmfao, westbrook was playing side kick, and not a great one at that."
"thats still under league average. Also, Bradley Beal helps"
Damn the wizards building around Bradley Beal harder than the warriors are around Curry
"Wasn't there a report that Washington wanted him to trade him to Brooklyn in a sign and trade for Spencer Dinwiddie, who is friends with Bradley Beal?"
Lakers fan here. I hate this trade.  I would have been happy if this trade netted us Bradley Beal instead.  Lakers better hope that a bunch of solid role players/veterans are willing to take minimum deals.
Free Bradley Beal
God damnit why can't Boston ever get this guy?!?! He would fit perfectly with Jaylen Brown and Jason Tatum. Add Bradley Beal into the mix next year and the team is legit scary.
"The Wizards pick is top 14 protected in 23, 12 in 2024, and 10 in 25. Something tells me the Wizards (especially if they either trade OR keep Bradley Beal) are either going to be good enough for the pick to either be late lottery/mid teens or bad enough that none of this matters and they keep it."
I wonder how Bradley Beal feels about his new teammate Kyle Kuzma
"If Westbrook was as good as people think he is, they would have won more games with him and Bradley Beal.   Getting thumped in the first round was pretty much expected for anyone with a realistic assessment of this Wizards team. They have a weak bench, zero positive defenders (except Anthony Gill) and only one star scorer"
TIL Bradley Beal is apparently a masochist
Why the fuck would you keep Bradley Beal?
Bradley Beal comparison is fairly accurate
This dude is not Bradley Beal. Lol
"Their last rebuild got them John Wall and Bradley Beal. They committed, they rebuilt."
Bradley Beal is already passed that one season. He's just not interested in a trade.   I don't get how this is such a hard concept to grasp.
I love Bradley Beal so much.
"Well yeah he’s not a good 1st option. He’s only an average second option. However, a 3rd option on a team with Lebron fucking James and AD? That sounds absolutely amazing.   And in this most recent year, he outplayed Bradley Beal down the stretch to lead his team to the playoffs. How much more recent can you get?"
"Westbrook has played with Harden, Paul George and Bradley Beal, the past 4 years and has won 1 playoff series"
No one in the NBA will pay that outrageous price for Ben Simmons. Sixers gatta be outta there mind for who Ben Simmons. Get the fuk outta here. I'm sure the Wizards don't want that much for Bradley Beal
Bruh… BEST case scenario with those three is west finals. BEST. GSW reloading and they are going to get Bradley Beal too. Clippers aren’t going away. Dallas gonna be a problem. And Denver/Utah still exist last I checked.
If by build around Bradley Beal they mean trade him for Ben Simmons I think it's a great idea.
Bradley Beal is such a fucking loser who doesnt care about winning. The fact his team keeps getting worse and he does nothing about it just shows he doesnt want to win.
The Wizards could force Bradley Beal to play on his own and he still wouldn’t leave the team
David Beal or Bradley Bertans?
This is more than the warriors were offering for 30ppg BRADLEY BEAL
"https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1420861735284744198  &gt;This is a trade Washington wants to make with Bradley Beal in mind, creating some salary cap flexibility for the future to add talent around him, sources tell ESPN. The idea of returning to his Los Angeles roots has been appealing to Westbrook."
"Bradley Beal is the Adam Sandler of the NBA, dude just wants to play with his friends and get the bag.  Who needs rings?"
"Lmao bradley beal is an engima  a loyal ass talented dude who will stay on a godawful team, front office forever."
Bradley Beal gonna be pissed lmao

Bradley Beal is gone  Woj is just coping at this point
Clearly getting Bradley Beal after the Westbrook trade.
Bradley Beal soon too
#Bradley Beal Gone
Y’all really don’t make any sense we don’t need to trade Ben Simmons right now at this exact moment.    I’m sure you’ve heard Bradley Beal and Damian are having issues with their team. We come in and offer a high price for Ben Simmons now and when we come back later asking for a little less it seems a lot more reasonable.   Offer a crazy number and later lower that price so people think they are getting a deal.    You ever notice when you go shopping and a store is on sale like all the time? That’s basically what they are doing
#THIS MEANS BRADLEY BEAL IS GONE AS WELL
That Bradley Beal trade is trash
Thats a horrible return for Bradley Beal
Very low if Bradley Beal does not request a trade.
"With Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook likely staying in Washington, I'd expect there's a strong chance DeRozan can end up with the Wizards."
"Right. There is no telling what might be on the table in the run up to the draft. I won't happen, but if all of a sudden Bradley Beal is offered and actually wants to be in Detroit, can the Pistons actually say no to that?   Good front offices go through due diligence and work their assets."
I get that he can play 4. But saying he’s a “4”implies it’s his natural position. It’s not imo. Al Horford is a 4 who plays 5. That isn’t what Hunter is. I get Hunter isn’t a Brad Beal/Avery Bradley size score or defender but to me his best position would be as combo guard alongside Trae
"If we didn’t give up Brown for AD, Kawhi, or Harden do you really think we’ll trade him for Bradley Beal? Lateral move"
Whoever is going to be a waste of a pick and spur Bradley Beal to not resign. Then we get no value for him walking and cause our franchise to continue to be awful. #wizardlife#janveselyforlife
you can try this with Bradley Beal if you feel Grant is not good enough lol
"Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal  Hield was in the 2016 draft, Beal was drafted in 2012"
I really really hope something like this doesn't happen with Bradley Beal. Especially considering we don't have a reliable fallback plan like you guys had with Dame.
"Say Simmons ends up going to Portland for CJ McCollum and, I don't know, two firsts?   Philly them have those two picks, their own 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 first round picks (2025 to OKC), and young pieces in Thybulle, Maxey and Milton, along with salary matcher in Tobias Harris, to send to, for example, Washington to get Beal.  CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal and Joel Embiid is probably a better championship base than Simmons, Harris and Embiid."
"Yea, just like Bradley Beal was not a 25ppg scorer at the age of 24.  You can't predict those kinds of development, we all thought Beal was gonna cap out as Wall's number 2 for life 3 years ago and it was an endearing thought that he could even be that good. Jaylen now is almost as good offensively as 24 year old Beal while being a significantly better defender"
"Lmao imagine a 2011 Drose with that thunder team, shit image a 2011 Drose team with that wizards squad with Bradley Beal."
Bradley Beal is gonna be a Sixer after the draft isn't he?
Bradley Beal also had a better regular season than Lebron  What’s your point?
"Kawhi and Kyrie are legit hurt. Lebron, Harden, Davis, Steph, CP3 all were healthy enough to play playoff basketball this year, but declined the invitation because of ""load management"" (some of them had injuries earlier in the year). Bradley Beal, Jimmy Butler and PG13 straight up declined to focus on next season. IDK if Randle or Westbrook were even invited.  To most players the olympics just aren't important anymore, and not even remotely as important as an NBA championship. Also, a lot of them have gold medals already from previous olympics."
Bradley Beal in 2019-20 was averaging the most per game of anyone not to make the all star team. Add him to the list.
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
Stats wise bradley beal will probably be if he doesn’t make the hof
"&gt; But having Damian Lillard &gt; having Bradley Beal especially when you factor in contract length.  I mean sure in a vacuum, but I’m not gonna be that upset if I got Beal instead. You’re making perfect the enemy of good"
"But having Damian Lillard &gt; having Bradley Beal especially when you factor in contract length.  Not trading for Bradley Beal and trading for Lillard or the next star who becomes available is taking a risk that you will be able to make that trade.  I'm not saying you wait for Wiseman and the two rookies to develop, I'm saying you wait for the right star to trade for."
If you're not going to take risks while you have a legit MVP player in Steph Curry on your team then just trade Steph now because this is your window and having Bradley Beal &gt; Not having Bradley Beal
&gt; Do the Warriors offer #7 for a rental though? Or do they keep Wiseman + 7 for the next star who wants out?  Do y'all think 31 ppg scorers grow on trees or something? If they could get Bradley Beal for literally 1 first round pick - even if its a good one - yes they'd snap your hand off
"Lol this sub has no idea what they’re talking about, Booker averaged 26 on 60% TS this year despite being 17th in free throw attempts.   Booker does all of these less than Harden, Trae, Luka, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Dame, and Donovan Mitchell. Y’all just dry ass haters who don’t know ball."

I mean we could have but the clippers pr.obably would’ve fucked up his development the way wizards fuck Bradley Beal ... kobe had good luck going to a proper team
"It won't make sense whatsoever for the warriors.  With Ben, you have 2 non shooters on the starting lineup, teams will practically going triangle 2 on Steph and Klay (imagine a taller Grizzlies Tony Allen that refuse to shoot, and there's your Ben Simmons).  Also, Ben will just park down low block and clog up the lane when Steph drives to basket.  You're not really getting an upgrade overall with Ben (sure better defense (maybe), but definitely way worse on offense (since Wiggins can shoot and can score))  Lastly, you're blowing up your futures for a slim chance of improvement that most likely won't happen.  Wiseman, Kaminga and Mody are raw/rookies, why not keep them at least one or two more years to develop them?  (Now if you're trading them for Bradley Beal or someone of THAT caliber then we're talking, but Simmons, absolutely not.)"
I am a Wizards fan and I still to this day can't fathom how Bradley Beal still wants to be with us.
"Round 1 - Rondo: His goal has never been to outscore the opposing PG. His job is to facilitate and get the W’s which he did. Bulls had a 2-0 lead and the only reason why Isaiah Thomas got past the 1st round and not labeled as a choker was because Rondo suffered a fractured right thumb in Game 2.  Round 2 - John Wall: He’s more of a facilitator as well with his usual double doubles. Also, he had to feed Bradley Beal. That’s the only reason why he didn’t score more than IT.  Round 3 - Kyrie Irving: LeBron had the ball most of the time. Kyrie still did his thing more efficiently than IT and negated whatever IT contributed. Most importantly, he got the W.  For the playoff guards out West, we all know those guys would dominate IT in playoff situations. They don’t wake up for the Celtics no matter what their seed was because they could back down the PG any day and kill him on switches."
"That's not totally fair, 95% of NBA players would get cooked in a 1v1 situation against Bradley Beal. IT's problem isn't his defense, it's his offense that isn't the same, defensively he is the same guy he has always been."
Umm no don’t mix you’re perception with reality. I go off exactly with what he says. He said he gonna strait next season with the blazers. Bradley Beal said he staying they’re out of options. Best philly can do is the warriors offer. They’re not getting dame for Ben anyway. Why the hell would blazers want to replace their franchise guy with somebody who don’t and can’t shoot.
Who else other than Bradley Beal should be taking more shots than Russ on that Wizards team?
"He's been on a team with Kevin Durant and a team with Bradley Beal, two great scorers. Besides playing with Harden multiple years."
Bradley Beal is an elite playmaker with such elite handles 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"The teams he's played on have had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Paul George, and Bradley Beal. Them only being ""pretty good"" is an indictment for a supermax player.   Russ has had negative winshares for his last 2 postseasons, which were both massive dropoffs from his regular season. In fact, virtually every stat that can be measured dropped in his last 2 postseasons, so I'm not exactly sure how you reached your conclusion..."
They should re-sign Isaiah Thomas and trade Bradley Beal for Isaiah Joe!
Bradley Beal?
"I don't know if this could still surprise someone, but Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal"
Westbrook was far and away the least efficient player to score 20+ PPG last year:  |Rk|Player|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|22.2|.509| |2|Pascal Siakam|21.4|.547| |3|Jerami Grant|22.3|.556| |4|Nikola Vucevic|23.4|.560| |5|Malcolm Brogdon|21.2|.561| |6|DeAaron Fox|25.2|.565| |7|Julius Randle|24.1|.567| |8|Donovan Mitchell|26.4|.569| |9|Collin Sexton|24.3|.573| |10|Terry Rozier|20.4|.575| |11|Jayson Tatum|26.4|.576| |12|Brandon Ingram|23.8|.584| |13|Jaylen Brown|24.7|.586| |14|Devin Booker|25.6|.587| |15|Luka Doncic|27.7|.587| |16|Khris Middleton|20.4|.588| |17|Trae Young|25.3|.589| |18|DeMar DeRozan|21.6|.591| |19|Bradley Beal|31.3|.593| |20|Paul George|23.3|.598| |21|Domantas Sabonis|20.3|.601| |22|Jimmy Butler|21.5|.607| |23|Kyrie Irving|26.9|.614| |24|Kawhi Leonard|24.8|.622| |25|Damian Lillard|28.8|.623| |26|Giannis Antetokounmpo|28.1|.633| |27|Zach LaVine|27.4|.634| |28|Joel Embiid|28.5|.636| |29|Nikola Jokic|26.4|.647| |30|Zion Williamson|27.0|.649| |31|Stephen Curry|32.0|.655|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021.
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.

I thought him and John Wall were gonna be the Wizards backcourt of the future but then they drafted Bradley Beal Lmaoo
"Outside of the OKC anomaly season…this guy is realistically worth around $12-$15 million a year. It’s simply baffling what he was asking for.   $25-$30 million per year is Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Brandon Ingram, etc money…aka bonafide all star. Just a perfect example of not knowing your worth and horrible risk assessment."
Not only is that  not true but it’s a massively closed argument. For one we didn’t have many holes we have our stud pg for the future in young two young promising wings in reddish and Hunter and two snippets at two guard  in bogi and huerter plus athletic big men in capela and ogungwu. Not to mention we got deeper at guard with the addition of Delon Wright and in the front court in gorgi dieng. Jus cause we didn’t trade all our assets for Bradley Beal didn’t mean we didn’t get better
He's putting up the same numbers we saw from Beal at the same age while being 6'6.   You wouldn't want Bigger Bradley Beal from your #1 pick?  25ppg 3-level scorer and 1-4 defender.
Kawhi  PG13  Dame  Donavon Mitchell  Russ  Ja Morant  Kyrie  Derozan  Bradley Beal  Dejounte Murray  Keldon Johnson   Giannis  Patty Mills  Blake Griffin   Reggie Jackson  Oladipo  Sabonis  Bojan Bogdonavich  Mike Conley   Jimmy Butler  Rudy Gay
Pretty obvious to me. Bradley Beal is a pretty good basketball player and pretty good basketball players sell tickets regardless of how bad your team is.
Initial thoughts: he kinda moves like bradley beal though
"really struggled with Okoro on him   this level of separation was common, but this one fell  needs to do some yoga bc a dude who can jump that high shouldn’t be as slow as he is laterally. his change of direction disappointed me    idk if he will ever become Bradley Beal-esque scoring 30, but he will become a very good player"
Give you guys 1 guess where it started and their name is Bradley and Kamiah B….no wait wait that’s too obvious.  Let’s just call them **B Beal and K Beal**
"I mean its hyperbole but I'd be disappointed if Jalen Green didn't average 27+ for at least like 5 seasons. His game is so similar to Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal. Just unreal shotmaking."
I mean Bradley Beal just did it twice in a row and I will bet Green will be better than Beal
Bradley Beal
Lol Hakeem was way out of his prime by the time he landed in Toronto. Kawhi won a chip and was lauded as the best player in the world by many until the Clippers’ playoff failure.  That’s like saying Wizards Michael Jordan was better than Bradley Beal because of his legacy.
"Lol 😂 if Steph Curry and Bradley Beal can avg 30+ MJ could average way more than 30. James Harden literally averaged 36 in this era. There are about 3 great Centers and a handful of rim protectors. MJ dominated teams who had David Robinson, Mutombo, Patrick Ewing, Shaq, Malone, and other hall of fame bigs in the paint. With these non threatening bigs of today who’s stopping MJ from getting to the rim? Nobody can stop Kawhi’s mid range which is a diet version of Jordan’s. Also, keep in mind that there wasn’t an emphasis on 3point shooting in that era only Reggie Miller and a few specialists shot 38-40%+ during that era. None of the best players were great three point shooters statistically but don’t kid yourself like he couldn’t make threes. He hit 6 threes in the first half of a finals game. Averaged 30-40 5/6 finals. If he grew up in this era he’d adapt just like if Lebron played back then he’d adapt. All of the top tier greats would translate to any era. MJ could easily averaged 35-40 ppg with this weak defense."
"I think that's just Vegas tho. Realistically, there's no way Zion wins MIP after he just put up 27ppg. I just feel like coming in second or third in MIP voting one year takes you out of future runnings. If you've already put up a MIP quality season, your next improvements aren't going to be massive enough for you to be in contention. Like 2 years ago, Bradley Beal went from 25ppg to 30ppg. Since he's established, that improvement doesn't qualify him for a MIP vote."
"He'd almost surely get over $20 million per year from someone in free agency, and it sounds like that's what he's looking for. But if the Celtics re-sign Smart, doesn't that blow up Celtics fans theory about clearing $50 million in cap space next summer for Bradley Beal?"
Dame is a much better player than Bradley Beal you’d be crazy to argue otherwise
"No bias too, but If we’re being honest here. If Bradley Beal never got sent home, keldon Johnson wouldn’t be in the team. Therefore Bradley Beal was the main reason USA won gold"
"And Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Paul George, etc."
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.  Starters:  Bradley Beal  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Others:  Jaylen Brown  James Harden  Julius Randle  Mike Conley Jr.  Brandon Ingram  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Zion Williamson
I mean ceiling are hard to determine because anything COULD happen but if you are asking me what I predict rj will be I think somewhere in the middle of khris Middleton and Bradley Beal(if everything goes right)

"Depends, maybe Smart wants out? He's on the last year of his deal, Boston isn't going to invest heavily in Smart. You aren't contending really this year, and it gives him a chance to get a ring.

Almost as delusional as Celtics fans who've been all over social media &amp; reddit thinking they're gonna get Bradley Beal
"I didn’t make any excuse. I just said that that’s a completely unfair comparison. If Bradley Beal somehow gets traded to the Nets, he didn’t somehow become a much better player because he’s going to make the finals now.  So saying “Russ is gonna make the finals and those players are not” is a completely ridiculous argument for why he is better value. Whichever you think has better value you should make an actual argument instead of saying stupid shit like that.  Also, I have said the same thing about Kevin Love being overrated (before everyone jumped on that train) and about Tony Parker being a little overrated at the time."
"“In a shocking turn of event, Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum has demanded a trade to the Washington Wizards to play with his buddy Bradley Beal. It has been Boston’s plan to wait out for Beal and sign him next season.”   Tatum booms us"
You can't forget Bradley Beal
"I feel like you maybe only mentioned each of these players' best qualities.  Kuzma and KCP are low-level starters or high-level bench players.  Dinwiddie missed all of last year with a knee injury.  Montrezl Harrell couldn't even get on the court for the Lakers in the playoffs (played a total of 39 minutes in the 6-game series).  Aaron Holiday has gotten worse each year, and he looks to be playing himself out of the league.  Isaiah Todd is a 2nd round pick.    I don't think it's a terrible job by the Wizards if the only goal was to get better next year, but Kuzma, KCP, Harrell, Dinwiddie, and Holiday were all players not really wanted/needed by their former teams.  Realistically, even with Bradley Beal, that team may struggle to make the playoffs.  As of now, they have around the 22nd best odds to win the NBA title.    The moves seem to have been made to make Beal happy, but it's possible they may have been better off moving on from Beal and starting a proper rebuild. This group of players isn't likely to have much success."
"Russell Westbrook averaged 24/6/8 as a second banana to KD during John Wall's career. During that same time, John Wall averaged 18/4/8. Russ had better efficiency btw.  Not to mention advanced stats, where westbrook completely blows John Wall out of the water, but that could be excused since John wall was on a much worse team with his second option being a young Bradley Beal compared to KD for Westbrook.   Sorry, but John Wall was never better than Russell Westbrook at any point in his career."
"Keldon Johnson, young player for the Spurs and was originally on the select team. He was brought up with the absences of Kevin Love and Bradley Beal  EDIT: If you are referring to the US team that is"
"He was not one game away from making the finals without Jordan, he was one game away from making the conference finals without Jordan - quite a difference. For context, Trae Young just successfully made the conference finals this year, so did Paul George. Bradley Beal and the Wizards were one game away from the conference finals in 2017, Kyle Lowry and the Raptors were one game away from the conference finals last year, Embiid and the Sixers have been there twice, etc. I don't want to belittle these players/teams because they're solid, but being a game away from the conference finals for one year is not necessarily a reliable barometer to project from."
"I don't understand the narrative that the Celtics are looking to get Bradley Beal in FA next year; Jaylen is still on the team and the ""Tatum and Beal are friends"" claim is not enough for one to think they're gonna bank it on one guy. That narrative makes no sense whatsoever from my perspective.   I do believe the Cs are trying to free themselves from cap space long term, while looking for players to compliment the Jays. I've said it for years that Kemba was not the answer. Whether that answer is in FA next year remains to be seen, but I don't believe they're actively trying to pursuit Beal; it would defeat the entire cap space plan altogether."
he was the reason the Wizard started off so poorly in the first place. He didn't drag anything. he was the reason they were so bad.  and the Wizards had the 3rd easiest schedule post ASB. Wow so with Russ and Bradley beal they managed to get the .... 9th seed.  What outstanding leadership! I would love for Russ to take my team to the 9th seed.
"My stomach dropped when I saw the name Bradley Beal, Jesus."
I thought it said they’re sending Bradley Beal holy shit lmfao
Honestly I like the Lakers as is. Would be cool if buddy and dinwiddie both ended up with Bradley beal. Lakers do a sign and trade to send schroeder to the kings.
"Nash did have great teams, but what a weird comparison. Russ has played with KD (arguably the best player in the NBA) and one of the greatest ever. James Harden, a top scorer of all time, and only this past year he played with an all star in Bradley Beal and did a good job. Westbrook is a Hall of Famer and I appreciated the effort he made here in DC. Hats off to him, but Nash played with who? Stoudemire? Bell? In his prime? When he was with Dirk they played well and brought the Mavs out the cellar. I agree with the premise but not the comparison. Nash with Kobe in Phoenix would have been the equivalent of Westbrook and KD, and he never had that."
Nets about to turn Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan into Bradley Beal and Dame!
"I'm not ignorant nor arrogant you're literally assigning rankings to a completely nebulous concept called basketball ""gravity"" and using one single tweet to prove your point. But because I watch basketball and you don't, I can name 5 players just off the top of my head that NBA teams would never not guard before they would not guard Duncan Robinson. Kyrie Irving, Keving Durant, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Joel Embid, Trae Young, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Lebron James ...oh wait that's more than 5."
There's gonna be an eight team trade involving Ben Simmons and Bradley Beal centred around Spencer Dinwiddie BOOK IT.
"Bradley ""King of Flip-flopping"" Beal"
"The Lakers have traded Russel Westbrook, Malik Monk, and Kendrick Nunn for Bradley Beal"
you made that whole list without even listing Bradley Beal who was the second best scorer in the league last year and All NBA
"Williams will be a restricted free agent next summer (unless the Celtics extend him this summer, which would ruin their dreams of Bradley Beal in free agency). Judging by the Celtics track record, how confident are we that they'll match if he gets a big offer sheet next summer? Cause it seems like the Celtics routine every off-season is to let guys walk rather than match the big offers they're getting from other teams."
"Trust me they would. That's why superstars get to demand trades in the first place. Not treating a superstar right really hurts your chances with other stars. It would also piss off Paul George who wants to be paired with Kawaii in the first place.  Also most of the star players who will be in free agency will be Brooklyn's core. Assuming they don't want to break up their super team you're not getting any of them... So you're left with Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Julius Randle, John Wall.... I think Leonard is better when healthy than those players.  Also signing a new super star means you have to make the cap room. You can't just use your bird rights. Makes you lose a lot of talent, sometimes assets to move contracts."
I’m taking this as “Bradley Beal trade imminent”. No further comment at this time.
"Bradley Beal to Barcelona, confirmed."
Only reason to save it is if the Celtics think they are getting Bradley Beal. At this point it seems like they are wasting another year of Tatum and brown but if it nets them Beal it’s worth it
"Celtics are staying as a 6-8 seed cuz they want Bradley Beal so they’re not making big moves.   Right now I’d say Knicks are better   Starting lineups are pretty even, Smart/Richardson/Tatum/Brown/Horford or Williams vs Walker/Fournier/Barrett/Randle/Robinson, but the Knicks bench of Rose/IQ/Burks/Toppin/Noel trumps the Celtics bench of like, Pritchard/Nesmith/Langford/Williams/Horford or Williams"
Right now I'd wager on the Knicks being a higher seed than the Celtics.  Celtics seem like they're just planning for next year with a Bradley Beal swing.
"This was a long time ago. When Sixers are going after Bradley Beal.   Morey is delusional to think he can get Lowry and Bradley Beal for Simmons.   They at least help Simmons develop a shot, before dreaming to get that absurd return."
"Are you looking at the average for the league...or by position..? It doesn't make sense to lump the power forwards and centers in there. Amongst guards he's actually better than guys like Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Drose, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Westbrook"
I just wanna make sure you know that hes implying Bradley Beal is a much better player and the Sixers would have to include at least 2FRP to get a deal done.
Bradley Beal isn’t a superstar?
"Why is Booker and Mitchell fucking ""SUPER STARS"" when bradley beal isn't? How is the #2 scoring leader not a superstar??"
Same for Bradley Beal
"huh? you can't trade players away and then in the same transaction absorb contracts via a TPE. if salary goes out salary must come in. so unless you're trading players away and getting expiring/picks back, and then trading a billion picks and no contracts to the wizards, a TPE is irrelevant when it comes to Bradley Beal.  cap space has nothing to do with it."
"Also AD, Kawhi, PG13, Bradley Beal, Zion Thrilliamson, Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, The Great Hardini, Kyrie, Westbrook...there's loads of players we could have sent to demolish the world on short notice. I'm kinda wondering why Zion didn't go. The Great Chonky One would have been un-fucking-stoppable with these rules."
I think the Celtics are going for Bradley Beal next summer
you want to give that kind of money to bradley beal wtf washington will remain mediocre for the next decade
"Oh right, cause Bradley Beal is gonna take $179 million from the Celtics instead of $241 million from the Wizards. I keep forgetting that 😂"
"IIRC didn't Bradley Beal have some insane stat lines during Russ's injury? I know they weren't winning a ton of games , but I thought I remembered Beal being in MVP contention early on"
Bradley Beal didn’t make it a season ago while averaging over 25ppg
"Man ours is something else, someone made a post about Bradley Beal saying hes not leaving and every comment was calling him a piece of shit for being loyal"
A guaranteed starting spot next to Bradley Beal is hardly scraps.
you want to give that kind of money to bradley beal wtf washington will remain mediocre for the next decade
"Oh right, next year's cap space. Because Bradley Beal will turn down 5 years and $241 million from Washington to sign for 4 years and $179 million in Boston. Totally forgot about that 😂"
"Every star should be loyal and also when Bradley Beal does it, the most upvoted opinion is “wtf is beal doing”."
Bradley Beal
"The all-seeing eye u/rNBA_is_for_nerds has determined that Bradley Beal won't want to play with one of his best friends, so it definitely isn't happening.  Guess what? We're not the Lakers. We don't have a fucking button to press and get the biggest names in the league to sign with us regardless of how shit we've been run. We actually have to build a team and can't rely on a big name saying ""I want to play in LA!"""
They want Bradley Beal probably
"If Russell Westbrook can get traded 3 times with that contract, Bradley Beal can definitely get traded."
This is why there will never be anything close to parity in the nba. Bradley beal can't make more money than lebron james to have a competitive league. But its been like this for a while
I’m sorry but Bradley Beal is not worth $240 million if you’re trying to put together a winning team
I think Ja Morant with worse passing/better shooting is better or Bradley Beal.
It's not a dumbass take to say that a team without 41 million dollars out of their salary cap would not make the playoffs. It's not a statement on whether Westbrook is better than Bradley Beal it's acknowledging how dumb that scenario is.
Dumbass take. The guy outplayed Bradley Beal down the stretch
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
"no the fuck he wouldn’t ??? what the fuck. Steph Curry and Bradley Beal didn’t even average 35 this year. the last players to hit that mark were Harden, Kobe, and Jordan. KP would average 25-28 at best"
"I live in DC, so occasionally the local NBC channel will come on and I’ll watch lol. I also go to a lot of games (couldn’t this year because of insane prices and COVID) mostly because I find Bradley Beal a joy to watch live."
Bradley Beal is wasting Joel Embiid’s prime.
Did Bradley Beal not play and average 30?

Trade for Bradley beal
Trade worked out for them but at the time it was definitely a weak haul. It was basically oladipo and a mid first round pick in sabonis. Imagine that type of trade for Bradley Beal today it was seen as a robbery.
"Bradley Beal. Definitely an all star, but only is scoring leader because of volume."
"Bradley Beal is 28, (not old) and is getting 34 mil this year and 35 next year.  Murray is getting 29 mil this year and 36 in 2024, about 32 per year so Beal is barely being paid more when you factor in his nba pay seniority.  I could agree with a lot of what you said before you said the nuggets wouldn’t trade Murray for Beal and 2firsts.  That is absolutely insane, Beal is an all around guard who just balled out next to Westbrook who is ultra ball dominant and played next to no jumper John wall for years.  There’s no reason to assume Beal and Jokic wouldn’t form a great connection between each other."
Yeah I was thinking more along the lines of Bradley Beal honestly
"He noticeably upped his effort, especially with the off-ball stuff attention stuff and dying on screens in the playoffs. He ended the playoffs with 20 steals, which is only 3 less than CP3 (who played 4 more games than him). Basically, he learned how to jump passing lanes well, and if you watched the games, you saw he'd effectively hold his ground until the nearest wing defender would tag him out (to your good wing defenders point).  During the regular season, sure, call him the worst star guard defender in the league or whatever you want (not exactly hyperbole, although I think Bradley Beal might grade out worse), but he puts in the effort when it matters and executes the defensive scheme which I think is all Hawks fans really care about."
Uh what? Bradley Beal averaged almost 5 more points a game and shot like 3% worse from three
"Better shooter. Looks great against a lot of defenses. Amazing spot up shooter. Bradley Beal has never been apart of any amazing offense that utilizes his strengths as a player. Donovan Mitchell relies heavily on driving/athleticism, he may not even be the same scorer he is at Brad Beals age. I think Mitchell is great but I think ppl will turn sour on him if he keeps losing series' and having 30 shots a night."
Would you you be willing to mess up the chemistry for Bradley Beal?
"Wiggins was really effective against some of the best scorers in the league, not least Bradley Beal, Paul George (in their first faceoff last season). He's assigned the best wing player and is reasonably switchable. Wiggins is a bit better defensively than you think. Plus he fits them like a glove right now, because he fills a need offensively quite well. Why would you trade him unless to obtain an offensive superstar?"
"People really just inject GSW into trade rumours despite everything. They've kept their draft picks to develop players for the future, the FO says to the media that they want to use their draft picks to develop players for the future, they respond to every trade rumour by saying 'We intend to use our draft picks to develop players for the future' - and it is absolutely powerless to stop people putting together packages where they sell the farm for Ben Simmons, Dame Lillard or Bradley Beal."
DeRozan isn't anywhere near as valuable as Bradley Beal though
There’s a few teams:  Clippers - I think they try this Kawhi and PG duo for at least one more year before they give it up or one of them requests to leave.   Blazers - I think they would have to blow it up more than likely to try and find a more suitable partner for Dame Lillard.  Wizards - They would have to seeing the fact that there’s at least a 50-60% chance that Bradley Beal is not resigning. I would look for them to try to build through the draft and try to find themselves a franchise cornerstone (Tank for Emoni Bates or Chet)
"You have a very weird logic and I don't know why you are comparing the two. And I would say Klay is a godly shooter, but he is not the same type of scorer like Bradley Beal. If you want you can call Bam one of the best dribble handoff player. I'm cool with that"
"I got shooters, in DC, Bradley Beal"
Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal? Nvm not East
"So if I'm interpreting this right, another way to phrase this is that Steph's shooting ability allows him to get easier layups than Kyrie, thus having a slightly higher finishing % (66% vs 62%)  And for experiment, if we were to put the two in the same scenerio already at the basket with the same defenders at the same places on the court against them as though we were playing some kind of basketball simulator, then maybe Kyrie would have a higher finishing percentage. And so, Kyrie might be better purely as a finisher. I don't know how we would get the right numbers if we wanted to look into it some more though.  we usually give credit to guys if they're able to get easier shots (layups) for themselves, so it might not be appropriate to consider solely their finishing ability.  Also, there are some tough bullets to bite with this argument though. Using a similar argument, maybe Bradley beal is actually a better midrange shooter than Durant. And Durant only has a higher midrange percentage (50.6% vs 47.4%) because his height advantage allows him to get easier shots.  At least on its face though, the argument doesn't seem too unreasonable."
If KD was 6'3 he'd still be Bradley Beal. Crazy good but not all-time great.   If Steph was 6'10 he'd be the best basketball player ever lol.
But what trade involving Maxey and Ben is going to get an all star player? Theres been no word on Dame getting to philly same with a guy like Bradley Beal. Unless SAC is willing to De’aron Fox in a ben deal it makes sense to keep Maxey
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
Wasn't there like a crazy stat where Bradley Beal was running 2 miles a night for the Wizards.
Then why do you keep bringing up winning? And I think if Minnesota healthy they can compete for a playin spot now. And if ANT develops into a Bradley Beal level of player like I think he can then they can be a playoff team you act like dlo is bad he has an average TO/assist ratio so he isn’t really a To machine like you said earlier he’s a 52.3% efg percentage guy while creating almost all of his looks and is a solid passer he’s probably a better player for what the wolves need than Wiggins how about we give Kat and dlo some time to play together before we chalk the trade up to being horrible.
Why is Booker who led his team to the finals behind Bradley Beal?
Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal
He was in Washington bro. Bradley Beal barely makes the ASG and he's a lock for 30 a night lol
"Bradley Beal, in my opinion, should be lower. Putting him at No. 2 because he scores 30 / night seems unfair to guys that actually impact winning, consistently   1. Harden 2. Mitchell 3. George (technically a 3, but plays 2 next to Leonard) 4. Brown 5. Booker 6. Beal 7. Lavine 8. McCollum (I want CJ to be higher but I feel like he is carried a bit by Dame)  If Klay was healthy I'd have him above Beal"
"I honestly can’t believe the disrespect Westbrook gets at this point . Not everyone with high usage can produce at a league leading level. That’s like saying Bradley Beal isn’t a good scorer, he was just 2nd in the league in scoring only because he had high usage, and If Kyle Kuzma were given the same amount of usage as Bradley Beal, he’d be second in the league in scoring too. That’s simply just not true."
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum
"Trade 3 is the only realistic one that takes into account assets the teams have. 1 and 2 don't work because the Lakers and the Clippers don't have the assets to trade for a superstar and star player respectively.   Trade 3 works in terms of assets but it doesn't work based on fit, so the warriors simply don't go for it. Realistic and impactful trades that work for the Warriors are them going for either Bradley Beal or Siakam. Beal trade would be bat shit insane offense with 3 of the best off ball guards playing off Draymond Green. Siakam trade works better with fit and gives them greater offensive and defensive versatility. Firstly, a Draymond and Siakam front court is insane defensively with either of them being able to play small ball center. Secondly, Siakam provides a more versatile scoring option who is also a pretty good facilitator"
"Lmfao have fun with Kemba and Fournier, we’ll take Bradley Beal."
Picking 2nd in the 2012 draft after going 7-59 (.106 winning percentage) and missing Anthony Davis and then fucking up by not picking Bradley Beal ://
"DeMar DeRozan. Also on this list. Kemba, KAT, and Bradley Beal"
Bradley Beal.  Then I would say Christian Wood
Bradley Beal = LeBron and Anthony Davis? What the fuck are you talking about
"I don’t know. I honestly feel like it works for almost everyone involved. As far as I can tell, it seems to be a big reason that buyout guys are so much more talked about in the NBA than in the NFL.   I guess maybe players feel like they’d lose agency and/or there’d be some concern that a team like the Lakers would end up with someone like Bradley Beal for $10 Million/year?? Limiting it to the final year or two of a contract and disallowing bird rights should fix that concern though."
"No it doesn’t mean anything in a superstar discussion. Superstars are the best of the best players. Players you put on your team and you’re automatically contenders now. Look at his history though. He gets destroyed by the Lakers last year with James Harden by his side. He couldn’t make it out of the first round with PG by his side. This year he gets destroyed by the 76ers with Bradley Beal by his side. He’s had excellent players over his career on his side but at the end of the day he hasn’t achieved any team success without Kevin Durant. I don’t see how you can look at that and call that a superstar. His stats are great but his overall production for the team isn’t up to par with real NBA superstars. That isn’t a knock against him, it’s just reality"
I've seen Celtics fans talking for a while about how Boston can get Bradley Beal next summer on a sign and trade by sending them the expiring contracts of Horford and Richardson. Does that mean the Lakers can now get LaVine next summer on a sign and trade by sending the expiring contract of Westbrook?
"Well before I make a case for Ewing I have to acknowledge a few things about Westbrook. He’s a great player and even better talent. A genuine physical marvel. He’s going to retire with a better resume than Pat by virtue of his MVP and all the triple-doubles and all that. I get it.So I’m not even going to try and make a statistical case for Ewing.  &amp;#x200B;  What I can say about Ewing’s is he was a tremendous big man with an extremely soft touch who was very efficient in the post and could knock down every jumper (turnarounds, runners, bank shots, fadeaway shots) in the book while being strong on the boards and defense all while making his teammates better. And that last part can’t be stressed enough:  &amp;#x200B;  The Bird-Parrish-McHale Celtics   Jordan/Pippen Bulls  Bad Boy Pistons  &amp;#x200B;  All of them had multiple HoF players on them, all won at least 2 titles and are regarded as being amongst the best ever, and all eliminated the Knicks from the playoffs at least once (the bulls 5x, I think) during Ewing’s prime. His only ‘bad’ playoff loss was to the Pacers - and maybe Olajowan’s Rockets - who they wouldve beat had Starks and Pat Reilly not chocked.  But to get back to the point…When Ewing was at the age Westbrook’s at he was making Charles Oakley and John Starks into All-Stars on the way to getting the Knicks into the Finals. While Westbrook is on his umpteenth team and couldn’t get out of the first round despite getting to play alongside yet another prime 30pt per game scorer in Bradley Beal.  At this point you might be wondering… how many 30pt per game teammates did Ewing ever have? The answer is none. Zero. He never had a Durant or Harden or Beal or even a Chris Paul.Anyway. Wes has the stats and the personal accolades but Ewing made guys better. He was a player you could build around. He made a guy off the bargain bin into an All-Star and carried a bunch of B/C level players into the playoffs and made deep runs year-after-year for over a decade.  &amp;#x200B;  I don’t expect to change your mind if yoy didn’t see him play and are basing things mostly on advanced metrics and accolades. But between Ewing and Russ, one guy you can build around and the other is a stat accumulating sipher. And I’ll leave it at that"
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid. Guys like Biyombo, Mozgov, Mahinimi, Deng, Parsons, etc. [Here's a list from that summer.](https://www.businessinsider.com/31-best-nba-free-agents-2016-2016-6)"
Bradley Beal is a fully realized Alex Moran
"Gobert signed an extension worth more AAV than Steph Curry, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, Karl-Anthony Towns and Devin Booker, who're all franchise cornerstones. But his value isn't at the level of any of these players in the playoffs."
That’s cool man I’ve alway loved my fellow lefties too.  I was a huge Bradley Beal guy coming into the 2012 draft. Remember a friend telling me I should never watch basketball again because I wanted the Bobcats to take him over MKG   I still stir him up for it every now and then 😂
"Yeah if they can somehow get Simmons while keeping their “big 3,” it could be an interesting move to then also trade Edwards for another win-now piece. Hard to say exactly who that would be, but still an interesting idea. Maybe package Edwards and filler for Bradley Beal? Maybe Jermaine Grant takes another leap and it becomes reasonable to trade Edwards for Grant? Who knows.   DLo/Beal/Simmons/KAT would be pretty amazing to watch, even if it’s a very flawed team. But this is an absolute pipe dream for Minny."
Im stupid for debating a guy who thinks Westbrook is not a elite passer despite leading the league in assist multiple years.  According to you Bradley Beal is also not a elite scorer as well huh?
"Wrong, its Bradley Beal"
"The amount of disrespect to Dame is crazy. He should Garner atleast what Kawhi did if he is going to stay, probably way more. Like Bradley Beal and 2 unprotected firsts or something like that. He is a top 10 player with a floor well above Simmons Ceiling (unless he magically becomes a legit three point threat)"
Surely the Blazers can get a better deal? Dame is a top 10 player and CJ is top 25 both should be worth atleast 3 or maybe 2 for CJ unprotected firsts. And Dame should be worth atleast KAT or Bradley Beal plus additional assets
Bradley Beal  Joe Harris  Bryn Forbes
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
Jaylen Brown vs Bradley Beal
"&gt; \- Bradley Beal is not getting traded until before the 2023 season starts.  If he's not traded and doesn't accept a supermax, he's opting out. I'm guessing if we don't trade him in 2022 he's not gonna be under contract to trade in 2023."
Is Anthony Davis better than Bradley Beal??
"The truth is if Lowry was talking to them at all and giving indicators that he had interest in the Pelicans, it was just because he needed them to create the leverage to make Toronto trade him to where he really wanted to go. Miami didn't have the cap space to just sign him outright without losing a bunch of key pieces, so Lowry had to make Toronto feel like he was leaving them one way or another: they could either trade him where he wanted and get something in return, or he'd go to New Orleans as a free agent and they'd get nothing.  That anonymous GM is right: David Griffin made moves (which included trading down in the draft and giving up a future 1st round pick) mainly so they could be big players in free agency. But instead all it got them is being used as leverage so Miami could get Lowry. Griff got played. Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine may try this same maneuver next summer to force a sign and trade to someplace they prefer to go to. I wonder if teams with no realistic shot at them will similarly get suckered into clearing out max cap space only to get left at the altar as a leverage play."
We played them twice at the end of the season and I was really surprised by how tough they were. They didn't even have Bradley Beal for those games and they still made both of them extremely close. Russ was fantastic.
He had Bradley Beal with him lol
Bradley Beal isn't worth the price the Warriors or 76ers would pay to get him.
The Game 1 Orlando Magic  The getting blown out game Bradley Beal
"Harden and Kyrie are signing the extensions I think. Also pretty sure Lavine is signing the max next summer to stay with Chicago. Wall and Westbrook picking the player options. So the only FA that is interesting is Bradley Beal becuz who knows if he wants to stay in DC and all those rumors with going to Boston. Safe to say, after Beal, there is not a whole lot out there becuz it’s just your average role players. Also weird Ayton has not signed the extension, I expected him to get one, maybe it will happen in the future and before the szn starts."
"I think my point is he actually would have scored and rebounded much more than that. If Bradley Beal can score 31 a game in today's game, who's to argue peak Wilt couldn't score 45?"
"First time I saw Tatum play his rookie year was when Boston hosted Washington for their Xmas day game, and I remember watching them interact during shoot around concluding with a clearly-very-tight handshake routine.  It was very surprising to me and I remember looking to see whether or not Beal went to Duke too.  Here’s a (very Celtics-centric) article that was posted the day after that game:  https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2017/12/26/inside-jayson-tatum-evolution-bradley-beal-boston-celtics-washington-wizards-nba-xmas-christmas/"
Got Bradley Beal too
"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"
so washington is gona take Josh and holford for Bradley Beal lmao
Bradley Beal.
"He doesn't need to request a trade, he simply needs to hit free agency. The situation the Wizards are in right now is actually pretty similar to the situation the Celtics were in with Kyrie. Can't extend him because the extension isn't close the max he can get after hitting FA, there's someone he's good friends with that he can probably team up with, very clearly not even verbally committing to his existing team even though he could clear up all rumors just by doing so:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/06/03/bradley-beal-future-with-wizards/  &gt; What Beal did not have answers for were questions about his future with the franchise.  &gt; Asked Wednesday about his intentions entering a contract year with the Wizards — he will be a free agent in 2022 — the 27-year-old said he had not yet thought about the years to come.  &gt; “We’re not even going to think about that or even talk about it right now,” Beal said."
"Yeah the wiz are probably a 8-11 range team in the east, they have some nice players and one big ol Bradley Beal. The franchise, well, sure they haven’t been super successful recently, but shitting on a random team because you think yours is superior is everything wrong with sports lol the Celtics were absolute steamy dump level in the 90s but these kids are like 20 and only remember the 08 chip Bc of youtube clips."
"Beal [considered a trade request](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2946317-sources-bradley-beal-considering-trade-request-before-nba-draft) before the draft, and Tatum [commented a shamrock emoji](https://twitter.com/chrisgrenham/status/1419073552821669889) on an Insta post about the potential trade request. I don't think Beal's going to end up in Boston necessarily but there's been some smoke."
Is Bradley Beal S&amp;T to Celtics the new Giannis to Heat
*Team Cancer*  **PG** * Damian Lillard * Ben Simmons  **SG** * Bradley Beal * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **SF** * Kawhi Leonard * OG Anunoby  **PF** * Bam Adebayo * MPJ  **C** * Rudy Gobert * Steven Adams  **Reserves** * Patrick Beverley * Danny Green
"Lebron   KD  Giannis  Steph  Harden  Kawhi  Luka Donic  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum   For 14/15 I could care less  I just think that you’re comment about him needing to be top 5 when healthy to be top 15 is complete bs, if I read it right.  If we’re considering Kyrie a PG and James an SG now I hold heartedly believe Kyrie is probably the best SG in the league (yes over Bradley Beal)  He had an absolutely amazing season this year, 9 in points per game, 11th in PER, and is the 9th player to make the 50/40/90 club, he also was having a good playoff run before he went down, and yes I do think Nets take the chip if Kyrie is healthy.  The Nets are a top heavy team that prides themselves on having 3 players who can go off at any moment and are borderline unstoppable when they do, I’ve seen you say it’s best they trade Kyrie, and no offense, that’s BS too.  There aren’t 15 players in the nba better than Kyrie"
"definitely Bradley Beal, he too loyal lol"
Andrew Wiggins and Bradley Beal too
"&gt;It's like if a top scorer like Bradley Beal decided to average 40+ points every year regardless of effectiveness and how many shots they took, he should still be praised for physically being able to do it but that doesn't mean he's better than a 25 PPG scorer that plays better for team basketball.  So, I'm going to get hate for this, but Kobe?"
"Suddenly putting lebron in the same category as Bradley Beal a literal anti vaxxer is so unfair. He never promoted anything Beal said or agreed with it. Draymond’s argument was poor but his point of not being responsible for making anyone get vaccinated is valid. Lebron probably shouldn’t have co-signed it but it still doesn’t put him on Bradley beals level of spewing Twitter nonsense. Ultimately he just doesn’t want to be held responsible for anyone else’s decision to get vaccinated. It’s not some uncommon opinion, many NBA players feel the same way. Even the beloved Curry won’t publicly chastise Wiggins or say that everyone has to get vaccinated. Some things guys don’t want to get involved in and that’s fine because it’s ultimately not their job."
Why trade for Bradley Beal at all if he's gonna miss half of our games?
Why trade for Bradley Beal when we already have Bradley Beal on the team?!?
"The man hasn't even said a word about it like some players have (Bradley Beal, booker, Draymond). It's a bigger deal cause he won't be able to play home games if he's not vaxxed but people seem to believe he will at some point. And anyway this is the greatest roster the nets ever had. Fischer already said the nets never had any intention in even exploring a trade with kyrie it's not gonna happen so we'll just have to roll with it."
so are Michael Kidd Gilchrist and Bradley Beal
"Steven Adams too is 28, and younger than Bradley Beal"
I will go one step further and say that any team that trades for Bradley Beal is taking themselves out of championship contention
"A weird one that sticks out to me is that (from oldest to youngest) Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, Anthony Davis, and Bradley Beal are all 28 years old. Beal is the youngest of the four? And even moreso, Michael Kidd Gilchrist is younger than ALL OF THEM 😂"
"Still kind of surprising since they were drafted 4 years apart, but Mitchell just turned 25 while Giannis turns 27 in early December, so it's much closer to a full 2 years older than it is to 1 year older.   Damian Lillard being 3 years older than guys like Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal is something I find myself forgetting since they were all in the same draft class (Lillard was a 4-year college player while Davis and Beal were both one-and-done)."
*bradley beal looks on shocked*
Bradley Beal coming out as an anti-vaxxer
Bradley Beal in shambles.
"Bradley Beal. Everyone talks like he's one of the league's top players, but he ain't done shit except score a lot of points on losing teams."
&gt;Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving  There's another level in there where Kyrie has been a lot quieter than Bradley Beal but he has had a much worse impact since he is so much bigger as a personality.
That Bradley Beal logic.
He’s clearly trolling Bradley Beal here. C’mon guys.
Is this a jab on Bradley Beal or is Kyrie spreading his gospel?
Easily Dame. The fact that Bradley Beal has been on a ton of mediocre teams throughout much of his career and still hasn't even hinted at wanting out makes me think nothing is going to change there. Dame has also had made it as far as the WCF so I bet he has a much higher urge to get back there and beyond.
"Big named centers not named Anthony Davis(Jokic, Kat, Embiid, Bam), Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Westbrook, and CJ McCollum  Center position is just a valuable position anymore. The rest are just players I don't think do well in playoff series on a championship team."
"You think moreys being strategic because you’re a sixers fan and you have to believe that. If Bradley beal becomes available, why would the wizards want simmons? Why would they want late first round picks? How does that help them rebuild? They now have a player good enough in the regular season to elevate the team from being a true tanking team, and the picks they got don’t really help them either.   Morey just doesn’t want to “lose” a trade, so he’ll continue to lower simmons actual trade value, while thinking his trade value is still high."
"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer’s newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons’ availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly — and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season’s $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons’ absence: It’s ‘borderline kind of disrespectful’  The Sixers’ position that they’re not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They’re trying to win a championship, and believe they’re in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who’s in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren’t as blindsided by Simmons’ desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons’ trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons’ camp don’t believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they’re just determined to do it on their terms. Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta. Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta.YONG KIM / Staff Photographer Destined for a messy divorce  Publicly, the Sixers talk about wanting Simmons to return and be part of a championship team in Philly. The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has “run its course.”  “They know that,” a source said. “They’ve been known that. It doesn’t matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He’s going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.” Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can’t blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can’t blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  “But that doesn’t negate that the relationship is done,” another source said. “This is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That’s what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it’s not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.”  » READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers’ starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers’ tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons’ skills was more lovely, it’s hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers’ lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly’s steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn’t honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  “This entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,” a source said. “It’s not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It’s not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. …. It’s never been smooth at all.”  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player’s former team got worse. That’s something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid’s squad, not Simmons’ team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team’s go-to player.  “What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. “I’m just [speaking] facts. But because he’s Australian, because he’s a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.”"
"&gt;Word. I agree with you. That is irresponsible of MPJ.   He doesn't care because he keeps on talking about it which is doing more harm.  &gt;how do you feel about some others that have spoken out? Some guys have made thoughtful arguments. I would suspect that more will come.   Kyrie believes the Earth is flat...so anything he says is already invalid. Bradley Beal jokes about getting the vaccine and still getting covid, which is spreading misinformation about vaccines. So if he decides to become more informed then maybe he'll have something to stand on.  &gt;I’d be really interested to be a fly on the wall in conversations between the players Union and the league.  I wouldn't...if you're undedicated about a topic/field of study and have so much to say about it then you deserve not to be heard. You don't know better than the experts in that particular field, that's just facts."
"Watching him in the playoffs, I came away thinking he was kind of inconsistent. If he could work on that and improving his scoring in general and/or work on his defense, then he could be top 15.   I have him at 20  11.Damien Lillard   12.Jayson Tatum  13.Donovan Mitchell   14.Kyrie Irving   15.Chris Paul   16.Jimmy Butler  17.Trae Young  18.Paul George   19.Zach Lavine   20.Devin Booker  21.Bradley Beal   And you could even make the case that Beal is better than him. I don’t think he’s better than anyone in the top 15 personally. Even if you think he’s better than Chris Paul, there are still the players from 16-19 that have a case to be over him."
"Nothing there came from his mouth notice the word ""allegedly"" also that came from Sullivan who has a Hard on for kyrie and kd using them for clicks ever since kd cut him off. Wouldn't be surprised if a lot of that is largely exaggerated. Even then if he's doing all that, it might be stupid but he's not publically saying anything like Bradley Beal was or Devin booker was"
"I said some of the top stars and highest paid players. Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving are without question two huge stars in this league. Wiggins is one of the top 25 highest paid players. They all fit under the description of ""some of the biggest stars and highest paid players"".  If anyone is being disingenuous it's you who's saying ""Kyrie doesn't count cause he's weird"" or some shit like that haha. Thats the whole point of the discussion. These weird, super high paid, super popular stars are spreading potentially harmful knowledge to society."
"&gt;too many high-profile people who are against the vaccine  there are 2. Kyrie, and Bradley Beal.  Wiggins is high profile because hes a meme player who hasnt lived up to his potential. His impact on the court is pretty forgettable, and hes not a household name by any stretch of the imagination.    Please feel free to correct me if im actually forgetting a player of significance in the grand scheme of the current NBA landscape."
"Why'd you bring race into it? The person you replied to is *only* using quotes and comments that all these players have stated to further their argument. It just so happens that group A has all black players and group B is all white.  I can throw Lonnie Walker, KAT, and Bogdan Bogdanović into group B, just like I can throw Bradley Beal into group A. It has nothing to do with race, merely the comments that these people have all shared."
"He's a walking bucket with elite shooting efficiency. It's not hard to imagine him as a Bradley Beal type in the near future. His defense and BBIQ are flawed but at his age and offensive ceiling, I think you give him the bag and roll the dice."
"Kyrie Irving, Andrew Wiggins, and Bradley Beal are 3 of the top 25 highest paid players in the NBA and all 3 have been vocally anti vax"
"&gt;What doctors and other health experts have said is that getting the vaccine mitigates the risk of death or serious illness if you do get COVID. In short: you can still get COVID after getting vaccinated, but you have much less chance of winding up on a ventilator in ICU – or, in the morgue  The chances of Bradley Beal ending up in the ICU or in the morgue because of Covid are basically zero. He's far less likely to have either of those things happen to him than a vaccinated obese or elderly person.  &gt;Yes, as Beal noted, there are breakthrough cases of vaccinated people getting COVID. **But this is happening because so many people are still unvaccinated!** The Delta variant, as with all variants, is a mutated version of the original COVID-19 virus. Variants survive and evolve in populations of, primarily, unvaccinated groups – and then cascade, like the ocean water over the decks of the Titanic, weighing the whole ship down.  That's a bald faced lie.  Let me ask you this. How did we make it an entire year without this happening even though *nobody* was vaccinated?"
Just wanted to point out that Bradley Beal attended BLM protests https://images.app.goo.gl/ypg1FpHYgXjGL6on8
"Bradley beal and andrew Wiggins should have zero influence on any aspect of most people's lifes.  then again, if those two remain the only people on the planet who dont get vaccinated, we could just blame covid on them, and the issue would be solved"
Do they don't. They exist to extract the most value from the employer and protect all of it's members. Freaking Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving are not underrepresented.
"In **South East** I'd change Suggs and Hayward for LaMelo and Isaac to have:  Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Bam Adebayo.   In **South West** I'd change Thad Young for Dejounte Murray straight up.  In terms of rankings, I'd go:  1. **Pacific** \- LeBron, Steph and Kawhi is just too much. Especially with a rim-running big man and a lights-out shooter.  2. **North West** \- When the worst player in your lineup is Shai and you have elite shooting throughout, that's scary. 3. **Atlantic** \- my one concern here is that unless FVV develops it, there isn't really an elite playmaker in this lineup.  4. **South East** \- Massive firepower in Trae, LaMelo and Beal, and then you bank on there being enough defense from Isaac and Bam to cover it. Isaac and Beal won't be taking a shot.  5. **Central** \- Lots of talent in the lineup but the lack of versaility made me put them so low. Their 3-5 can't really shoot from the perimeter. 6. **South West** \- Honestly, just the last talent?"
Facts Kyrie hasn't even publicly said anything anti Vax unlike Bradley Beal but Kyrie is at the face of this whole thing
"you can find a correlation looking at local vaccination rates, COVID case counts, ER &amp; ICU capacity etc. and pretty easily figure out that there are areas of the country where people are steadfast in refusing the vaccine.  If seeing 3/4 of a million people die in the US isn't convincing enough to change behavior for the greater good &amp; get a vaccine, I don't think it's a stretch to count a bunch of these bozos in the ""never going to get it"" category.  There's always a new reason or excuse why people haven't or shouldn't yet, and it's always bullshit, so excuse me for feeling like stone cold idiots like MPJ, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac or the Q-Anoners that drink horse medicine to own the libs don't deserve an ounce of my patience or compassion.  If you don't like that, feel free to downvote me and scroll the fuck on."
"I just don't see what this subs reaction has to do with any players actually getting the shot. These are a small group of hard headed uber wealthy individuals, not someone's old uninformed uncle. Bradley Beal isn't being a contrarian to r/NBA, or any of us, he's being a contrarian to information that was around months ago. That time has passed. These people aren't going to get vaccinated even if the entire internet and press left them alone, they would stop thinking about it entirely. People going overboard on Reddit is not impacting them, and yes I know some comments go way too far.  Measures like what the post describes and financial penalty are all we have left for NBA players."
Follow up tweet:  &gt;[The NBA and NBPA agreed on continuing stringent regulations for unvaccinated players this season. The opening news cycle of training camps focused on a few star players -- such as Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal -- who had come to camp unvaccinated.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1443687542088421376?s=21)
"If Giannis had the opportunity to take the vaccine the day before game 6 of the NBA Finals, I would understand him declining on that specific day. If Bradley Beal had the same opportunity, I would ask him why he cares about a game he's not playing in."
He could make extra cash selling Bradley Beal branded lab equipment (and caskets) to aid those who are doing their own research.
Hmm educate and Bradley Beal in the same sentence
Bradley Beal and educate don't belong in the same sentence  Fuck Bradley Beal
Also Bradley Beal   &gt; *googles “no vaccine mandate baseball”*
Drew Hanlen and Bradley Beal really molded the perfect mentality in that young man.
"I guess I see what you're trying to say, but COVID and vaccinations are such huge issues with such huge potential for misuse and harm that it's perfectly reasonable to scream about it everytime this idiot opens his mouth. I just disagree that nothing of value comes from calling out dangerous misinformation wherever it is found.  Everyone who reads anything about Bradley Beal from now until the end of time needs to know that he's such a huge idiot that he didn't make the reasonable and obvious decision to get vaccinated. Nobody should listen to anything he has to say on anything that requires enough intelligence to make that simple decision, including owning a sports team. It will always be okay to remind people of that and to make fun of him for being such a huge fucking idiot"
Is Bradley Beal kinda dumb? He tries to pass off basic ideas as wisdom.
"It's only the most significant event of the last decade or so that has left millions of people dead. For sure, let's talk about something else because we wouldn't want to ""pile on"" a bunch of idiots with huge influences because it will ruin sports subs.   Fuck Bradley Beal and anyone else who repeats with this anti-vax nonsense. It will always be okay to pile on this idiot for being an idiot because his actions are causing harm"
1. Julius Randle  2. Bradley Beal  3. Kevin Porter Jr
Free Bradley Beal from the vaccinated cult haters.💯
"[NBC Sports] Bradley Beal considers avoiding the Covid vaccine a long-term goal ""It's all about having the freedom and having the natural immunity, and knowing what you're doing how to operate your body. I've tried to educate myself on and something I definitely could see myself being a part of in the future."""
"It's only really been that way since 2011. And even then it was pretty much only that way where LeBron went cause he could get anyone he wanted. I can't remember any other situation between LeBron going to Miami and then back to Cleveland where a star player had the amount of power they have today.  Add to that the CBA changes (bird rights increasing your salary significantly), and the new TV deal might have had a part to do with that as well.  It's important to differentiate a situation where a player wants to win and isn't getting help, so he leaves as a free agent (again, LeBron) and a situation where a player chooses financial security (Bradley Beal).  This is a recent thing. As I said before and as you said now, players should be able to leave if they're unhappy. My problem is not them requesting the trade, but it's the way they're doing it. That was apparent during the AD situation and especially so with Harden.  The differences being the Pelicans put AD on the bench even though he wanted to play, they messed with the Lakers (apparently they leaked proposed trades? I remember the whole 'not negotiating in good faith' thing Magic said) but they also knew AD had one more year. The smart thing to do is wait until the summer which is exactly what they did. The only thing that 'irked' me about AD is he basically said ""I wanna go to the Lakers"" without ever really saying it out loud.  Harden just shat on everyone to get out. And as I said before, the owners will not and do not like that. There could be a possibility where they lock out the players until this issue is fixed in their eyes, but I have no idea what they might want."
Weren’t the Celtics the 2nd seed that year? Considering Bradley Beal and Westbrook were the 8th seed this past year I think he deserves a touch of credit
"Drafts were all torn between Thomas Robinson, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Bradley Beal. Two dudes out of the league and a multiple all star"
Bradley beal would be my best pick.
"&gt; Trying to reason with them is better than saying “you’re a fucking idiot” in my eyes.  You know who tried to reason with them? Scientist and researchers who actually put in the work creating, RnD and produce vaccines. But apparently, anti-vax people are too good for that.  You've been babying them throughout this thread saying they can do as much research from their phone despite their dumbass choosing to ignore the credible ones. Hell, you out here thinking Johnathan Isaac is right lmao.  Oh I'll feel good about it. I may not be smarter than them (since there are a lot of educated people even at unis who are anti-vax), but I'll feel good I don't fall for conspiracy shit because I wasnt dropped as a baby.  &gt; So yea I’d say my way is better since it’s more likely to get them vaccinated, which is what we want isn’t it?  Imo, there are healthy skeptics, which fine, educate them cause they are willing to listen. But we still have dumbass like Bradley ""why are you still getting COVID?"" Beal who could easily, you know, listened to experts. (he's not anti-vaxx but just a dude making dumb, uneducated comments)."
Bradley Beal has entered the conversation. It’s really been disappointing being let down by these guys. Used to love Wiggins and Beal and now I would love to never have to hear about them again.
"Oh my god. This is more important news than Bradley Beal professing his undying love to mediocrity and anti-vaxxing. We, the Lakers fans should hold a protest outside Staples in light of this new atrocity that crushed millions of souls across LA and Laker fans worldwide."
"Full quote:  I stand with Kyrie Irving.   I stand with Andrew Wiggins.  I stand with Bradley Beal.  I stand with Jonathan Isaac.  #NBA  #YourBodyYourChoice  2/x I’ve never said this before: I agree with @KingJames   “We’re talking about people’s bodies and well-being. I don’t think I personally should get involved in what other people should do for their bodies and livelihoods.”  3/x @KingJames is being courageous here.  With his box-office power, he could be even more courageous—he could SOLVE the problem—by saying:  “I stand w/ my fellow players. And I won’t play in any arena that bans another NBA player because they make a personal healthcare choice."""
Imagine the eradicated ones coming back like small pox coz of morons like Bradley Beal and Dwight Howard.
"No expert, I repeat no expert, or even educated person is saying it’s 100% effective. Almost every single person I see that takes the stance of not getting vaxxed tends to start with this argument. You, Bradley Beal, and others. Just because it’s not 100% effective doesn’t mean it’s 0% effective. Context man"
"Not Jonathan Isaacs or Bradley Beal, they’re  one of the good ones!"
"[He asks questions because he's too lazy to ask Google, doesn't he](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/vaccines-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-key-facts)?  Let me get this off the table:  * most Western governments screwed up with the planning and maintenance of pandemic plans, they fumbled the first measures against covid and they rushed the re-openings to please businesses. Moreover, economic relief has been mainly given to those who need the least.  * people showed how petty and egotistical they can we can, refusing to wear masks, to quarantine when sick, forging vaccination status certifications etc etc  * many physicians and researchers lost their credibility in an power-hungry bandwagon jumping dictated by the chances of career advancement.  But I highly doubt that virology, immunology and pharmacology could be exposed by Bradley Beal, ffs.  He asks stupid and over-asked questions. A general practitioner could have answered him."
And I have commented!  Bradley Beal is very capable of finding out the answers to these questions.  This is on him
"I like Bradley Beal and find him to be a likable speaker, but he is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is here. Not to mention, his big question is googleable."
take me back to 2017 John Wall all NBA Bradley Beal 23 PPG first ever Otto Porter could still play and Gortat
So Bradley Beal is just Superspreader Ben Simmons?
[Washington Wizards Star Bradley Beal : Why are the vaccinated still getting COVID?](https://youtu.be/rIwNkfg-njw)
"Well at least he is vaccinated. Not the same tier of stupid as Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving or Ben Simmons."
I better not see seatbelts infringing the personal choice of Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal on the competitive nature between him and vaccines: ""I know they’re looking to destroy me. Likewise, I'm looking to destroy them."""
You’d think guys making millions of dollars playing a game of statistics would have an elementary understanding of them. But then you get Bradley Beal
"Seeee?!?  - Bradley Beal, probably"
"If Bradley Beal tore his ACL, would it take him 9-10 months to “gather information from the Wizards medical team and others in the organization” before he drew a conclusion?  If he got gonorrhea, would he need to take months and months of “doing his own research,” or would he just take the shot of PCN or Rocephin immediately at the recommendation of his doctors?"
"Good on him to do the right thing for himself and those around him. Meanwhile Bradley Beal is happy with putting all of his teammates at risk because ""you can still get COVID after you get the vaccine""."
&gt; I would ask the question to those who are getting vaccinated 'why are you still getting COVID?' - Bradley Beal
Smart guy Lonnie Walker (UMiami)  Dumb guys JI and Bradley Beal (FSU and UF)  I did make the right choice!
Bradley Beal was also uttering complete nonsense
I would ask the question to Bradley Beal 'why haven't you got out of the second round yet?' and see how he would react to someone pretending to know more than him about his line of business.
I understand that but that’s not what people are talking about. Once a story comes out about someone not wanting to be vaccinated they get attacked like nothing I’ve ever seen on this sub before. I saw several comments degrading Bradley Beal on another thread.
For sure the team without Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving. I also heard that Bron is anti vaxxer that he just took the vaxx to protect his image.
I can't play basketball and have to retire on the millions I've earned due to a statistically low bad reaction to the vaccine &gt; killing someone's grandma  At least according to Bradley Beal.
So 90% of the might not play  -Bradley Beal probably
Bradley Beal = Really Bad
This is like that Bradley Beal argument where he was like so why are vaccinated people still getting covid huh?!?!  Bro anyone can get injured but it’s a fact that being overweight increases the odds  I don’t even think he has some shredded legs either to protect his tendons it’s mostly upper body mass but I could be wrong about that never seen his thighs or calves
WHAT IS THIS RESEARCH THESE PEOPLE CLAIM TO DO??? Is it just googling: “risks covid-19 vaccine“? Do they just read facebook comments on what karen claims to know from her best friend jessicas masseuse? I just imagine bradley beal sitting at home like: “thank you for your explanation Dr. Fauci but have you considered mRNA sounding a lot like DNA? Is there any proof against it?“
Bradley Beal the type of guy to play Russian roulette with a glock
"You know, I'm something of an idiot myself    - Bradley Beal Osborn"
"A reporter for WUSA9 in DC said that after Bradley Beal did his media availability today Beal told him off mic “What if I get the vaccine and my arm stops working and I can’t shoot?”  If the greatest shooter of all time and the guy that beat you for the scoring title last season got the vaccine, then there’s no excuse for any of these shooters being anti-vax  Link to WUSA9 story - https://youtu.be/EVjGq0sMzk8"
"This is a legitimate argument. Covid is not going to kill bradley beal, so he doesn't need the vaccine.  It's great if someone wants to get it. And if you don't, that's fine too"
"Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, Michael Porter Jr,  Jonathan Isaac with Josh Richardson as the 6th man."
*Bradley Beal has entered the chat
“I a total fucking idiot” - Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal has entered the chat.
"The problem is that even if 90% of the league is vaccinated, it seems as though the majority of the 10% unvaccinated are the main guys on teams.   It doesn't matter if Joe Random and every other bench player is vaccinated, if someone like Wiggins, Kyrie, or Bradley Beal are out there spouting off about anti-vax stuff and whatnot refusing to get the vaccine, rather they like it or not, they're gonna be seen as speaking for the majority of players/the NBA and the main focus will be on them over the 12 other guys on the roster that **are** vaccinated."
wtf i hate bradley beal now
Bradley Beal isn’t vaccinated.
Hey I'm hoping the same thing happens after Bradley Beal says he's not getting it
That you Bradley Beal?
"Yeah I just saw the fucking headlines about Bradley Beal and his decision   ""But what about the people getting covid that are vaccinated?"""
"Yeah, but what about what Bradley Beal said?!"
"Bradley Beal is overrated and I don't understand why teams would want to trade for him. His contract is too much and he just puts up empty stats. He's better off just staying in Washington, dropping 60 on 55% shooting in a 20 point loss."
"Okay I mis spoke with fan favorite. No one outside of regular NBA fans know Bradley Beal, not even casual fans.   I didn’t imply nothing should be said about Beal. He’s a dumbass as well IMO.   Kyrie continues to push his bullshit excuses about standing for some cause so he gets the attention. It’s only natural. When you blatantly lie about standing for something when you clearly aren’t it attracts more scrutiny.  It’s super obvious that Beal is just some anti vax idiot so at least people have an honest view of where he’s at.   But you’re incoherent ramblings about this being some conspiracy against Kyrie are asinine at best and an attempt at throwing the blame somewhere else at worst"
Bradley Beal as well  Outside of Beal tho that team would spend a lot of time on IR even if it weren’t for health and safety protocol
"Fuck Bradley Beal. He and his wife are stupid fucking morons who endanger those around them and prolong the pandemic. And fuck Washington DC and the Wizards for being unwilling to take a stronger stance against Beal’s stupid, selfish, reckless, uninformed decision.  There, does that make you feel better?"
Bradley Beal is on the goddamn court two days ago and openly against the vax and people haven’t had anywhere near this same damn energy. Players are on the court not getting the shot playing against players from different cities but we are worried about the player that’s not getting the shot and not even playing because of his city mandate.    The outrage is fake and most of it is simply because people hate Kyrie while Beal is running around games RIGHT NoW with no shot. Just be honest about this situation that it’s people upset Kyrie will waste losing money over the vaccine or because you simply don’t like him.
BRADLEY BEAL  He is and still openly anti vaccine as is his wife or girlfriend and he’s openly tried to convince others not to get it.  He played in a game two days ago and played 29 minutes. There are players that don’t have the shot in certain cities they just have to get extra rules so they can get cleared.  That’s why a lot of this Kyrie outrage is so fake. It’s about the money and people just generally not liking Kyrie. Johnathan Issac if his brittle ass could play would be playing without the vaccine
OKC's whole treasure trove + a Bradley Beal-level star.
Bradley Beal on the 76ers would be good fit especially take some of the load off Joel
"People are mad at Kyrie because he’s so fucking entrenched that millions of dollars aren’t swaying him and it’s very loud and incredibly glaring. People think Bradley Beal is a fucking asshole as well, but the light of that one isn’t in our eyes.  People are also annoyed because of the absolute privilege it takes to turn down several million dollars over a shot that most of the country has taken is absolutely overwhelming. It’s an amount of money that would change anyone of our lives. Fuck, 1% of the amount of money he’s up to lose, counting the extension would fundamentally improve any of our lives. Yet he says ‘fuck it’."
"I’m vaccinated -VOLUNTARILY 6 months ago- and I still support his decision. Is there some rule now that if you’re famous you HAVE to vaccinated and perform your job for everyone around you? If he doesn’t want to get vaccinated it’s his choice, it’s not really that radical. The media and everyone here are the unhinged ones IMO trying to peer pressure him into doing it.   If you get vaccinated, and avoid people who aren’t vaccinated, why are you all so butthurt?  Where’s the Bradley Beal hate at?   Also, most importantly, where’s the hate for every franchise in the NBA. This is 2 cities in the country causing this issue. NYC and San Francisco. The NBA is just following the rules of their franchise host cities. If it’s SO OBVIOUS Kyrie is an asshole who should have a vaccine, why aren’t you all mad at the NBA for not making it a league requirement?"
Social media and the internet as a whole is a fucking toxic ass place regardless of where you stand on any topic.  Just seems less likely you actually give a fuck if people are vaccinated for the health of everyone if coming from a place of hostility.  Also the approach depends on how people feel about you in general anyway see how Johnathan Issac and Bradley Beal were openly anti vax and disrespectful to medical workers but Irving is enemy number one for the media.  All this shit is narratives and selective but keep up the good fight
"Careful bro, your casual is showing. “Something he does every season and gets his teams absolutely nowhere with?” This is the quickest way of you telling me you don’t watch Westbrook games at all hahaha, I shouldn’t even bother with this argument since you are so incompetent when it comes to basketball knowledge. 75% of games where Westbrook gets a triple double, his team ends up winning. How the fuck is that ‘meaningless stat padding’ when it literally wins his teams games? He also carried that Wizards team last season to the playoffs, something that Bradley Beal couldn’t do which you completely ignored because you have no counter argument for it. Just stop trying dude, go watch some Steph Curry highlights since that’s the only basketball thing you have any knowledge on."
Russ has prioritized stats over everything for most of his career......... He can't hide from them when they're inconvenient.  Nobody is taking about Bradley Beal bombing because he isn't a stat padder
The wizards are trash and will lose Bradley Beal after getting washed this year. It’s a shame the wizards keep doing “just enough” to keep him invested but not enough to truly build a winner.
No one cares about what Bradley Beal is doing because his team isn't going anywhere
"No because if they did we’d be hearing more shit about Bradley Beal (and maybe Jonathan Isaacs but he doesn’t have the star power of the other two)  Marks and the Nets are Kyrie’s employers, they are following a city mandate which is why they’re responding to him and media"
I won’t dispute that.. but they were the 9th seed playing in the play in game the season before he got there. They ended up in pretty much the same place. And that Wizards team didn’t have Bradley Beal.
"Telling it like it is man. To make a comparison, they're crucifying you for drafting Jordan Clarkson instead of Michael Jordan when the guys before you drafted Bradley Beal instead of Michael Jordan and that's totally okay for some reason."
Bradley beal plays for the Wizards
Bradley Beal literally shot 1-11 TODAY but you don’t hear a thing about it. Russ is not the only star player having an ass preseason
Bradley Beal averaged 31ppg lmao wtf are u talm bout
He had Bradley fucking Beal who nearly lead the league in points for the second year in a row.
Bradley Beal / DeMar DeRozan works better just in terms of caliber of player because its just pretty disrespectful to KD to compare him to Melo.   There isn't a modern player exactly like Melo though.
Beal eats a what? What is Bradley Beal eating??
"Simmons for Bradley Beal, straight up"
How do you feel about Bradley Beal?  Bradley Beal is a better scorer than peak Carmelo.
Wrong - Jan Vessely Right - Bradley Beal
Leave KD out of this. He’s not the spokesperson of the medical world to get anyone vaccinated. It’s not his job.  Literally every player has said almost the same thing.  Bradley Beal at SF  Tingus Pingus also seems harsh. It’s not his fault the Mavs entire offense is just “Luka and Pray”
"Cunningham: Larry Bird, OJ Mayo  Green: Bradley Beal, OJ Mayo  Mobley: Kevin Garnett, Marvin Bagley  Barnes: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Julian Wright  Suggs: Chris Paul, Coby White"
Most orgs that feel this way don’t have pieces that move the needle for philly. In Washington’s case they’d rather suck with Bradley Beal than suck with Ben Simmons since brad doesn’t wanna leave
"&gt;The entire argument is they need Russ who had a negative net rating without Beal last season so the Lakers can rest LeBron and AD   It's not.   Net rating numbers are going to be terrible for players on bad teams, especially ones with bad defence.   Bradley Beal had only one year with positive net rating in his 10 year career, one season being 2016-2017. Would any NBA GMs say 'We don't want to bring Bradley Beal because he has a negative net rating?'  You're just looking at a single number without any context.    &gt;If LeBron AD miss 65+ combined games the Lakers will be fighting for the play in again.  That's why they brought a guy who can take ball handling duty from LeBron, so that LeBron's chances of getting injured goes down? How are you not getting this?"
Bradley Beal
"Jonathan Isaac, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, ... yeah you get the idea"
"I fully agree with you, and I also don't want to let fools like Jaylen Brown and Bradley Beal off the hook."
"I only added rozier bc I wasn’t sure if he was the point guard for the hornets or not bc I don’t really watch too much hornets and the ones I watched had Lamelo coming off the bench. Also I put in Dejounte and Lonzo as a debatable choice. I think dejounte is actually pretty close to DLO offensively while being miles ahead defensively so that’s my argument. I think Lonzo is worse than dejounte but he’s up there too. Still none of those guys are definitively better. The 15 I listed are and that’s the whole point. He’s worse than the 15. Just bc I’m saying he’s a below average starting point guard doesn’t mean he’s a below average player. Almost every starting point guard is an above average nba player. Like let’s say Lowry is an average starting point guard, he’s still an elite player. Don’t be too caught up with the word average. Like I could say sabonis is a below average all star and Bradley Beal is an average all star, that doesn’t mean sabonis is below average player or Beal is just an average player"
Why do they have to be in win now mode? What if the pels decide to deal Ingram and picks for beal to appease Zion? What if the mavs managed to get enough assets?   There’s plenty of teams that can make a competitive package for Bradley Beal

Bradley Beal is a wing?
Bradley Beal is a good bet. Flamethrower scorer as the only option on a bad high paced team. That’s a recipe for a couple 60+ pt games
"Probably because at this point its a pattern of stupidity with Kyrie. That said, Bradley Beal and Issac do deserve some heat."
I’m pretty sure Bradley Beal can still play home games.
It's weird how little heat Bradley Beal has gotten over all of this
Bradley Beal should get booed way louder considering he's actually publicly anti-vaxx. Kyrie is just privately not getting it (as of now)
Bradley Beal didnt spread any misinformation. He pointed out that the vaccine does not make you immune to covid. That is a factual statement that cannot be argued.
"A lot of Warriors fans lack patience for developing players. Half of the sub was screaming for the front office to trade Wiggins, Wiseman, and picks for Bradley Beal."
I’m not a dumbass bro I watch the league I know Alex Caruso earned his check as a consistent role player and Bulls fans are excited that they built a playoff team around Lavine. I also know that the Wiz fuckin suuuuuck and Bradley Beal isn’t going to make Kuz look like an NBA starter if Lebron couldn’t. Eat a dick
Where they going to trade for Bradley beal?
Ben Simmons &gt; Bradley Beal
I guess that’s true. Guys like Bradley Beal are actually spreading misinformation and saying that the vaccine doesn’t work. Kyrie has just said he’ll keep it private (which anybody with half a brain can infer means that he’s not taken it)
"Bradley Beal gonna be like “exhibit A, I rest my case”."

Tbf I think the Warriors make a trade mid season if they are hovering around 500.  There’s no all star type of player available right now but the nba changes fast.  One more star (let’s say Bradley Beal) on this Warriors team and they instantly become real threats come playoff time.  Steph / Beal / Klay / Otto / Draymond 😨
"&gt;Philadelphia 76ers receive: Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal  finally, a realistic trade"
"kyrie has said nothing about the vaccine to the media, unlike bradley beal and jonathan isaac"
My point is people don't really care about all lives when it comes to being vaccinated.  Kyrie the only player getting discussed. Because he plays on the Brooklyn Nets and has a chance for a championship.  Bradley Beal life doesn't matter despite being in the same situation as Kyrie. Same for the other lesser known players.  Kyrie is the face for a virus that doesn't care how famous you are.

It's because Kyrie was already one of the most hated players on here lol  Bradley Beal is a weird player in that he averages like 30 PPG and no one really cares about him either way anyway
bradley beal for clown takes
Bradley Beal is catching no heat for outwardly being anti vaxx. Kyrie is getting all of the hate despite not even saying anything publicly about it

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"Yeah this sub is full of self important basesment dwellers who just want to jack themselves off for having ""superior intelligence"" for buying into MSM and Social Media fear mongering.  Like when Bradley Beal said ""the vaccine doesnt stop transmission"" and everyone called that misinformation. Even though its the literal truth. If it doesnt stop transmission, then it doesnt stop transmission. You cant really argue that as a fact. But somehow its labeled ""misinformation"""

That's not even my point, I'm clearly saying he isn't worth them  Dude it's not an opinion it's a fact. they have never won an mvp award or even finished top 3 for it. Hell even beal doesn't think he's one. My point was you said he wasn't worth an all star which isn't true Houston was going to trade Harden to the sixers if they decided to send simmons and another player/ pick but Morey decided to be stubborn. We can go on and on about it but you're grasping at straws.

I did take into consideration his playoff which is why I said teams view him as a mental midget at this point but again that doesn't mean he can't improve. He is in year 4 and you're talking about what's fantasy when I have shown you the only thing stopping Simmons from using his potential is himself. Like what are you even talking about at this point"
In what sense? If I'm not mistaken Bradley Beal was actually premed at Florida before he left for the NBA.  A 4.0 GPA kind of guy. I don't think in a standard measure of intellect he'd score low. Although his non vaccination status is rather stupid.

"Bradley ""despite the loss"" Beal starting as he means to continue early this season."
Man Warriors are loaded for the future.  Wiseman is the next AD/Giannis  They got the next Kawhi in Kuminga  Poole is a young Bradley Beal  Moody is Middleton 2.0  &amp;nbsp;   Scary hours in the Bay area! So stacked even after letting Paschall (next Draymond) and Smailagic (mini Jokic) go
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
Bradley Beal is his ceiling
"Levert is an inaugural member of the Sneaky Old Club, alongside Pascal ""Older Than Andrew Wiggins"" Siakam and Dame ""Same Draft As Bradley Beal"" Lillard"
"Lakers superstar LeBron James recently said that it is everyone’s personal decision whether or not to get the vaccine. Those comments didn’t sit well with Abdul-Jabbar.  “I’m a huge fan of LeBron James, both as one of the greatest basketball players ever and as a humanitarian who cares about social injustice,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar on his Substack. I have written his praises many times in the past and undoubtedly will in the future. I admire him and have affection for him. But this time LeBron is just plain wrong — and his being wrong could be deadly, especially to the Black community.”  James, 36, commended Golden State Warriors titan Draymond Green over a powerful statement he shared about the vaccine, which also promoted personal choice.  However, Abdul-Jabbar was not fond of James signing off on the comments from Green.  “After Golden State Warrior Andrew Wiggins received criticism for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine for personal reasons, his teammate Draymond Green said the public needs to ‘honor’ that decision: ‘There is something to be said for people’s concerns about something that’s being pressed so hard,’ he stated,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar. “‘Why are you pressing this so hard? You have to honor people’s feelings and their own personal beliefs.’ To which LeBron responded that he ‘couldn’t have said it better myself.’ Actually, it couldn’t have been said worse.  “On the surface, it appears that Draymond and LeBron are arguing for the American ideal of individual freedom of choice. But they offer no arguments in support of it, nor do they define the limits of when one person’s choice is harmful to the community. They are merely shouting, ‘I’m for freedom.’ We’re all for freedom, but not at the expense of others nor if it damages the country. That’s why we mandate seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, car insurance, education for our children. For example, seatbelt compliance is at 88% in the U.S., but that 12% that doesn’t comply results in 47% of car accident fatalities (17,000) and costs U.S. employers $5 billion a year, and those costs are passed on to us. They made the choice, but we survivors are left to deal with the grief and the price tag.”  The NBA icon also bashed Washington Wizards star Bradley Beal for his poor reasoning on not getting vaccinated. Abdul-Jabbar took the time to rip apart Green’s logic as well.  “The only support for Draymond’s statement is his belief that when people ‘press hard’ there’s something inherently wrong with their opinion,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar. “There is no logic to that statement. If I press hard against institutional racism, if I press hard against police brutality, if I press hard against recent laws making it harder for minorities to vote, if I press hard against child porn, if I press hard in support of MeToo am I automatically wrong? On the contrary, the passion of those urging vaccines might suggest there’s some urgency to their opinion. That the situation is serious and we need to take immediate action to protect people. That thousands are dying every day, mostly among the unvaccinated. That the Black community, where vaccine hesitancy is high, are dying at a disproportionately higher rate than whites. That publicly talking about honoring opinions that contribute to their deaths is irresponsible.  “The country also mandates against drunk driving, ‘pressing hard’ against the freedom to drive under the influence.  We do that because drunk driving kills 11,000 Americans every year and costs us more than $44 billion dollars. Vaccine deniers and those who want to ‘honor’ them are like drunk drivers who are convinced they’re okay to drive. When they make it home without an accident, that means they were right. Until they aren’t. Which is why 97% of COVID deaths are among the unvaccinated.”  The 74-year-old closed out his piece by sharing a strong analogy, putting the onus on celebrities to help spearhead the rescue mission within the pandemic.  “I think of the situation like those old fire brigades when people stood in a line passing buckets of water to save their neighbor’s house from burning to the ground,” wrote Abdul-Jabbar. “Maybe some people were afraid to join the line. But when the town leaders joined in, it encouraged others to do their duty. Today’s celebrities and athletes are like those town leaders. You either join the line to save your neighbor’s home, or you stand by and let it burn because you don’t owe them anything.”  While Abdul-Jabbar is extremely adored in NBA circles by his colleagues, he may receive some flack for going against some of today’s faces of the league. He recently spoke about the possibility of James surpassing him on the all-time scoring list."
"&gt;Who is the best **shooting guard** in the NBA?  &gt;1. James Harden, Brooklyn – 63% 2. Devin Booker, Phoenix – 17% 3. Luka Doncic, Dallas – 10% &gt; Also receiving votes: Bradley Beal, Washington; Stephen Curry, Golden State; **Kevin Durant, Brooklyn**  Um, excuse me? KD hasn't played at the 2 since Seattle..."
Bigger Bradley Beal who's a defensive force...so an elite two-way player who can score on all levels and has the size to guard multiple positions. That's goddamn Kawhi Leonard
I still can’t believe he was the highest paid player on the same team as Wall and Bradley Beal lmao
"Some 130 miles to the northeast there’s a tall, fairly young Australian who would be glad to be traded for Bradley Beal."
I think because of Ben Simmons and Kyrie Irving we will see the Owners try to force some kind of accountability on the Players under contract who demand a trade or flake on the organization.   Idk what it’ll be and I’m sure the NBAPA will fight it but I can’t see how it will continue as is. Owners could lockout the Players and it’s Billionaires w/ unlimited time as an Owner vs Millionaires w/ a limited playing career.   Believe this current CBA lasts until 2023-24 so Zion would be 1-2yrs into the next contract.   Only way I think it makes sense is to eliminate the Restricted Free Agency after the Rookie contract. Make it so the Rookie deals are the full 5yrs and then Players hit Unrestricted Free Agency vs the 4yrs and RFA or being forced to take the Qualifying Offer in the 5th season to be free.   If you remove the RFA then Players will only be with the Drafted team for 5yrs instead of the 8yrs they would between their Rookie and Restricted Free Agency contracts. That should also force teams to get their shit together and not tank season after season.   Ben Simmons wouldn’t be on the 76ers if he was free to leave before the contract extension. He was essentially forced to take because he wouldn’t have the freedom to choose his team until he was like 27yrs old.   Teams would still be able to offer the 5yr vs 4yr contracts and potential Super-Max deals vs the standard deals in Free Agency.   Still wouldn’t help the Nets in the Kyrie situation since he’s just a full on Anti-Vax Flake who chose the Nets as a Free Agent vs being forced to play somewhere he didn’t choose.   As a Nets fan I’m starting to think when Kyrie flaked on the Nets last January it was because the Far Right failed to overthrow Democracy.   Kyrie had every chance to speak out against these clowns like Bradley Beal did but he remains silent. If he doesn’t speak out against the people using his name then he must stand with them. Funny since those are the same people who cheer on the cops after they murder minorities.

"&gt; top 25 player  In my perspective, a Top 25-30 player are players who are good enough to be the #1 option of any team so in my eyes a Top 30 player is someone more or less of a shooter.

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
They should Trade Russell for Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, and MPJ : “He’s correct”"
"6’1-6’2 with a 6’6 wingspan is not some insurmountable obstacle, especially if he continues to build strength. Bradley Beal, Lowry/FVV, McCollum are all starting all-star caliber SGs in this league, and Sexton is longer than all of them."
"Here's an article with 22 games into season with the Wizards with 4th best offense  https://www.bulletsforever.com/2019/12/9/21001312/washington-wizards-first-quarter-nba-season-analysis-offense-defense-bradley-beal-davis-bertans  Their offensive rating prior to the bubble was 115.6 (https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2020_games.html).  I can't tell you the relative rankings but it was elite at that point of the season.    That would have been good enough for 2nd in the NBA that season (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_ratings.html(  Again, bubble ball without Beal and Bertans really hurt their overall offensive rating to close the season- their offensive rating in that time span was 103.85."
"This would have to be a deal that gets done in the off-season, if Bradley Beal says he wants to sign with the Celtics. Theoretically, Tatum, Beal, and Simmons fits together better than Tatum, Beal,and Brown, especially if the Celtics have 4-5 76ers Draft picks they can flip to surround them with a good supporting cast.   Even then, I still wouldn't deal Brown for Simmons. Brown is one of my favorite players in the league, and he's way, way better in a vacuum than Simmons."
"The only way this makes any sense is if the Celtics knew for certain that they could get Bradley Beal in free agency. Simmons would work better next to Beal and Tatum than Brown would. Even then, I'm not sure this makes any sense though, and it'd be so, so risky to bank on Beal leaving the Wizards. DC is playing pretty well this season.   Theoretically, Tatum, Simmons, and Beal would be a deadly squad though, particularly since they could use the 4-5 draft picks from the 76ers to find role players. The big issue would be why would the Celtics do that deal now instead of this off-season, once they know they can get Beal?"
They had the 2nd best offense at one point in the 2019-20 season-  I believe bubble ball without Beal tanked that rating.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/11/25/20981578/washington-wizards-bradley-beal-second-best-offense
How about we acknowledge the 4 winning seasons and 1 0.500 season Bradley Beal already had lmao
"&gt; For the first time in his career, Bradley Beal is able to lead a team to a good record.  How about we wait until at least all star break?"
This is bullshit ainge said he wouldnt trade brown for Bradley Beal
It depends on if Boston is confident in getting Bradley Beal in the offseason. If they are then it makes alot of sense for boston to think about a trio of Ben Tatum and Beal vs Brown Tatum Beal.

A great Bradley Beal - as in ""better than a top 15-20 player"" - is much better than Simmons. 2. Giannis is a PF, he needs to be good defensively.

Have you watched the Bucks at all? We have 4 starters out every damn game, what even is that argument? And even if it didn't, we just won a ring, they don't care about the regular season and the sample size is 9 games..."
"&gt;Yeah, he fucked up even worse this time, but pretending this is the first time he's shown he's not someone you can win with is a joke.  I mean I'm pretty critical of Ben.  My flair on the 76ers subreddit is literally making fun of him.  But he's a 3x all star.  He was an all-star last year.  He was second in DPOTY last year.    I think some people forget... the 76ers went to game 7 against the Raptors(who went on to win the championship), simply due to a triple bounce 3 pointer by Kawhi that was 100% a travel.  He has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that you can win a championship with him, that year alone.  Anyone who says otherwise is forgetting that year.  &gt;Dame's slump which has literally been 2 weeks long to the issues Simmons has been having in the league since forever and saying both are recency bias?  Dame has been a first or second round exit every year but one in the NBA.  That is a long sample size.  Has shot 40%+ from 3 1 year.  Has shot 37%+ from 3 like 30% of years.  Those are long sample sizes.  Dame hasn't shown he's capable of winning a championship... and unlike Ben he's not a 24 year old.  &gt; Dame is a top 10 player. Dame can carry an offense by himself. Dame is a PG who is bad defensively, but because he's a PG, it doesn't matter much. He can win a championship next to Embiid and actually be better than him for a whole series.  Dame is not a top 10 player, and if you think he is, I question your knowledge of basketball.  If you want to say top 10 offensive player, there's an argument to be had.  Top 10 overall?  Not even close.  &gt;Dame can carry an offense by himself.   Yes this makes him suited to 8 seed first round exit teams.  He's a great Bradley Beal.  But he has never shown the ability to actually be good enough on both defense and offense to carry a team(something a guy like Giannis does for instance... which is why they aren't even CLOSE to the same level of player).  Top 10 players can generally wreck the game from either end of the floor.  Or they are crazy efficient 40% volume 3 point shooters like Curry.   Dame is neither.  He's a 37% slightly above average efficiency 3 point shooter.  And he's a black hole on defense.    Dame was pretty efficient due to the way NBA called fouls.  Now that that is over, Dame's days of being even a top 15 player I believe are over.    &gt;You're delusional. I mean I thought most of you guys realize Morey is delusional, didn't know there are fans who actually share his views.  Time will tell.  I don't think many teams will have a choice... unlike the 76ers.  We can keep Ben on ice for 4 years, and still be a competitive team(who by the way is ahead of the Bucks in the standings, while half of our lineup is out).  Teams like the Trailblazers, Timberwolves are going to blow up any day now on the other hand."

"I would say the nets would be the best game but good luck finding quality seats for around that price. Imo nba games should only be seen in person in the 100 sections. What ever you do, don’t sit behind the backboard! Worst seats in the house!    My second choice would be dc becuse it’s an amazing city one and Bradley Beal is must see tv - the team isn’t the greatest so the tickets will be cheapest!  Hope that helps and good luck!"
This is wrong man lmao kyrie himself said he supports people choice to get vaccinated or not vaccinated. And he rlly didn't say anything damaging or anti vax. Players like Bradley Beal said more damaging stuff about the vaccine. At most kyrie came up with a dumb excuse to not get vaxxed but I don't rlly think he cares if you get vaxxed or not.
"Man, I hate when people say this. CP3 in his prime was an MVP candidate and a top 5 player.  D Will as good as he was was never an MVP candidate nor ever a top 10 player.  It would be like comparing Harden to Bradley Beal in 2019.  Technically Beal was the second best Shooting guard but he wasn’t a top 5 player like Harden.  Williams and Paul weren’t as close as people made it out to seem.  Williams was just on a deeper Utah team, and even in 08 when they had comparable talent as teams the Hornets were better because Chris Paul was better."

Bradley Beal type beat 😪
"He's wearing his favorite neon pink suit, looking real spiffy. He's super excited so he called his mom, and then his old friend Thomas Bryant. Bryant picks up a payphone somewhere in DC expecting the good news. Suddenly he starts crying and smashing the payphone. Nearby, his teammate Bradley Beal is concerned, ""TB, what's wrong?"" Through sobs TB chokes out, ""he's coming *here*"" Beal starts crying too."
"He’s not being rewarded , he’s being allowed to participate at work like he should have always been just like Bradley beal. Only the vaxxed get rewards like a passport"
"If the rules change and Kyrie is able to play, that's fine with me.  Honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that some cities have this rule whereas others do not.  And that Bradley Beal can play at the Barclays, but Kyrie cannot.  I think everyone should be vaxxed, mind you.  But the rule that unvaxxed away players can play there makes no sense to me."
"Bradley Beal is allowed to play in Barclays. You’re right, but he did face consequences. He’s losing money now and in the future in the form of an extension. If they let him play unvaccinated it’s really not worth taking umbrage.. It’s just politics..  For the record, think he’s an absolute dotard."
He's a very good offensive player. And that type of player is not worth what was essentially kicked around as the Bradley Beal or Ben Simmons package.
Ok that changes nothing about what I said.  There are unvaccinated players still playing. You’re not taking this same stance with Bradley Beal.  He’s not playing due to the mandate. The mandate that’s in place because of politicians.  That makes it political.  You’re not over here talking about I can’t watch Bradley Beal because he’s unvaccinated
"There’s always a lot of talk around a deal for Bradley Beal, maybe a deal for Dame Lillard. Your probably looking at a team wanting to get younger. But honestly they aren’t going anywhere and the idea of trading away a piece of the best young duo in the nba after 7 games with a new coach is a laughable over reaction."
"i'm pro vaccine, but i always thought the rule was stupid on how bradley beal was allowed to play at barclays and kyrie wasn't."
"I mean, it's no different than DC and Bradley Beal."
"He needs to be a top 4 guard in the East to secure a spot. Although teams can have up to 6 guards total depending on the coach's reserves picks.  Trae, Harden, Kemba, Lowry, Butler, LaVine, Lonzo, Derrick Rose, Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, and Bradley Beal all have cases over him."
Wait is Bradley Beal allowed to play in New York city?

because him and bradley beal have a bet going on
"Publicly*.  And the only trades he's talked about publicly were for Siakam, Dame and Bradley Beal.  And those trades were max trades, which by necessity would have included either of or both of Dray and Wiggins.  They're both a much better fit on our squad than any max deal we could have made.  None of these trades necessarily included our picks, which were very easily flippable to the Pacers, who 2 years ago were trying to blow it up and get rid of Myles Turner.  He'd have been a perfect fit."
"Lmao what? KP is mostly questionable because of his health, but he's nowhere near negative value. At the start of the season there some talk about going after Simmons, which would help the secondary ball handler/playmaker problem, but we still wouldn't have someone that can create their own shot. In a perfect world, we get Bradley Beal. Otherwise, John Wall doesn't do shit for us, due to the fact that he's a shell of his former self."
You just described Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal was their best player and led the Wizards to the playoffs. Westbrook is a good passer but his putrid scoring and defence far outweighs that. Not to mention he’s a complete liability off ball.

Yea thats the tough part finding a good trade. I think a lot of tatum and browns skillsets overlap just like bradley beal which is why I think it wouldn't be that great of a signing. People just get excited cause he's a big name and a star. I think the celtics definitely should have entertained a Harden trade last year.
"Honestly I think one of the two should get traded. I also don't get celtics fans obsession with bradley beal, I think the fit is terrible."
The Bradley Beal special
Can we argue that this the best team Bradley Beal has had in like 5/6 years?
Bradley Beal is a goldfish. Good mentality
"I don't watch many Wizards games - is Bradley Beal always this annoying? That collision he initiated with Schroeder where he collapsed to the  floor, the push off on Grant Williams where he expected a foul call? Just his general bitchiness. How do yall watch this and root for him?"
"Green plays nothing like Wade. Body type completely different. Wade was a physical beast from the moment he stepped into the NBA. Green def has Kobe like ceiling. It's just about him filling out his frame. He is competitive, but is he the maniac Kobe was? Vince Carter and T-mac were actually more naturally gifted than Kobe, but he blew past them cause he was more durable and mentally tougher. So it just depends how Green develops, but in terms of raw potential, he can def be the next Kobe. He is more gifted than Lavine and Bradley Beal."
To all the replies he’s right. Bradley Beal played in MSG in the preseason
"Not this garbage again.  “Dame Lillard, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, trill…  Me not wanting to join a super team might end up being my Achilles’ heel…  Hector, I’m on my shield…  Trying to get next to Freak and Dirk on that lonely hill…  Now my goal’s revealed so fuck you, the reporters thinking my homies squealed…”"
I doubt it because Bradley Beal is not vaccinated.
"bradley beal was leading the scoring title race almost all of last year.  i heard absolutely nothing about him being mvp at any point.  i'm not going to look at old mvp races, but who was the last top 3 finisher who didn't make the playoffs?  it's practically disqualifying from even being in the discussion.  as for him having a bad offensive supporting cast, what is that supposed to mean?  they were a good enough defensive supporting cast to finish 5th in defense and they ended up 22nd in offense so it's not like they won because steph turned them single-handedly into a top 10 offense."
"Ahhh yes, we’ll go with Rui ~~Bradley Beal~~  No it’s all **Rui’s** ~~Beal’s~~ fault."
Future Atlanta Hawk Bradley Beal
"I've been pulling the sidebar pic off of NBA's twitter recently rather than trying to find a game photo that can be properly cropped to 300x450.

NBA's twitter used Bradley Beal for their photo instead of Harrell so I went with a pic from NBA Brazil instead, https://twitter.com/NBABrasil/status/1453898098359558161"

"He’s been a beast, making up good for Bradley Beal forgetting how to play basketball"
This is for every “Free Bradley Beal” post in the last few years.  Deal with it
I'm going to be not mad but disappointed if Bradley Beal and Spencer Dinwiddie can co-exist at the same time and that's been the problem.
"Bradley Beal off ball movement is something else, much more impressive then Curry who needs seems to only get himself open for a 3 compared to Beal who can get open for a layup, 3, or middie"
"So basically, he’s a member of the Heat so they can trade his salary if they acquire someone like Bradley Beal..."
"Bradley Beal always seems to get a pass; he's been one of the worst defensive players on the Wizards, and the wizards have been one of the worst defensive teams in the league. Most metrics would throw him in the same bucket defensively as D'Lo, Trae, Lou Williams, and Colin Sexton.   RPM has him 117th of 118 shooting guards defensively. RAPTOR has him 75th of 90 shooting guards (using the default 514 minutes played filter)."
"**TEAM KESAVAHRAJ**  New expansion team owner G_Kesavahraj immediately earns the support of his fan base after adding a star laden roster that appears to fit very well together. Wings Bradley Beal and Jimmy Butler highlight the group, while BFFs Tobias Harris and Boban earn the fan love on social immediately.  After a 3-3 start to the year, the team finds their rhythm and chemistry. Beal and Butler prove to be an ideal yin/yang, as Beal provides the shooting and spacing while Butler focused on crashing to the line, dishing, and bothering every other wing on defense. Both players average 20 PPG as the team swells up to a 28-20 record midway through the year. Both Beal and Butler make the All-Star team.  At times, the presence of Boban as a starter slows the team's pace down, but with Beal and Tobias Harris the club still feels like they have enough shooting to play a half court game if need be. The club finishes the regular season as the # 3 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the team turns up the gas even more, crushing the feel-good story Knicks 4-1 in round one. Goran Dragic showcases his own scoring prowess in the series with 21 PPG, perhaps having saved up his energy for the playoffs. At this point, the team truly feels like a title threat.  But in round two, the group matches up against the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis, who may prove a handful for them. Sure enough, Tobias Harris struggles with the matchup, and switching over Jimmy Butler leaves some open holes on the perimeter. Khris Middleton hits 5 threes in game 2, leading to a 2-0 lead for the Bucks.  Now down in the series, all the good vibes start turning sour. Jimmy Butler gives a press conference, blasting the team's defensive effort (and making indirect shots at Beal in the process.) The group responds with a strong Game 3 win, but falls back into old habits in a Game 4 loss. Butler puts the team on his back and scores 31 in Game 5 to pull off another win and take the series back to 3-2. Still, the Bucks' hot shooting ends up carrying them in Game 6, leading to a bitter defeat.   The team licks its wounds and pride after the loss. Surely, they had the talent to compete for a title, but it just wasn't in the cards this season."
"That’s fair. I mean Dumars did win a FMVP and all star for bad boys. Pistol was just like Bradley Beal of his era. Shit team great individual player and he would even be better in this era. But when we rank greatness, Dumars is prob ahead of Pete cuz his peak wasn’t as good but his career was much better. Dumars was an elite defender too now.   My point about russel is that most ppl Have him in the 4-8 range when ranking greatness. But when ranking pure b-ball player he isn’t top 10 clearly"

Bradley Beal is not going to get traded. Is there a need to evaluate that statement anymore? It’s been discussed so often.
"Bradley Beal to actually want a trade and for the Wizards to be interested in trading him, which both parties have said they have no interest in doing"
"Wizards. I thought Harden was going to be the next great SG (that was when he won his 6th man award), and Bradley Beal was going to have next in line.  I wanted Wall to be more off-ball, so Beal can have more on-ball shine. Disliked Wall at first, but couldn't help becoming a fan the more I watched.  I guess I just gradually became more invested over time."
"I came in here expecting Perkins to have trashed him. Luka getting the same treatment Giannis gets. Win. Prove you're a winner. Same as any superstar on a losing team. DeMarcus Cousins, AD, Kyrie, Russell the Muscle, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, all have had or have similar criticisms. This ain't hating."

Bradley Beal for THT + a first?
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"Well Bradley Beal didn't name his child Batmo, so humanity has long lost hope"

Bradley Beal of the west is such a horrendous take you should have your commenting privlages revoked.

"**TEAM KD RETURNS TO WASHINGTON**  Flash back to 2016. Fans of the Washington Wizards rejoice as hometown hero Kevin Durant announces that he's taking his talents to D.C. to rejoin his old coach Scottie Brooks (recently hired). Immediately, many peg the group as a true contender despite only finishing 41-41 the season before.  The Wizards start a little rockier than some expected, given the youth on the roster. After all, Beal (23 years old) and Bogdanovic (year 3 year in NBA) have not fulfilled their full potential yet.  At the same time, the overwhelming talent of prime John Wall and Kevin Durant proves to be difficult for the league to handle. Wall takes charge as an alpha dog leader and attack dog in transition, showcasing his underrated vision and passing ability. KD passively aggressively snipes to the media that Wall is the ""best PG he's ever played with,"" leading to a surly Westbrook press conference the next day.  Overall, it's hard to argue with the results. Durant helps lead the team to an immediate +15 game turnaround (going 56-26), winning MVP honors in the process. Wall leads the league in assists (11.1) and earns 2nd team All-NBA honors.  Of course, the true test comes in the playoffs and -- more specifically -- the Eastern Conference Finals where Durant matches up with rival LeBron James (still on Cleveland.) The series is an instant classic, with KD and LeBron trading punches, and sidekicks Wall and Kyrie Irving having their own big games here and there. The teams head into Game 7, deadlocked at 3-3.  In that final game, it turns out to be Kevin Love who provides the difference. Love catches fire and hits 5-7 threes, leading to a 26 point barrage that helps the Cavs slip by and head to the Finals once again.  The Wizards go home disappointed, but hopeful that they can be right back in the title mix as Bradley Beal continues his ascent."

"I never said harden doesn’t deserve to be higher, so nice straw man there. Although you’re still clearly over-conflating team success with individual success. This isn’t an MVP list either. Bradley Beal isn’t shit because his team is shit."
I think its more like saying bradley beal is the GOAT (if you dont count lebron).   Its still a pretty crazy statement considering all the great cookie choices out there
I mean yeah but that’s like saying Bradley Beal is a bad player because he isn’t as good as Lebron.
&gt; Bradley Beal averages 21.6 PPG on 56.2% TS to Kobe’s 25 PPG ON 55% TS.  Lol what the fuck do career averages have to do with this conversation...
"Bradley Beal averages 21.6 PPG on 56.2% TS to Kobe’s 25 PPG ON 55% TS. That’s a massive gap between them as scorers.  And yes 35 PPG on 56% TS is more impressive to me than 32 PPG on 59% TS. Not to mention this has only been less than half a season of stats...  The whole premise is that arguing era in player to player efficiency conversations is largely irrelevant.  Even in your Beal to Kobe example, Kobe is clearly the better scorer, and that’s the only thing Beal is even in the convo with him on."
"Bradley Beal is averaging 32 PPG this year. Kobe only scored more than that once. In 2006 he averaged 35 PPG at 56% TS%.   But if that difference 3 PPG is too much of a jump, in Kobe's second best scoring season he average just under 32 PPG on similar TS%. Its an apples to apples comparison between the AI/Westbrook conversation and the Kobe/Beal conversation.  &gt;But if you’re asking if inefficiency is a valid criticism for Kobe Bryant, it absolutely is. But Beal is a terrible choice to use lol, he doesn’t even score what Kobe did in his prime to even mention TS%  Except he does... Your whole premise was that era doesn't matter. Beal scores as much as Kobe did in his prime...  I don't know what you're even trying to argue at this point. Literally every one of your posts has been riddled with misinformation..."
"&gt;I don’t care what the league average was at any point  Guess Bradley Beal is better than Kobe Bryant, huh? Cause Kobe never shot 59% TS%. And that's what Beal is shooting right now.   This is dumb. Like really dumb."
So last season we can confirm Kemba Walker and Kyle Lowry were better than Bradley Beal since they were all stars and Beal wasn’t   Am I right?
"The US will have Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, AD, Harden, Dame. Thats arguably 7 of the top 10. And you can still have great support guys that compliment that top 7 like Klay(if healthy), Bam, Bradley Beal, PG, Draymond Green  Only issue with US is they dont have many bigs.  FIBA rules familiarity is not really the issue with US Teams over the years. US loses when they don't have shooting and spacing like in 2004, 2006 and 2018. If they can have everyone available this will not be an issue with KD, Steph, Klay, Harden, Dame, Beal arguably the worlds best shooters right now. This opens up the game for slashers like Lebron and Kawhi and roll men like AD and Bam will thrive."
"He's the only guy on that list who can hit pull-up threes, he has the best touch in the paint and is probably the best passer (although RJ is close). Right now, Herro is the only guy amongst the bunch I'd be comfortable saying could one day lead a good offense on his own because of his shot versatility and handle. He's also shown so much improvement in just 2 seasons that he seems like a Bradley Beal-type guy where he will steadily add new elements to his game. He was also the 3rd best player on a Finals team."
"Dame has upped his production to meet Steph (in the regular season, postseason still a a massive gap) so no, Steph is still playing as great as always. Don’t discredit your own guy, he’s playing great, Steph isn’t playing any worse than his usual self, even with this supporting cast.  Oubre and Wiseman are/were historically negative on +/-, Dame hasn’t had terrible teams lol, you’re acting like he’s Bradley Beal. He’s had solid supporting casts.  Do you think Dray is out there for offense? He’s a great passer, but that’s it, and he’s a negative offensively if the ball isn’t in his hands. I don’t know why you’re bringing Dray up, when Dray is far from an offensive plus, especially off-ball.  You can compare Curry’s on/off number pre-KD too. If anything playing with great players means it shouldn’t be as impactful when he sits, but spoiler alert, it is."
It was only a matter of time before they turned things around. A team with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook wasn’t gonna be bad forever.
"I think Curry's great, but he's not significantly better than the field. There's a decent chance Steph won't earn all-nba 1st team this year given his team's record just like Bradley Beal not even making all-nba 3rd last year averaging 30ppg."
Bradley Beal
"If Kyle Korver was an all star then Duncan Robinson has a chance of making one sometime down the line.          For herro, I think his ceiling would be around Bradley Beal/devin booker range, although I don’t think he’ll actually ever end up being that good."
"&gt;Also really? Saying stfu over a civil discussion? No wonder no one can take you seriously.  Oh sorry, don't take me serious. And it isn't all that civil, you're uncivilized at arguing points. You want me to do all the hard work to jump through a thousand hoops to prove to your moving goalposts that Westbrook's got flaws. Your head's up your ass and youre trash. There's no civility in your discourse.   Oh look, more tasks for me to prove things your willfully ignorant ass can't acknowledge.  &gt; Also the other players listed aren't portrayed in the media as such, and are not viewed by the general watching public as such, and **I dare you** to find articles that show them in an ""combative"" light aside from Draymond.   https://www.sbnation.com/2018/10/30/18039814/washington-wizards-drama-john-wall-bradley-beal-history    and more, if youre a Wizards fan and your head isn't in the sand then you know   &gt;Talking to media about wanting to get traded, refusing to play when he didn't get traded, complaining to the coach about not getting minutes and not starting over Westbrook (who was already an all-star), beefing with teammates about rotations and how he deserves more minutes over them, you can read about it online.  Yeah? Prove each point with articles. I dArE yOu"
Is bradley beal the best or westbrook.  I guess my life depends on it
ESPN and SportsCenter: Bradley Beal HATES John Wall?!

ESPN: Bradley Beal reveals John Wall is one of the worst teammates he ever had.
You seriously can’t be asking this question right?   You actually think KD’s career would be different with an average point guard?   Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal are averaging 29+ PPG on bad teams with no point guard &amp; they’re worse players than KD in every aspect   KD is a 7ft marksman that creates his shot at will from anywhere &amp; finishes 70%+ at the rim.  He doesn’t rely on anyone to score. His stats actually see little drop off with Westbrook or Curry off the floor if you don’t include 1 anomaly post season. Check u/SilentGenuis comment. Ben doesn’t really like KD &amp; is critical of his game. KD’s one of the better offensive engines in the game lol.
"Avery Bradley was a top 6 SG in 2016, Beal wasnt"
"He’s a solid role player nowadays. He’s definitely not trash, but Bradley Beal is a borderline superstar it’s a many tiers that separate the two"
"If lebron and AD went ahead and somehow got Bradley beal for example, you don't think ppl would be mad?"
"&gt;last prime years  I mean Bron is playing at 36. Steph is 32 and with his style of play, can probably keep it going for a while lol.  If GSW decides to trade the pick/younger guys for a Bradley Beal/Lavine that would make a lot of sense too though.  And Klay will be back at some point as well."
Kellerman would take Bradley and Iguodala over Curry and Beal
"avery bradley beal\* lol  avery bradley's defense was really good in his prime, doesn't have kawhi's size or hands but he was really smart and annoying with it - he was just small"
im not the one saying it im just trying to understand how he thought that lol only way i could see it is if beal was having an average stretch around the time of the segment and was comparing him to bradley in his prime
Bruh   Comparing Beal and Avery Bradley at any point in there careers is blasphemous.
Hell yeah Bradley Beal got in as a starter!
"How TF is Bradley Beal a consensus starter over LaVine? Zach's averaging 28/5/5 on some Steph Curry efficiency shit, and the team is currently the 9th seed"
bradley beal averages 4.7 assists to 3.1 turnovers. Kawhi averages 5 assists to 1.8  turnovers.
Kenny saying Bradley Beal wasn't a super HS player lolllll  didn't he win Gatorade NPOY?
Just because he’s putting up the same numbers last year and wasn’t an allstar doesn’t mean he’s not an allstar caliber player. Bradley Beal is virtually doing the same exact thing he was last year when he wasn’t an allstar and this year he’s a starter.   Yeah our young guys have stepped up but that doesn’t change the fact that without DeMar we would be at the bottom of the conference. And it’s not like last year we were some garbage team. we were 2 games out of the playoffs.
In that case Bradley Beal never deserved it last year and doesn’t deserve it this year with your logic? Records matter but they aren’t everything.
I mean more in terms of being under the radar on a bad team like how Bradley Beal was last year
"That wasnt Jokic's fault, that was JaMychal Green's man. JMG was fronting Len and went for an impossible steal and Len was way too far out for Jokic to have any chance to recover without fouling him on the dunk attempt. One of a handful of just supremely dumb plays Green made in this game, along with his attempted save on the fucking AIR BALL (with NOT A SINGLE WIZARD NEARBY) that turned into a Bradley Beal corner 3. Just sheer idiocy."
"With the floor spread, he would get into the paint at will. He was getting to the hoop with a two post offense featuring Tyrone Hill and Mutombo. Not to mention George Lynch and Eric Snow couldn’t space the floor.   Similar to Bradley Beal, he would lead the league in scoring but his fight and tenacity would inspire every night and his teams would be in the playoff hunt even without any talent around him."
"Embiid is leading the league over Bradley Beal , steph, dame, etc in points per 100 possessions on a better TS%. Actually leads the league in TS% amongst high usage qualifying players"
"I mean at least that's consistent logic, kind of odd though.  Do you think Bradley Beal is a top MVP candidate?"
"I love Jokic, I've been supporting him and the Nuggets since \~the 2017 season, but I feel like this shows how we shouldn't ever use ""empty stats"" again to describe a guy who is putting up both volume and efficiency.  If this were Zach LaVine or Bradley Beal a lot of yall would be yelling empty stats, but when Jokic has good games while catching a lot of Ls it's all praise and ""get this man some help""  Praise the Jokic, praise the LaVine, let's just be consistent"
"There’s the slightest chance for like a Kemba Walker and draft compensation for Bradley Beal, but I doubt it."
"False Equivalency.  There's only 6 guard spots in All NBA selections if the offensive numbers are close to equal then defense has to be a deciding factor as well as win totals  the years WB made All NBA he was averaging 25+ pts, 8+ Reb and 8+ assists on teams that were the 6th seed and up  Kyrie has only made one 2nd team allnba and one 3rd, in 2015 he was third team all nba with similar stats to Lavine this year except he was on a 53 win team and his 2nd all nba placement was 2019 where he avgd 24/7/5 on a 49 win team  Again there are 6 guard spots in the All NBA  who of this list is Zach Lavine Replacing?  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic  Dame Lillard  James Harden  Lebron James (yes he's a guard now)  Donnovan Mitchell  Bradley Beal   I just listed 7 guards above Lavine just incase you wanted to die on the Lebron hill  that's not even arguing he should squeak in as the last spot on the 3rd team  the dude I responded to actually said 2ND TEAM ALL NBA as in he's a top 4 guard this year  explain it to me."
I know its unpopular but Bradley getting the start while Zach might not even make it is pretty messed up. Beal averages 5 more points on 5 more attempts with not great efficiency right now. Meanwhile Zach is shooting lights out and has been trying to avoid hero ball to help the team. I know its all about the narrative and he was snubbed last year but he has been an allstar in the past.
Lol only 2-3 of those guys have an actual shot at winning. Bradley Beal? Are you high
Do you even watch the games? If your argument were the case Bradley Beal would be the favorite over Steph because he leads him in Rebounds and Pts.

"If you actually think about it statistically, the more points you score in a game - the more likely you are to win.   So if we take the teammates of a given player and and they collectively score their average PPG every game (let's call that x).  Then if you take our player (say Bradley Beal, Booker etc.) and say that they score their career high every game. Do you think they are more or less likely to win the game with this group if they scored their career high every game compared to their career average? Or do you think the impact would be nil (i.e. they win one game and lose the next).   Statistically speaking, of course."
Just like Bradley Beal last year :(
Is Lavine the new Bradley Beal?
"We've heard of Bradley ""Despite the Loss"" Beal, but what about Russell ""Despite the Win"" Westbrook?"
ala Bradley Beal
Becoming the new Bradley Beal
I wonder how many guys currently have their career highs in a loss.  Devin Booker  Bradley Beal  Ben Simmons   And now Grant
Facu is guarding Bradley Beal? That’s an easy 50 or the rest of the team pops off cuz everyone is gonna have to help.
Bradley Beal. Sick backcourt defense too
Bradley Beal
if bradley beal becomes available the heat are offering herro duncan precious and picks and arent looking back and that beats the nuggets offer everytime
Bradley Beal  Bradley Beal  Bradley Beal  Bradley Beal  Bradley Beal
"It's not that it would necessarily be wrong. Bradley Beal of all people would probably have the general public's sympathy, with the way the Wizards have been run, how much has he has grown despite numerous bad HC's coming through, and now with the trade of John Wall.  But the fact that he has just put his head down and continued to work on his game is worth commending. That's all the other guy meant."
"McGrady would have been perfect for this era. He played in one of the most defensive eras ever as a ISO player and was still pretty efficient even on terrible teams leading the league in scoring. Look at what Bradley Beal is doing out there. People always say so and so player would average 40 in this era, McGrady in his athletic prime with the Orlando Magic is def one of like maybe 5 players ever that would legit average 40 in this era along with 8 rebs and 8 assists."
"Bro if you really listened to Draymond, you would understand that he's mostly talking about the reactions we have to looking at player movement. When you complain about players trying to take their own career into their hands and asking for a trade but you have zero qualms when teams use them as literal commodities, it sort of dehumanizes them. James Harden wasn't wrong to want to ask to be traded. But people got on his ass about him giving up on the team and all that. Then you have people shitting on Bradley Beal because he wants to stay in Washington to try and succeed while they come up with garbage tier trades just to put him in a Lakers jersey or whatever. And it's likely because fans identify with their teams and don't look at how players themselves feel. They think that because most are paid in 8 figures that they aren't entitled to be satisfied with their job and work environment or to be given respect as someone providing the fans with entertainment.  Criticize players that push their actions too far (Kyrie and Harden partying in covid is totally fine to criticize). But don't criticize them for voicing displeasure with their situation while giving owners a free pass."
"You really dont understand what subjective means lmao. you cant be this dense.   &gt;players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing.  What is this based on oh your opinions lol.....right again you lack comprehension. Even your points are inconsistent and you dont realize how off your logic is lol.    Brown, Irving, Harden, Kris, all play with MVP caliber players on their team, and have played with multiple Allstars on their teams throughout their entire careers.  Since you value winning so much, Young, Beal are both players who have never played on a winning NBA team, and their stats also dont transfer to wins. Beal is an older, less efficient shooter and doesnt translates to wins. Young is younger but is a lot less efficient in shooting, is completely terrible a defensive to the point where the team went through lengths to cover his flaws and doesnt translate to winning.  ( Some more inconsistency in your logic). Devon Booker and Demar are both leading their teams to the playoffs on winning teams....Hahaha.   It's so easy to rebuttal you because you continue to base everything on your own opinions but you're very illogical and inconsistent with your arguments lol. You've been exposed lmao"
"The Wizards need a performance like that at least 1 once a week. Bradley Beal is killing it, but he needs help."
"I shouldn't bite but I will.   &gt;Dude learn the definition of Subjective.  Learn that things are absolute.  &gt;LaVine is now averaging a career-high 28.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.3 assists while shooting 51.8% overall, 42.5% on 3-pointers, and 86.3% on free throws. His true shooting percentage sits at a whopping 65.2%, which is fifth among players with a usage rate over 25 (he’s right around 30). Truly impressive stuff, a combination of offensive volume and efficiency Eclipsing the best of Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler Bulls seasons into a historic stratosphere. Four players this season (Kawhi, KD, LaVine, Jokic) are averaging 25-5-5 or better with 50% from the field and 40% from 3 Only four players in NBA history had done that before this season.....he is also only 25 and continuing to develop. really great for young player who hasn't even entered his prime.  Yes you've posted the same numbers three times. They are incredible numbers. No argument here. I'm not debating what his scoring, assist, and rebounds numbers are. I'm not arguing what his shooting splits. I'm not saying they are bad. I'm not saying they at the expense of the Bulls' offense. I'm saying despite Lavine's great numbers, players such as Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Khris Middleton are clearly better and he's on the same level as players like Devin Booker and DeMar DeRozan (who is crazy underrated these days). Making your teammates better is a real thing. Playing defense is a real thing. It's hard to quantify that in a stat, but the stats that do try do that show Lavine isn't on the level you want him to be. You can see it when the game is happening. Do you honestly not see where Lavine needs to improve as a play maker or on defense?  &gt;Are you delusional? you've been exposed lol. Nothing you say is backed up and you continue to think that your opinions are an actual source of evidence for your argument.  Exposed? Again, I've shown numbers and gave examples from games, not sure what else you need.  &gt;All you do is try and attack my character which you know nothing about because you dont have an argument. Making assumptions about people also discredit you, its just very lazy and subjective. Just stick to objective facts, kid  When have I attacked you're character? You're the one saying things like ""delusional"", ""kid"", exposed"" and other demeaning phrases. I don't care at all, I just find it funny you're saying I'm the one attacking your character. You're the one making assumptions, I've never questioned anything you've said, I'm just addressing what you have said.  If you want to stick to objective facts then fine, the objective fact is Lavine has never been on a winning team. That should end the argument right there. We aren't discussing what Lavine is averaging or whether he should be an all-star, we are discussing is Lavine is a ""winning"" player, and if were aren't adding context to the objective facts, then Lavine is the very definition of a losing player.  Now obviously that's ridiculous and you need to look at his team, just like you need to look at how he gets his stats, now just what his final stats are."
"I just can't follow this logic man. He has had a slew of shit games, his team isn't winning. By this logic then Zach Lavine and Bradley Beal should be front runners for MVP as well."

[Bradley Beal quite evidently does not suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEy92jAIPTg)
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
Bradley Beal is not a bum. More news at 11.
Bradley “despite the ~~loss~~ win” Beal
Damn though you said Bradley Beal just put up 72 points and got excited lol
No more auditions. Bradley Beal already got the role.
So u wouldnt trade him for Bradley beal
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
"There is no doubt Europe has the advantage in the front court, but The gap between AD and Jokic isn’t as big when you factor in defense, and you are underselling the overall disadvantage Europe has.  Europe has a great team, but the US has an insane team. Lebron, Steph, and Kawhi are too much regardless, and the US “B team” PG, Kyrie, KD, Dame, Kat would probably beat the Euro starters too. That’s without even including Harden, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Jaylen Brown, etc."
It's known as the Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal to the Lakers 2022
Umm. All star game is a popularity contest where the best players play. Obviously offensive numbers would be big  Bradley Beal might be a starter and he’s currently on the worst team in the whole nba. I’m convinced your arguing for the sake of arguing. You have no clear context in your arguing lol. Nobody got time for that now My team is playing
"Lavine is in competition for the worst defensive shooting guard in the league with Bradley Beal. It's not a mystery why these guys teams always lose when they're consistently ranked at the bottom of their position on defense.  Mitchell might even be better than these guys offensively. When you have these guys not putting much effort on the defensive end, we don't really know what they would look like offensively if they actually had to put full effort on defense the entire game. Mitchell isn't an elite defender by any means, but he's quite average, and in the context of team defense, having some average defenders in the lineup is fine."
Jordan Clarkson is like a Bradley Beal cosplayer that also somehow scores like Beal.
Lebron just a chungus Bradley Beal
"Statistically, Russel Westbrook is objectively better than Michael Jordan. To elaborate, this is because Bradley Beal is just Lebron James, as they have the same facillitating and rebounding and athleticism, but Beal is the more versatile scorer and defender. Its obvious 2021 season was a fluke, get a grip on reality. Wizards will sweep their way to the playoffs after warming up this year and will 4-0 sweep LeBum ""It hurt me financially"" James."
"Nope, not even the week that he averaged 52/6/6 on 62/48/91 shooting splits.  He got snubbed because the team went 0-3 that week (33pt loss, 3pt loss, 5pt loss).  Suns fans were livid, because those losses had absolutely nothing to do with his play.  He had De'Anthony Melton, Dragan Bender, and 2 Rookies (Ayton &amp; Bridges) starting alongside him.  To give an idea, here are our shooting splits in those games if Booker's stats were removed...  * **at Jazz**: 59pts on 19/34 from the field, 5/8 from 3, 16/17 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 33pts on 12/42 from the field, 2/15 from 3, 7/11 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Donovan Mitchell, who scored 10pts on 4/14 shooting* * **vs Wizards**: 50pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/9 from 3, 9/10 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 71pts on 24/57 from the field, 11/29 from 3, 12/16 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Bradley Beal, who scored 28 on 11/22 shooting* * **vs Grizz**: 48pts on 19/29 from the field, 3/6 from 3, 7/8 from FT    * *Rest of Team: 67pts on 24/52 from the field, 9/22 from 3, 10/15 from FT*    * *Booker's matchup was Justin Holiday, who scored 14pts on 5/9 shooting*"
"Alright. Firstly, I wouldn’t say Durant and Kahwi are much clutch than Kyrie. Clearly much better players but not more clutch. What have they done to be considered more clutch than Kyrie? 2016 Is not the only clutch shot Kyrie has, he makes game winners every season. He has so many clutch moments and if you want me to point them out, I will.   Durant is clutch but his reputation as a clutch player is overrated because of 2017 and 2018. Both of those Game 3 shots were great shots but there was little to no pressure. Before that, in 2016 he choked away the 3-1 lead to GS by shooting 10/32 in game 6 at home. In 2013 against Memphis he was awful in those 4th quarters as they were eliminated.  He scored like 8 points in the last 3 total 4th quarters of that series. Total.  If you tell me why you think KD and Kahwi are more clutch than Kyrie, and make a good point, I may agree with you.   What player am I making Kyrie out to be? I have clearly said so many times that I understand why anyone would take PG over Kyrie or Jaylen Brown over Kyrie. PGs defense is way better than Kyries and he’s taller and a much better rebounder obviously. I just don’t think you can count on him to be the offensive player that he usually is when it matters most and he’s proven to be a choker. That’s a huge thing for me. Paul George as far as talent is definitely better than Kyrie. As far as talent he should be a top 5 player but there’s a reason that he’s not. That’s all I’m saying and that’s not unreasonable, neither does it show that I don’t know what I’m talking about. It’s just my opinion and it’s different than yours. I never stated where I think Kyrie ranks in the NBA so I’m not sure how I’m making him out to be a player he’s not, I just think he’s definitely, undoubtedly, better than Bradley Beal😂"
So is Bradley Beal my guy
Yeah but you get off the tobais contract sooner and open up space for a Bradley beal trade in the offseason. Come on sixers fan!!
"Being more proven doesn't matter for an all star game. It's a snapshot of this one season and your performance.     And wins matter more for all NBA teams than all star game. That's why Bradley Beal will undoubtedly make it with a 7-17 record. They factor in, but usually not too much."
"It was a few inches shorter and they were far less athletic. The drastic difference in pace also needs accounted for. There were far more possessions per game during his era, games were higher scoring and there were nearly twice as many rebounds up for grabs. Wilt's stats adjusted to per possession look much more like a current excellent season. As I recall earlier in the year, Bradley Beal was scoring more points per possession than Wilt's 50 ppg season."

Bradley Beal didn't have the best record in the NBA last season
No way Warriors do that. That draft pick might be too good now. If they pull that trigger it would be for Bradley Beal
Nuggets would be nasty if they got Bradley Beal
These are coaches not fans who are the voters. Coaches had no issues leaving Bradley Beal and his 30 points off last year
"Luka dropping 40+, but his team still loses? Who does he think he is? Bradley Beal?"
I’m sorry I forgot Bradley Beal is better than lebron
bradley beal straight hoopin
"Yeah, and I just feel like if never wins before retiring, he’ll probably end up complaining about how he never won a ring or even be in the Finals.  It’s same attitude I have towards Bradley Beal. It’s okay to be loyal and all, but I don’t wanna hear any complaints if you never make it to the mountaintop. You had plenty of chances to jump ship, but you chose not to."
"Di Angelo was a one time all star two years ago, and has sucked since. Julius Randle will not be an all star this year. A team with Bradley Beal and Russel Westbrook is better yes, especially considering you got two guys career bench guys playing starter minutes."
I mean who is he better than in this list? If you had the 10th pick in a single season draft trying to win a ring youd take bradley beal?
BRADLEY BEAL
"Bledsoe I agree isnt the answer longterm but theres not too many players they can easily replace Lonzo with. He's shooting the 3 ball at an efficient clip and even though he got torched by lavine and luka the last 2 games he's one of the best perimeter defenders in the league who can cover multiple positions with his length as a taller guard, and on top of that he's a good playmaker whenever the team needs him to be and is 2nd in total +/- on his team through the season so far. He's an RFA after this season, so the only reason they should consider trading him is if they dont want to match any offers from a team like the bulls who will probably throw him a bag or if a player like bradley beal becomes available"
"Ok, now you're into delusional fan territory.  (I also forgot to include Bradley Beal on the list)"
**Bradley Emmanuel Beal**
Damn when Bradley Beal is getting back in transition on defense you know it’s not your day if Boston
Bradley Beal is so smooth

“ who the hell wouldn’t watch bradley beal”  Fine john wall for player tampering
Who wouldn’t want to watch Bradley Beal? Anyone who enjoys good team basketball.
"I think people are drastically underrating what it means to average 5 blocks and 5 steals per game. Bradley Beal, for example, is averaging nearly 33ppg... so it’s not as if a 35ppg scorer is a lock to win you games. I don’t know what the “right” answer is, but I don’t think it’s as clearcut as some responses make it seem. I mean think about the implications of a guy who gets 5 blocks - presumably he is affecting many more shots with his paint presence. And the chaos his stealing ability causes. Don’t forget, he’s still giving you 15ppg which is respectable."
"Jokic doesn’t need to play with other “big men” play creators. He is the creator. Jokic needs play finishers.  Guys that know when to cut and can finish at the rim and guards/wings that can knock down open shots that he makes for them.  Jokic playing with a guy like Zion who he can create offense for is better than him and Draymond passing the ball back and forth to each other saying “you shoot it”. Draymond is an excellent play creator in his own right but an absolute turd of a play finisher.   Replace Jamal Murray with a more efficient and deadly offensive scorer like a Steph Curry, Dame, or Bradley Beal and the world might explode."
CP3  Bradley Beal  LeBron  Tim Duncan  Hakeem
"They could have convinced him. Traded for Bradley Beal, added a Giannis type. Instead they threw in the towel."
But don’t you know? Bradley Beal is leading the league in scoring on the defensive juggernaut Wizards.
Free Bradley Beal... preferably to the raptors please
&gt;The Bradley Beal speculation doesn't make sense. Beal doesn't make the warriors a finals team. James Wiseman two years from now might.  Warriors lmaooooooooooooooooooo
"These people act like having an all star player is some enormous gift from god that should never be given up. Bradley Beal hasn’t exactly been helping them do much of anything while he’s with them, he’s scored 40 like 10 times in the past two years and they probably haven’t won a single one of those games because he only makes plays on one half of the court and doesn’t make his teammates better and he’s played there for 9 years already but the moment you say the obvious “bad team should trade X all star for assets” they go crazy.   He’s going to bring back a ton of assets. I’m sure you could go trade him for Herro and expiring contracts tomorrow if you wanted to, but that’s a bad prospect for wizards fans and they should keep him because he’s “homegrown” or whatever bullshit.   Idk man, I guess I’m just a big bad big market fan who knows nothing and they should keep him and continue to build....whatever this is that they’ve been building around him for the last 9 years...🤷🏾‍♂️"
"Does he make it over Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, or Bradley Beal?"
Bradley  Beal is like 6 man Lou Will but a starter
"Jeez that really puts into perspective how competitive the West is, especially in the guard position.   It seems as the league is getting more and more stacked there are gonna be tons of guys getting left off putting up like 22 ppg on good efficiency. Or if you’re Bradley Beal. Dude averaged over 30 ppg last season and was the 2nd highest scorer after Harden iirc and was left off. Meanwhile Devin Booker was whining about getting left off and only got in because Dame got injured lol."
"This is an enormous overreaction. Edwards is 19 and has shown great flashes. We are all excited about this kid. James Harden did nothing in his first four seasons in the league and still became a star. Jimmy Butler was a terrible rookie. Bradley Beal had a very ho hum rookie year. Brandon Ingram looked truly awful his rookie season. Look, players take time and we are only a few games into the season. LaMelo just not so many games ago played awful and this sub was calling him a bust. Can we chill and let these kids grow up? Come back in 2-3 years on this. None of these players were expected to be generational talents. I am very confident in our selection of Edwards based on what I’ve seen from him already. Great handle, good vision, very strong moves to the rack, good ability to create separation, hits big shots in the game. His efficiency isn’t there yet but he’s also being told in the second unit go ham, so he is volume scoring. Let’s relax."
"Yea if they're way out if the playoffs it could go that direction. But my read of Washington's ownership is that they can't easily afford to cut ties with a player of Bradley Beal's caliber (unless they're being offered a proven young star like Ingram/Brown which may not happen). They just invested a lot in Westbrook+Bertans and having Beal is the crown jewel of what Ted Leonsis wants to do from a business/marketing standpoint.   First they will offer Beal an extension and see if he's willing to turn down $50mil/yr.. considering he doesn't have the offcourt earning power of a player like Harden, I'd wager the numbers on that extension will make him think twice about how bad he really needs to leave. He can re-up on a huge deal and still request a trade in another couple years when it's not too late to compete for a ring. But if he's deadset on turning down the extension and is willing to make a fuss to get out, that's the only realistic route I see where he's traded by next offseason."
"Actually yeah that makes sense, because then we can do this:  - Bradley Beal - Jrue Holiday - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - James Harden - Zach LaVine"
SG is pretty loaded tbh  - James Harden - Bradley Beal - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - ??? - Zach LaVine  No idea who'd play the 5 though.
"Okay, Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, and KAT aren't all stars either then"
"Bradley Beal is probably ""least of all the problems,"" not Russ.  Triple doubles without context aren't really that valuable.  Russ being one of the least efficient scorers in the league on high volume is actually a big problem."
"Well Bradley Beal is now in health &amp; safety protocol because post-game he had a lengthy conversation w/ Tatum in close proximity. No word on whether he's tested positive/negative, but seems like he's at least going to miss the next game."
Bradley Beal Ewing Theory incoming.
"Alaa is a boomer and always says some shit like that, he’s fun but he’s an unabashed homer  Zumoff (the play by play guy) is terrific though and pretty lavishly praises most guys  like against the Wizards they were both just laughing at how good Bradley Beal is for 48 minutes"
Yeah he was literally hugging Bradley Beal yesterday and god knows what else. Any players he had close contact with like that should be out too.
BRADLEY BEAL IN SHAMBLES. SOMEBODY CHECK ON HIM PLS
"Gave up on the dub a long time ago, but I'm still watching mostly to watch Tyrese Maxey statpad. I feel bad for Wizards fans. This must be how they watch Bradley Beal throughout the season."
"""We now check in with Bradley Beal to see how the defense is doing. How's it going, Bradley?""  ""*We can't guard a parked car!*""  ""Thanks Bradley."""
Please give us Bradley Beal and take Lonzo off our hands.  Westbrook and lonzo backcourt 💩
I feel like I have seen so much stuff talking about how good Bradley Beal is for a few days. This post seems dumb.
If I was scott Brooks I would play 4 on 5 defense and have Bradley beal cherry pick at the other on. It would force the other wizard to try harder on defense and be on there toes to get the ball quick to beal.
Ah the Bradley Beal Special
Bradley Beal is seething at this stat line
Having a player like Bradley Beal is totally pointless for them right now. It is better to hope for another Bradley Beal in the future when it hopefully won't be totally pointless for that player to be on the roster because the rest of it won't be dogshit.
The Celtics wasn't part of a road back to back of which the starters had to play 36+ minutes due to Bradley Beal going for 60.. lol
So you can hope one of those assets turns into a player like Bradley Beal?
"Ted Leonsis' secrit thoughts:  ""Scott Brooks serves as the perfect tank Captain. We may lose Beal, but at least we get a shot in the lottery for a shot at a player that has a shot at becoming 1/2 the player that Beal is right now. Plus I don't have to pay anyone this way""  To quote my man Bradley  ""It starts at the top"""
"&gt;  I don't think I've ever really watched a game with him in it.   This is why no one cares about Bradley Beal. Well, this and the fact that they're not winning games."
I feel for him. Also he has only won 6 six games scoring 40+ out of the 24 such games in his career. \[[Source](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=bradley+beal+40%2B+point+games+won+and+lost+in+career)\]
John Wall and Bradley Beal were top tier on all time handsome backcourt
"Well I have zero idea why the coaches wouldn’t vote him in for the reserves. He’s definitely better than those 3 guys you named, but he’s rarely brought up in top 20 conversations, for God’s sake there are people who would think Ben Simmons is higher ranked in the league than Bradley Beal."
TIL that Bradley Beal is a scrub
"In 2004, Tracy McGrady won scoring champ on the 21-61 Magic, and in 1953 Neil Johnston won scoring champ on the 12-57 Warriors. Bradley Beal/Wizards are definitely on pace to join them."

Rounding out the bench with a back up wing, good defensive and passing guard who has improved his catch and shoot threes, and Harrell a former 6th man of the year winner."
We must save Private Bradley Beal.  Bradley Beal deserves to play on a team that is out to win.  What a wasted talent.
Gib pavers bradley beal so we can be actual championship contender. 😭
Get Bradley beal out of there man
"Bradley ""Bradley Beal"" Beal"
"I don’t think Steve Kerr has a losing recipe, the guy is 342-142. Warriors have a different offensive plan than most players are used to and they have a few new faces. They’ll catch up.  Bradley Beal is fine. Nothing wrong with the Wizards. Again it’s an adjustment period.  I’m sure Levine and Markanen are frustrated with some of Boylen’s coaching but they have no choice other then to persevere.  Losing Liangelo Ball would be tough on any team.  I learned what Sisyphus is."
me when Bradley Beal scores 101 points in 2 games and lose both of them  https://i.imgur.com/dnzEnly.jpg
"Hey can we get a gofundme set up for Bradley Beal? I'm not sure what for, just kinda seems like something should be done at this point and we can figure out the details later."
Bradley Beal is fun as fuck to watch..... just glad the rest of Washington decided not to show up
"Bradley Beal man, spooky."
"Man Pritchard and Ish Smith were the only serviceable PGs this game. Also, I love watching Bradley Beal play basketball."
Bradley Beal is a maniac but he's too proud to ask for a trade to play for a real team. I respect it but it's sad at the same time
"Rock bottom is when Bradley Beal demands a trade, causing his trade value to tank and forcing you into a possible 5+ year rebuild."
Bradley Beal for prime MJ. Who says no?
"This is going to sound insane, but Bradley Beal looks like what I think the elves look like in Artemis Fowl"
Man bradley beal has really evaluated himself to a borderline superstar but has no team to show for it...
Bradley Beal vs the Celtics get this man some help
Bradley Beal has the chance to be mvp this yr
Tell Tatum that every defender is Bradley Beal
I wish Jeff Teague was Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal is 1-3 in his 60 pt performances. That makes me nauseous for him
Maybe because Bradley Beal is a loser and he sucks. That's why no one gives him credit. Because he sucks.
Bradley Beal is definitely a weakness
Bradley Beal is gonna look back at his life and cherish all his achievements. Scoring many points per game... Losing a regular season game to a 6-1 team with an MVP candidate... Getting to the Reddit NBA sidebar...
I dunno if I believe Bradley Beal actually has an alliterative first and last name until I see the birth certificate. My sources say it’s very possible that his name is actually “Bradley Eel” and he’s been too polite to correct anyone this whole time
bradLey beaL
Bradley Beal just dropped 60 last night too. I will not stand for this abominable alliterative slander.
"Why does this surprise people? Curry is one of the most popular players in the NBA, Bradley Beal is not."
"Just an FYI, considering there was an attempted coup yesterday in the US, the NBA was probably hesitant to be postering the internet with Bradley Beal highlights.  Also they lost and also yeah he’s less popular than Steph."
"This just in, Steph Curry is more popular than Bradley Beal."
"Yeah, I mean, that's just marketing. No one cares about Bradley Beal or the Washington Wizards. Sad but true."
Yep. I’ll admit it. Not only did I watch stephs game live. I also watched the highlights. I didn’t watch any of the Bradley Beal stuff. Cause i don’t care about the wizards or Bradley Beal. The complaints are all warranted and correct.
"Good stats, bad team. Literally the Bradley Beal award.    Winning matters."
"2x MVP, 3X Champion and the greatest shooter ever is more popular than Bradley Beal.  Who would’ve imagined"
"Bradley Beal dropping crazy points while wizards still lose isn’t news, other than the fact that this time happens to be a career high and it actually got some coverage"
Who's Bradley Beal?
I know multiple women who follow him on IG because of his and his families overall cuteness. None of them know Bradley Beal.
"Bradley Beal didn't have a career night, he lost. Throw the game out."
"He's Bradley Beal, steph curry is steph curry. Y'all gotta stop this goofy shit, the big stars are going to get more coverage, this is known and how the world works"
[bradley beal sucks!](https://streamable.com/m7n3gc)
Bradley Beal missed the playoffs in the East last year. Then they added Russell Westbrook and are an astonishing 2-6 so far this year. Steph is a 2-time MVP and was the best player on the winningest team in NBA history. Is it really a surprise that his 62 points in a W get more coverage than Bradley's 60 points (3 in the 4th) in an L?
Beal will always be a legend and one of the realist in the NBA . . . the dude is physically gifted and basically the ideal 2 guard . . . i love Bradley Beal
One bradley beal please

😂😂😂😂Bradley Beal without question lol
"I feel like his link proves himself wrong. Beverley ranks above Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Damian Lilliard in career 3 point shooting."
"Who was more deadly tonight, Bradley Beal or the police at Capitol Hill?"
It’s the Bradley Beal curse. Always making career highs and losing the game.
Alaa is openly in love with Bradley Beal.
Bradley Beal has entered the chat
"As I’ve continuously said, Bradley Beal is the most underrated player in the league by far, and the fact he wasn’t an all-star last year, is an absolute travesty. With the right team, he’s an all-nba level talent.   But I have to give this guy his true credit in being all class with his situation. Him missing the all-star game and being so disrespected, plus having these fucked up scoring nights and still losing, I don’t know how he hasn’t asked to be traded yet. It has to be driving him crazy inside. He’s the 2nd best 2 guard in the league if you count Harden as one. If not, he’s the best. Yes, #1. He’s better than Booker and Klay when healthy. His total offensive package, ability to create his own shot and work whilst being the single focal point of the offense last year is second to none in this league. On a bad nignt, he’s dropping 23.   If this guy played with LeBron James he’d be considered a top 10 player, I’m sure of it."
"  Bradley Beal: ""I don’t count any of my career highs that have been in losses""  Also Bradley Beal: ""Throw them out the window with the other **two or three** I had.""   &amp;#x200B;  ....sounds like he's keeping count lol"
Bradley Beal: Shit hurt. But I’ll be alright.
Bradley Beal sucks.
Your daily reminder that Bradley Beal sucks and will never win a ring.
Bradley Beal still so underrated. He gets snubbed so often
"i only watch 76ers games, is Bradley Beal the greatest basketball player of all time?"
Bradley “60 points in a loss” Beal
Free Bradley Beal
I do not like playing against Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal isso good I’m sorry westbrook ruined his night
I do not like playing against Bradley Beal.
Bradley “In a Loss” Beal
"Seriously, get Bradley Beal the fuck out and get that man to a winning team.  &amp;#x200B;  What a damn game. Felt like there were stretches where both squads here truly could not miss. Happy to see us lock up defensively in those final few minutes. Incredibly impressive performance here. Not easy to win when a guy drops 60 against ya."
Russ threw some of the most atrocious passes in the fourth I’ve ever seen an his defense was even worse. Ish Smith totally outplayed him that quarter.  At least Bradley Beal helped me in fantasy tonight.
I am so irrationally angry for Bradley Beal
Truly the Bradley Beal experience tonight
"true, Bradley Beal probably does make quite a few Wizards fans pog"
"oh well i personally go off of pog, and ppg alone. bradley beal for mvp"
"If I were the Pelicans I would throw a Paul George type trade to get Bradley Beal.   Beal, Ingram, Zion would be sick."
That's... An extraordinary amount to get for Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal average 30ppg and didn't make the all star game. So...yeah No
even bradley beal and lavine didn't make it last year. so no.
Bradley Beal was the youngest to hit 700 three pointers at 24 years and 146 days old. That is about Donovan's current age so I'm guessing it's him.  Edit: that was in 2017 so it might have change since then.
"No need to put words in my mouth lol, they were garbage. Having the keys doesn’t mean it’s a nice car. Bradley Beal has the keys to the wizards rn, doesn’t mean they’re “in line to win a ring”, champ"
Kyrie needs to know his place and pass the ball instead of jacking up a shot early in the shot clock. Its. not a problem now but when he is going 6/20 while Harden is only take 12-14 FGA thats gonna be a big problem. There's a reason why Bradley Beal doesn't win games. Basketball is not a 1 on 1 sport man you have to make your teammates better to be great.
Bradley Beal - sorry I didn’t see the 25 and under part
Blink twice if you want to ship him out for Bradley Beal rn
You described Bradley Beal. Bradley Beals don't grow on trees.
Washington Wizards - Bradley Beal sounds like he could be a character in Harry Potter
"PHI gets : Beal, Rubio   WAS gets : Edwards, Beasley, picks   MIN gets : Simmons   Philly can make the money work with a couple of their expirings (Scott, Ferguson, Bradley, Poirier)"
I'm going to sit here and wait for Miami fans to say they need to trade the entire team for Bradley beal so we can get blow out by the cavs just like the nets.
Him and Bradley Beal some of my favorite non Sixers I would to love to have on my team
Bradley Beal
Best offensive player has been Bradley Beal
"The next closest was Bradley Beal with .46, then Jordan Clarkson &amp; Terrance Ross tied at .45, and 5th was Kevin Durant at .44"
"The thing that is very fascinating about the NBA today is that there is so many talented players on every team.  There are good teams and bad teams, but people like to pretend like every bad team doesn’t have any talented players and the narrative is always to try to drive those players away from those teams just trying to figure out how to build a cohesive roster.  For example, I really want the Wizards to figure it out!  They aren’t a bad team on paper, but they have issues with health and not enough time in the offseason.  But the media would love seeing Bradley Beal leave even with two years left on his current deal."
Bradley Beal
"Bradley Beal wins, that's who.  He goes from a lousy team to a legit contender"
Bradley Beal owners in fantasy
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"
No shit when I was taking a shower I was thinking damn. Bradley Beal is gonna catch a lot of shit if he leaves. To go to a contender. And then if he stays in Washington he’ll hear “But he didn’t win a ring”...players nowadays are damned if they do damned if they don’t
"Zach LaVine will be this year's Bradley Beal where he's snubbed.   I doubt the Heat have 0 All-Stars, one of them will make it, probably Bam.   The rest I agree with."
"If Denver ends up out of the playoffs then yeah, it'll probably be KD or Giannis or Bron.   Also Bradley Beal is having a career year leading the league of in scoring, but the Wizards are trash."
"I think Wiggins, the Minny Pick and however many Warriors future picks/ swaps get it done. Bradley Beal is in a  similar situation Harden was where he can dictate somewhat where he wants to go. He has two years left after this year which is basically one as his final year is a PO. For the Wizards if they can own every Warriors pick from 2022-2027 in the form of picks and swaps that potential has a ton of value. Curry, Klay, Draymond prob all wont be on the team 4-5 years from now. Westbrook still sells out tickets and Wiggins could be flipped later. Right now the most important asset to the Wizards should be draft picks. Beal will get moved its just a matter of when."
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
Watch Bradley Beal not make the all Star team again
"I like to pick cool players in the east who I like and watch their games. For example I like Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler so I end up watching a lot of raptors and heat games, and really liked the philly/toronto series. I like bradley beal, too, but I only watch their games when they're playing a good team."
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
Bradley Beal isn't the single best offensive player in the league (according to 538's model).
Wonder who’ll get Bradley Beal and have their odds shoot up
Bradley Beal doe
"Drawing fouls has always been part of basketball. Does Embiid exaggerate contact? Absolutely, just like Marcus Smart, Lebron, Bradley Beal, and just about every other contact drawing player in the league. It’s part of the game."
A Bradley Beal type would help them a lot
I love Bradley but if we traded Kyrie for Beal that would be suicide. We don’t need any more scoring.   I think at this point he may just not play as opposed to play somewhere he doesn’t want to. I think he deserves to get shipped somewhere like the Wizards though. So he can iso his way into the vet minimum like Iverson and regret wasting his youth being a diva.   I’m a big proponent for mental health and if the dude is having serious issues I’d rather him not play and address them. It’d be better for everyone involved.
Bradley Beal for Simmons and a first. Wizards are dumb if they don't take it.
"I've responded to every substantive point you made. And Ben Simmons played at an All-Star level that year, plus Covington, Saric, and Reddick all well above replacement level (I'm assuming you meant Simmons rookie year, since the 76'ers went 28-54 in Embiid's rookie season). Booker's Suns missed the playoffs. Wiggins and Lavine were absolutely *miserable* those years (and Wiggins hasn't really improved much since)- Lavine was literally one of the worst players to receive regular minutes in the NBA those first couple years. So, that's a swing and a miss on those.  The fact remains that basketball is a team sport, its not only possible but relatively common for good players to play on bad teams (KAT, Bradley Beal, pre-Lakers Anthony Davis, etc.), and literally ALL of the available evidence supports the proposition that KAT's positive impact is comparable to that of e.g. Jokic, and that the main difference is in their supporting cast."
"Did you even try on missouri? Bradley beal? Bill Bradley? Hansbrough is a UNC legend,  peeler ultimate high school and mizzou legend. But sure give Tatum both"
"I had that experience, where at a certain strength level I would actually regress if I went hard more than a couple days a week, and most of the week was just light work and stretching  To tie it back to the NBA, Bradley Beal said on JJ Redick's podcast that reducing his training volume was one of the hardest things for him to learn"
"Maybe a fringe all star, but can't see anything big like a Bradley beal or something"
Bradley Beal or KAT
"Bradley Beal seems like he could be up there. Especially if he's not enjoying Russ.   I figured he would just play out his extension then leave, but I would be shocked if he asked out in the next year"
"Bradley Beal, KAT, Lavine, and maybe John Collins soon"
"PG: 2018 Harden SG: Bradley Beal SF: 2008 Shane Battier PF: Pascal Siakam C: 2011-12 Tyson Chandler  Bench: Terry Rozier, 2013 Korver, Steven Adams  Harden and Beal can both play with or without the ball, score a ton, and run PnR with DPOY Chandler. Battier’s a great 3 and D wing, and Siakam fits well as the 3rd scoring option. Off the bench, Rozier is the 6th man, Korver adds another shooter, and Adams provides extra size/defense."
No Bradley Beal for Missouri???
"Man, Chaminade high school has produced some great talent between David Lee, Bradley Beal, and Jayson Tatum."
"Bradley beal is from st. Louis also, id put him over tatum"
"&gt; They absolutely do, regardless of whether Simmons wanted out or not. When you have the chance to land James Harden, you pull the trigger - period.   I'm not sure I agree with that, but we're going to get that answer by the end of the season, I guess.  &gt;It's not. Google 'Bradley Beal to Sixers'. You are uninformed and rude. Fuck off.  I've already brought up [Beal for Simmons](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kzyjo2/iko_even_with_simmons_right_there_for_houstons/gjtc31r/) as a better deal for the 76ers, so what the hell are you talking about uninformed? Do you not read the thread you're replying to?  And you're the only one being rude in this conversation."
"&gt; The 76ers don't need to find a trade at all.  They absolutely do, regardless of whether Simmons wanted out or not. When you have the chance to land James Harden, you pull the trigger - period.   &gt; It's literally the only offer we know about.  It's not. Google 'Bradley Beal to Sixers'. You are uninformed and rude. Fuck off."
And Bradley Beal is about to enter into a contract year 👀
I would say Bradley Beal is better than Tatum both all-time and currently for the state of MO
"Do you even know what the protections are? Did you not just watch last season having big men (who aren't gonna come to Nola willy nilly) for the regular season / when needed helped keep Toni and Lebron fresh? Last thing Zion needs is to be center by himself as he still learns the fucking game. Dude hasn't played 50 games and is going through rookie pains.   Sorry we can't just magically sign a bunch of shooters with non existent cap space and the small city of NOLA attracting no ring chasing vet mins.   Adams has been the best offseason addition for sure. Money we spent on him wouldn't be spent in the next two years on other free agents because honestly who are we attracting. JJ has been ice cold. Lonzo is hurt. Bledsoe is the only thing clearly not a good fit and we will likely move him at the deadline or in the offseason. NAW looks promising and could take leaps like his cousin SGA. Lewis looks like a late lottery pick. Pieces are there just we have to give it more than 15 games with little to no offseason.   Sure a stretch 5 would help. But who tf is out there that's playable that the Pels could have gotten. It's this myth. Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol were the only halfway decent ones. Both went to Los Angeles. So fuck off in saying we need a stretch 5. There ain't fuckin one. Of course adding a Bradley Beal and a Serge Ibaka to this team would have been ideal. Oh well. Young team, they'll grow and in 2-3 there will be a trade made for one of these guards like Booker, Beal, etc who will team up and then the Pels will be dominant. We're not 50 games into Zion and he's a walking 25 points."
You're out if your mind if you think Gasol is moving the needle in a Bradley Beal trade
The Los Angeles Lakers are going to need Bradley Beal to compete against the Brooklyn Nets. It’s looking like a Brooklyn Nets sweep at the moment.   Nets in 4.
Where is Bradley Beal ranked?
"I feel like there’s a trade between Washington and Denver that makes too much sense not to get done.   A pick, Troy Brown Jr &amp; Bradley Beal for Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.  I don’t do a lot of trade research or discussion so this may be one that’s been talked about a lot, but I think both teams benefit greatly from this."
And Bradley Beal should’ve made an All NBA team last year. His season was much better then Dipo’s one hit wonder season
"I guess you greatly overvalue the rookies. You're talking about a guy that got 5mpg his rookie season and his averaging 3.5 points on his second season on 13mpg  Now im higher on Achiuwa than most people, I agree he does have value. But I also thikn he has more value on the heat than he does on the Rockets, as we have many players to play his minutes  Just arent getting a 20/5/5 player on good efficiency that plays good defense, even as an expiring, for the 20th pick and a rookie that barely gets minutes, even on a team as shorthanded as the Heat this year  Your valuation of Bradley Beal seems even more off balance. Herro, while a good player, plus the 2 picks Miami can trade if they renegotiate the protections with OKC, is a lot less enticing, no matter the amount of swaps (which dont really matter since Bam is locked up for the scope of those swaps) than what the Wizards could get on the market for Beal, who isnt Harden, and will have a lot more suitors than Harden does. Beal fits the timeline of every team looking to make a push towards contention or playoffs, against almost every team in the league, that offer just isnt competitive what so ever.   It'd require a lot more to outbid other teams for Beal.  Also, its not me thats downvoting you, im enjoying this discussion"
Bradley Beal right now is better than even that one-season peak Oladipo. He's also 1 year younger.   So him.
"Hummm  You see, as long as the Heat keeps lowballing other FO's they arent going to get deals done. What you said above is nowhere close to what other teams would offer for Bradley Beal"
Bradley Beal?
"This is what I'd do:  **Minnesota Receive**: Ben Simmons  **76ers Receive**: Bradley Beal  **Wizards Receive**: Minnesota FRP (unprotected?) 2022/2024/2026 + pick swaps 2023/2025/2027, Anthony Edwards, Jarret Culver  Matisse Thybulle (PHI), Philly 2022 FRP (Top 15 protected, if not conveyed then 2 SRP)  Hawks FRP (Protected Top 20, 2022-2025, if not conveyed then SRP 2025/2026 conveyed), Tony Snell  **Hawks Receive**: Ricky Rubio  You could sub out the Hawks for a different team that you think could use Rubio more (maybe Blazers/Heat/Pacers/Bucks)."
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
"A younger player to fall in line with Embiid's timeline, and ideally someone who plays a good bit of defense since that's an important part of the 76ers gameplan.  Personally, I think *not trading Simmons* is also a better decision than trading for Harden and from what we're hearing that might have always been the 76ers plan, and they were just boosting up the price for the Nets.   Simmons hasn't had a great start to this season (to put it politely), but the kid has incredible amounts of talent, I would be hesitant to give up on him this quickly.   As many people in the NBA has said, for many teams (and in my opinion including the 76ers), Bradley Beal is a better target than Harden.  Sure, Harden is walking highlight reel in a way that Beal isn't, but we're still talking about a player who averages 35 points per game, is 5 years younger (and the same age as Embiid), plays solid (even if not DPOY-level) defense and plays a much more team-oriented game.   Now, is the Wizards still interested in trading Beal? We don't know. The rumors of him being on the way out has been going on for 2-3 seasons now, with the Wizards insisting there's nothing to them."
Then how about Harden vs. Reggie Miller? Or Allan Houston? Or Bradley Beal?
Bradley beal *** :)
Bradley Beal
I mean a little biased sure but what has Bradley beal done of significance? Put Kyrie on that wizards team I'm sure he averages 30+ points too
"I mean I get that, but 30/9 is impressive as fuck no matter what your situation is. Bradley Beal put up 30/6 on a trash team and he gets well-deserved love for it. Just seems like everyone’s been waiting for the chance to shit on Trae"
"No? His contract is fucking amazing. You’ll never get equal value in return for him. Unless they can convince Washington to take Shroder and Harrel for Bradley Beal, which will never happen in a billion years, there’s no reason to trade either of them."
"Understandable, kids looking good. Hornets do a good job playing around him too, seem like they know his strengths and limitations. Edwards? He’s having troubles with NBA defenses and they’re like “yeah just go cover Bradley Beal for 20 minutes”"
I understand the comparison but hield is more like a D-list Bradley Beal lol. He’s actually older than Beal. Wall was also better than fox at 23.
Kinda off topic but Buddy Hield is older than Bradley Beal. Idk why but thats just so shocking to me.
"On the other hand, if they can get Bradley Beal for Ben Simmons and, say, one first, then that’s a better deal."
Bradley Beal. The Pelicans
Free Bradley Beal
Broke: KD  Woke: Bradley Beal
Connecting the dots I do think Nets are gonna add Hassan Whiteside or Javale Mcgee using the disabled player exception and second round picks or buyout market. They probably want to see if anyone is bought out and how Claxton looks before pulling the trigger.  As you mentioned Robin Lopez is prob also on the radar but with Thomas Bryant hurt I'm not sure it is likely unless Bradley Beal is gonna get moved
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
"They can actually go big and sign someone like Bradley Beal straight up, IF he demanded a trade which i dont think the Washington Wizards would say No to, if Kyrie Irving is made available by the Nets. Or they can be smart about it, get some back up bigs  plus some draft picks. Did i sell low? I dont think so, the nets just gave up Jarret Allen and Caris Levert having some draft picks would serve them well in whatever situation they may be next season. Well Its actually hard to say when execs and front office view Kyrie as a huge distraction on and off the court. But the man can play no doubt so it would be interesting if wherever he might end up."
Bradley Beal and Ben Simmons can not be in the same tier
"Everything is true except Huncho being a key role player . But yeah that sucks , Denver needs to pull the trigger and get another star . Pref Bradley beal tbh"
Your team should at the very least have homecourt advantage in the playoffs for you to be an MVP. Otherwise Bradley Beal or Trae Young would have been in contention last season.
I wasn't expecting Luka 'Bradley Beal' Doncic this early in the season
"I would trade 3 1st round picks and Murray in a beat for someone like Bradley Beal. Jokic loves everyone, but Murray needs more ball in his hands and honestly he cannot get close to being a star worthy of pairing with Joker. For ex. Beal’s level of playing atm is way higher than Jamal’s will ever be, and he is consistent and more capable playing off the ball with Joker running the game for us than Murray is. I think Murray needs the ball more than he gets it now due to Joker organizing everything almost and just for that he needs either to be consistent and to adapt to it in a right way or to leave and blossom into a 25-5-7 point guard for some crappy team because he will honestly never see those numbers here on this Denver squad with his inconsistency and MPJ’s offensive upside."
This is like every Bradley Beal game lol.
The Bradley Beal of the West. He needs to get Dallas the W or they go below .500
The Bradley Beal experience
otherwise known as Bradley Beal on the Wizards.
Edwards athleticism is ELITE and he can shoot.   He has to get better at shot selection.   But He has a crazy amount of upside. Bradley Beal on steroids is his upside
"uhh if you're referring to Vucevic/the magic, he definitely isnt the player that in that trio who has ""consistently"" made the playoffs...  he's only played in 11 playoff games in his decade long career, compared to 40 for Bradley Beal (who is also 3 years younger)"
I would be too if Bradley beal was still on the market.
"Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Vucevic All NBA “Despite the loss” club"
That's never been a thing.  He was never ever being shopped just people making stuff up because they would rather see him elsewhere.  Sort of like Bradley Beal is always on the block even though he isn't.
Came here to say this. This is the Bradley Beal and Kevin Love (in Minnesota) effect.
Bradley Beal is pretty much the best outcome for Herro. I could easily see the heat giving up more than just him and FRP for Beal.
He went to the Bradley Beal school of scoring a lot and losing
Bradley Beal is who I thought Ben McLemore would be. I had higher expectations for Nerlens Noel too and Justise Winslow
You can see someone thinking Bradley Beal is the best offensive player in the NBA?  Really?
Best league ever  1 - Anthony Davis + LeBron James  2 - Giannis Antetokounmpo + Luka Doncic  3 - Joel Embiid + James Harden  4 - Nikola Jokic + Kawhi Leonard  5 - Kevin Durant + Steph Curry  6 - Rudy Gobert + Jimmy Butler + Damian Lilard  7 - Bam Adebayo + Paul George + Kyrie Irving  8 - Karl Anthony Towns + Jayson Tatum + Ben Simmons  9 - Draymond Green + Devin Booker + Chris Paul  10 - Kristaps Porzingis + Zion Williamson + Donovan Mitchell  11 - Clint Capela + Jaylen Brown + Bradley Beal
Pls.   Also does anyone else think that Bradley Beal is kind of cute? God damn
PG: Bradley Beal   SG: Bruce Brown   SF: Bogdan Bogdanovic   PF: Bojan Bodganovic   C: Bismack Biyombo
what are you talking about. There a bunch of solid FA options. We dont need to address a star this year as long as we build upon our success and guys like RJ and Randle improve stars will come to us   **2021 Free Agency**  * Kyle Lowry  * Mike Conley * CP3 (PO) * Kawhi Leonard(PO)   **2022 Free Agency**  * Zach Lavine * James Harden (PO) * Jimmy Butler (PO) * Bradley Beal(PO)
"Why did you do too 15? There are plenty of times in NBA history where the top 15 was significantly better than it is today. However, if you did top 50, then the top 50 of this era is much better than almost all other eras.   I mean just take a look at 1990. In no strict order, here are just 15 of the top players in 1990:  Michael Jordan  Magic Johnson  Charles Barkley  Hakeem Olajuwon  David Robinson  Karl Malone  Patrick Ewing  Isiah Thomas  John Stockton  Clyde Drexler  Chris Mullin  Dominique Wilkins  James Worthy  Kevin Johnson  Larry Bird (who was injured at that point but still put up 19.4/8.5/7.2 and was still a lot better than your 15th player Bradley Beal)  This doesn’t even include Bernard King (who was a former scoring champion who averaged 28.5 the next year), your young players like Tim Hardaway, Reggie Miller, or Mitch Richmond, and also someone like Tom Chambers who averaged over 27 a game that year."
"Definitely think he's more likely than not to make it onto 3rd team, but it's going to be partially dependent on how certain players are categorized. I think he'll definitely be behind Giannis and Kawhi, since they're forwards without any question. After those, you've got a number of players that could realistically be classified either way like Jimmy Butler and Paul George, depending on how voting pans out. There's also the slim possibility some really fucky position labelling where guys like Luka and Bradley Beal get considered as forwards so that people can fit more guards in.   He 100% should make one, but you can never say lock when it comes to the lower end all-NBA players."
"He's been fighting ""empty stats"" labels since year 2. Other players praise him, but a lot of fans viewed him how a lot of people currently view Zach Lavine or Bradley Beal: guys who supposedly get numbers but don't contribute to winning basketball. And while it's true Booker's time on our team has been a very rough patch, it's clearer now than ever that it was mostly about the team around him and the front office and the culture. Get a good team around him and Booker is still lighting it up, but now with added bonus of winning games."
"**PICK A TEAM FOR ME** (You can read this whole thing or scan the bold points.)   I've faded into and out of the NBA throughout my life. Since 2019, I've gotten back into the league. I'm still looking for a team to back though.  First off, I don't go in for supporting the big dogs. I support the **Pirates, the White Sox, and West Ham United.** I will usually try to support the home team, but I don't have an NBA home team. **I was born in a non-NBA town. I grew up in a non-NBA town. I live in a town where the closest NBA team is five hours away,** so there's no natural, regional connection. (Where I live currently I'm blacked out of Denver, OKC, and Minnesota. That's some bullshit there.)  As a young kid in the 80s, I supported the **Pistons. Liked Charles Barkley and Joe Dumars.**  As a teen in the 90s, I moved with Chuck Daly to the **Nets. Loved Petrovic, Coleman, and Kenny.** When Petrovic died, the Nets fell apart, and I moved on in life I stopped watching the NBA for about a decade.    In the late-00s I lived in Denver and followed the **Nuggets for a bit. They had some really lovable players like Chucky Atkins, Billups, and Camby. The short-lived Iverson experience** happened too. When I moved away I stopped watching NBA until early 2019.  Players I like right now: **Julius Randle, Bradley Beal, Sabonis, Giannis.**    **Give me your advice, especially with the playoffs coming, though it doesn't have to be a playoff team.**"
"?? Is this not the same exact thing people in this sub said about Anthony Davis for years? I know ya'll are gonna come back and say no, that's not what happened, but even recently I still see people say this about him. That he couldn't get it done in NOLA and he just had a bunch of empty numbers. Westbrook should not be immune to people questioning his intentions and whether he's capable and pushing himself and his team to the next level in the sport. He's certainly getting paid like he should be. I don't see why some of you are offended at someone daring to question why someone getting 200 million dollars has 17 wins on the season isn't catching some heat about not putting the team on his back. The triple doubles are fine, they're great, but how much does that really matter with 17 wins? The Wizards stink and it isn't because of covid. Westbrook and Bradley Beal have some explaining to do and someone calling them out about it isn't crazy at all."

"&gt;Victor Oladipo (top 30 player)  Not when he played with Westbrook he wasn’t. They lost to the 3 seeded rockets, led by Harden, why would he be expected to win that series.   &gt;Paul George (top 10 player)  They lost in the first round in 2017-18 cause of PG tbh, idk how you can blame Westbrook when he puts up 45 and 46 in games 5 and 6.   And in 2018-19 they lost to the 3 seeded Trailblazers as the 6 seed. Dame was playing out of his mind that series, especially in game 5.   &gt;James Harden (top 5 player)  Injuries plagued that offseason, and they lost to the eventual champions, the Lakers, who have two top 6 players in the league, and the Rockets who had no real big men in their lineup.   &gt;Bradley Beal (top 10 player)  That team is god awful outside of Beal and Westbrook.   We need to stop with all this Westbrook hate and just appreciate him while he’s still in the league. Just because a player doesn’t get it done in the playoffs doesn’t mean he’s not capable of winning.   Take CP3 for example, one of the best winners in the NBA, look at what he’s done for Houston, OKC and now the Suns, and what just cause he doesn’t have a ring that his ability to elevate teams isn’t incredible?    There are 4 (3ish) guys in the league right now who are proven to be capable of delivering a ring, Lebron, Kawhi, Steph, and KD. That doesn’t mean than the other superstars and hall of famers in the current NBA are incapable of winning."
\&gt;Bradley Beal (top 10 player)
"Bradley ""get clapped"" Beal"
"He was built and trained(like a madman) for today’s game. An even better scoring Bradley Beal, imagine that"
Everyone fails with Westbrook. Thats a fact. Friken Bradley Beal can’t even make the 8th seed with Russ.
What are y’yall on man? The “eye test”? Well i watched all the wizards games that year and Bradley Beal should have walked away with it
"Like u/ThatBull_cj noted, you're using possessions/game for 48min here rather than possessions played by these players. Luckily [nba.com has possessions played by each player.](https://go.nba.com/tm0a) Using those and the data above, you have the % of possessions played that each of these players is doubled, below.  1 Luka Doncic (DAL)  **38.4%**  2 Trae Young (ATL)  **37.9%**  3 Damian Lillard (POR)  **32.8%**  4 James Harden (BKN)  **30.8%**  5 Chris Paul (PHX)  **35.2%**  6 Bradley Beal (WAS)  **29.1%**  7 De'Aaron Fox (SAC)  **29.8%**  8 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC)  **31.1%**  9 Ja Morant (MEM)   **31.7%**  10 Stephen Curry (GSW)  **28.9%**"
"Also, let’s just take a peek at the advanced stats. All of the top players actually have excellent advanced stats. So where’s Westbrook rank?  PER: 75th Box Plus/Minus: 50th WS/48: 167th Win Shares: 200th Real Plus/Minus: 56th RAPTOR: 224th  By comparison Bradley Beal is actually around top 20 in most of those stats. Teams that actually have two top-15 players like the Lakers and Clippers are contenders, and not a well under .500 10th seed. But yeah, Westbrook is easily top 15, right there with Kyrie, Luka, Paul George, Giannis and Harden."
If you count that Bucks team as a superteam then yeah literally every player on Erving's list was on a superteam (and almost every championship team in NBA history was a superteam too).   Tail end or not all 3 were all-stars. Don't you think the Lakers would have been a superteam if they added an all-star like Kawhi or Bradley Beal? Or would they get a pass because Lebron is old? Heck people try to call the Lakers a superteam now as they are constructed.   Age doesn't matter performance does. That Sixers team had 3 all-stars. So did the 97 Rockets. So they were superteams.
I like Bradley Beal but man do I hate the idea of him winning the scoring title over Steph
Bradley Beal is option 1 on the wizards and the focus of the other teams defense. CJ McCollum isn't.   Scott Brooks also doesn't know how to design an offense.

I love you Westbrook but nobody should have been taking that shot other than Bradley Beal.
I love Bradley Beal very much

I say somewhere between Corey Maggette and Bradley Beal.  Maybe an elite scorer equivalent to Devin Booker.

"You might be right, but you’re probably underselling just how dominant AD would be next to a different good creator. As great as the Lebron/AD thing is there are actually advantages to pairing him with a smaller player. Teams will switch a ton of these PnR with Lebron, but if you put Beal in that situation it gets harder to do that and Davis probably gets more downhill opportunities.   AD won’t initiate elite level offense but what he does do is make capable ball handlers look a lot better. Guys like Jrue and Rondo were not the best creators, but AD helps them get to a different level. I don’t buy that AD necessarily needs a Lebron level player to be on a WCF type team. He’s supremely capable of leading a great playoff defense and then is a number 2 on offense who still creates in unique ways. I bet if you placed a Bradley Beal type player next to him with this level of defensive talent and a reasonable offensive supporting cast, they’d be a serious threat in the playoffs and we would be talking about how great the ball handler suddenly looks.   In any case, I wouldn’t make too much out of what the Lakers do with just Davis right now. He’s clearly not in his usual form, maybe on either end."
We'd have to get someone who averaged like 30pts per game to make it worth it imo.  Like Bradley Beal. But I don't see us getting that.
bradley beal is so fucking good at the game known as basketball

Bradley Beal carry me in the Fantasy this season. Hope they make the playoffs. I'll be rooting for my boy
Bradley Beal knows his Greek warriors!
"That’s Doctor Bradley Beal MD, to you, OP"
"[Reminder that Bradley Beal once said Delly was the best one on one defender in the NBA.](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/qa-bradley-beal/)  This doesn't really have anything to do with the game, but I had a laugh thinking about it.  The tank rolls on, I guess."
Bradley “~~despite the loss~~ cause of the win” Beal (please be okay)
The Wizards' Big Three Era is here.  Russell Westbrook.  Bradley Beal.  Daniel Gafford.  (shoutout to raul neto he been fire these last games)
Mr LeBron I think you should sign me to the Lakers instead. Trust me I’m better than this Bradley Beal scrub and will sign for the minimum
"Watching Westbrook get bounced out of the first round with Paul George TWICE, and now possibly not even making the playoffs in the Eastern Conference (weakest division) alongside Bradley Beal doesn’t answer this question for you?"
Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic are laughing at your love of Bradley Beal right now.
No because Bradley Beal wasn’t as efficient and didn’t pass that well and lost a shit ton of games. Stop being dense
He looks like Bradley Beal just a little bit
Lmao does that make Bradley Beal the best player in the nba last year? There’s more to the game then a star line.
How I'd Bradley Beal younger when Tatum is 17 Marv?
"Bradley Beal took a while to get going last game too, coming back from his injury so it could really go either way. Tatum could be cooking but maybe Robert Williams sets the tone in defense."
So they’re not going to trade for Bradley Beal? I thought he was their missing piece
I know Bradley will Beal happy if he plays
I read a post years ago mentioning how Bradley Beal would forever be limited due to a certain condition... Did I read that wrong? Or is Bradley Beal now healthy?
Bradley Beal in shambles
2021 Washington Wizards Bradley Beal —&gt; Shaun Livingston —&gt; Brendan Haywood —&gt; Chris Whitney —&gt; Ledell Eackles —&gt; Jeff Malone —&gt; Greg Ballard —&gt; Wes Unseld —&gt; Bob Ferry —&gt; 1961 Chicago Packers Walt Bellamy.
"Damn, play-in legend Bradley Beal about to have his record erased."
Bradley Beal joins the Celtics in free agency and Zack LaVine joins the Sixers while Simmons gets traded for elite role players and a shit ton of picks and the Celtics and Sixers are in the Ecf for the next decade and you’ll like it
"See all this bullshit that you and other people who discredit Westbrook spew can be undone by asking this simple question.  Without Westbrook, would the wizards even be in the play-in or even have a chance at playoffs?  The answer is no, there isn’t even an argument. Take Westbrook off and all we are left with is post on this sub titled Bradley “despite the loss” Beal. I don’t know what’s so hard with saying the words “ Westbrook is a top player in the league” but it’s honestly make y’all look silly. Y’all talk about nuance I guess as a buzz word but I get the feeling from comments that y’all don’t know what the word means."
Harden for Bradley Beal would have changed the league A LOT
Westbrook with 28/13/14 and Bradley Beal with 46/2/3  Final Score: Wizards - 111 : Brooklyn 147
How about 25/20/20 plus a Bradley Beal 40/5/5?
"Good idea let’s just look at PPG, congrats Steph on your MVP, congrats Bradley Beal on your runner up."

How could we forget top 15 all time great Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal?
I mean if we're gonna go as far back as 2006 then TS% is pretty useless hear without comparing it to league average at the time.   Unless you think Bradley Beal is a better scorer than Michael Jordan lol

"Bradley Beal, the man is a pleasure to watch, silky smooth on offense"
"52-20 is pretty solid but doesn't really have any special meaning towards the rest of the league. When you extrapolate it across a normal season its less than 60 wins, and we've already seen many historic 60+ win teams. As for making 10+ 3 pointers in every game, that can be attributed to faster pace as well as the game transitioning more towards the 3 pt line. While it is an interesting tidbit, it's not super incredible.  In comparison, Steph Curry was in a close battle with Bradley Beal the past month for scoring title which was held by Beal for like 3/4 of the season. He also scored 46 points in a super crucial do or die game that had heavy implications for the playoffs (warriors secure the 8th seed which means 2 chances in the playins vs 1)."
"I think the Nets are gonna win the East if everyone’s healthy, but knowing Russ I know he’s gonna try his absolute hardest. I believe in him and Bradley Beal. They can definitely steal a game or two at max."
"Remember the ""Free Bradley Beal!"" talk? And look how they turned the season around."
"Jordan reminds me a lot of a young Bradley Beal.  The guy has been really, really good in any chance he’s gotten to play."
He’s gonna be on that Bradley Beal level of offense soon. He’s so fucking good and scary thing is he hasn’t even gotten past the top of the iceberg in terms of using his body and gifts
Yo I remember when Bradley Beal was so ahead of everyone else
Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook
Memphis vendetta against Bradley Beal.
It’s when Westbrook kinda took over coaching no joke. Westbrook had an intervention asking each player what’s your role?  https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/team-meeting-led-russell-westbrook-and-bradley-beal-helped-spark-wizards
Yeah. But with Bradley Beal clearly fucked up the Wizards  don't have a single snowballs chance in Hell.  It's just gonna be russ going mad and getting swept in 4. With a fully healed Brad he at least had somewhat of a chance.
Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal
BRADLEY FUCKING BEAL
"We wanted Bradley Beal, not Badly Beal."
This Bradley Beal situation is a joke.  Everyone should be ashamed.
i'm not totally sure if Bradley Beal in his current state is more productive to winning this game than Ish Smith
Bradley Beal needs to sit.  He's practically limping around the court.
"Wizards had me thinking they could win this game and have a puncher's chance of beating the Celtics to earn the 7th seed, but if Bradley Beal is gonna try to play through an injury, I don't know if they'll make it past the play-in games at all."
"Jokic, kickout to… BRADLEY BEAL?!?!"
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
"You're right, he's not carrying one of the worst rosters in the game to 38-33 in the ridiculously stacked West. Westbrook though is doing much better. 33-38 10th seed in the East and he only has Bradley Beal on his team.  Terrible troll or actually one of the dumbest things I've ever read on this sub"
"Pretty much, yeah.  Honestly, the goal is going to be a championship.  So to me, the question is more or less who is the worst player you can build around that gives you a realistic shot at a chip.  *Generally* that's only top 10 players (or guys who project to be top 10 players).  Arguably like top 6-7 even.    And Gobert himself is something of an exception.  You look at other players in the top 11-15 range and you get guys like PG and Bradley Beal.  And not to talk shit about them, but I don't really think teams with those guys as their best player are championship contenders.  Gobert is ranked worse than those guys, but because he's so good at a specific thing it allows the team that is built around his specific skills to be better.    So to sum up, I want cornerstones who project to be the best players on championship contenders.  That's either top 10 guys right now, and guys who project to be top 10 players at their peaks (Zion, as an example).  And Gobert, who is absolutely an outlier.    Granted I might just be biased, but this all makes sense in my head."
Bradley “David Robinson” Beal.
it’d be cooler and more manly if curry played despite it lowering his odds for the scoring title. would be a nice gesture towards bradley beal.

"Really just meant this recent run of trying to add a star to Tatum/Brown core. Horford was great but that was a while ago now.  At the time, kemba was regarded pretty closely to what Bradley Beal is now. I dont think that was all that predictable."
hot take Bradley Beal (who is only 27) Will be better than all these guards except for Luka and Trae
"Would you rather have Ricky Rubio or Bradley Beal and KD? An elite playmaker that isn’t an elite scorer isn’t as useful as an elite scorer that isn’t an elite playmaker, especially not two of them."
"Dame started being recognized because he started campaigning for himself as an all star in the media.  Lebron does this every year with MVP and DPOY this season.  Devin Booker starts crying about not making the all star team and he's in the next year.  Bradley Beal cries because he missed the all star team averaging the most points ever by someone who didn't make it. Next season he's starting.  If Trae wants the attention, he's gotta create some drama."
"Bradley Beal is the only guy who can score on the Wizards and the Sixers are giving him all the defensive attention, and he's still scoring 30+ every game. The Nets have three guys like that except they're better. Not to mention they have the best 3 point specialist in the playoffs and bench guys who would probably start on a lot of other teams. I'm rooting hard for the Sixers but it would take a miracle to get past the Nets."
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."

Or Bradley Beal
The dude gets paid 41 million per year.  Bradley Beal gets paid 25 mill.   LeBron gets paid 39 mill.  Let that sink in.  The idea that he's untouchable because he's playing a good playoff team would be laughed out of here if it was LeBron or Steph.
Maybe i got carried away. It wasn't perfect but other than Bradley Beal getting most of the points for Washington I'm happy with our lead and play
Just one of those Bradley Beal games tbh
Bradley Beal will go off and we still beat the Wizards. How many times have we seen this?
Can bradley Beal carry russ trash ass to at least a 5 game series? It'd be a miracle gentleman
bradley beal is such a bucket
Bradley Beal did this
"I mean, he’s certainly not the main piece, I’ll say that much. If you think someone like the Wiz are trading Bradley Beal for a package built around Tyler Herro you’re dreaming.   He’s a an okay scorer (pretty good 3-pt shooter but below average inside the arc), average rebounder and passer, and below average defender. He also has average at best physical tools. Again, he’s not valueless, but he’s not a centerpiece of any deal for a star."
Bradley Beal has one year left and could very much be available.
Bradley Beal? Donovan Mitchell?
"&gt;RJ/KCP/Tobias/Marcus Morris/Andre  I can't believe you threw this out there as a lineup he should have gotten more from. The fact he got this line up to the playoffs is an accomplishment in and of itself. You expect a Detroit team with no 20ppg scorers, no allstars, no notable defenders, and no notable depth to win a playoff seriers? This team made it over      \- a young Wiz with John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter, Markief Morris, and Marcin Gortat   \- the Bulls with Derrick Rose-Jimmy Butler-Taj Gibson-Nikola Mirotic     And that detroit roster only got worse every year.     What is there to defend? The Pelicans best player is 20 and has played 1 season of NBA basketball. Literally. 85 games. Did I say this year was a success? No i didn't say that anywhere. They underperformed, they underperformed by 3-4 wins."
"Idk if you caught the Bucks-Heat pregame last night, but Shaq had some stupid hot take about how Giannis is a DPOY but Simmons is a wannabe DPOY.. because Giannis shuts up and shows it on the court, and he needs Simmons to do that instead.   It was like, did Shaq even watch the Wiz game? Simmons clamped up Beal multiple times. You're not gonna hold him to 10 pts when we're talking an elite offensive player like Beal. All you can do is slow him down and make him work for it. I mean... it's Bradley Beal, not Jimmy Butler"
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors — Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats – 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats – 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers’ defenders but couldn’t do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam’s field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim. Siakam had very little success the few times he tried to drive on Simmons as well. Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he’s done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he’s kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87. That’s a combined field goal percentage of 29.8."
Was it the Wizards GM? Can I interest him in THT and salary filler for Bradley Beal?
- Trae Young is a system player. He’s a very capable shooter but his game took a huge turn with a coaching change rather than himself changing his game.  - Bradley beal can’t be a team’s first option  - TS % is one of the useless stats to compare players.  - Ben Simmons was at fault but Doc Rivers gotta share the blame too for constantly underachieving.  - Spurs have no plan for the future and their roster construction shows.  - Middleton and Holiday are both top 20  - NBA players don’t respect Giannis enough.
"It's really hard to read player ceilings, but I think so.  For Cade, the level of shooter he is is gonna decide his ceiling IMO. He's gonna be a good defender, his passing is like B+ and can maybe get to A-,  it he's always gonna be very limited athletically. He's not as gifted a player as someone like Luka.   &gt; But I watch Green and it’s tempting. I see a 6’6 Bradley Beal with a 47 inch vertical. He’s gonna be the highest scoring rookie we’ve seen in a LONG time and that’s no cap. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if he got 25ppg his rookie year.  Agree on everything, especially the Beal comp."
Lebron James is the best player in the trade. Bradley Beal is the best piece. Beal has many many many more years to play compared to Lebron.
Wizards/Bullets  Gilbert Arenas  Bradley Beal  Bernard King  Chris Webber  Moses Malone
"Would this lead to teams tanking or fighting to get a specific playoff spot in the hopes of nabbing that player they want at the end of round one? You raise a good point about the Hawks only ending up with Rose/Randle.   One of the things that gets missed in thought experiments like this - fun as they may be - is how to incorporate a new player into your defensive and offensive schemes quickly so as to not disrupt what helped you win the last series. But it's really tough to pass up the prospects have having a top 5 or 10 player in the league added to your roster.  Jazz v Grizz (1 v 8) - Take Ja Morant   Suns v Lakers (2 v 7) - Take Lebron (pray he holds up or doesn't end up brawling with Crowder in practice)   Nuggets v Blaze (3 v 6) - Take Dame   Clippers v Mavs (4 v 5) - Take Luka  Sixers v Wiz (1 v 8) - take Beal   Nets v Cs (2 v 7) - take Tatum   Bucks v Heat (3 v 6) - This is so bloody tough. Don't want Butler because he can't shoot. Don't want Bam even though his D is great - he can't shoot or create for himself. I can't believe I'm saying this - Duncan Robinson   Hawks v Knicks (4 v 5) - Take Rose (6th man, keep in Trae's ear)  Jazz v Clippers - Closer but the Clips prevail. Take    Suns v Nuggets - Nuggets take Devin Booker from the Suns in a close series - yes, I'm aware the Suns have Lebron. It becomes too many cooks in the kitchen with Dame, Joker, and Lebron. Save yourself the headache and take the hot hand.  Sixers v Hawks - I think the funk of the Process can't be solved by Bradley Beal. Hawks. Take Matisse Thybulle for his sick defense and not needing to run a lot of plays for him.   Nets v Bucks - Nets win with two guns. Take the Freak.  Nuggets v Clippers - Nuggets rip the Clips. Take Rondo to put in as your closer, 2nd team general. Keep your Playoff P away from me!  Nets v Hawks - I think this series would be really close. But I think the Nets prevail. Take Giannis.  Nuggets v Nets - Close series. But I think the Nuggets would squeak this one out. Do they get to take KD for game one of the 2021-22 season?"
"&gt;vs. Tatum, Brown and let’s say Bradley Beal,   The thing here though is you know you can land Lillard in this scenario vs. **hoping** you can bring in that 3rd guy.   I'd also guess Washington trades Beal before letting him reach UFA. It feels like the days of all-star level players walking in free agency are essentially done. Teams just realize they cant afford to get nothing in return."
"I would love Dame here but I don’t think we can get him without giving up Jaylen, and the idea is to bring in a 3rd star, but not sure we will have the cap space/assets if we bring in Lillard, especially going forward when he’s making $50M in a few years  If you’re telling me in 2 years if I want a team of Tatum + Lillard vs. Tatum, Brown and let’s say Bradley Beal, I think the second option makes more sense even if Lillard is better than both Brown and Beal. I think we’re trying to keep both Jays and bring in a third guy to contend.  I think the Knicks are a potential landing spot since they have a lot of good young talent and the cap space to take on his massive contract. We’re capped and our young guys just aren’t as good of an offer to a team that’s rebuilding (some mix of Barrett, Quickley, Robinson, Toppin vs. Pritchard, Nesmith, Time Lord, Langford)"
&gt; Sixers fans should accept that the best possible move is finally holding Simmons accountable and addressing his offensive shortcomings unless a Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal type player forces their way out.
"Any rational Sixers fan knows that there are maybe a handful of moves that would actually make the Sixers better next year and a CJ for Simmons swap isn’t one of them. Sixers fans should accept that the best possible move is finally holding Simmons accountable and addressing his offensive shortcomings unless a Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal type player forces their way out. The only other possible moves I can see that would work would be something with the Spurs for Murray and a Sign and Traded DeRozen? Gives the Sixers a PG with solid defense and a closer in DeRozen, but only works if he wants to play in Philly. Could do something similar with Lowry but I would assume the Sixers would want more than just Lowry and Toronto has no reason to do that unless they think they can fix Simmons AND pair him next to Siakam."
Bradley Beal is right there.
&gt;or even a Bradley Beal   No thank you
"Not sure what the record is in those games, but Bradley Beal averages more points for his career against the Bucks than against any other team."
I don’t think you realize how good Bradley Beal is
Bradley Beal
"#Perfect offseason  Tatum recruits Bradley Beal during the olympics, he requests a trade to Boston and we trade Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, and a decade of picks and swaps for him  #Realistic offseason   Re-sign Fournier to a 3 year deal around 40-45m   Trade for a good starting PG like Derrick White or Ricky Rubio  Agree to a cheap extension for Timelord"
"Marv Albert: ""Now they're saying Jayson Tatum and Bradley Beal will become the next hosts of Jeopardy"""
"Most players on the OKC Thunder are better/have more potential than Kuzma. Why take on his contract when they can keep the money for when they need it? Laker fans have to realize that not every team is salivating over role players. You guys were the same people who said that Kuzma, THT, KCP, and this years first would get you BRADLEY BEAL. Any opinions from your franchise’s fans are automatically invalid from that alone."
"Sixers fans immediately after they lost to the Hawks - ""all we need is a league average point guard to replace Simmons!""                                     One, Simmons helps you win in the regular season, that's already proven. High seeding helps you avoid difficult matchups in the post season. Simply removing Simmons from the equation won't change anything, you're being ousted in the first round....you know, like what happened last season when Ben missed the playoffs entirely even though Joel averaged 30+ for the series....the team still got swept. As much as the Simmons hate commentary will get you karma, it still misses the point of his value.                  You need to get something much more than a league average point guard. Who is that anyway? Schroeder? Would he move the needle enough to get the team a championship? No a chance in hell. What they're also ignoring and what is truly the elephant in the room for the franchise, something none of their fans want to admit, is Embiid's long and constant injury history. What happens when he's on the bench recovering from his latest ailment? Who is going to step up? You think Tobi + 'league average PG' is going to get you wins when Joel isn't playing? Again, no chance in hell.             What they really need is another superstar to help take the load off Embiid and carry the team when he's off the floor, because he's going to be off the floor *a lot,* as he has been his entire career. So the least you want is Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum aint gonna be that guy, but in reality you're looking for another top ten player and the only way you're getting that is if someone demands a trade because after the Hawks series nobody is going to consider a Simmons centric trade for their franchise player. They will hang up very quickly but not before laughing very loudly in your ear.             Going back to Beal, you honestly thing the Wizards are going to want to pair Simmons with Westbrook? That could be the most ill fitting All Star pairing in the entire league. Washington are going to want a lot more than just Ben, they will demand young talent in the form of a Maxey or Thybulle. Sixers will balk at that. But at least an Embiid-Beal pairing would give them a much better chance of competing for championships though would you even put them above the Bucks? A healthy Nets team is going to obliterate them....and that's without knowing what changes the Nets will be making next season, what holes they are going to try and fill. Honestly, this was *the* best chance for the Sixers to go all the way, it's almost comical how many obstacles were removed from their path - Lakers and Nets being the biggest ones, both taken out of the equation...but they blew it and may never have a chance again given the Nets might just be at the beginning of a multi year dynasty."
"Imagine posting this pretending that Brad Beal has ever gotten to a conference finals as a best player on a team lmao  I know you are trying, but Trae young could play like complete shit and lose the next 3 games by 70 points and he'd still have accomplished more than Bradley Beal has ever accomplished"
Bradley Beal 150% is not a superstar. He has less name recognition than Giannis or even CP3.
Bradley Beal? The three quarters man? Naw
"If they draft Mobley, could they pull something around an Allen sign+trade paired with Sexton for someone like Bradley Beal? Idk if the rules allow a trade like that, but I think you could build a decent deal around that framework."
3 Way trade with the Wizards Sixers and Wolves  Simmons sent to Minnesota  Firsts and young guys + Dlo sent to the Wizards  and Bradley Beal to the Sixers

"Green could be like a Bradley Beal player but better, well worth the risk"
"There is no way Simmons puts the Blazers into championship contention. If they trade with Boston, neither Tatum or Brown would be sent over. Someone like Bradley Beal however, would be amazing alongside Lillard."
"In my opinion i dont think so. Look at devon booker, he was on a terrible team having great numbers and he didnt make his first all star team till last year and he barely made it. If im not mistaken he was a replacement. Same goes for bradley beal."
"I dont think he gets all those all nba teams to be honest, he may not even have as much all star games (maybe 2 or 3). Lets remember, voters and coaches like taking into account the team record, the better your teams record the more praise and attention you get. How many guys miss the all star team every year because even though their numbers are good their team is bad (Devon Booker and Bradley Beal come to mind im recent years). Also how many guys make the all star team because their team is good but their numbers are not all star level. Inside the NBA literally has this argument every year where shaq will say how team record shouldnt be taken into account but charles and kenny say the opposite. The same argument goes for season awards."
"If Bradley Beal demanded a trade to the Kings along with Kawhi Leonard and Zion Williamson they would have the best “big 3” in the West and would be favourites in the conference……nobody cares about your whiney “what ifs”. Bron got hurt and that sucks but the whole league is hurt, he’s the best player on the planet.  Just let some team have their moment without making it about the Lakers"
"""x trade for Bradley Beal makes perfect sense"" - people with no sense"
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"Draymond Green said a few days ago that he’s one of the toughest players to guard - “that kid is so fast. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.” Bradley Beal also says that he’s destined for greatness. I think he can be super elite on offence, but his defence needs improvement. This kid is only 21 years old!!!Give me a player that you can realistically see as his ceiling - I see glimpses of Beal or Kyrie in his game"
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
It’s also too overconfident and unrealistic for the Raptors to think that a 4th pick would be equal value for Bradley Beal and that a 24 year old Ben Simmons would be given away by the Sixers for the twilight years of Kyle Lowry.
We could be a contender with a few trades. Package Boucher + GTJ + Jalen Harris and a future first for Bradley Beal.

Jalen green will be great value Bradley Beal
All bad trades. Philly should gun for Bradley Beal and upgrade the pg position for a 2 way guard or let maxey start
"He's got a point, the NBA is trash at marketing like half its teams and their players. Bradley Beal is out there averaging 30 a game and the only thing we hear about him is how the wizards should trade him"
have you heard of bradley beal? that trade doesnt make sense though.
"because this is about Westbrook, not Bradley Beal"
"“Apathy on defense” does not sound familiar. He’s easily the hardest working defender in the league probably. Had Matisse not slapped Huerter on the head, we’d be talking about how Simmons’ defense had Trae shook in the final minute. Outside of box score watchers, Ben Simmons dominated Bradley Beal in their playoff matchup."
&gt;Bradley Beal  No.
"I think it depends. I think the Sixers try to play hardball with his value and pretended the playoffs don't exist and see if anyone bites in regards to some of the more coveted stars on the market. I think they come back realizing they're not going to get Bradley Beal without giving up pics and other young players. They could probably get CJ McCollum I would imagine so it comes down to does demarre even want to go to Philadelphia oh, and who would the Sixers prefer of those  two mid-tier Stars. I definitely think the Spurs would do that in a heartbeat"
Create Bradley Beal to Lakers trade ideas
"Maybe, but how much more does Beal give you than what Curry gave them in this series. I know Beal's better than Seth, but Seth was a beast this series for the most part for the Sixers, and all you're really doing is transferring that scoring to another player that might be a bit more efficient this series, and then *maybe* you beat the fifth seed Hawks. Big deal. Let's not pretend beating the Hawks was Philly's goal this year. The fact that they lost is embarrassing, but even scraping a win probably doesn't change shit for them in the big picture. They literally have no one doing what Lowry would have provided them, so his impact to the Sixers would be ***way*** bigger to their team than Bradley Beal. Beal is a great name brand player to throw in there, but what does he really change for that team? Their gaping flaws still exist. Beal's a fantastic scorer, but he isn't what they need to really contend. Maybe I'm biased."
"Bradley Beal for Ben Simmons would be the worst trade in NBA history, and is exactly the kind of move I would expect the Wizards to make."
"Yeah it was a pretty horrible point to begin with, shit bradley beal got more all-nba’s than trae lmfao I guarantee you he won’t be missing one for a longgggggg time now that people have actually seen him play"
"In my mind I was thinking why not keep jimmy and trade Simmons for someone who can shoot. But at that time it seemed like a far fetched idea to give up Simmons so early.   But looking at it now, it was the perfect time to do that when his trade value was at its highest.   They legit could have got Kyle Lowry plus OG, or Bradley Beal, or even Harden or CP3 or so many other options which are al much better than Simmons."
yup he is  edit: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/team-usa-basketball-jayson-tatum-bradley-beal-devin-booker-commit-to-play-in-tokyo-olympics-per-reports/
I'd much rather have Lowry than Bradley Beal and he's not that much worse than Lillard either
Stephen A Smith is all: “you can trade Ben Simmons for CJ McCollum or Bradley Beal!” —only if those GMs never want another job in the Nba.
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
This sub loves coming up with garbage trades for Bradley Beal.
"Rough trade outline (we can quibble about number of picks or adding some young players):  Sixers receive: Bradley Beal   Blazers receive: Ben Simmons  Wizards receive: CJ McCollum + 2 Portland FRPs and 2 Sixers FRPs   Lillard and Simmons do their best Curry-Draymond impression. Sixers get a great scorer. Wizards either come to terms with the reality, start a rebuild and trade CJ for more picks OR they do the usual and fight for the play-in."
Bro out here trying to swing a 2k level trade for peak career Bradley Beal lol
"I think some of this is a bit reductive. I think a better view is that scoring is always a necessary part of a great players game. You're looking at Harden's playmaking and noticing that Curry doesn't do that to the extent that Harden does. Yet, Curry&gt;Harden or at least they're comparable. You conclude that playmaking isn't as important as we thought. Problem is that you're ignoring all the ways Curry impacts the outside of scoring. That's what's making up for Curry's perceived lack of playmaking (emphasis on perceived). He's an offball superstar. Bradley Beal is a scoring ability is comparable to both Curry and Harden (not as good, but not far off). If scoring is 95% of it all, he would be considered a much better player. It's also worth mentioning that every offensive skill leads to easier scoring, so there's some redundancy going on here. I definitely agree that defensive ability is often overrated though"
"Okay, Lillard to Philly? Bradley Beal to Philly?"
"But that's the point. There's a fair bit of luck involved in the draft.  Look at the 2017 draft. How many of the guys in the top 10 have been worth their draft pick? Tatum and ... maybe that's it? Maybe Fox. Lonzo's probably earned a top 10 selection and but not a #2.   2018, 2/5 of the top five were clearly bad picks only 3 years later.   2016, Jaylen Brown - who was considered a reach by almost everyone at 3- is clearly the best pick of the top 10. At what draft position was the second-best player in the 2015 draft taken? 13?   You have to assume that you are going to miss on more of your top picks than you're going to hit on, because that's what EVERYBODY does.   It's true further down the draft. The Nuggets didn't know what they were getting with Jokic. The Warriors didn't know what they were getting at Draymond. In neither case if you asked the team, ""What's the best-case scenario for this guy?"" nobody in Denver would have said ""MVP"" and nobody at Golden State would have said, ""One of the best, most revolutionary defenders in the history of the league.""  Even Jerry West, who is regarded as one of the greatest draft basketball minds of all time, evidently was a huge advocate of Dion Waiters and wanted him to drop to the Warriors. (And speaking of 2012, the number of smart draft people who thought that MKG was going to be an all-world player was substantial. He went #2 over Damien Lillard, Bradley Beal, Kris Middleton, and Draymond Green among others).   If your strategy involve you hitting on multiple top draft picks, you have to understand that you have to get lucky and you have to expect to miss a bunch."
I been saying ben simmons is going to minny for ages. Simmons D book and bradley beal are all going to team up with kat and dlo
"I honestly don't know how they fix this. They need an elite ball handler and perimeter scorer (either guard or wing) but instead they have Simmons and Harris, neither one of which can bring in that dude without giving up a ton of assets cause of how bad their contracts are. Another question who is that player? Bradley Beal?"
"This is a legit take by Laker fans here in LA. They are some of the biggest homer, low BBIQ fans in any sport. I’m sure they will be taking calls on 710 ESPN tomorrow discussing the very idea of a Kuz for Booker trade. I was listening after the Lakers were eliminated and they were seriously entertaining the idea of using Kuz, THT, and Schroeder in a S&amp;T to acquire both Dame Lilliard and Bradley Beal this offseason."
"Uhh guard is a stacked position, who are you taking off? Chris Paul? Bradley Beal?"
"It would cost them so much for Beal they’d end up in the same situation as Washington right now, Bradley Beal and not much else."
Bradley Beal
Try your best to get Bradley Beal and try to absorb another bad contract?
Bradley beal isnt a superstar
Bradley Beal on Reddit?
I agree. The crazy part is people were flirting with this idea back in the beginning of the season after BK got Harden. You don’t need all three. And it ended up being the right move in hindsight. You could trade Kyrie for depth + picks or for a slightly lesser player like Bradley Beal + depth/picks. Bradley Beal would’ve came seriously in handy this series. Kyrie is so unreliable it’s maddening.
"&gt;Spida is the superstar/best player on the Jazz.     Based on what? Ppg? Your feelings? Is Bradley Beal better than Bill Russell too?     &gt;And regularly gets exposed in the playoffs.  Define exposed? The Jazz is still a much better defensive team with him on the court."
"Its more about relationships now. Players are still loyal but its to the people within the franchise, not necessarily the franchise name itself . If Lebron genuinely likes Jeanie Buss , or Giannis genuinely likes the Lasrys that will make them feel a sense of loyalty to that organization.   Bradley Beal is an example, on paper there's nothing much for him to like about the Wizards franchise or history. But their owner Ted Leonsis is big on loyalty/relationships and has been close with Beal's family since he was drafted, also the GM Tommy Sheppard has the same religious beliefs with Brad who is also deeply religious. When players sense that trust and personal connection, it builds loyalty and makes them feel appreciated."
Someone for the love of god save he and Bradley Beal from their teams
Sixers were legit in the running for Bradley Beal at one point. Can't see the Wizards ever doing that kind of trade now.
"It’s not disingenuous,it’s the main reason.  Al Horford contract is $40 million guaranteed for the next two season compared to Kemba’s $70 million.   In the short term, this gives the Celtics more flexibility to retain players and trying to re-sign Evan Fournier in Free Agency.  In long term (summer 2022), Horford’s contract is easier to move off the books if they wanted to target a Max Free Agent like Bradley Beal."
De'Aaron Fox  Zach Lavine  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Bradley Beal  in that order
It's been so bad the last week. Everyone photoshopped in a Lakers jersey. Guys impossible for us to get in basically any way. Dame. Luka. Bradley Beal. I think I saw Booker too lol
"Bro, I glanced and saw ""Wizards star Bradley Beal,"" and underneat ""Portland's Damian Lillard,"" and got anxiety."
Is Bradley Beal even that much of an upgrade over BI?
Would you trade Ingram and 2 first for Bradley Beal if he guarantees he’ll resign
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.

"If you could choose between Bradley Beal and 3 players on 12m deals, you would choose the 3 role players?  Sorry but I'm taking my chances with Brad and hope some midseason buyouts like Blake happen.  NBA is a star driven league and 3 is better than 2.  Ask the Nets.  Given the choice of Harden or 3 role players AND 4(7) picks, they made the easy choice."
Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook
"*tinfoil hat - on*  Well you see, joining Team USA is actually just a recruitment mission Brad sent Tatum on. In 2023 Bradley Beal will be playing point guard for the Boston Celtics."

bradley beal
*Bradley Beal photoshopped in Heat jerseys has entered the chat*
he didnt have that big of an effect on the game kinda like bradley beal does most games
"Ya that is pretty good considering he is a guard. Think of how many guards you have being all star snubs every year. Even in the east this year we have Bradley Beal, Malcolm Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine. Guards have always been NBA's deepest position."
Bradley Beal is equally bad on D tho
Sixers need to trade Ben Simmons for Bradley Beal. So Westbrook can teach Simmons how to be impactful while not being a good shooter.
"Not 3rd team All NBA for sure, Bradley Beal and Jimmy Butler way better this year. /s"
Bradley Beal would be a dream
"At that time there were players who were playing better than Trae. You could make an argument that he deserved it over some of them, but at that time some guys were just too good to not choose them.  The all star guards in the east were: Kyrie, Jaylen Brown, Harden, Ben Simmons, Lavine, Bradley Beal.   Maybe Trae over Ben, but I don’t see it as a complete snub"
He was the best player on the floor in the first round that featured Bradley Beal and Russel Wedtbrook
"fun fact: Bradley Beal turned 28 exactly a month ago. More than twice as many career games as Embiid, and it honestly feels like he's part of an entirely different generation."
"Slower pace, yet he still took more FGA and FTA than Bradley Beal. And virtually the same amount of 3PA"
No hasn’t he only had that leg injury and COVID last playoffs by still played and the beginning of this season but other that he’s been able to play in the playoffs healthy and in season he got healthy carried the wizards from the worst record in the nba to the first playoffs in two years   Steals is definitely not a garbage stats it’s apart of defense your point invalid and your only trying to down play that he can play d   He’s definitely not a garbage scorer and if their were 75 players that could score better than him then why don’t they have 2 scoring titles or “a” scoring title at that   He literally made most guys have mvp seasons victor oldapio credits him Paul George averaged 28 points a game because Russ gave him greats open shots the whole season Bradley Beal was able to play better and get better shots because of him dude has games where he drops 24 dimes and 19 and 18 on a regular basis he is a floor general please just say you are a in denial Westbrook hater and carry on because you don’t make any sense
"I would never argue they are divas. But the game they play back home is not the same kind that will fly against the competition at the Olympics.  The other teams have been getting consistently better and american talent has gotten comfortable. This is a wake up call.   I never said Pop is the GOAT. And Coach K is not just a ""college coach"". Do I think Pop is the best fit for team USA? No. I don't. But he is not a shit coach and the product on the court is simply not characteristic of him.   I agree the roster itself is not the best that it could be. Even including Bradley Beal and the other dropouts, there are some questionable choices imo."

"He offered him to Golden State for Klay and also to the Wizards for Bradley Beal. Both said no. Harden was not a sure fire future MVP like this sub likes to act like he was in 2012. At the time, the haul was looked at as a pretty decent return. Essentially a rental of Kevin Martin for a year while Lamb could develop into hopefully our future two guard, and a pick from Toronto that was guaranteed a the time to be a top 5-10 pick, but the raptors ended up going on a late run, and that pick dropped to 12. Shit just didn’t work out, at all."
Cp3 isn't leaving phoenix to join Nola at this point in his career. Only way he leaves phoenix is for a guarantee at a ring or a bigger payday  Bradley Beal will get traded for his bird rights to a contender and will sign an extension.  Lavine is the only one I could maybe see but I think another team will trade for and extend him tbh.   Nola's best way to get talent is drafting and trading and they traded away quality draft picks for a dude they are gonna have to overpay to keep
Chris Paul. Bradley Beal. Zack Levine. All could really improve Nola's shooting/passing/spacing.
Bradley Beal hopefully.
Bradley beal won rings?
"There were rumors that Griffin wanted Beal as part of the AD trade and Washington said they didn’t want to trade Beal, so now if they actually will, I wouldn’t be surprised if they are a dark horse suitor  https://www.btimesonline.com/articles/113697/20190614/report-pelicans-want-bradley-beal-as-part-of-anthony-davis-trade.htm"
"How's this?  Sixers get:   * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * OG Anunoby  * 4th overall  Raptors get:   * Ben Simmons  * Tyrese Maxey  * Matisse Thybulle  * 15h overall (from Wizards)  * 28 overall, 2023, 2027 Sixers 1sts  Sixers move Ben for Beal. Instant upgrade, and worth burning future 1sts and prospects for. A core of Embiid/Beal/Harris with Danny Green, Seth Curry is filthy and actually has a chance against the Nets imo   Raptors want to win now, they get an upgrade at SF and also assets that they can use or flip for another vet.   Wizards start their rebuild right by getting an incredibly talented young SF and the 4th overall pick in exchange for their all-star."
"Hmmmm  Wizards get: Matisse, Maxey, Culver, McDaniels, as many firsts as needed,   Timberwolves get: Ben Simmons   76ers get: Bradley Beal"
It only matters if beal of Bradley wants out cause russ will get you a bag of chips and a second
Bradley Beal considering asking for trade   Bradley Beal might ask out  Bradley Beal may consider trade request if Westbrook traded  How many different ways can you say we have no actual news to report on Beal?
Beal of Bradley is not worth that super max
He is literally 6'3 look it up. [Also Westbrook is taller](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2021/05/Bradley-Beal-3.jpg)
"Jarret Allen, Bradley Beal, Middleton, Durant, LaVine, Seth Curry, Kevin Huerter, DeJounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young.   I would be running a ton."
nah this Bradley Beal lmao this is 2k19 I’m 7 seasons deep so that’s why his scoring is so low for him he does nothing really besides score tbh
Probably Bradley Beal and 6 firsts
"We finished with 19 wins in 2019. Its more like the lakers could have replaced lebron with zion, told kcp he is injured to get bradley beal, and then kick dennis in the balls for wanting 100m so he can be replaced by sexton."
They would be stupid not to trade him for Bradley beal who is a top 15 player
So enjoy not getting Bradley Beal.
He would be if they made it to the finals. He’s been on the team for not even a full regular season. Your comparing Siakam when he had kawhi on his team to Wiggins last season during a short injury plagued/Covid season. Siakam isn’t even that much of a better player then Wiggins. What has he done since kawhi left the team? Made one all star appearance riding of the success of the previous year. Is Siakam on the same level as Bradley Beal? Nah. Warriors would rather have Beal if they were giving all those assets up. Siakam is injured too. Why would they want someone that’s going to miss some time at the start of the season they already going to be missing Klay for probably half the season. Their record would suck because they would have traded Wiggins their second leading scorer and Oubre who will probably leave. Probably wouldn’t even make the playoffs. Warriors aren’t that desperate to overpay that much. They would be a lot better keeping Wiggins the two draft picks and wiseman. Warriors brought in a bunch of developmental coaches to work with wiseman.
"Miami or Philly. I feel like him and Bam complement each other’s game so well, and they Miami would have enough cap to get some good depth and S5 power around those two if they let go of guys like Jimmy Butler, Gordon Dragic, and Trevor Ariza they could even get a lot more. A starting 5 I think would push the heat up top would be this  PG-Malcom Brogdan SG-Bradley Beal SF-Davis Bertans PF-Bam Adebeyo C-Brook Lopez"
"Honestly, I think we could do nothing but add a solid shooter, and we’d be an 8th seed. We had the talent last year, but the young players still needed time to develop, and they all really improved throughout the year.   We were looking like we would be at least a play in team after the all star break, but then unlucky injuries started piling up. I get why from the outside looking in, it would seem like we need to make a big move to compete, but we already have a good amount of talent on the team. Obviously we’re gonna make moves to ensure we make the playoffs, but they don’t have to be huge moves like trading for a star like Bradley Beal. Instead we could go after players like Duncan Robinson and Bojan Bogdonavic."
"Why don't the US ever put a full strength team forward?? The arrogance of assuming any team we put out will win is astounding.  In 1992 NBA players were fighting for the opportunity to make the olympic team, but now players think it's not worth their time.  How can we call this an olympic level US team with no James Harden, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul or Bradley Beal?????  But instead we got Keldon Johnson, Javalle Mcgee and Draymond Green? Are you kidding me???"

So your saying we aren’t competing for the playoffs just because we don’t want to trade a young all star and other assets away for a year of Bradley Beal? Lol ok
Washington in “no way” is getting Bradley beal
I think that's an overpay from the Sixers for Bradley Beal tbh
I can solve this:   *Cap* *Hat* ? Who wears hats? At least 1 person on one of the 30 NBA teams probably wears a hat!  confirmed Bradley Beal will be playing on one of the 30 NBA teams next season.
"The Boston Celtics are in ""no way"" getting Washington star Bradley Beal."
I love how everyone talks about this like contracts don’t mean anything. Bradley Beal already made his decision which is why he’s under contract for the current season.
Bradley Beal has averaged 30 ppg two seasons in a row. He is definitely the guy we need to energize our offense since wiggins dray looney (hopefully wiseman next year) will keep us at the same top 5 defense we are.
Wizards vs Bucks. There was no Bradley Beal in that game and Russ put the team completely on his back. Had a 3 to tie it with less than a minute left but the rest of the role players outside of Rui did not show up that game at all.
"Yeah! I wouldn’t do KCP for Giannis either! Or Bradley Beal! Or Steph Curry! If they want KCP they’re gonna have to pry him from my cold, dead hands!!"
"If Bradley isn’t available, who do they go for? Also is Wiseman gonna be involved if it isn’t for Beal."
Bradley Beal legit only helps teams like the Lakers and Knicks who suck at offense too
"Don't think this is a 'Ben Simmons isn't good' reason, this is a fit reason. *And* a 'Bradley Beal is very good' reason."
Bradley Beal
"""Bradley Beal is an excellent basketball player who would be a great fit on the Lakers."""
Who's after Bradley Beal?
"FUck Bradley Beal, give Fournier an extension!"
"On/off numbers like that are not super useful on an individual player level. They are useful on a lineup level, but OP didn't include full lineups here.    Also, there's a big gap between ""Westbrook is not good"" and ""Westbrook is not as good an offensive player as James Harden or Bradley Beal.""  We should expect Westbrook-only lineups to do worse than Harden- or Beal-only lineups because the gap in offensive talent between Harden and the next best offensive non-westbrook player on the Rockets is larger than the gap between Westbrook and the next best offensive non-Harden player.   The worse the supporting cast is, the wider we'd expect to see those chasms. Those numbers don't tell us anything about how good Westbrook is."
"All I know is it’s been fun seeing Rui Hachimura, Bradley Beal, and Russell Westbrook on the same team. Can’t wait to see them next season with a new coach.  &gt; It turns out that most people only react to basketball as entertainment and popularity contests instead of respectfully learning how the game should be played in 2021  And what’s wrong with that? The average fan dgaf about TS, VORP, offensive rating, etc. People just wanna see stars play ball regardless of analytics."
"Their two biggest assets are the draft picks, combined them you get Bradley beal, beal isn’t what they need."
"LOL. Reggie was really solid, but he was never even seen as a top 10 player in the NBA. Theres a reason he only got on 3 all NBA teams his entire career, and all were 3rd team.   He was a lot closer to a devin booker/bradley beal/jayson tatum level player at his peak than an MVP candidate who got robbed. Not meaning disrespect, but the rose tinted glasses on reggie are kinda wild."
"&gt;Its literally has nothing to do with what the Wizards sub think or want. Do they make the decisions? No. The front office does.  Alright, so lets find another metric to see how these trade proposals go over.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Obviously the fans want to keep Russ and Beal so that they can at least compete for a play in spot rather than being a tanking team, but if the front office don't want to lose Beal to free agency next year they aren't gonna keep them around.  The fans mostly seemed to want to trade the 2 but not for the Lakers package.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Bradley Beal isn't re signing with them after opting out next season.  Are we sure he opts out?"

I'm Bradley Beal
Ok? Is your point that Wiggins is better than Bradley Beal? Or that Beal isn't worth as much as we think because Wiggins played some good defense on him? Not sure what your getting at at all
"Yeah, thats a no brainer. It only costs smart fournier and a bunch of garbage to acquire Bradley Beal? Who wouldnt do that"
"This is insane, and just goes to show how well NBA marketing works. Bradley Beal is all-nba third team guard who averaged **30 ppg**, KAT is a mutliple time all-nba player. Booker's raw numbers and his advanced stats have never been anywhere close to those guys'. If it weren't for injuries, Booker would be a 0x all-star! Paul George was literally an MVP candidate a little while ago, and now Booker is in the same tier?  People need to realise it's no coincidence that as soon as the Suns became popular people starting giving Booker an absurd amount of credit. He's all over TV, Twitter, Instagram, he clearly is marketed as the young face of the league, and it clearly works to increase perceptions of his standing in the league. 24-28 is not only reasonable, but very fair for Booker."
"If you have Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Bradley Beal, why do you need your first round picks for the next 5 years?"
I can only recall a handful of times players forced trades and their team got a fair package in exchange. I can recall a great deal of times where they got fleeced. I can even recall another few times where it was downright highway robbery.  So I’d say this comes down to whether or not Bradley Beal plans to put up a fight more than what Washington is willing to do

How much better is Bradley Beal than Jaylen Brown? If you lose brown it doesn’t make much sense to me
"Both from the same area + childhood friends.  &gt;Tatum followed in Beal's footsteps every step of the way, but now both of them are first time Olympians set to star for Team USA. In some ways it culminates a journey they can't help but be amazed by.   &gt;   &gt;""We're both excited. For one, we grew up five minutes from each other,"" Beal said. ""To have two of the guys from the same high school on the same team, I don't know if that's ever happened for USA Basketball. We're excited about it.""  [https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/childhood-friends-bradley-beal-and-jayson-tatum-amazed-be-olympic-teammates](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/childhood-friends-bradley-beal-and-jayson-tatum-amazed-be-olympic-teammates)"
"Lol, why does it feel like Bradley Beal is that source?"
"Can you please tell me where in my comment I said ""Westbrook has a higher usage than Bradley Beal"" idk what youre talking about I just said he was ""high usage"" as he did create more points than anyone on the celtics so I am sure that classifies.   Youre mentioning kemba and smart who each missed 30+ games and then fournier who they just got after the deadline those two? Ok I'll mention Rui Hachimura and Bertans then. The comparison was on the offensive end and its quite honestly not close Beal is a top 4 scorer in the league on offense where Brown isnt top 20.   I can even give you 20 or so names in no order who are better scorers than Brown: Curry, Lebron, AD, KD, Harden, Tatum, Beal, Kyrie, Jokic, Embiid, Lavine, Luka, Kawhi, Booker, Middleton, Lillard, Mitchell, Giannis, Trae, PG, Zion, Randle (who I just is debatable). Just of the top of my head."
Because last year was pretty much the most fun I’ve had watching wizards basketball in recent memory. Sure they didn’t have playoff success but I watched every game and had tons of fun. A rebuild doesn’t guarantee fun or success. You still have to get lucky and have an outstanding front office for a rebuild lead to a championship. We drafted john wall and bradley beal within a few years of each other and never even made the conference finals. Who knows how we’ll do building around a bunch of mid-late lottery picks instead.
"That’s irrelevant to my point. My point is that if the Celtics want Bradley Beal, they should trade for him now because there’s no guarantee he’ll come in free agency.   What the Lakers did with their remaining assets is irrelevant. What Boston does with their assets By not going for Beal are irrelevant"
"Losing Wiggins is not bad at all if we get Bradley Beal lol. People are gonna point to dEfEnSe, but we had a top 5 defense last year and didn’t even make playoffs. In this day and age, where scoring is at an all time high, we need a guy like Beal"
"If OKC is enticed to drop protections on the 2023 FRP we gave them:  Miami gets: Bradley Beal  Washington gets: Tyler Herro, Precious Achiewa, 2024 FRP, 2025 FRP Swap, 2026 FRP, 2027 FRP Swap, 2028 FRP.  That’s nowhere near enough to get Brad unfortunately."
"No way are they giving up 4OA + OG Anunoby for 2 years of Bradley Beal. Let's consider asset management: We have 4 more years of OG Anunoby at $18mil/yr and whoever we draft at 4OA will be locked up for 5 years at $7mil/yr.  That's $25 million for at least 4 years of OG + whoever we get at 4. Then we have Lowry, in all likelihood, coming off the books to provide about 20 million in cap space + whatever assets we recuperate in that.  So we're realistically looking at Suggs/Wiseman/Green, OG Anunoby, and a UFA: Oladipo, Porter Jr, Powell, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, etc.  The roster would look like this: Suggs, FVV, GTJ, OG, Siakam, Holmes + whatever assets we get from Lowry.  Just doesn't make sense to give up *both* the 4OA pick and OG. Probably send a guard back."
Bradley Beal had an over 2% higher usage rate than Russell Westbrook in the 2020-2021 NBA season. You just made this all up!
"The Hawks aren't blowing up their team for Bradley Beal. They're especially not trading De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish, who both have star potential"
"Thanks for including the /s, if you hadn't included that I totally would have thought you actually think Gabe Vincent and Bradley Beal are equal!"
Yeah that ain't happening. Bradley Beal will help someone like the Lakers who need scoring more than Boston who doesn't need scoring as much
But Bradley Beal is no Danny Green
"Love Bradley Beal, but not if it means giving up Jaylen"
The 4th overall pick and siakam is a severe overpay for a single year of Bradley Beal. Siakam as a whole brings marginally less than Beal given that his defense is miles ahead and Beal’s scoring is literally all he has over Siakam
The Warriors are interested in Bradley Beal and Bradley Beal is interested in the Celtics are not the same thing.
"Oh it's the annual ""Bradley Beal for a couple of role players and draft picks"" time."
"We gave up Poetl, the 4th best young player, a lottery protected pick, and Demar for Kawhi fucking Leonard not the fourth pick and Siakam for Bradley geez Beal."
"To be fair, I don't think you can build a true contender around Bradley Beal."
"""I have to make a decision before the draft."" - Sounds like someone who talked to Draymond about the Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, and 14th package.   Draft picks are a lot more attractive when you're the team making the call, and the Wizards probably could even send Wiseman, 7th, and 14th to another team to move into the Top 4 to get someone they really like if they're not in love with Wiseman or the options at 7.  This trade just makes too much sense not to happen. The salaries also work out in a way that allows the Warriors to take back another player in addition to Beal, removing the depth problem that Wiggins trades present.  If the trade is executed after the Warriors make their selections, with the Warriors picking for the Wizards (as most draft trades are executed) it also opens up Golden State trading another first round pick without having to redo the protections on the pick owed to Memphis.  Final trade should be   **Wizards Trade**  * Bradley Beal * Davis Bertans  **Warriors Trade**  * Andrew Wiggins * James Wiseman * 7th pick in 2021 draft * 14th pick in 2021 draft * Unprotected 2028 first round pick  That's a heck of a package, and Golden State gets to go all in on the last years of Curry's prime."
"**Bradley Beal: “I don’t know what I’m going to do when my contract is up, but I have to admit I love going to new places.”**"
One Bradley Beal please.
"&gt;Beal has long maintained to confidants his desire to stay in Washington, so long as he believed the Wizards were positioned to advance deep into the postseason. And if Beal were to seek a new team, he would do so only to land in an established winning environment, sources said.  &gt;Beal does not have a proverbial list of preferred destinations, but it was mentioned by multiple sources that he would welcome joining teams such as Boston, Golden State, Miami or Philadelphia—although Beal requesting a trade would all but guarantee an expansive bidding war across the league. The number of potential destinations and interested suitors could span a significant portion of the NBA.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2946317-sources-bradley-beal-considering-trade-request-before-nba-draft"
Bradley Beal
 Bradley Beal is like 28 if I’m not mistaken
"Lol 7,14 and Wiseman ain't moving Bradley fucking Beal. Stop selling other team's superstars so low"
"That's a strawman and you know it. ""Intagables"" like defense, tipped passes, poke outs that lead to turnovers, the fact that he siad fuck it, stopped shooting, and just started diming passes while still getting the double teams thrown at him. Idk why these dont show up in the box score(I remember complaining about it in the game thread) but he blocked 2 shots that game on the perimeter too. He literally decided he was going to be cp3 floor general for a whole game. And he played full game minutes only attempting 10 shots and making 1 lol. Still got 10 points. If we only counted ppg on shot efficiency for the best players in the game Bradley Beal would be better than Giannis, by your example at least.  Edit: and dame didn't even have the worse +/- that game lmao."
"I think it's safe to assume since there are a lot of shorter players who have quite better handles, speed, vertical and lateral quickness than KD, such as Bradley Beal, Victor Oladipo etc. the limits of their star status gives a good indication of where KD could end up, that's being most optimistic and giving him the benefit of the doubt that at 6'6 he would be comparable to these players.   Alternatively, if someone like DeRozan was 6'10 instead of 6'6 with a few points taken off from his other qualities, he'd definitely be a more effective and higher ranked player.   There's nothing wrong in accepting the fact that height plays a major role in any player's effectiveness and one might wonder if CP3 wasn't a 6' PG, but a few inches taller, what he could have accomplished.   These are all hypotheticals but they're based on what we can observe on the court, like Luka's physique, being thick and tall helps him a lot over smaller guards who try and defend him. BTW, Luka is no shorter than 6'8, look at some pics of him."
&gt;and then add Bradley Beal in the off season  It would hurt so bad to see him leave but having him end up in MIL would be a lot better than other places
So is Bradley Beal.
"Milwaukee about to win 74 games next year, and then add Bradley Beal in the off season"
i love this game  Mike James Thomas Bryan(t) Shaw(n) Bradley Beal(Bill) Russell West Brook Steppe(n) Curry  &amp;#x200B;  Mike James  James Thomas  Thomas Bryant  Brian Shaw  Shawn Bradley  Bradley Beal  Bill Russel  Russel Westbrook  Brook Steppe  Stephen Curry
"You could probably get Bradley Beal w/ Wiseman &amp; Wiggins with the 7th &amp; 14th pick but the things you’d have to do for cap space would be hell on earth. I’d rather trade for Siakam, an all NBA talent because the mins with Klay and Beal would be difficult, unless you run either or at the SF; I also believe it’d be easier to trade for Siakam because he’s not worth that much on the trade market rn because he slightly underperformed. Siakam would fit well w/ the Warriors type of play. I think if that trade ever happens, they’re winning the chip for sure ."
No it’s not stupid when it’s talent like Bradley Beal. Cousins and New Orleans was working fine until he tore his Achilles. The Sixers drafted Simmons and Embiid. That’s not the same here if we were to sign Beal.
Get Bradley Beal. Do what you must.
Hell nah Bradley Beal eat like 4K just in breakfast
&gt; We are not getting Bradley Beal  Why so confident? Beal's on his last year and WAS prime for a rebuild with new coach
"Brandon Ingram, Bradley Beal, Paul George, or Dame. Please"
"They should get Brandon Ingram, Bradley Beal, Paul George, or Dame. Hey or just get them all I don’t know"
"At the time it was a move that made sense. But in hindsight, it would have been better to save the TPE for the offseason.   The Celtics could have done the Kemba-Horford trade, but absorbed Horford into the full Hayward TPE. This would have created an even larger Kemba Walker TPE…..which could fit the salary of Bradley Beal. Then the Celtics could have focused their efforts on trading for Beal with picks and players but wouldn’t have had to worry about matching all the salary since they could absorb him into the TPE.   Now if the Celtics still want Beal they basically have to wait till next summer and clear the roster of essentially everyone outside of Tatum and Brown to sign him."
"Green, Gay, Olynyk and Mills are good. Bradley is awful, though, don't get the appeal. All are worse than Fournier. If they let  Fournier go, the plan has to be to open max slot for Beal, otherwise what are they even doing?"
It's Bradley Beal.

"Report: Lakers also have ‘strong interest’ in Demar DeRozen, Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gay, Trever Ariza, Andre Iguodala, Dwight Howard, Patty Mills, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Statue of Liberty."
"To be honest, even before the Westbrook trade, I always read DeRozan saying he would take a big pay cut to play for the Lakers as a smokescreen in an effort to drive up his asking price elsewhere. I can't tell you how many other players have run this same bullshit play over the years. The best way to go into contract negotiations is to have a credible bluff that you have a better offer elsewhere. Every team knows what everyone else can offer, but if you can make them think you're seriously considering a discount to play for the Lakers, then you'll probably get better offers.   I'm sure some Laker fans are newer, stupid or naive, and believe it when players say that they just want to play for the Lakers, but those of us who have been fans for a long time and follow this stuff every year can recognize the bullshit these guys say to increase their leverage. Boston fans don't have as much experience being leveraged like this, which is why you guys now all believe it's a done deal that Bradley Beal will sign with Boston next summer 😂"
"Lavine is definitely one of the stars that vocally has made it clear he wants to stay. If Bradley Beal wants to stick it out with Washington, there’s nothing stopping Lavine from wanting to do the same."
"No, Boston will be well over the cap this summer and figure to be over it again next summer. This talk about making a run at Bradley Beal next year I don't think is realistic at all. To do that the Celtics would have to just let Fournier walk and also not extend Marcus Smart and Robert Williams. Then they'd also have to just not guarantee Horford's contract in 2022-23, meaning they'd be paying him $14.5 million not to play for them.   Beal's max next summer would be just over $40 million, with the cap being at $115 million. That amount combined with Tatum's and Brown's contracts would equal $99 million just for those three players. That means to sign Beal as a free agent the Celtics would have to figure out a way to dump Horford to a team with cap space (which I'm guessing would take another 1st round pick), and they'd have to renounce rights on everyone else except maybe for Pritchard and Nesmith. To me that seems *extremely* unlikely."
"Beal is a UFA in the 2023 off-season. Unless you plan on trading Robert Williams and scraps for Bradley Beal, he won’t be on the Celtics next year."

What really confuses me is with these organizations being able to literally connect their players with actual experts just by picking up the phone -- how is it that Bradley Beal hasn't had it brought to his attention that we've had information for several months that indicated Covid spreads roughly 25 times more between the unvaccinated.

Bradley Beal: “That mf will be Ite”
"&gt;The city of San Francisco's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for large indoor events — which will force Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins to miss home games at Chase Center unless he gets vaccinated — does not apply to unvaccinated players on visiting teams.  &gt;Some have found it strange that the city's mandate applies only to Warriors players and not opposing players who are reportedly unvaccinated, such as the Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving or the Washington Wizards' Bradley Beal. Attempts to explain the discrepancy have largely painted the question as a legal and jurisdictional issue and not a policy choice on behalf of the city. (""Because [visiting players] are not employees of a company that is under the city’s limits, the rules don’t currently apply"" reads a paragraph from a recent piece in The Athletic.)  &gt;However, the city's health department currently requires bars, gyms and restaurants to screen customers for proof of vaccination, regardless of whether that customer lives in the city or not. The health department is also using its authority to mandate masks, physical distancing and testing for out-of-town unvaccinated players, which strongly suggests it has the ability to bar unvaccinated opposing players from Chase Center if it so desires."
Bradley Beal in shambles
"Bradley Beal isn’t trying to compete in this league. He’s just about getting his stats, his money and pretending he’s upset when they lose for the media."
"Absolutely fuck Bradley Beal. If you don’t wanna take the shot that’s one thing, but if you’re actively spreading misinformation and trying to deter others, you get a big middle finger from me. Fuck Brad Beal and his dumb ass wife"

**”BRADLEY EMMANUEL BEAL GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW”**
Only other names being thrown around right now are Bradley Beal and Donovan Mitchell. Mostly Mitchell
Just read that the team added Bradley Beal.
Naah. Dame is not the GOAT player in his franchise either. Bill Walton and Clyde Drexler are better than him. Beal is not that good. Neither is Westbrook. I would gladly have Jamal Murray on my squad rather than Bradley Beal or Westbrook.

"The Los Angeles Lakers may have landed Russell Westbrook this offseason, but he wasn't their first choice.  Bill Oram, Shams Charania and Sam Amick of The Athletic reported the Lakers initially wanted to target Bradley Beal or Damian Lillard to team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. When it became clear they weren't going to get either Beal or Lillard, the team shifted its focus to ""more realistic"" targets.  No shit"
"&gt; He scraped the 8th seed with Bradley Beal as his teammate  And not much else. The east was pretty good this year. Bucks/Nets could have conceivably won a title. Hawks were good, and could have got lucky in the finals. 76ers are God knows what, but they are a better team than anyone below them on this list. Knicks were decent. Heat and Celtics had flaws but were better teams than the Wizards.  The wiz ended up right where they should have been. Without Westbrook I'm not sure they end up that high. Pacers/Hornets were right on their tail."
We don’t deserve Bradley Beal
"I'm just picturing Brodie in Shep's office going, ""We're leaving, let's go Bradley"" and Beal just doesnt move."
"Is he really an excellent floor raiser? He scraped the 8th seed with Bradley Beal as his teammate. Ja Morant got there with no star teammates, even beating the Warriors in the play-in, and no one would call him an excellent floor raiser."
"Knicks fans are like that too!  There are some fans who wouldn't trade Obi Toppin (and only Obi Toppin) for fucking Bradley Beal because ""how many times do we need to do that for you to realize, trading youth for experience has never worked, for any team, ever.  The only way to build a team is tanking and drafting well, there's literally never been a good team that wasn't built through tanking""."
"Excerpt:   &gt; In the two months that followed their first-round playoff flop against Phoenix, when Davis’ groin injury left them pulling up lame, the Lakers explored the prospect of trading for such stars as Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook. The process unfolded well beyond the team’s front office’s search, with James setting up a war room of his own at his Brentwood estate for some in-person player meetings while leading remote communications in other conversations."
"Damn respect to Beal for this honestly, dude chose to stick with a franchise after the best player that's played there in years other than him requested a trade after one season and tried to get him to do it too  Not saying Westbrook did anything wrong but damn I really respect Bradley Beal for sticking with Washington"
"To be fair to Simmons, Sixers failed to build team that complement him.  To be fair for the Sixers its damn hard to build team around when Simmons and Embiid are together in the same team. But it's not impossible, the complement star must be a scoring guard, someone like Bradley Beal, Klay Thompson, CJ, Lilard, Lavine might be it. Tobi is a bad fit for Embiid and Simmons duo and why that's line up not working out which made Simmons get all the blame.  This is by no mean a shade to Tobi, he is a good player but the three cores just don't fit. These relationship don't work out. Someone has to go, and Simmons want to be that guy that move out."
"I assume then Paul, Curry, Lowry, Rondo and both Ball Brothers among of many lesser names would be disqualified from that PG title as well?  I mean should we consider Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier as PG's as well from now on due to their defensive responsibilities?"
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
The more I watch Jalen Green the more I see Bradley Beal
"Kris Dunn = Keith Murray  Bradley Beal = younger, thinner Charles S. Dutton"
"According to Zach Lowe, just because Lacob says he doesn’t want Simmons doesn’t mean that Bob Myers, Steve Kerr, and Stephen Curry don’t want Ben Simmons. The Warriors core was actually petitioning the front office to trade for an impact player, and Ben Simmons fits the mold. (Bradley Beal was their top choice though).   We already know Morey is willing to do Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th, 14th, and 2 future firsts. So the question becomes how much of that are there Warriors willing to give up, and what is Morey willing to accept with the Warriors removing stuff.  My guess is the trade, if it goes through, would involve the Warriors telling the Sixers they can either have Kuminga or Wiseman/Moody."
"Eric Gordon looked like he could be an all-star early in his career. He's been a servicable roleplayer since but really thought he'd have more of a Bradley Beal career arc.   Alec Burks was someone I thought would be a 20ppg guy too that looked promising early in Utah but then like a lot of guys being brought up here, just got mad injuries and never quite got back on track to develop into more than a spark plug scorer type."
"then orgs should do a better job at talent and individual assessmentS before giving out huge contracts. the onus isn't wholly on the player. for every Ben Simmons (and I'm completely convinced he's in this category yet) and Andre Drummond you have a Dame Lilliard, Bradley Beal, KAT, and KG where is the org that's completely failing to do their part"
Bradley Beal is a fucking giant
Bradley “Despite the Loss” Beal
"Scott Brooks iced Bradley Beal man, Beal could have had 70+ if the coach left him in to start the 4th. At some point when a player is that hot you have to keep him in, Scott Brooks is a travesty of a coach. As a fan of absurd scoring outputs this pisses me of"
"Beal, it's only good to be unselfish and trusting of your team if they're not horrible fucks. It's okay to hog the ball, a heavily contested Bradley Beal shot has more chances of going in than an open Westbrook 3  You got 59 and you passed a few times late in the 4th instead of doing it yourself"
"Thank you Scott Brook for icing Bradley Beal and sitting him when he had 57 to end three, you need to leave him in when he's that hot not stick to your same rotation"
"Bradley ""Despite the loss"" Beal"
Bradley is Beal balling us
"Scott Brooks iced Bradley Beal, travesty of a coach. He deserves Westbrook as his pointguard"

"2 years ago I picked Bradley Beal in DFS Fantasy Basketball on DK. I didn’t know much about him or the wizards at this time.

I’ve been a Wizards fan ever since."

"Well for all NBA, the [rules](https://pr.nba.com/1920-all-nba/) are a little different.  &gt; Players who received votes at multiple positions were slotted at the position where they received the most votes.  I think that's how Simmons got All NBA as a guard despite receiving fewer points overall than Middleton, for example  https://fansided.com/2020/09/17/khris-middleton-missed-nba-selection-outdated-positional-designations/  https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/nbcsports/bradley-beal-gets-most-votes-of-any-guard-left-off-all-nba-as-russell-westbrook-and-ben-simmons-take-final-spots/2420527/?amp  Middleton got 82 points, Embiid 76 and both missed the All NBA  Ben Simmons and Russell Westbrook, the two third-team guards, received 61 and 56 total vote points  But Middleton's votes were split between F &amp; G. And Embiid at center was behind 3 other centers.  Because of these rules, I tend to put All NBA in its own category.."
And Bradley Beal.  But it’s a small League.  Only 8 teams.
"I dislike them just because they're so garish, but considering that they've never lost in them, I have developed a sick form of respect for them.  I'll say this in their favor: at least they're unique and interesting and trying something new.   I mean, I'd rather have my team wear something so striking and weird like the hawks and the heat than say... [the wizards](https://www.nbajerseyfan.com/images/washington-wizards/bradley-beal-wizards-2020-21-gray-city-edition-jersey.jpg) or [the lions](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/938/276/9276938.jpg).

"Bradley Beal is not what Cs need. It’s Hayward situation all over. They need some vets who can help score, run plays and not demand the ball too much. We already have Tatum, Brown and Kemba."
Pritchard and late 1st round picks barely count as assets.  Bradley Beal is in season 9 with us. He matters to the franchise.
"Take a look at the video clip. Where is the help coming from? How is the defense ""collapsing?""  The logical help defender has his back to the play. You're not leaving Joe Harris in the right corner (hitting 50% of his threes this year), and the help defender in the left corner (the shooter is hitting 40% of his threes this year, and is in the game precisely because Nash trusts him with that shot) is being guarded by Bradley Beal. You trust Kyrie to score over a Beal contest, especially because the angle means he'll see him coming, and that's assuming Beal can get there.   There isn't a coach in the league who wants a three in this situation.   If you've watched Kyrie much, you know that this is an *easy* opportunity for him to get to the rim. He scores here at better than his 3-pt rate even against good help defenders who are in position to collapse, but that's not the case here."

"He had some clutch steals. Bradley beal had some blocks, this team hasnt looked better defensively all year."
Bradley fucking Beal
I’m trying to understand the difference between guys like Bradley Beal who have been worse defensively and comparable offensively to prime DeMar
"if Bradley Beal finishes this season in Washington, he's a saint"
"Is every accolade a team award now? I don’t think all stars should go to the same team. The Hawks didn’t deserve four all stars in 2015 or whatever and Bradley Beal should have made the all star team last year.   With that being said, I don’t know if WB is an all star this year."
Yes I’m aware of his stats. He’s a top 15 player in the league. My comparison was that neither one of them are “the guy” that carries a team to a championship. Siakam is a top 25 player. I know Bradley Beal is better. That’s what my comment literally said in the first sentence. Thank you for reiterating my point.
"Bradley Beal averaged 30/6 on 58% TS which Siakam will never ever seen in his life  He didn't make it into the playoffs because the Wizards were ass, we're talking individually here"
"Bradley Beal is absolutely better but he’s not “The Guy” that leads you to a championship. In the wizards best year he couldn’t get to the eastern conference and hasn’t made it to the playoffs the last two years (granted the rest of the roster was ass). That was the comparison I was making, they aren’t going to carry a championship contender."
Bradley Beal is a superior scorer and first option to Siakam
"I don’t think Pascal has regressed per se, I don’t think he was ever the number 1 guy on a team. He’s a very good number 2 (think like a Bradley Beal- no hate, both are all stars and star level players). He’s just not “the guy” and his flaws are being exploited. He’s lost his touch around the basket, but hey it’s five games. We will probably see a return closer to his averages from last year by the 35-40 game mark.   Or I’m wrong and he’s actually just ass. But I think my dissertation i just typed is probably more correct."
Yeah the Pels could absolutely use a Bradley Beal but thats true for most teams.
Not enough Bradley Beal in here
Not one mention of Bradley Beal?
Bradley Beal and James Harden look like a before and after picture.
"Yep,Bradley Beal is crying rn but the sound is blotted out due to Westbrook nailing the rim on every shot"
"Most of his shots are coming from 16-3p and he's shooting 57 percent from there. He's shootinig terribly from three and pretty much everywhere else besides the paint but he hasn't forced too much. Especially, in crunch time he heavily defers to Bradley Beal. Also, we were never winning anything. Best case scenario is we click in some way and become a fun team to watch."
"Chris Paul is one of the best point guards in the league. In fact, I think you could argue he's the 3rd best right now. But when I say elite, I mean a guy that can be the best player on a realistic championship team. That's LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Harden, Curry, and Giannis. Then you've got the next tier of guys like Jokic, Lillard, AD, and Luka. Then your 3rd tier stars like Paul George and Embiid and Tatum. And then finally you get to your CP3 tier with Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler and Bradley Beal. 2011 Dalls was a seasoned playoff team full of strong veterans and a relatively recent former MVP. This Suns team is just nowhere close to those Mavs, and they haven't played a game in the playoffs."
Best TS% off drives so far (min 15 TSA):  Dame Lillard - 72.3  De'Aaron Fox - 72.2  Luka Doncic - 69.3  Bradley Beal - 69.3  Kyle Lowry - 67.6  Kawhi Leonard - 67.2  Worst:  Ben Simmons - 32.2  Marcus Smart - 34.4  Russell Westbrook - 35.1  LaMelo Ball - 38.3  Donovan Mitchell - 40.0
why cant tmac carry orlando like ai on the sixers   why is westbrook 1-5 with bradley beal as his 2 guard
"He definitely outplayed Kleber. Advanced stats mean fuck all when you are talking about a lottery team vs. a playoff team. They heavily favor good teams while bad teams get the shaft because of how the data is collected. Based on your logic Montrez Harrell is better than Bradley Beal because his advanced stats are better. See how they can be misleading?  I think the sample size this year is big enough to draw conclusions. Hunter is averaging double the points Kleber is, plus he is actually starting and playing a huge role in the Hawks offense. Kleber looks like a replaceable stretch 5."
I like Bradley Beal if he’s ever on a 50 win team
"Check out his advanced stats. I think that was the old word on him, but he was a very efficient, high volume scorer. His OWS led the league most those core years.  Also, I think those Jazz teams may have been shit. Think Bradley Beal without Wall the past few years (but better)"

u put him above  Zach Lavine Jaylen Brown Bradley Beal Oladipo Levert etc  you are the reason that people shit on heat fans lmao
people are overlooking a ton of things about the team beyond just the inefficient shots and lack of defense. Literally this team has no way to win games. When it comes down to the wire and they have to draw up a play what's the call? Some Beal iso into a driving layup? They definitely aren't getting a game changing defensive play in. Also for whatever reason Bradley Beal has been garbage from 3 this season. But really the biggest issue is that you have 5 guys on the floor who literally are just playing casual basketball in a professional league. Literally the talent is the only thing that makes them somewhat competitive in their games.
0-6. Bradley Beal trade request coming soon. Masai do ur thing
Westbrook needs someone to keep him in check. That’s why he played well with KD. These guys who let him to do whatever he wants end up being disappointed. Bye bye Bradley Beal
"Miami and Washington structured around Beal for Herro, Duncan, Andre, Avery Bradley, and Harkless, with a third team incentivized to take harkless and bradley's money. Miami gets beal, Washington gets two shooters that Russ may fit better with?"
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"They got Bradley Beal on 30ppg, Russ in 20ppg (however inefficient he is) as well as Bryant &amp; Hachimura each on 17ppg. Their offense isn't great (Russ has over 5 turnovers a game) but its not bad  Their defense however is a fucking joke, how tf do you give up 133 points to my Bulls? Zach Lavine even had an awful game going 1/7 from 3."

Ok what player shoots a lot and puts up James Harden numbers enlighten me. Bradley Beal? 😂😂
"I don’t know about that. A Luka run offense is one of the best in history, why take the ball out of his hands? He is a better playmaker than scorer.          I think Bradley Beal/Zach LaVine would be a great complimentary piece. Luka would feed them so many open looks."
Kinda in a Bradley Beal situation rn tbh
He’s right that Lavine is a boss. On that Bradley Beal underrated tip.
Bradley Beal won 10 more games in a weaker conference?
"It’s not about being bankrupt, it’s about being in the red year after year, and for what? Because Bradley Beal might want to leave?   Not happening."
We are not getting Bradley Beal but I am happy that the consensus in the organization seems to favor at least ATTEMPTING to trade these picks. I was very worried we were going to add more rookies without even trying to see if something was out there.
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors."
Lol the audacity to insist on keeping James Wisemann when the best asset you are giving up in a package for Bradley Beal is the 7th overall pick.
"Look I get that Sexton is putting up numbers on a terrible team and is a weak defender. But he's 22 (same age as Luka and Trae) and put up 24 PPG (top 20 in the league) on 57% TS (just above league average).  He's improved every year in PPG (17, 21, 24) and efficiency (52, 56, 57% TS). I don't see him being worth just Bazley &amp; a pick swap (assuming that Kemba &lt;-&gt; Love is a pretty neutral proposition these days).  EDIT: Would it really be surprising if Sexton is able to basically be Bradley Beal in a few years? 22yo Beal &amp; 22yo Sexton look pretty similar."
This!! It’s the same thing with Bradley Beal. They’re not great 3pt shooters but their all around midrange shooting and bucket getting is elite
"Bradley Beal is probably the best player available to trade for, he doesn't really help Portland move the needle much though imo"
Lets say they get a guy like Bradley Beal because he wants out all of a sudden. And CJ as filler plus all their future picks gets the job done….  Does that get past Denver? A revitalized Warriors? A Lakers team rumored to add CP3 or Lowry? I don’t think so. Better to go ahead and get started on a quality rebuild while your 31 year old superstar is at the height of his value.
"Yes, but it's an accurate description of a lot good shooters in the league. Other guys with lower to Mediocre 3 point percentages but are still deadly and need to be guarded tight include Lou Williams, Luka, Trae Young, Jamal Murray, and Bradley Beal"
i have made a longer one  Mike James Thomas Bryant Shawn Bradley Beal Russell West Brook Steppe Curry
i like this game  Mike James Thomas Bryant Shawn Bradley Beal
Bradley Beal = Mitch Richmond
"But as great as ad is, he isnt as good as giannis. I dont really think ad could have won without another superstar or top tier all star (bradley beal, jayson tatum)"
"IFFFF either gets traded soon, it would have to be Bradley Beal.  Washington has been tense for Beal a bit longer than the Dame rumors have had any real substance to them, plus Lillard has spent years building his brand on the specific idea of staying loyal to the team that drafted him, and wanting to have 1 team his entire career.   Not saying Beal doesn't say the same when its brought up, but it's a foundational block of who Dame markets himself to be, on a different level than almost any other modern NBA star. From the player perspective, Lillard requesting a trade would be a relatively heavier decision than it would for Beal simply because it would be a more drastic change in narrative and branding.   There's also a bit of a difference in their weight to each small-market franchise... besides the fact that starting PGs are going to be generally harder to replace than SGs, Lillard is perceived as just being a notch higher up the totem pole of NBA stardom.   Between the 2 teams, Beal's perceived value would be more closely comparable to CJ McCollum, not Lillard. Only one of these players (Beal or Lillard) has spent any time in their NBA career as a Robin to someone else's Batman, and that's going to put them in different classes when it comes to the team evaluating a potential trade package.   So the pressure on the player to make the decision, as well as the pressure/stakes for the franchise to be picky about getting the right deal, are just gonna be more difficult with Lillard.   That said, it's still most likely neither gets moved before the season begins."
He called out Bradley Beal like 5 years ago when he was flying under the radar. I think Paul George as well before he took a leap in Indiana.
There’s no way Harden has less of a chance than Bradley Beal. Michael Jordan probably wouldn’t win mvp on the Wizards because they couldn’t be a top 4 seed regardless
"John Wall     Bradley Beal     Bernard King or Bobby Dandridge         Elvin Hayes     Wes Unseld  Only needed $3900, suck it."
"You can out Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Trae Young, Zion WIlliamson, Paul George, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, ect. on the Timberwolves and they will still almost certainly be a Lottery team.  Basketball is a team sport, I find it outrageous to blame the Star for a teams lack of success."
Does Bradley Beal fit in here?
"In the words of Bradley Beal: ""Dumb ass question."""
The ol Bradley beal
"17 IT Celtics come to mind, Bradley and crowder were dogs on defense, and IT was my favorite dude to root for back in his prime. 14-17 wizards with wall, Beal, and gortat was a lowkey fun team to watch as wall began to assume superstar status, even tho they were never true contenders. 2014-15 mavs with Ellis, dirk, and Vince carter off the bench we’re a fun team to watch, crazy that it all came burning down after the Rondo trade which was a move that was supposed to make them favorites."
"I could see him being a Bradley Beal type. Pure scorer, not much else."
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
"Without Bradley Beal I honestly don’t think we would’ve gotten 15 wins during the 2019-2020 seasons. He got the team to the 9th seed with his 2nd best player being Thomas Bryant, and third best being Bertans. Imo that’s extremity impressive. He was also doubled almost every possession while putting up 30 ppg, and was not named an all star. Honestly I’d say he’s underrated but I’m also extremely biased."
