"&gt; IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS  Those sound like Pokémon names, bet it's a cool player."
IGGY SIGHTING. I REPEAT. IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS HAS BEEN SPOTTED ON AN NBA COURT.
"Yes. In a close game against the Atlanta Hawks I want my coach to play Ignas Brazdeikis, Theo Pinson and fucking Jared Harper."
"Knicks legend Ignas Brazdeikis, who scored 19 points for New York"
Give me Ignas Brazdeikis or give me death
" You're right, Ignas Brazdeikis is definitely not Slovenian. He is Lithuanian, but now living in Canada. Not sure where the OP got his info, but it's wrong."
"Michigan also has Glenn Robinson III, Ignas Brazdeikis and Derrick Walton who are floating around. It doesn't help their top end quality but definitely means something for depth.  &amp;#x200B;  Plus Jon Teske and Zavier Simpson in the G League."
"&gt; Bamba, who most of us would be happy to send packing  Bamba for Ignas Brazdeikis and a 2023 2nd round pick no take backsies"
"You never heard of the great Sindarius Thornwell, or future HOF Ignas Brazdeikis? Damn casuals"
"To split hairs even more, there are multiple High School teams that play there.  Indiana Pacer Oshae Brissett also went there but played for ""Athlete Institute Prep"", and former NBA player Ignas Brazdeikis went Orangeville Prep like Jamal. And Thon Maker was at Athlete Insitute Prep at the SAME time Jamal was at Orangeville, and they basically each ran a team.  &amp;#x200B;  Used to coach there and it is really a top notch org"
"The hell, Ignas Brazdeikis got 31 minutes? Wishing him the best, never got to get any time with us"
Honestly I would definitely rather take a team assembled of the top 15 NCAA players than a team of:  Greg Whittington  Anžejs Pasečņiks  Will Magnay  Ashton Hagans  Theo Pinson  Ignas Brazdeikis  Keljin Blevins   Grant Riller  Gary Payton II  Jontay Porter  Malik Fitts  Oshae Brissett  Ray Spalding  Devon Dotson  Ty-Shon Alexander  Jalen Lecque  No coach ever plays all 15 players in a game so you only need the top 8 or 9 college players in the country. I guarantee that theres more than 8 college players in the NCAA who could enter the NBA right now and be better than the worst 15 NBA players.
Ignas Brazdeikis.
"1. I'm not down voting you, but maybe you should take the hint.   2. I'll be honest, I forgot that THJ was in Dallas because I only watch two teams: the Pistons (where Beilein now works, funnily enough) and the Nuggets. I have never cared about neither the Knicks nor the Mavericks.   3. So you can name one. Trey Burke comes off the bench for Dallas. Ignas Brazdeikis doesn't get minutes in NYC. Mo Wagner is behind *Thomas ""I score on my own basket"" Bryant* in Washington. Who even knows where Glenn Robinson III is anymore? Is he even still in the NBA?"
"At that point there was no one to give the minutes to over Bacon. Bacon wasn’t getting minutes over anyone important unless the guy you’re responding to was clamoring for more Ignas Brazdeikis or playing Chasson Randle at the 3.   Also, for the brief period after the trade deadline where MCW and Anthony were both healthy there was a pretty clear effort being made to split the PG minutes fairly evenly between them."
Must suck to be a knicks fan given your only good player is Drose whos 32 and you traded away your best player Ignas Brazdeikis
"You could not convince me, no matter what you say, that Larry Bird at 16 is not a better player than Ignas Brazdeikis right now."
"Otto Porter Jr is probably gone, and most of the random injury fill-ins we signed, so Chasson Randle, Ignas Brazdeikis, Donta Hall, Sindarius Thornwell. Strictly speaking, Mo Wagner is in that category, but I think we'll keep him.   I think we also probably will trade one of Gary Harris or Terrence Ross at some point."

But dat Ignas Brazdeikis talent tho...
"Deividas Sirvydis, Ignas Brazdeikis, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, Anžejs Pasečņiks, Udoka Azubuike.  I would also rename the team from Hornets to Bees and move the team to the fictional city of Spelling."

"Rokas Jokubaitis, Deivydas Sirvydis, Arnoldas Kulboka, Arnas Velička. Fellow Lithuanians. I mean there's also Ignas Brazdeikis, but we're already familiar with him, he's been hanging around the NBA for a while now."
"Franz NBA teammates with his own brother *and* a Michigan teammate (Ignas Brazdeikis). Go, Blue!"
Ignas Brazdeikis averaging 9.8 mpg and doing nothing
"Ignas Brazdeikis, our two-way player we were forced to play big minutes because we had 6 guys out (4 starters).  We started off the game well, and then he came in and all our momentum disappeared and the Spurs went on a massive run targeting him.  He played 19 minutes and had 2 pts on 1/6 shooting and was -30."
Ignas Brazdeikis baby!
This has got to be it. I’m sure it will be tough to part with Terrance Ross and Ignas Brazdeikis but the trade needs to be fair for both sides.
