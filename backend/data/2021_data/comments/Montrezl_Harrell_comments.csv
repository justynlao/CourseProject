"LOL @ montrezl harrell before ibaka.   Also, this is a shitty list."
&gt; this is the same sub that was calling Montrezl Harrell a gorilla and the n word all summer  lol jesus I havent seen a comment with this amount of absurdly inaccurate over the top hyperbole in almost 17 whole minutes since the last time I scrolled though a Westbrook thread
Ya'll weird af for these misogynistic comments in all of these threads. But this is the same sub that was calling Montrezl Harrell a gorilla and the n word all summer so what did I expect.
about the same amount of games as when montrezl harrell used luka doncics skin color as an insult
"Also, substitute a ton of Montrezl Harrell minutes for minutes to guys who can shoot the 3."
Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell are unplayable against the Brooklyn Nets.   The center position is overrated in 2021. The next 3-5 years are Brooklyns.  Nets in 4.
"Yes because defensive Specialist ""Kyle Kuzma"", a DPOY candidate can guard Jason Tatum and Brown of Jaylen better than Montrezl.   Let me remind you this:  Jayson Tatum dropped 41 pts on Kuzma's head on insane efficiency.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzq7rz4QQo  Do you honestly believe Kuzma or the Morris dude can do better than Montrezl Harrell? You need to think hard about this before answering me. If your answer is yes then we won't argue anymore. I can't change your mind/opinion. it is what it is."
"that's ""black hole on defense"" Montrezl Harrell for you"
Montrezl Harrell is a bad NBA player.
Los Angeles Lakers fans told me Montrezl Harrell was a good defender now. He will unplayable against the Brooklyn Nets... that’s if they even make the NBA Finals.  Most overrated offseason of all time.
It’s embarrassing that there are some Los Angeles Lakers fans that still think Montrezl Harrell will be playable against the Brooklyn Nets. You don’t have to delude yourself because he plays on your favorite team. He’s a garbage defender and can’t shoot. Garbage offseason move. Bad fit. Dennis Schröder starting is funny too lol.   The Los Angeles Lakers just had one of the most overrated offseasons of all time.
Precious looks eerily similar to Montrezl harrell
This Wes Matthews/Montrezl Harrell lineup never works.
“Zion is Montrezl Harrell” is one of the most galaxy brain idiotic things I think I’ve ever seen on this subreddit. You are genuinely not watching games if you think Zion doesn’t get doubled on almost every possession.
"&gt;Man is out to prove a point lmao  I admit, I find the legend of Zion fascinating.  If you listen to his fans, you would swear that opponents are running quadruple teams at him as soon as he crosses half-court, and despite that, he scores effortlessly against the entire NBA.  Reality is quite a bit different.    In reality, he accomplishes very little against NBA starters, and Van Gundy uses him basically as a sixth man -- almost exactly like Montrezl Harrell is used --  to take advantage of backup forwards who tend to be mediocre defenders, at best.  Even against those reserves, Williamson is rarely doubled, and teams invite him to shoot from 20+ feet any time he wants to.  He remains a raw prospect, but is being hyped outlandishly, and miles beyond what he's currently capable-of on the court."
"Not every game, but here's their recent Laker game.  Similar pattern, Williamson does most of his damage against Markieff Morris and Montrezl Harrell.  1st quarter  8:13 Top-Of-Key PNR for Williamson, no double, throws ball into crowd  7:50 TOK drive, blocked by Davis  5:37 elbow extended, single coverage by Davis, passed  2:44 Harrell primary on left block, Davis doubled after a few dribbles and blocked shot from behind  2:09 TOK, single coverage by Morris, layup for Williamson  0:28 left block, single coverage by Morris, Williamson loses ball, turnover  2nd quarter  11:41 Pseudo PNR at TOK, then single coverage by Morris, Williamson scores 5' shot  11:05 semi-fast break, Harrell and Morris converge to stop layup, makes pass to Hayes for layup  10:20 Morris single at FT line, James floats around in a soft-double, Williamson drive left, and misses layup  9:08 left block, single coverage by Morris, passes out  8:18 drives against single from Morris on left wing, scores from 5' and 1  7:50 brings ball up, drives into lane against Morris and James, TO  3:47 intial coverage by Caldwell-Pope on right block, double by Caruso, passed out  1:10 TOK PNR with Reddick, Davis stays on Williamson, passes  0:45 Dribble hand-off from Adams at FT line, drives on Gasol after switch, missed 5' shot  3rd quarter  11:26 right wing, single from Davis, drives into lane, questionably fouled by Gasol helping  10:10 brings ball up left wing, single from James, passes off  9:15 brings ball up center, drives on Davis, questionably fouled by Gasol  6:04 catches pass in middle of lane, goes up against Davis, missed from 6'  4th  11:14 left wing, covered by no one, drives for a layup and 1  10:49 brings ball up right side, single by James, passes off  10:16 TOK, PNR, Matthews switches, dribbles around him, Morris recovers and forces TO  9:17 brings ball up right side, drives on Harrell, misses 5' shot  8:34 right block, initial coverage by Morris, passes out as Harrell comes to double  7:10 catches ball in lane, bowls over Harrell, misses short shot, gets own rebound, makes layup  6:47 left block, versus Davis, drives, makes layup  4:36 catches at FT line, drives left on Harrell, misses 5' shot  \--  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; I just need all the data possible instead of a one game sample size.  Here's what you can do.  Watch the games, and pay actually attention, and stop talking out of your ass."
"&gt;uhh...he's still scoring points? And doing it rather well?  As basically a sixth-man, almost exactly like Montrezl Harrell does, and with largely the same toolset.  I'm not saying those points don't count, or anything.  I'm just pointing out that the people who see Williamson's 20 points in the boxscore need to realize that he isn't scoring most of those against starters -- exactly because he cannot do so reliably, and needs to be matched up with lesser players in order to succeed."
"&gt;I don't really understand SVG's reasoning here because Zion can score on anyone   That's exactly the problem, he cannot.  In college, he could simply overpower everyone.  He's still trying to do that, but it doesn't work against most NBA starters.  Against backups, however, is where he finds success.  Montrezl Harrell did a good job on him, and Harrell tries hard, but is not exactly an all-world defender."
"Lost among the ton of interesting things that happened in that game, Montrezl Harrell played a very good defensive game.  The Lakers asked him to handle Embiid alone frequently, and while he certainly didn't shut him down, he made him work for whatever he got, and had two steals off him ( 3 total ).  'Course he didn't score, and had just one rebound, so I guess TANSTAAFL, but it was nice to see him defend like that."
"after seeing those Montrezl Harrell threads, im convinced that Donald Sterling is an r/nba regular"
Sandwiched between Damion Lee and Montrezl Harrell...
"&gt;If you haven't seen how much teams are either doubling Zion on the catch or having him see extra bodies at the rim then I'm not sure you've seen many Pelican games.  This is an oft-cited legend, but not accurate.  Here, for one example, is how the Lakers recently defended Williamson.  Anthony Davis did take him a few times, but mostly they led Montrezl Harrell and Markieff Morris guard him alone.  Morris did struggle to guard Williamson, but Markieff Morris is making minimum wage for a reason.  1st quarter  8:13 Top-Of-Key PNR for Williamson, no double, throws ball into crowd  7:50 TOK drive, blocked by Davis  5:37 elbow extended, single coverage by Davis, passed  2:44 Harrell primary on left block, Davis doubled after a few dribbles and blocked shot from behind  2:09 TOK, single coverage by Morris, layup for Williamson  0:28 left block, single coverage by Morris, Williamson loses ball, turnover  2nd quarter  11:41 Pseudo PNR at TOK, then single coverage by Morris, Williamson scores 5' shot  11:05 semi-fast break, Harrell and Morris converge to stop layup, makes pass to Hayes for layup  10:20 Morris single at FT line, James floats around in a soft-double, Williamson drive left, and misses layup  9:08 left block, single coverage by Morris, passes out  8:18 drives against single from Morris on left wing, scores from 5' and 1  7:50 brings ball up, drives into lane against Morris and James, TO  3:47 intial coverage by Caldwell-Pope on right block, double by Caruso, passed out  1:10 TOK PNR with Reddick, Davis stays on Williamson, passes  0:45 Dribble hand-off from Adams at FT line, drives on Gasol after switch, missed 5' shot  3rd quarter  11:26 right wing, single from Davis, drives into lane, questionably fouled by Gasol helping  10:10 brings ball up left wing, single from James, passes off  9:15 brings ball up center, drives on Davis, questionably fouled by Gasol  6:04 catches pass in middle of lane, goes up against Davis, missed from 6'  4th  11:14 left wing, covered by no one, drives for a layup and 1  10:49 brings ball up right side, single by James, passes off  10:16 TOK, PNR, Matthews switches, dribbles around him, Morris recovers and forces TO  9:17 brings ball up right side, drives on Harrell, misses 5' shot  8:34 right block, initial coverage by Morris, passes out as Harrell comes to double  7:10 catches ball in lane, bowls over Harrell, misses short shot, gets own rebound, makes layup  6:47 left block, versus Davis, drives, makes layup  4:36 catches at FT line, drives left on Harrell, misses 5' shot  \--"
or Montrezl Harrell for some reason lol  They let him take naps up there.
"&gt; Ibaka, who Harrell is being compared to will not see his minutes and role decrease in the playoffs because he's a better player that doesn't have playoff weaknesses... do you not understand this?  Ibaka *did* see his minutes and role decrease last playoffs. Or were you unaware that the Celtics played him off the floor in Toronto's 2nd round loss to them? If Ibaka doesn't see his minutes and role decrease this year it'll be because the Clippers have no other options, not because he's a better player. If Trez sees his minutes and role decrease it's because AD and LeBron will be playing more minutes at the center/PF position. Do *you* not understand this?  &gt; Ibaka (again the person being compared to) is not going to be used like Dwight or Javale in the playoffs.  Again, that's because on the Clippers they have no other choice but to play him. It's the same reason they had Trez in there so much last year against guys like Jokic. The Clippers' roster is much thinner and more poorly constructed than the Lakers, so they don't have the option of just sitting their centers the way the Lakers did last year (and still can).  You really seem to be unaware of something that's both obvious and crucial here: Montrezl Harrell plays for *the Lakers* now, not the Clippers. He doesn't need to fill the role on the Lakers that the Clippers needed him to fill, he just needs to fill the role that the Lakers need him to fill. So if Trez isn't guarding the rim or is getting attacked on switches and gets played off the floor, oh well, same thing happened to Dwight and Javale. They can just sit him and plug in guys who are better suited to whatever the matchup is, same as last year.  But if *Ibaka* is having trouble with Jokic or AD or is getting abused on switches, the Clippers have to stick with him because they don't have any other choice. This IMO is part of the problem with just being super happy about the Batum signing. They swapped Green and Trez for Batum and Ibaka, and in the postseason it's not like Batum can credibly guard bigs. That's where the Clippers will miss Green. So all they have is Ibaka as a guy who can protect the rim and switch out to the perimeter. And he was absolutely cooked by the Celtics going small last year and got played off the floor. If Ibaka and Zubac get played off this year, the Clippers don't have an OG Anunoby or Paskal Siakam to pick up that frontcourt slack, cause Batum, Morris and Kawhi can't do it.  If the Clippers end up playing the Lakers this year and the Lakers have their LeBron/AD 4/5 lineup out there, if Ibaka can't guard AD (and I don't think he can), then I don't know what they're gonna do. But if Trez is in the game and is having trouble with Ibaka or whomever, then OK, the Lakers have many other options. See the difference?"
Chris Webber changed Montrezl Harrell into Montrell Harris today. And I almost died.
What could be worse than calling a Tech on Kelly Oubre for blowing Montrezl Harrell a kiss?  Refs: Watch this
Dude keeps calling Montrezl Harrell Montrel Harris
Friendship with Montrezl Harrell over  Montrell Harris is my new friend now
It’s Montrezl Harrell...
Montrezl Harrell dunked so hard they forgot his name
TIL Montrezl Harrell is actually pronounced Montrell Harrell.....thanks C Webb
"Known pivot maniac, Montrezl Harrell"
"He’s actually 2nd, the best player in the league is Montrezl Harrell"
I thought about it and man Carlos Boozer was born at the right time. As good as he was I’m not really sure he was better than Montrezl Harrell. Montrezl Harrell in an era where it would be okay for him to play the 4 could definitely be a 24/10 sidekick
Oh please. Everyone was understanding and empathetic when Montrezl Harrell took time for his grandma.   It's about how you come across.
My mans just called Montrezl Harrell a TOP FIVE player.  You just said Kemba wasn’t even a ‘star’ yet a man who has to sign a VETERAN MINIMUM just so he can spite his former team IS? And since when did Doc Rivers LEAVE? He was let go cause he couldn’t stop blowing 3-1 leads. “Several Role players left”? Since when was Jamychal Green several players?  Stick to baseball man.
He died so Montrezl Harrell could take his place
"I think guarding Jokic with Montrezl Harrell is completely different than guarding three perimeter stars with three great perimeter defenders (in the Nuggets series, Jamal Murray had the biggest drop in ppg between consecutive series in NBA history while being guarded by Kawhi, PG and Bev)"
"If Lou Will, Montrezl Harrell and Jamal Crawford can win it, do can Boucher even with his MPG being high. 6MOTY is not the ""player with the sixth highest MPG of the the year"", it's the first off the bench player of the year."
The reason he frustrates me is because I feel like he could be much much better if only he played with more energy/effort. He could be a Montrezl Harrell type
PJ Tucker isn't better than Harrell of Montrezl wtf
Montrezl Harrell has a better defensive rating than Giannis does   League fucked
"Javale McGee got 4M and was seen as a minimum contract player  Dwight got a minimum and was only signed late in the offseason because Boogie got hurt, he literally wouldn't have gotten signed if the Lakers didn't sign him  Rondo signed for the minimum because he was seen as a terrible ball hog  Avery bradley signed for 5M and was waived by the Grizzlies, no team had cap space left by the time the Lakers signed him so 5M was the most he was gonna get  KCP re-signed with the Lakers after being there 2 years prior  Caruso signed for 3M and hadn't played regular NBA rotation minutes yet  Danny Green got 15M  Nobody was going to offer any of those guys more than what we offered. Only this year with Wesley Matthews, Montrezl Harrell, and Marc Gasol have we gotten ring chasers, and none of those caliber players are going to hit the buyout market."
"Tristan Thompson, Montrezl Harrell, Serge Ibaka got paid 9m/yr each. Robin Lopez got 7m. Steven Adams got a 2 years extension for 17m/yr. And those were in the same free agency. Sure, Dwight's injury history and past locker room history might hurt his value a little but I would assume that he's worth at least the same as some of the names on this list"
Montrezl Harrell and Hayward
"Gotta go Trez, Caruso is a good grit and hustle player but we’ve all seen the highs Montrezl Harrell can play at.  But can’t be mad at the fans for picking the guy that helped contribute the team getting a chip."
Montrezl Harrell and Alex Caruso
"&gt;you can’t fault their logic.  You certainly can.  Promote the players who can play.  Williamson is doing most of his scoring against bench players right now.  Last night he accomplished next to nothing against Gasol and Davis, but Markieff Morris couldn't do anything with him.  This has been the pattern most of the season for him.  He's really Montrezl Harrell with an enormous publicity team right now.  And Harrell is by-far the better defender -- not that he's even better than average, but Williamson might legitimately be the worst defender in the league.  Nobody wants to see that when there are so many skilled players."
Imagine thinking Montrezl Harrell is going to be playable against the Brooklyn Nets.  Nets in 4.
Karl Malone would just be Montrezl Harrell if he got ejected or fouled out every game for throwing elbows
"I'll answer your question, but first answer this   Is Montrezl Harrell racist?"
"Morey is an overrated drafter. Maybe he picks up a decent rotation guy in the second round like Montrezl Harrell but we've had way too many Royce Whites, Terrence Joneses, and Sam Dekkers any time we had a halfway decent pick.  It shows that he himself knew this toward the end by just trading them away in recent seasons."
He passed the torch to Montrezl Harrell
he has enes kanter and montrezl harrell type of flaws which means very little trade value for his offensive production
"Lee wasn't really all-star level after 2012-13 season.  He lost his J after that, which made a really one dimensional scorer. He could only really score right under the basket.  Think Montrezl Harrell but with a really soft ambidextrous touch around the rim, better passing, and somehow worse defense."
"6th man is interesting. A 6th man on an average or bad team can look way better than they actually are, but other times it truly is a case of just already having a star in the same position. The lakers have a few people better than Clarkson on their bench. Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell are both better than Clarkson and are having a tremendous impact but the Lakers bench seems to be deep enough that no particular bench player seems vital for the Laker’s success."
"That was maybe the most impressive thing I've seen Montrezl Harrell do this whole season. In the air, through contact falling to his right, switching in air to finish the layup."
Montrezl Harrell missed a sizable chunk of the bubble because his grandma died. When someone leaves on “personal” you don’t know what it is and you can’t make assumptions like that without proof.  Now that we know what he’s doing he 100% deserves criticism.
"I reckon Montrezl Harrell. He would of been a beast in the early 90’s during Jordan’s era. He could of fitted in with the Bulls BIG 3, he’s that good imo."
"What does Montrezl Harrell do better than Faried exactly?  Either way, the torch has been passed."
"You got Marc gasol, montrezl Harrell and Schroeder.  You got 2/3 of the SMOY.  I’m not calling u guys cheaters... Pelinka did a masterful job.  But you guys are far and away the best team  in the league.  Your roster is ridiculously better than everyone and you guys have the ability to sign really good players for cheap.  It’s not your fault as a fan.  I just don’t think it’s good for the nba."
He plays pretty similarly to Montrezl Harrell when he goes to the paint.
As a Laker fan Lakers need to play better defense wish we still had Dwight no offense to Marc or Montrezl Harrell its just that are rim protection was great when Dwight was there...

The difference between Randle and Sabonis is the difference between Anthony Davis and Montrezl Harrell
Imagine simping for Montrezl Harrell of all players LMAO
"&gt;That's such a stupid risk by him to leave 60 million on the table  That's your opinion. Other people may not agree. After his current contract is up, he will have made $34m in his career, will only be 28, will have played in LA for probably the most historic and famous franchise, will have played with a guy who may go down as the GOAT, and may have a ring. It's not the objectively incorrect decision like some of you believe. You just may value things differently than Harrell does. You need to work on understanding that your opinions are not the only valid ones.  &gt;but no one gives af about Montrezl Harrell's legacy lmao.  I know someone who might. His name is Montrezl Harrell. You might not know this, but professional athletes typically like to win championships."
"Memphis' starters are 1/13 for 3 points, and they lead the Lakers by 5 at the end of 1  (marc gasol +7, montrezl harrell -12)"
https://lakersdaily.com/montrezl-harrell-appears-throw-shade-clippers-after-sign-luke-kennard-massive-extension/
Montrezl Harrell must have a burner account here
"Montrezl Harrell has attempted 7 mid-range shots so far this season, connecting on 5. He's a career 33% from mid-range.  It's cool that he's made most of the absurdly few he's taken, but he misses the next couple and we're right back where we were."
"From the latest ringer article.   Doc Rivers was loyal to Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, and Montrezl Harrell, and kept them in roles that fit their games. But all that is out the window under Lue. Beverley is averaging the fewest shots (5.7 per game) he has since his rookie season, Williams is down to no. 6 on the team in touches (35.7), and Harrell is on the Lakers.  (Lou was second in touches. More than PG last season)"
Every other team in the league lauds Montrezl Harrell for his defense
"Yeah thats a good point. I thought Bogy and Gallo could have a Lou Will / Montrezl Harrell type thing going where both play well enough to be in consideration for the award, but with the nod to Bogy because he'll play more games and probably have the ball in his hands more"
"I honestly didn’t realize he averaged 21 a game last year on 56 TS%. He might actually be good?? I feel like no one has given him attention since he came into the league.  Also, never forget than Montrezl Harrell was included on the top 100 lists lol."
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
as everyone's favorite clipper Montrezl Harrell would scream   #AAAAAAAND ONEEEEEEE
It truly is a mystery why Paul George got preferential treatment over Montrezl Harrell /s
Jesus if only thomas bryant was decent at defense. He's absolutely elite on the offensive end. Similar to montrezl Harrell
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would easily shoot at least 50/50/90 in the NBA Finals against the Lakers, especially with Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and Talen Horton-Tucker on the team.  As a Kevin Durant fan.... I would much rather face the Lakers than the Clippers in the Finals.  Nets in 4 against the Lakers."
"It's not like Kerr has a bunch of lottery picks to develop.  He turned Looney into a borderline starter level player (before injuries really hamstrung him.) His was defensive versatility was absolutely huge in our playoff series vs the Rockets.  Paschall made the rookie first team and is looking like he will develop into a Montrezl Harrell type role.  Draymond showed his his hustle  the year before, but Kerr ultimately made the decision not to play David Lee in favor of Dray and allowed him to flourish into an all-star.  Bell and McCaw all exceeded expectations and contributed in small ways during final runs while one the roster. They're both essentially out of the league once leaving the Dubs.  Poole is developing nicely.  None of those players were picked higher than 30, must were deep second rounders. You're not going to be finding superstars, but he's maximized most players."
The weird switch on Montrezl Harrell once he joined the Lakers is so comical
The man left a young dynasty to go play with Pat Beverly and Montrezl Harrell. I don't respect that in the slightest. He also killed his brand. Kawhi was cool in Toronto. Nobody talks about him now that he's in LA. My bitterness is overtaken by the incomprehensibility of the decision. You want to live in LA? do it in the offseason. Could have signed for 2 years in Toronto and gone to LA after that with 3 rings and a legacy.
He transformed into Montrezl Harrell
"Montrezl ""double standard"" harrell"
"Montrezl Harrell: ""I'm never ever one to blame the refereeing, but this is getting out of hand. We continually get screwed. We won this game in my opinion. It's getting fucking ridiculous. I'm sick of it. It eats at me. It's really getting out of hand."""
"Tyrese Haliburton, Jordan Clarkson, Norman Powell, Montrezl Harrell, Enes Kanter"
Ah yes with perennial MVP leader Montrezl Harrell losing this game.
"Montrezl Harrell got a tech tonight for yelling ""and 1"".   The hell is going on?"
No one:  Montrezl Harrell after a dunk: https://data.whicdn.com/images/309193058/original.gif
"And people can also make a mistake and go too far, or say something they regret and try to make amends for it. When Montrezl Harrell called Doncic a ""white boy"" last year, he wasn't immediately expelled from the league. He was given a chance to apologize and learn from his mistake."
"I've been saying that the issue is Ainge.  His overall drafting and acquisitions have been atrocious.   I look at the teams that are contenders.  They have their superstar(s) but the also have good/great supporting cast and depth.  What I see is their players are athletic, have length,  good ball handle handlers and great-good rebounders and their players have a combination of these things. I look as our roster and dont see anyone with the above mentioned except maybe Robert Williams. Ainge got rid of Kanter and even Poirie(sp) so now we get bullied under the boards.   He wanted more versatile 5s then decided to get Thompson who is average at best.  He put on too much weight and lost his leaping ability.    We could have gotten Christian Wood for cheap!!!! Imagine getting close to 20 points from him and 10 rebounds? Also,  he can spread the floor.   I think Montrezl Harrell was a affordable contract.  He's a bad man, a Marcus Smart type with more size.  I think I'd rather have him than Thies(sp) or Thompson.  We could have gotten Dwight Howard,  Javale McGee cheap and Whiteside for nothing!! Rondo would have been better than Teague and if Ainge had the foresight,  he would have gotten D. Rose from Detroit.  How come Ainge cant find the Browns(Nets), Caruso(Lakers) and other so called no-name players who are playing lights-out????  Speaking of foresight, he drafts Grant William's and Carson Edward's but the are sitting or not being the kind of contributors we need.  We let Max Straus go he he's playing well.  What about drafting Neismith but haven't been giving him time to develop? We could have gotten Bey and we also gave Memphis Bane who has the best 3 point percentage of the rookies.   Tatum and Brown are good-great players at times but they are too young.  Kobe needed Shaq he got really good, where the y just needed to surround him with the right roll players.  I think we miss Hayward more than we think.  His years of experience plus the ability to give us 20 points at any night is a plus.  Kemba is going down hill and doesn't have the explosiveness quickness like J. Morant or Fox.  He's a defensive liability and that's bad for a team known for defense.  We miss Horford and also Crowders tough ess.  We have 2 choices.  Either chalk this year and play the young guys so they have experience and also to see who they should keep. Second,  they can make some moves like sending picks and players to get someone who can contribute more than what we have.  Would it be possible to get Rose and Knox for Kemba, Thompson or Thies and our trade exception?   What about 2-1st rounders,  Kemba and Thompson for Turner and Warren?     Steven's can do better but he's dealing with the hand Ainge gave and continues to give him.  Gros said sometime ago that he would go over the luxury tax to be competitive.....well, let's see if he's serious"
The guy could apologize.  It seemed to work for Montrezl Harrell.
"Lakers win  LMAO they really let the reigning Champion Lakers get even deeper, LeBron still best player at 36, resign AD, CaruGOAT still the best role player in the league, traded Danny Brick for Dennis, and added Marc Gasol and 6MOY Montrezl Harrell. Clippers have no chance, no team is even close, we going back to back 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Lakers lose  Lebron is literally 36 years old why do you expect him to carry?? Your standards are literally too high. The team's offense is terrible when LeBron sits. Gasol is washed, nobody can shoot, and the team sucks without AD. You shouldn't expect this team to be good with AD out. Depth? Why is Jared Dudley playing in the middle of the 2nd quarter! It's the regular season! Who cares how good we are. All this Superteam formation just to beat a balding 36 year old 🤬😩😩"
"Montrezl Harrell is probably the prime outlier. Christian Wood, Bam Adebayo, and Chris Boucher are also all relatively small among centers."
"Bad trades all around  1. Covington is significantly better and more available than Porzingis, the Mavs would have to send out at least 2-3 1st round picks for the trade itself to make sense (1 at least for KPs injuries and contract)  2. Hassan Whiteside wont go for less than a 1st round pick most likely  3. Montrezl Harrell is at the moment better than Grant (albeit barely) and you are suggesting they throw in a top 5 3&amp;D player in KCP AND a 1st round pick? Talk about a desperation move from the Lakers"
&gt; Explain how Robin Lopez was getting spoonfed when Harrell was in  Lopez is a center and he was going one on one against Montrezl. I already said Montrezl Harrell is not the guy you want defending a center one on one  The problems you laid out are fair but they're dependent on the team construction as you said since he's forced to be the C. That doesn't necessarily make Kuzma better. It just means he has an easier role
"Especially because, unlike in the 18-19 season with just Bron and no AD, we had the assets still on our team that we traded for him  Having a young Ingram, Lonzo and Hart would help right now, not these uninspired old bums. This notion that we had a stacked superteam was ridiculous, and the move of letting Dwight go for Montrezl Harrell especially is been the one really wrong move we made in the offseason that hurts us"
"Late first round pick and Montrezl Harrell, and salary matches. Done deal!!"
Remember when Kelly Oubre got a tech for blowing a kiss at Montrezl Harrell earlier this season? Like wtf just let the guys play
No one:   Montrezl Harrell after a dunk: https://assets.sbnation.com/assets/973715/westlol.gif
LMFAOOOOOOO! I did not just see Montrezl Harrell attempt a three
"Best player looking at his entire career: Shaq  Best individual season: KG, Kawhi and possibly this year's Embiid  Best player in Doc's mind: Montrezl Harrell"
"Who would you have preferred take the shot? Montrezl Harrell is a career 65% FT shooter, Kuzma is 73%, Caruso is 76%. It's not like they had any good FT shooters on the floor that were obviously better choices than LeBron."
I mean Montrezl Harrell is *very* likely to become unplayable in the playoffs lol I don't understand your point here.  Clarkson is a weak defender/playmaker. When rotations shrink his opportunities to feast against second units will diminish which will dampen his impact on the game.
"....again, how would he become unplayable. That's such a nonsense thing to say about the 6th man in a rotation, without giving any reason whatsoever when no team so far has really had an answer for him. Ok then, I've just decided Montrezl Harrell will probably become unplayable in the playoffs, because I said so, lol."
"Yeah, it's weird to see guys like Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell win the award over guys like Iggy and Marcus Smart."
Montrezl Harrell disagrees
"so do gir lions in india, dr montrezl harrell knows his facts"
"Even when Montrezl Harrell gives a fun quote, people still got to put him down on this sub :("
Kenneth Faried died so Montrezl Harrell could take his place.

Montrezl Harrell  *ducks*
"Just earlier some Sixers fan, in order to downplay the LeBron MVP case, called us the most 'stacked superteam' in the league, even with AD out... even tho haters clowned our lack of depth from the jump  Apparently adding Schroeder, washed Marc Gasol and no defense Montrezl Harrell makes us a superteam."
"This is such a homer take my guy, you're pulling stats so deep trying to find evidence that apparently Jokic can score better than Embiid, he just doesn't want to??? Embiid is averaging 29ppg on 67%TS while Jokic has 27 on 65%TS. Embiid is scoring more, on better efficiency, in less time.   Your argument using the clippers also shows your complete lack of ability to think about context lmao. He was doubled teamed by the clippers because their best center was Montrezl Harrell. If it's just the passing, then why is Harden doubled?"
You just described Montrezl Harrell with a three ball.
"Their backup centre went from Dwight Howard to Montrezl Harrell. This isn’t that surprising, and it also doesn’t really matter because AD will be back at the 5 during the playoffs."
"DAE find it funny that Montrezl Harrell and Lou Dort are very similar players, but Montrezl has a French sounding name, but Lou is the actual French guy."
Montrezl “Locker room cancer” Harrell has been baling the past couple of games
"Oddly enough, Montrezl Harrell was statistically similar to Anthony Davis as a defender within 6 feet last season:   - [2019-20 Harrell:](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-lt6/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612746&amp;sort=FGA_LT_06&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Harrell) 50.7% FG allowed, 5.6 DFGA  - [2019-20 Davis:](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-lt6/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747&amp;sort=FGA_LT_06&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Davis) 49.8% FG allowed, 5.3 DFGA  He was similarly good in 2018-19, too:   - [2018-19 Harrell:](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-lt6/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612746&amp;sort=FGA_LT_06&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Harrell) 54.9% FG allowed, 5.3 DFGA"
"Remember when Luka and Montrezl Harrell got into that verbal scrap last year then suddenly there were loads of new ""Mavs fans"" on social media spouting racist shit? I 'member."
Montrezl Harrell lost major weight over the offseason
"Right on, Schröder ended up paying it for trez  Edit: https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/4/8/22374990/lakers-dennis-schroder-pay-montrezl-harrell-fine-team-chemistry"
"if you really think that come playoffs, rondo and ibaka won’t be WAY more valuable than lou and montrezl fucking harrell, then idk what to tell you lol"
"Montrezl Harrell yelled, “There you go!” Andre Drummond gave a look of pleasant surprise.  Alex Caruso belted, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Jared Dudley hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Yes, the one that it took an all-time level meltdown for the Nuggets to beat after going down 3-1. A few less Montrezl Harrell minutes in Game 5 would’ve sealed the victory for the Clippers."
I wouldn’t be suprised if McConnell pulls a Montrezl Harrell and is nominated for 6MOY and DPOY
"&gt;Montrezl Harrell said he doesn’t understand the ejection  /  &gt;""My beef is with anybody who doesn’t have a Lakers jersey.""  Pick one lol. Reffs know that Montrezl is a very emotional and reactive player. Reputations matter."
"Sabonis is 24, there are not many 24 year olds on the list.    Sabonis is a center that can't guard his position and can't shoot.  He is a glorified Montrezl Harrell with passing ability"
\&gt; Montrezl Harrell said he doesn’t understand the ejection   &amp;#x200B;  Ref: Dwight Howard sends his regards
"You're right about Schroder and Harrell. They're vitally important when LeBron is out- both of those guys are much better shot creators than anyone the Lakers had last year other than LeBron and AD. I think Montrezl Harrell, in particular, has been essential this season. You can run isos and post-ups and use him as a roller and get pretty good, efficient offense out of it. It's not ideal but it works better than their alternatives.  Schroder isn't perfect either but he can dribble penetrate and that gives you something to generate shots with. I think adding those guys was crucial to this season.  Harrell's offense will be less important in the playoffs but that's fine, they won't need it. It will buy them a couple of 8 to 10 minute shifts in the middle of a game, and that's fine."
"&gt;The roster moves that looked so good in November, winning raves for the Lakers’ front office, haven’t panned out. Dennis Schröder and Montrezl Harrell have not proved capable of pinch-carrying the Lakers during the regular season when James and Davis are unavailable. I believed, as resolutely as the Lakers, that they would be, but Schröder and Harrell tend to be more concerned with their own scoring than anything else. When the Lakers explored the trade market for both last month, it seemed to confirm their own uncertainty about the fit.  Hasn't Harrell been fine in his role on the roster?"
"Seems like you share this opinion with others in this thread.   Maybe Lou is too old, or Harrell is a liability against the best centers, but I remember the Clippers were dominant with Kawhi and PG in the first unit and Lou and Montrezl in the second.    How does the bench scoring unit look like for the Clips now?"
"&gt; To me though, the loss of Montrezl Harrell and sweet Lou Williams will prove to be too much and the Clippers will fail to make the WCF again this season.   Casual spotted"
"I respectfully disagree. Looking at the reviews carefully, at first there was no bad intent between Schroder and OG. OG grabbed onto his leg cuz he was falling and Schroder latched onto him. Then OG got pissed and flipped him over. Thats where it went wrong for him.  As for Harrell, he shouldnt have gone to start a fight from Trent Jr. At least from the angle I saw, Trent Jr. was just there. He wasnt doing anything. Then Montrezl ran and started fighting him. Even if Trent Jr. was about to act aggressively, usually going to fight isnt going to help your case.   But looking back on it. Maybe youre right, maybe they just shouldve gotten a double tech."
I can imagine very few things scarier than Montrezl Harrell running at my face ready to fight
Because we have a better Cacok and his name is Montrezl Harrell
Gary Trent: just standing there  Montrezl Harrell: time to attack
Honestly that's cool and all but the thing I love the most about Luka and Jokic is that they're so classy unlike Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley

Do you watch your own fucking team? 18.4% of Kawhi Leonard's shot attempts and 17.5% of Paul George's shot attempts come from 0-3 feet. Each of those numbers are low for star players. Zubac and Mann get to the line at a high rate but shoot less than 5 times per game. What do you expect?   The Clippers last season led the league in free throw attempts IIRC. They lost Montrezl Harrell (who got to the line a ton) in the offseason and Lou Williams (who is now also gone) declined ptetty hard.
"Ah yes, Clippers fans love Montrezl Harrell.  We're so biased.  Never mind the fact that we all criticize his horrendous defense as a reason for blowing the series vs Denver.  And never mind the fact that he can be a great offensive player and still a poor player overall because he's a.liability at a position that requires good defensive skills."
Clarkson. I'd put Montrezl Harrell at #2. Montrezl has 15 ppg and McConnell has 7 ppg
But Montrezl Harrell is elite and is putting up ridiculous numbers when he's usually going up against bigger and taller defenders.  You also realize you're using size to discredit a player who is undersized for his position...
"Montrezl Harrell is #5 in scoring for all Centers in the league. He's one of the best scoring Centers in the league. Sure plenty of big men have good FG% because of putbacks, but they aren't able to create their own shot the way Montrezl can. Plenty of players can do what Powell does"
Montrezl Harrell is #5 in pts per game for all Centers. DeAndre Jordan is #29 on that list. Montrezl Harrell is one of the top scoring Centers in the league
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"
Montrezl Harrell.
He changed his name to Montrezl Harrell and now plays for the Lakers
"&gt;So you're trying to ascribe value to Embiid for the team being worse when he sits - that's not how it works. He gets no credit for those games, his value is zero in each one.   This is one of the dumbest statements about a team game I've ever heard. I guess LeBron James has zero value to the Lakers this season because he's missed games. No. That shows how important a player is to their team. If your record gets 20% worse when a single player sits, they're quite valuable to your team. Moving on.  &gt;Even if Embiid is more valuable per game that he plays, Jokic is still very valuable, and because he plays more games his value will surpass Embiid's.   How? If Jokic wins more games. Sure. If he put up his current stats and goes on a losing streak, then I doubt we'll be having this conversation in a month. Someone else will become the front runner.  &gt;Value over replacement - Jokic is at 5.8, Embiid at 2.7.  &gt;Win shares - Jokic at 10.7, Embiid at 6.2.  I can't believe people still quote these stats. They're next to useless. Do you think Domantas Sabonis is the 19th best player in the league? Do you think Montrezl Harrell is the 10th best player in the league? Also, since we're using WS. Why not use WS/48 where Jokic .300 and Embiid is .295. DRTG where Embiid is third and Jokic isn't top. ORTG, where Jokic is 6th and Embiid is 19th.  You can use crappy stats to favor either side of the argument. Advanced stats in general that aren't player specific(RTG, WS, VORP) are mostly trash. I'm trying to imagine in what world someone would look at VORP and WS and be like Mikal Bridges is better than Jamal Murray."
"""On June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations.""... yes he ""joined"" him...  ""On July 16, 2019, the Houston Rockets traded Paul, 2024 and 2026 first round picks, and 2021 and 2025 second round pick swaps to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Russell Westbrook.""... yes... also ""joined"" him"
"Maybe, but they'll be using AD a lot at center in the playoffs, and they now have three other options for the remaining center minutes. It's totally possible Frank Vogel will prefer to give those minutes to Marc Gasol or Montrezl Harrell instead of Drummond, depending on how Drummond fits in with LeBron and AD and what his defense looks like."

I don’t see it. I also don’t see the montrezl harrell nene comparison either tho
This sub flipped it's shit over the Montrezl Harrell thing lmao. It's expected at this point.
"Previous tweet:  &gt;[B/R reports the #Hornets primarily targeted Myles Turner, Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, and Richaun Holmes before the trade deadline.](https://twitter.com/SwarmnSting/status/1376933083899826183?s=20)"
I find it hilarious how the nets add a 35 y/o LMA and a way past his prime BG and act like it’s unfair but seem to be completely quiet when Lebron and the lakers add   Anthony Davis  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroeder  Montrezl Harrell  Andre Drummond
"&gt;Aight bro if you really think you're right take it to r/NOLAPelicans  Oh, I'm sure I'd find totally unbiased, reasonable opinions there.  Current Lakers' fans also think Kobe Bryant was better than Jerry West, when the latter did everything better.  Popular opinions are often wrong, and again, argument by ""Well other people say..."" is meaningless.  I don't care that Williamson fans think he's the second coming.  So far, he's the second coming of Montrezl Harrell.  By the way, ""bro"", you neglected to answer the questions.  Why does Van Gundy use Williamson against reserves whenever possible?  Why is that when most of Williamson's production occurs?  Why is Williamson 3rd in FTA while 37th in drives/game, when that's his entire offensive arsenal?"
unfortunately for the nuggets we don't have montrezl harrell or doc rivers anymore
"It's appropriate that the accompanying image shows Williamson illegally clearing-out against a taller defender, since he does that constantly.  Apart from the officiating that Williamson benefits from as the new golden child, he and Montrezl Harrell are the same player."
"&gt;SG - Lou Williams  &gt;PF - Montrezl Harrell  First off, Lou and Trezz are a PG and a C  Second off, they 100% belong in the league, you blind"
Montrezl Harrell
Montrezl Dashay Harrell
"The defensive numbers don't agree with you at all. Montrezl is *considerably* better than Kanter there.  Honestly, rebounding is about the only area Kanter wins. Harrell is better in just about every other metric. TS%, STL%, BLK%, lower TOV%, WS, WS/48, DWS(Trez doubles him up here), OBPM, DBPM(0.6 to -2.2 lol), BPM, VORP...  Again, it's really not close overall, but especially defensively. And to be honest, as one sided as it is statistically, it's *more* obvious by just watching them both play how much more of a net positive Harrell is."
"He goes over and talks to the refs like a normal person, rather than yelling at them from afar. If you've got video of him angrily getting in a ref's face, I'd love to see it, cause I watch every Lakers game and never see him do that. He doesn't get T'd up cause he doesn't show the refs up with angry outbursts. He talks to them, but he doesn't lose his cool when he does it. There's a huge difference between how someone like Montrezl Harrell talks to a ref and how LeBron does it."
"Probably because my analysis, like everyone else's, was based on the original video where we didn't have the benefit of slow motion. I guess I should issue a public apology to Harrell and Lakers fans.  Dear, Montrezl and Lakers fans.  I'm sorry for being wrong on the internet.  Thankfully, u/RickySuela was there to spam a slow motion video to correct me.  Many apologies."

This madman frank vogel is utilizing a defense based on montrezl harrell lmaoo
"Montrezl Harrell is the fakest tough guy, he flopped, there is no second elbow"
"After watching him all year, I just don't understand how you take BJ Boston at all. Sure the argument is always raw is okay, that can be refined... but he's not just raw, he bad. Lays so, so many bricks and misses layups regularly.  I like Isaiah Jackson more but his strengths have been pretty phased out of the game. Strikes me as a thinner Montrezl Harrell, could build muscle as a pro."
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"The Clippers last year:  Lue: ""So, what does our center rotation look like?""  Doc: ""Okay, so we're going to start Ivica Zubac. But we're only going to play him like 18 minutes per game.""  Lue: ""What about the rest of the time, including crunch time?""  Doc: ""I'm glad you asked- We're going to play Montrezl Harrell at center the rest of the time.""  Lue: ""That guy's like 6'8"", are we going to send help when he's defending a bigger player in the post?""  Doc: ""Here's the brilliant part-- No."""
"&gt;LMA was great at defense once he came to San Antonio and didn't have so much offensive responsibility. He led the league defensively for FG% at the rim for a couple years.  This is a small fraction of what defense is, guys like Montrezl Harrell do well in this stat every year. The Spurs simplified his role defensively, acting like he was ever near Bosh or Howard's class defensively is just outing yourself.   &gt;A real star player could at least win 40 games even if the cast was bad  Again what I was saying earlier about people reducing player convos to their obsession with floor raising and ""can you carry limited teams to 40 wins or 45 wins. That's how we'll decide who is better"". Even if I agreed with your premise that LMA was a better floor raiser which I dont really, I just dont care about it nearly as much as you do"
"Don't forget montrezl harrell, Kobe bryant, rajon rondo, and Kenyon Martin.  Also as a bonus carmello Anthony, he had to have said something when Jeremy was outshinning him"
"Montrezl Harrell, DeMarre Carrol, Kenneth Faried are all the same person to me"
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
Did the NBA do anything to Montrezl Harrell?
"Not really. Defensive stats are skewed heavily by rotations and team defensive strength.  Ben Simmons is a top 10 defender in the league, but many defensive stats have Montrezl Harrell as statistically better because of his team/rotation. You cannot rely on any defensive stats for a ""general feel of things""."
Did Montrezl Harrell get in trouble for calling Luka Doncic a pussy ass white boy?
Anyone remember when Montrezl Harrell used a racial slur and didn’t get punished?
"Fucking ridiculous, Montrezl Harrell also said a racial slur during a competitive game but didn’t get penalized. 🤦‍♂️"
Because they're talking about Montrezl Harrell?
"fuck, I mean I guess if you needed me to explain to you how some whataboutism concerning Montrezl Harrell last night was designed to intentionally detract from an important discussion about anti-semitism then I guess you probably also need help understanding why Meyers isn't playing another minute in the NBA any time soon.  Hold on, lemme go look for some crayons..."
Lets not forget about Montrezl Harrell too
"Montrezl Harrell is ideally the man out. He’s such a weird fit on this team despite his elite production in limited minutes. But Vogel reducing his minutes with AD injured leads me to believe he doesn’t trust him much defensively.   And with him having a player option, he most likely will walk to get a bigger payday and/or because he doesn’t like his role here. Lakers have got to make better use of his salary imo."

So montrezl harrell didnt get booted out of the league last year for using a racially charged statement againdt Luka.... but this guy Meyers gets cancelled ASAP. 😂🤣😊🤣 the nba is trash
Montrezl Harrell?
Yeah I think montrezl Harrell tweeted “now we can’t even game in peace?” then deleted it
What was the punishment Montrezl Harrell got?
 Montrezl Harrell
"I find people's reactions to these things more interesting than the actual controversy.   Is Leonard some sort of anti-Semitic neo-Nazi? I'm going to guess probably not.   Did he say something stupid and offensive which he should should some contrition for? Yes.   Does he deserve nationwide attention and a suspension that will cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars and become a huge red mark against his image? Come on.   This and the Montrezl Harrell- Luka Doncic incident don't have any real impact on anything, but the way people react to it to try to defend their corners or spread indignation is what I find most fascinating and relevant. Either we decide to stop giving a fuck about the small things or we keep raising the temperature."
"It says something very interesting when you try to equate dropping an antisemitic slur with Montrezl Harrell.  What Harrell did wasn't okay. This? Yeah, this is quite a bit worse.  I'm not sure if you're overselling what Harrell said, or underselling the antisemitic slur."
But there was no issues when Montrezl Harrell and his racial comment towards Luka Doncic. Something screams double standards. If you want to punish Meyers Leonard then Montrezl should be punished too
"Montrezl Harrell only if you pronounce his name with the L.  Otherwise, probably Caldwell Pope."
“I didn’t know what the phrase “White boy” meant when I said it to Luka” - Montrezl Harrell
"not to be a dick, because its obvious Leonard deserves to be shat on. But if the NBA ""unequivocally condemned all forms of hate"" they would've done something about Montrezl Harrell being racist towards Doncic, several individuals being racist towards jews, and several others towards Jeremy Lin and asian players  Seems the NBA is only worried about one form of racism while if you believe every human being is equal under their skin then you should know that every race is able of being racist"
They must've missed Montrezl Harrell
"Yeah, I don't think we'd give Zo that much money and that 2016 offseason was a crazy summer with so many bad deals given out other than Batum.  &amp;#x200B;  How are you liking Kupchak so far? IMO, he's done Ok, but I've soured on him a little when it was leaked that we offered 80 million to freaking Montrezl Harrell of all people"
Big black man with dreads = Montrezl Harrell?
"As Montrezl Harrell would politely say, ""***AAAAAAAAAND ONEEEEE***"""
"As previously noted...  One should apply some era adjustment to this efficiency statistic. Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA. All are obviously active players. Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"&gt;Big men are not getting the same quality shots if the three point line doesn't exist.    That's true, but I'm referring to the shots they got without the arc.  Nowadays, bigs routinely shoot way over 50%.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%.  11 of the 20 all-time are currently active bigs.  &gt;You can watch tape of games before the line was introduced  Believe it or not, some of us played basketball before the arc.  We don't need to watch tape.  &gt; and see how cramped the paint was  And bigs still shot better than Curry does, most years.  The median seasonal effective FG% is .478, and most bigs are north of the median most of the time, almost by definition."
"&gt;It's not even about Zion, nobody is getting called at the rim anymore  That's questionable.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%, in NBA history.  11 of the top 20 all-time are currently-active bigs.  Those guys are not shooting threes, and they are converting their shots at unprecedented rates -- because interior defense is virtually non-existent in today's NBA."
"&gt;The right guy with the right skill set could abuse these mini centers  It doesn't even require much of a skill set.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in NBA effective FG%.  12 of the top 20 all-time are currently active.  Interior defense in the NBA has disappeared almost entirely."
"&gt;This is as stupid as telling people critical of America to just move out.  Yes, because these are totally analogous situations...  &gt;It’s not an argument or a defense, it’s literally just a thought terminating cliché that allows you to dismiss legitimate criticism.  There is no arguing or defense needed. You just sound like a spoiled brat whose favorite basketball sub isn't catered to fit you perfectly. Many people are fine with the sub the way it is. I've already said if you feel so strongly about it, use your own time to moderate it, but you've already said this about the mods   ""Then again, you try and think about the kinds of people that would willingly volunteer to spend up to dozens of hours a week just to be unpaid posting cops and I’m not that surprised.""  Pretty shitty if you ask me, so you're essentially bitching about a problem but you're not willing to help fix it. Not to mention, the condescension coming from you.   &gt;And don’t tell me the subreddit leans left when I’ve seen comments with 50+ upvotes calling Montrezl Harrell a gorilla in game threads.  Oh I remember, did you actually look at a lot of those posters; this sub got brigaded. There's more than one instance where stupid right-wing topics got posted and got clowned on this sub."
"You can in fact criticize a community while still participating in it. This is as stupid as telling people critical of America to just move out. It’s not an argument or a defense, it’s literally just a thought terminating cliché that allows you to dismiss legitimate criticism.   And don’t tell me the subreddit leans left when I’ve seen comments with 50+ upvotes calling Montrezl Harrell a gorilla in game threads."
100%  Gasol is better than playing Andre Drummond next to AD who clogs up the paint or Montrezl Harrell who is undersized and a defensive liability. The best option remains playing AD at center but Gasol is a great backup
"You’ve played with college team rivals on a couple of occasions, currently with Montrezl Harrell and previously with Russ Smith in New Orleans.  What’s it like to share a team with someone who played for a college rival, and what kind of bets are made behind the scenes?"
"One should apply some era adjustment to this stat.  Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA.  All are obviously active players.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"&gt;mchale would smoke most bigs today with his post moves  Everyone would.  Interior defense doesn't even exist in the NBA anymore.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective field-goal percentage.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are currently active.  The biggest challenge McHale -- or anyone else -- would have is getting teammates to pass him the ball, instead of jacking up threes."
Montrezl Harrell guarded him in the first game tbh
Montrezl got 9 minutes. Likelihood is that Gasol got the minutes he was always going to get and Harrell avoided a DNP.
Show some respect for the Lakers' centers.  Marc Gasol provides TEAM BASKETBALL and OUTSIDE SHOOTING  Montrezl Harrell provides SCORING and ENERGY  Andre Drummond
"Bold statement considering this is a squad led by LeBron James, who has been forced to play an elimination game in the first round once in his entire career and has obviously never lost a first round playoff series.  This is definitely not the team from last year, Andre Drummond and Montrezl Harrell are legit horrible defenders and AD/LeBron don't look right at this moment, but at the same time i won't bet that LeBron with AD as his co-star can't win a playoff series."
"The Lakers looked good with him on the court this year, and the stats bear it out. If you clicked the article you would have seen that:  &gt;&gt; The statistical case in Gasol's favor is overwhelming. He is the only center on the team with a positive plus-minus since Drummond arrived at plus-13. The Lakers have been outscored by six points with Drummond on the floor, and more distressingly, they've lost Montrezl Harrell's minutes by 61 points. Before Anthony Davis got hurt, the starting lineup featuring him, Gasol, LeBron James, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder destroyed teams by 13.9 points per 100 possessions. The sample is small, but so far, Drummond and Davis have played 133 minutes together and the Lakers have lost those minutes by 26 points. The two have struggled to find any chemistry on defense, and offensively, Drummond's presence as a non-shooter has clogged the paint for Davis.   &gt;&gt; Gasol's shooting makes it easier for teammates to get to the basket, and his passing is infectious. The Lakers have a 64 percent assist rate with him on the floor and a 59.1 percent assist rate when he's on the bench. He is by no means Drummond's equal as an athlete, but remains an effective defender, thanks to his high basketball IQ.   At the very least he is clearly better than Drummond, and Harrell in most cases as well."
"Montrezl “ALL BALL” Harrell  Also, that’s not Gary Trent lol"
"Are you *really* trying to make the case that Denver has more playoff experience than the Lakers? The Lakers are one of the more veteran teams out there while Denver is very young. If you look at all the top West teams, tell me who has more experience than the Lakers do? Utah? Phoenix? Denver? The Clippers? Dallas? I mean, what a truly bizarre thing to attack the Lakers for.   &gt;I know it’s not as much as LeBron but outside of him who has gone deeper in the playoffs other than when they were Lakers? schroeder? AD? Morris? Drummond? Outside of LeBron these players have minimal experience in the playoffs.  First, does the playoff experience the Lakers got last year not apply for some reason? They won a championship, but for the sake of this argument you want to just throw that out like it's not something those players can build on and draw from?   Also, just FYI, Schroder has played in 46 playoff games in his career (by comparison Jokic has only played in 33). Morris has played in 45 playoff games. Wesley Matthews has played in 46. Montrezl Harrell has played in 26. Marc Gasol has played in 94. Anthony Davis has played in 34. By comparison, MPJ has played in 19 and Aaron Gordon has played in 5, but for some reason you think the Lakers' lack of playoff experience is gonna hurt them in the postseason?"
Yeah he’s good but he’s no Montrezl Harrell
"Not really, not having Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell + having by all accounts a superior Paul George makes their chances much greater. I also don't see Lue fucking up rotations as badly."
"People casually forget this, but Montrezl Harrell will be damn near unplayable in a series against Brooklyn, Kyrie and Harden will hunt him down every second he is on the floor.  I do think the Lakers are as good as they were last year, but i have my doubts that Schroder and Trez can outdo what Dwight/Javale/Rondo did last year."
"i like montrezl harrell. He is pretty consistent, providing scoring and energy of the bench."
"Ah yes, I forgot Marc Gasol, Montrezl Harrell and Andre Drummond are known for their sunny demeanour and likability. LOL"
"I feel like it’s probably Zion or Giannis, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Montrezl Harrell was really high.  Feels like everytime I watch the Lakers he gets an and one every other play."
"THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND ~~SCOTT STERLING~~ MONTREZL HARRELL"
"Nah people mainly remember that, ask any Clippers fan about Doc Rivers and Montrezl Harrell"
The blonde ref is the one who gave Montrezl Harrell a T for yelling and-1
"Pat bev, Dwight howard, Clint Capela, montrezl Harrell, Trevor ariza, and Micheal Beasley all of these players are solid and better than almost any respective player on the warriors roster"
Here’s the lists I made:  KD had:  Russ  Prime Ibaka  Young Harden and Prime Harden  Curry  Klay  DPOY Draymond  Kyrie  Iguodala    Lebron had:  Kyrie  Kevin Love (who was still good in his first couple years with Cleveland)  D-Wade (mostly injury prone Wade but he had prime Wade for an entire season)  Chris Bosh  Prime Anthony Davis  6MOY Montrezl Harrell  6MOY Candidate Dennis Schroder  Ilgauskas (who was a 2x all star)  I honestly don’t know who had more help
Yet you're named after Montrezl Harrell
Naz Reid &gt; Montrezl Harrell
Montrezl Harrell is just a slightly better Kenneth Faried on a big market team so he gets praised more. I’ll take my downvotes for having an unpopular opinion now.
Better than throwing Montrezl Harrell at him.
"Yeah, the player he needs to model  his game after is Montrezl Harrell. Vando is never gonna have a huge range and you know what? That is probably fine for your backup 4."

"Congratulations, you came back from a 3-1 deficit after historical, unprecedented meltdowns in three consecutive games. That was a fluke. That series would've been over in 5 if Doc Rivers had the sense to sit Montrezl Harrell in Game 5 while Jokic was destroying the Clippers in his minutes."
"I'm sure that 90% of the fans doesn't know what PER. +/-, TS% (and other term for that matter) stands for. Not to mention the meaning if big number is always good or not, just like the recent confusion of Defensive rating.  Again, it's  is a tool. Hate it or not, it's here to stay. Why do you think Doc Rivers was axed by Ballmer in the first place?   I'll give you a clue:  &gt;Two philosophical points of contention between Rivers and the organization were, more recently, his insistence on playing backup center Montrezl Harrell over starting center Ivica Zubac and, at large, his reluctance to develop or empower the team’s younger talent throughout his tenure.  &gt; After a Sixth Man of the Year regular-season campaign, Harrell missed a month in the bubble due to the sickness and eventual passing of his grandmother. Upon returning, he was visibly not himself, offensively or defensively.  &gt; Yet Harrell’s postseason role was that of an effective rotation player (18.7 minutes per game), despite the Clippers posting a team-worst minus-11.6 net rating with him on the floor in the playoffs, including a mind-blowing minus-30.1 net rating while sharing the floor with Leonard and George.  &gt; In comparison, the Clippers had a plus-17.7 net rating with Zubac on the floor in the playoffs and a plus-11.1 net rating with Zubac alongside Leonard and George, both marks ranked No. 1 among the team’s rotation players.  &gt; It was clear to many that Zubac was the better matchup on both ends versus Dallas and Denver. There was an internal thought process of “How does Rivers not see that Zubac is the more productive player and the better postseason matchup?”  &gt; A common criticism from some within the team — inside and outside the locker room — was that Harrell’s energy and effort was only consistent on the offensive end of the floor, multiple league sources said.  &gt; Meanwhile, Rivers maintained, publicly to the media and privately to his staff and the organization, that Harrell was the better player, in spite of all of the evidence to the contrary  Edit: words"
Montrezl Harrell missing the free throws or PG or Marcus Morris Sr
People like you are still stuck in the past and are projecting the bubble memes onto a brand new season with different circumstances.  Kawhi and PG have been locked in and on a mission this year PG’s slump was only because of his toe injury and in his last 4 games is averaging 30+ so he seems to have moved on from that injury.   They’re out for blood now and with Rondo and Batum as the connective glue that can playmake and keep the ball moving plus step up on defense that alone is an improvement from Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
He died so Montrezl Harrell could take his place
Got replaced by Montrezl “Future” Harrell
Zion plays nothing like Jarrett Allen or Montrezl Harrell though
Montrezl Harrell had a DNP in game 1 of Lakers Suns
"It's usually not the touch that's the issue IMO (although sometimes it definitely is), it's the footwork and the lack of moves. He has no change of speed game.  When you watch a guy like Montrezl Harrell, he's really good at facing up on his defender, getting to the basket, and then stopping and carving out space with his body. Simmons literally never does this, he always gathers really far away from the basket and tries to 1-2 his way in."
He got replaced by Montrezl “Future” Harrell
"So are Pat Beverley, Marcus Morris, Montrezl Harrell… but they get shat on when they talk trash."
I got a better one: imagine if Montrezl Harrell did that to Luka. This subreddit would pull out the tiki torches.
"Schroder was probably the fourth biggest reason the Lakers lost in the first round and that's being generous.  They lost because AD got hurt, LeBron was below average for his standards, Montrezl Harrell proved to be unplayable (nice job Clippers on spotting that) and their duo of Drummond/Gasol at the center spot CLEARLY was a horrible idea.  Putting the blame on Schroder as if he was expected to be anything more than a guy that comes in, gives 12-14 points a game and makes some mistakes is just revisionist history. AD being hurt and LeBron's worst playoff series since the 2011 Finals is what doomed the Lakers, not Dennis."
Reggie Jackson gives off the same hated vibes as montrezl harrell and patrick beverly. Accomplished nothing in their careers but acted like they just won the championship just by scoring a shot lol.
Or maybe it was Montrezl Harrell? 🤔🤔
"This is pretty much true. The past two winners, Lou Will and Montrezl Harrell have been pretty abysmal in the playoffs. It’s basically whoever scores the most points off the bench award"
"Usually see a lot of comments that he was unhappy coming off the bench which isn't the case     https://lakersnation.com/lakers-news-montrezl-harrell-more-comfortable-coming-off-bench/2021/03/07/  &gt;“Honestly, I feel better coming off the bench,” Harrell said. “I get to see the flow of the game, I get to see how certain things are being called, honestly. So I just felt more comfortable coming off the bench so I could actually get a feel for the game, I don’t want to just go in there and put myself in early foul trouble and have us down a man more than we already are.”    I think if he has any real issue its because he was DNP for games in the playoffs, especially having to watch Drummond lumber around and getting cooked out there taking the majority of mins.  He was great for us most of the regular season and pre-Drummond"
"Keep up the grind Montrezl Harrell, hope you find much success with another team or with the lakers if you stay!"
"The question should be how much worse would they be defensively if they add Doncic, lose Ayton, and replace him with Montrezl Harrell. A lot worse, a lot."
"Jarrett Allen, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Dwight, the Lopezes, etc."
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
&gt;      Andre Drummond      Montrezl Harrell      Kyle Kuzma      Julius Randle      Mitchell Robinson      Duncan Robinson  We got a fucking squad now boys
IDK I feel like Jokic isn't really a good matchup for anyone but you probably have a good point. I may have Zubac and Montrezl messed up in my head. Harrell def had an awful series against the Nuggs last year
I would’ve rather has Montrezl Harrell over KP this series. At least he plays hard.
&gt; He commented “THATS TUFF 🔥💯” on a Montrezl Harrell post about his dead grandma. He also tried to trademark the phrase “thats tuff” even though he didn’t create it nor popularize it.  We don't know his relationship w Harrell... dumb to call him a scum bag for that imo. And I really don't see how trademarking stupid things doesn't make you a scum bag either
"My favorite was that 2019 season where they were the 8 seed but gave the warriors a good scare thanks to Montrezl Harrell and PatBev. My interest in the NBA was waning until that series, even though the Clippers lost it just really resparked my interest"
"1. He and 2 friends assaulted a guy in a mall in 2018 and left him with a torn ACL and torn meniscus, he received no charges   2. He commented “THATS TUFF 🔥💯” on a Montrezl Harrell post about his dead grandma. He also tried to trademark the phrase “thats tuff” even though he didn’t create it nor popularize it.   3. His behavior with the Lakers on and off the court just makes him seem like a huge bum"
"Markief Morris, PCP dude, Harrell of montrezl"
Suicide watch in effect for montrezl harrell
Dennis Schroeder is pulling a Montrezl Harrell and is losing out on so much money from the playoffs
Montrezl Harrell with an incredible -16 in 8 mins. Lakers suck because Gasol is their only decent center and he's old as shit now
"Bro, Montrezl Harrell really out here thinking he Bron 😂😂💀"
Montrezl Harrell the only Laker trying. Trade everyone but him and AD in the offseason
"Brook Lopez, serge Ibaka Montrezl Harrell Dwight Howard all guys with under 15 mil contracts"
What a let down for the Knicks. This guy can bang in the post like Montrezl Harrell but better but instead he settles for jumpers. He tries too hard to play like a guard.
I never bought into that before the season started and the Lakers had their new team constructed.  I was alive in 2020 so I knew Montrezl Harrell is unplayable in the playoffs and Rondo and Dwight were solid championship caliber role players.
"What about game 7. Where Zubac played 14 minutes and was a -10, worse than Harrell who was a -8 in 25 minutes.   I’ll remind you that Montrezl outscored every other clipper in game 7 was way more efficient than every other clipper in game 7. You want Doc to take him out? What?"
&gt; Frank Vogel can't coach and why the fuck Montrezl Harrell ain't getting no run    if lebron wanted harrell in he would be in
"Schroeder has more leverage than he would ordinarily because the Lakers are over the cap. He's not worth the contract he wants but he might get it anyways just because they can't let him walk.  Montrezl Harrell was an asinine signing that never made any sense, he'll opt into his second MLE year and the Lakers should look to use him as marching salary in a trade.   Drummond could have some utility as long as he's extremely cheap; if another team even offers him the ~$5 million room exception that's too much.  They just can't keep wasting money and roster spots on non-shooters. Players like Markieff Morris are at least the right profile of player even if they're not good enough; spending their MLE on Harrell was just bad process."
Anyone calling for more Montrezl Harrell minutes does not understand the modern NBA.
Yeah fuck those jazz fans and fuck Montrezl Harrell. Or are we still allowing black on white racism?
[Dwight](https://www.nba.com/sixers/news/team-signs-howard) signed a day before [Trez](https://www.nba.com/lakers/releases/lakers-sign-montrezl-harrell-free-agency2021) tho
&gt;They went defense heavy  Did they? They signed Montrezl Harrell...
I have the same playing time as fake tough guy Montrezl Harrell
Is Montrezl Harrell still not getting minutes with AD out? Wtf is going on there?
The Lakers have zero chance of winning this game so would it really hurt to put in Montrezl Harrell right now
"They actually have a fair amount of flexibility. They have their own 1st round pick this year to trade, as well as a future 1st (either 2027 or 2028 if they want to). On top of that they have KCP's $13 million contract, Kuzma's $13 million contract as well as Marc Gasol's $2.7 million contract and Alfonso McKinnie's $1.9 million contract. In addition they may be able to sign and trade Dennis Schroder, Montrezl Harrell (they could sign him to a 1+1 for $23 million along with early Bird rights), or Talen Horton-Tucker (he could get as much as 4 years and about $83 million).   That's a lot of possible pieces to make salary combinations with if players become available via trade."
"- Garbage front office that can't develop talent to save their lives.  - Sign the best player in the league because ""it's Hollywood!"".  - Trade away most of their young players who show some promise (who incidentally start playing better on other teams) for a superstar-caliber player who essentially forced his way out of his franchise.  - They've got Dirty Dennis ""groin puncher"" Schröder, and drama queen Montrezl Harrell.  The list could probably go on for longer..."
Not as classy as Dallas fans who remained extremely composed after the verbal abuse Montrezl Harrell laid on them!
I bet Harrell would. Montrezl is a menace to society. That guy is ironically one of my favorite players cuz of how menacing he is.
I mean it's the same fanbase that went unashamedly racist against Montrezl Harrell and Marcus Morris last year while claiming that white people are victims in America.  Don't have high expectations for their conduct.
Do you think Montrezl Harrell opts out of his player option next season to get played?
Why is montrezl Harrell DNP?
"I love this griz team, they need to pick up montrezl Harrell this offseason"
Montrezl Harrell lost at least 20M total from lockdown to the bubble. He was looking at least 2/40M offers before the bubble exposed him. Davis Bertans agent on the other hand is the GOAT for making him not play the bubble.
Again he shoots low 40% in the mid range. That’s bad.  That means every time there’s a game he’s on fire there’s probably 2 he’s shooting you out of it. The issue is when he can’t shoot any better against smaller guys than bigger ones teams can go small and destroy the Mavs in the pick and roll. He’s horrible defensively so he needs to be hitting his shots at a very high rate to make a winning impact. It’s starting to look like he’s a losing player in the playoffs for how often he gets exposed. He’s a glorified Montrezl Harrell in the sense that he puts up big numbers in the regular season when he gets minutes and then gets played off the floor in the playoffs when teams focus on attacking him in the pick and roll.
I mean Doc chose to play those role players. Giving guys like Montrezl Harrell serious minutes in the playoffs.  At least Vogel knows what's up
Can we soccer loan our unused center in Montrezl Harrell to the clippers?
"Montrezl Harrell always takes 13 seconds, but I never wanted to point it out cuz I feel like it could be used against him some day. Hopefully nobody important in the league reads this."
How come Montrezl Harrell doesn't get any minutes. I thought he was the 6th man last year.
"Montrezl Harrell is like the quintessential ""hold me back"" player, he ain't doing shit."
Montrezl Harrell is constantly arguing with people online.  He seems really emotionally driven.  I could see him doing if the circumstances were right.
"r/nba as an example. Constantly bullies and talks shit about Paul George. Other plays as well (Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell, etc.,) but mainly PG13. When he has spoken out about his mental health and how he deals with anxiety due to all of the jokes and vile comments about him on the internet, r/nba ridicules him and spouts off about ""pandemic pee XDDD"" jokes.  Compare that to Kevin Love. r/nbas mental health darling. Not saying that this sub is racist, but definitely racially insensitive. You can't deny that. That's not even going into the plethora of people who refer to black players as thugs or shit like that."
The Montrezl thing was not that bad. Jokic fucked him up but at least Harrell can play offense. Zubac would have done about as worse because he’s super slow and he also can’t do shit on offense. He’s just overrated on this sub. And people wanted to hate on Harrell then because he called Doncic a bitch-ass white boy and got the whole sub to become racist.
"His style of play works well against a smaller team like the Hawks.   As we’ve seen this entire season, he’d likely continue to struggle against anyone with size and physicality.   All in all, he’ll probably continue to trend as a good role player who can situationally ball out (kind of like a Montrezl Harrell type)."
"There's value there.  Some people don't see it, but there's value. For Chris Paul walking, the Clippers got back Lou Williams, Patrick Beverly, Dekker, and some G-Leaguer called Montrezl Harrell.  Felt like a bunch of random players at the time but Clippers found some value.  And at the time, the few guys the Clippers did get back didn't appear all that valuable to their current needs.  They turned out alright."
Yeah the situation with montrezl Harrell kinda proves your point.
"I agree that the Clips kind of sold their soul to get Kawhi and PG. They had such a promising mix of young talent and good veterans like Lou Will, Montrezl Harrell and JaMychal Green. I was so disappointed they traded away Tobias Harris, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and Landry Shamet. That 2018 team was awesome to see, it felt like those young OKC and Warriors teams before they found real postseason success.   They technically replaced them all pretty well on paper, but they lost a lot of chemistry in the process and I don't think Kawhi and PG have been a great fit in personality or leadership.  If things blow up this year which I'm kind of hoping they do, I'd be excited to see how they can refresh with Mann, Kennard, Zubac and others. They have pieces where they won't be a dumpster fire like the post-LeBron Cavs, but who knows what happens."
"&gt; By pointing out that its racist   Never denied that. However, Montrezl Harrell is the one that said that, so how is it the Clippers’ fault when he isn’t even on the team?  &gt; and that Luka probably doesn't like them for it?   Pretty sure he said that he didn’t care.  &gt; Thats blowing an entire issue out of proportion?   Yes, especially when you pretend like what Montrezl said would be just as bad if the roles were reversed in this situation."
"I’d imagine a large part of that is the overlap between Lakers fans and Lebron fans. Two huge fan bases coming together.   Come to think about it, a lot of fan groups are anti-clippers: Luka fans, Mavs fans, Laker fans, people who like to clown PG, people who like to clown Bev, Montrezl Harrell, bitter spurs/raptors fans, and anyone looking for nba drama"
"He fell for the fake hustle and grind acts of guys like Patrick Beverly, Montrezl Harrell, Marcus Morris, and Lou Will who all thought they were dogs."
I remember when Montrezl Harrell did the crying laughing emoji on Twitter when first reacting to Kennard's contract and people here ripped him to shreds for it on this sub
"Yeah imagine being the LA franchise that's had a winning record for 10 straight seasons (the longest active streak in the league) and several All-Stars (Blake Griffin x5, Chris Paul x5, DeAndre Jordan, Kawhi Leonard x2, Paul George) and 6MOY winners (Jamal Crawford x2, Lou Williams x2, Montrezl Harrell) ...  Yet has never made it to the conference finals and sadly plays second fiddle to the other LA team that had six straight losing seasons over the same timespan.  Just brutal."
Montrezl Harrell made Luka forever mad at the Clippers and then dipped. Boss moves.
"3.5 at least - There's  Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell"
"&gt;Why isn’t Montrezl Harrell not playing?  Vogel is still experimenting with this lineups.  Which is amazing, since we're now 74 games into this season, but he's quite the tinkerer.  This is also the same coach who started Caruso in the final game of the Finals last season.  If there's one thing Vogel is not, it's set in his ways.  He might be the least-consistent coach in the league, which probably makes him hard to coach against.  Vogel played 11 players tonight -- in the first quarter alone."
Why isn’t Montrezl Harrell not playing?
he's a taller montrezl harrell
"Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, and Eric Gordon and Lou Williams"
Haven't Montrezl Harrell and Lou Williams been basically in the same boat for the past few years when they were both on the Clippers?
"&gt;Remember it’s all Doc’s fault for making PG hit the side of the backboard and his bad rotations.  No, but it is Doc's fault for putting 6'8 Montrezl Harrell on Boban. It was Doc's fault for letting Reggie be the single defender on Luka's last minute shot. It was Doc's fault for not calling timeout until after the Clips blew their 20+ point lead. It was Doc's fault for not trying Jamychal Green on Jokic instead of letting Trez get eaten alive. And it was Doc's fault for giving so many minutes to Trez last season over Zubac."
"Montrezl Harrell, simply because anyone would be an upgrade over Drummond."
The biggest acquisition was probably Montrezl “Klutch Client 6MoY” Harrell and Vogel has no problem sitting his ass on the bench.

"Montrezl Harrell, alongside the Morris bros, has to be one of the most dirtiest players on court. Street level."
"For all of the talk about how great Rob Pelinka did this offseason, letting Danny Green walk in order to give Montrezl Harrell the MLE look like the 2 worst moves of any team this offseason."
Did Mark Gasol and Montrezl Harrell disappear from this plane of earth? That's the only explanation I can think of for why they still have Drummond in
I know nothing about him and have never heard him speak but I feel like Montrezl Harrell is a sweetheart.
Montrezl Harrell is not going to help the Lakers win this game

*Montrezl Harrell liked this comment*
What about montrezl Harrell? He was coming off arguably being the third best player on the clippers last year
"6MotY is usually going to be someone who's fringe Top 100 in the league. Last year Montrezl Harrell was 6MotY and ESPN had him at #76 on their player rankings coming into the season (which honestly feels high for him, but that's just my take). Only three 6MotY winners are in the hall (the three who won the first four actually) though Harden will be added to that, and Ginobili is likely to make it as well. But in all of those cases the players have exemplary careers regardless of winning sixth man."
"Just Marcus Morris, Montrezl Harrell, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George."
"Montrezl Harrell/Wingspan   7′ 4″"
"Sure, but he did get heavy minutes from known defensive stalwarts Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroder, and Andre Drummond, so is it really that impressive?"
"?  lakers are already over the cap with only 7 players signed.  montrezl harrell could refuse his PO and they'd still only be under the cap by $2M... with 6 players signed.  they have no large trade exceptions available.  they've only got the NTPMLE,  $9.5M, but if they use that full amount I'm not sure they can resign everyone they need (including schroder in this)."
&gt; I feel like the Spurs would help them with cap space for Ben Simmons.  You think the Sixers are trading Ben Simmons for a signed and traded DeRozan? Simmons has got much more trade value than that. I've seen Spurs fans say they'd be happy with Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell for DeRozan.
"Curious about the players you hate for being ugly. Mine's Anthony Davis,  Montrezl Harrell, James Harden. DeRozan's got a pass bc he seems like a nice person."
"Not the highest on sengun either, for me I don’t question his bust potential I think he’ll be an NBA player I question how much of his stuff is really going to translate and how impactful it’ll be. I think him being a roll man will work, being a passer out the short roll will work, posting up mismatches and backups will work. Other than that I’m not sure. On defense he’s not big enough to defend 5’s and is bad at defending the PnR, he’s better as a help defender 4 but he’s not athletic enough to play there. I don’t buy the shot, don’t trust the ball handling stuff and I don’t think the post ups will generate enough PPP to go to it unless he’s a bench scoring option.   I’ve said it before I see a Montrezl Harrell type where he’s going to be getting buckets off the bench where his defensive ?’s and size won’t hurt a team as bad.  With Giddey I just think he’s a bad fit for us and we’re a bad fit for him in terms of roster construction and the way he plays. If we move Derrick or Dejounte then pick up Giddey to be our offensive engine I’d be on board but his play style is just so boom or bust like.   Josh Giddey is one of the 3 best passers in this draft, can make any pass imaginable, and is amazing out the pick and roll, but he  only knows 2 offensive sets those being the high pick and roll, or attack in transition. He’s only effective will the ball in his hands. He relies on his gravity as a jumbo playmaker and finisher to score and generate points which is fine but the man isn’t explosive, a real shooting threat, and can’t score off the dribble or in isolation to warrant him being a teams offensive engine. Without a shot teams will go under him, and off ball he’ll  essentially be useless since he’s also not a cutter. (A little similar to how teams just realized they could simply shrink the floor against us) His North/South change of pace needs to improve, he also needs to improve his handle. Without a dribbling package he’ll never be able to score off the dribble, or attack 1 on 1 matchups against guards 4-5 inches shorter than him due to the deficiencies as a quick twitch athlete . (This is a given for every team except us apparently) You have to get floor spacers around him and a big that can put pressure on defenses whether it be by finishing or floor spacing to open up the floor and give him room to work and operate because the man is great at getting the ball to guys who have a clear chance to score.  To me the simplicity of his game despite him being a High IQ player is his biggest weakness. I think his swing skills, primarily shooting, scoring out the Pick and Roll and ball handling will be the difference between him being Tomas Satoransky and an allstar level lead guard."

"I don't think the Lakers will get Lonzo, but hypothetically they wouldn't need to use Schroder to get him. Montrezl Harrell is probably likely to opt in to his deal, because I don't think he'll get more than $10 million this summer elsewhere, and if he does then the Lakers could package him and Kuzma along with the 22nd pick in the draft for a signed and traded Lonzo.   Or alternately if Trez isn't part of it, the Lakers could trade Kuzma, Gasol and Alfonzo McKinnie along with the 22nd pick and they could get Lonzo on a contract starting at $22 million per year (4 years and $95 million). I think because of the hard cap the Lakers won't pursue Lonzo, but they wouldn't need Schroder to do it."

"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"I'll admit I forgot about Gasol, although teams are fine with him shooting 3s as he's very reluctant to shoot them. That was the case with Rondo, but he hit a bunch of timely ones in the bubble last year. Caruso though, nobody respects him, he might be at a good % this year, but volume is actually more important than your %. Somebody like Jae Crowder is more respected than a lot of shooters that are better than percentage wise than he is, simply because he always takes them. In that respect, I'll give Kuz some props for upping his volume and 3P% this year.   &gt; There’s really no justification dude. We know the Lakers were a good offensive team in the regular season before AD got injured, we know they were doing well offensively in the playoffs before AD went out, they were, by the stats you pointed to yourself, similarly talented offensively as last year’s team, which was a good offensive team even in non-bubble conditions.  I never said they weren't *good* offensively, I said they weren't good enough to win a title and I stand by that. Just because it happened once, doesn't mean it'll happen again, the Lakers were one of the worst 3-point shooting teams in a long time to win the title.    That's not to say that the Lakers can't win a title again, they absolutely can, but they need more offensive firepower, even more than 3-point shooting, they need another creator, somebody who can run offense while LeBron sits. The big reason the Lakers won the title last year is they won the non-LeBron minutes because their offense managed to survive in large part due to Rondo. AD is a really good offensive player when he gets to play with a point guard, and a pretty mediocre one when he doesn't.   Do you really think if they run back this current team, they'd win the championship? Because I don't. I was much more afraid of the Lakers in 2020 than this year. I know you don't think there's much of a difference between the 2 teams, but there is. For one thing, the 2020 iteration had proven playoff vets like Rondo and Danny Green and to a lesser extent Dwight Howard, who for all his warts, knows how to play defense, even if he can be a clown. This 2021 team had Dennis Schroder, who is on his way into becoming the next Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, the definition of an 82 game player as opposed to a 16 game player, always gets benched in the playoffs due to bad PnR defense, and Andre Drummond, who thinks he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar reincarnated apparently."

"&gt; If the Blazers are a believer, the Lakers could have some traction. Horton-Tucker can earn up to about $33-$46 million over three or four years via sign-and-trade. Portland would have a team salary limit at roughly $143 million for the 2021-22 season, which should not be an issue. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers would need to include additional salary, starting with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma. Others, like Montrezl Harrell (if he opts into his final year at $9.7 million) and Alfonzo McKinnie ($1.9 million, some of which would need to be guaranteed) could round out a deal, especially if the Blazers were willing to include center Jusuf Nurkic, who notably told a Bosnian media outlet if Lillard is out, he's out. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers also have the No. 22 pick, which can be dealt in August when Horton-Tucker is eligible for a sign-and-trade (legally, Los Angeles would not be able to select a player at Portland's direction). The Lakers can also send one of their 2027 or 2028 first-rounders and five of their next seven second-rounders (through 2028).

I dont think Masai is dumb enough to let like an extra 8 million on the books get in the way of a full extra pick.  I feel like the last few days this sub has been really devalueing the value of a 1st considering the precedence of what a mid-to-late 1st has gone for in the past.

Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day.

"Defensive is best portrayed through eye test, not stats. Statistically, sabonis is a better defender than embiid since sabonis has a DBPM of 1.5 compared to embiid’s 1.0. If you watch games tho, you’d know that that is far from the case. Embiid is an elite defender while sabonis is a traffic cone. There’s so many good defenders that are net negative on DBPM as well, not just Wiggins. Marcus smart, Paul George, lu Dort, Dillon brooks, and capela are all net negatives according to DBPM. Now if you just look at stats, this would make you think that montrezl harrell, who is a positive on DBPM, is a better defender than all of them. Well, that is false. This is why you need to watch games and not just rely on stats"
"Doc is a terrible coach. He's had so many great players, hof players and he's won once, and made 2 finals appearances, while the celtics made multiple conf finals when he left, only to be really stopped by lebron during doc's clipper tenure.   Brett Brown lost to kawhi leonard on a basket with 04.2 to go. Doc Rivers lost to kevin huerter bulling seth curry in the post in game 7.  Who's really responsible for the collapse? it's doc. Think about it the 26pt lead. Does that happen without hack a ben? How is atlanta going to generate 27 points without fouling a terrible FT shooter to come back in the game. You mean you couldn't keep ben out for that amount of time?  Come on man. I've seen the doc story way too much. He made Kawhi Leonard look like tony snell in game 7 and had him guarding Jokic because he refused to take out montrezl harrell who was a -61 for the entire playoff run. Jokic even said it himself that Zubac is a tough defender after the series.   Doc didn't play zu in second halfs of the game, pretty much all year.   When Ben Simmons gets traded and he will and Doc messes up again, you'll see doc is a bigger issue to worry about then ben simmons. Ben simmons just has a shit contract, that's really all. He's a decent player, just not a max or big contract player."
"That's not all the way fair. Morey only traded for 2 established superstars in his tenure w/the Rox, CP3(awesome) and Russ(not awesome). D12 was a free agent, and Beard wasn't a superstar when we traded for him. So which players did he trade that you cared about so much, and which superstar did you not want?  Unless you're yearning for the days of the post-TMac/Yao era of the treading water Rox, then you can't hate on the Harden trade at all if you even want to count that one. FWIW I loved Scola, Brooks, KMart, Chuck, KLow, Dragic, etc.  1. In order to get CP3, Morey traded Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations. I still adore Pat Bev and Trezz, and I got love for LouWill, but that CP3 trade led to the greatest non-Hakeem led team in franchise history. It's undeniable that trade was amazing, and even if you hate CP3, it was the best move for the team. I cared more about team success at that point than how much I missed Pat Bev and Trezz, and I became a CP3 fan.  2. I agree with you on the Russ trade tho, and I hated it in real time but tried to stay positive. We all saw how that worked out, and I still miss CP3. But that trade was on Frittata and Harden 100%, and I can't be convinced Morey wanted Russ especially at the cost of those picks. It is what it is, but Morey makes moves to get better, and he's generally on point unless the owner is a cheap bastard who takes out $200 million loans at like 35% lmao"
"He's going to end up on the Lakers for Montrezl Harrell, Denis Schroder and a couple drafts picks"
"That seems like a lot given Montrezl Harrell just signed for the 2-year MLE. Holmes is better than Trezz, but is he worth twice as much money for twice as long a contract?"
so was Montrezl Harrell and they still gave him the MLE lol
Someone ask Montrezl Harrell if he’s watching the WCF
I think he is a solid X's and O's coach who does a great job of cultivating relationships with his players but he isn't very good at making adjustments and stays loyal to his guys when he probably shouldn't (ex: overplaying Montrezl Harrell last year).
It's honestly the coaching too. Doc rivers would have been playing Beverley starter minutes this whole time and making no adjustments based on match up. Watching Montrezl Harrell get completely smoked all playoffs cos he had a good regular season was very frustrating. Ty Lue makes the changes clipper fans were screaming at the TV for doc to make for years
montrezl harrell enjoying life somewhere rn
Feel kinda sorry for Montrezl Harrell now
"I said this above, but a hypothetical trade for him could be Kuzma's $13 million, Schroder S&amp;T at $15-17 million on a 1+1, the 22nd pick in this year's draft and maybe Montrezl Harrell if he decides to opt in to that final year and $10 million of his deal.* The Thunder get yet another 1st rounder, and they'd get two or three more players they could also possibly flip in the future.  * *This is based on the assumption that neither Schroder nor Trez get great offers in free agency and instead look to just rehab their value in OKC where they'd both get a ton of minutes."
"Less than a year ago [Schroder said this while he was still in OKC:](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2020/11/15/dennis-schroder-appears-to-have-rejected-trade-to-lakers-last-season/amp/)  &gt; “Yes, I have received offers… But I never wanted to go to the Lakers, the Clippers, or all the names that my agents have have called… In the end, I’m good with GM (General Manager Sam Presti, editor’s note) and that was my decision. I said that I like the organization here better.”  Schroder is not gonna get the kind of money he was looking for this summer, not from the Lakers, not from anyone. He gambled on himself and lost, and now his market is gonna be thin. He could sign something like a 3 or 4 year deal at the lower rate he's at right now, or he could sign something shorter and try to rehab his market value and re-enter free agency in a year or two (he's still only 27).   Look, I don't know if the Lakers are actually going to go after Kemba, but if they did, a hypothetical trade for him could be Kuzma's $13 million, Schroder S&amp;T at $15-17 million on a 1+1, the 22nd pick in this year's draft and maybe Montrezl Harrell if he decides to opt in to that final year and $10 million of his deal (he too probably wouldn't have much of a market this summer and might relish getting to rehab his value for a year in OKC). The Thunder get yet another 1st rounder, and they'd get two or three more players they could also possibly flip in the future."
I was being silly using that term but of course this sub is racist. I’ve seen multiple instances of it. Go see that montrezl Harrell and Luka thread
Montrezl Harrell
"Especially as a rockets fan. Rockets have had awful picks for like 10 years until this year, which is still too early to tell.  Best picks since the 2010 draft (in no particular order): Clint Capela, Marcus Morris, Chandler Parsons, and Montrezl Harrell.  Granted they haven’t had a ton of 1sts but still."
"The Drew League this year, apparently, has Montrezl Harrell, Nick Young and other fringe NBA guys as star players in it. I'd be willing to bet that Jericho Sims, who is 6'10"" and averaged 9 ppg last year in the NCAA, could not score 90 there."
Montrezl Harrell won 6th man of the year not 12 months ago.
Thanks for this list! Here are a few names that were omitted:  PJ Tucker - 943k; Montrezl Harrell - 563k; Eric Paschall - 177k; Terance Mann - 115k
"Lue would've adjusted the rotations and not overplayed Montrezl, literally the only Clipper in the series with a negative +/-, and the Clippers would've easily won the series that they should have. And yeah the defense would've been better without Harrell constantly getting cooked."
"ws/48 wise montrezl harrell is the 7th best player in the league, i just don’t believe any stat like that is useful"
"You beat a Clippers team because Doc Rivers lacks any brain cells to not play Montrezl Harrell when they were up. ""I think the Clippers are worse."" They just took down the Jazz and pushed the Suns to 6 without Kawhi. The fact that you delusional Nuggets fans are getting upvoted while I'm getting downvoted for telling the truth is actually astounding."
"Yeah, but before he got hurt he was really good for a long time. And the team that drafted him turned him into a (pretty good) year of Russell Westbrook and then Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the No. 22 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft. Not bad considering the contract."
"Pat Bev played with Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell for years and didn't seem to improve their defensive chops any. Beverley needs to just focus on trying to stay healthy this year, otherwise this might be his last year in the NBA."
"Per The Ringer   &gt; Multiple reports have indicated that the Lakers are interested in a deal for Buddy, and with fewer than 24 hours until the 2021 draft, multiple league sources say **Los Angeles has stepped up its efforts by adding the no. 22 pick to a deal** that’d include Montrezl Harrell and Kyle Kuzma or Kentavious Caldwell-Pope."
See: Montrezl Harrell
"&gt; CP3, Blake, Kawhi, PG, DJ, Elton Brand, Maggette, Kaman, Danny Manning, Ron Harper, Norm Nixon, Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith, Bob Kauffman, Lamar Odom, Lou Will. Shit… you might be right.  That's 16, add Jamal Crawford, Eric Piatkowski, Montrezl Harrell, JJ Reddick and that's 20. He might have a case for top 20-25 with Miles, Richardson, Bledsoe, Austin Rivers, Eric Gordon, etc. But then again, Reggie Jackson, Batum, Mann, and Zubac might make top 20 now."
Montrezl Harrell
I'm a pacers fan but he is indeed very overrated. He is very similar to  Montrezl Harrell with better passing but is somehow a multiple time allstar
His changed his name to Montrezl Harrell
Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Montrezl Harrell  Jerami Grant
"He's a very good player, but in all honesty he's got a lot of the same issues that someone like Montrezl Harrell does. He's an undersized center who can't space the floor, isn't a great perimeter defender, and isn't an incredible rebounder either. He's very good in the regular season, so he's been very productive for Sacramento, but if they ever make it to the playoffs he'll have the same drawbacks that Trez does, and with his current contract I'm not sure how much of a positive trade asset he would be. Not a terrible signing by any means, but will be nearly as loved making more than twice as much as he was before? We'll see."
Forgot to include Montrezl Harrell in the Wizards trade bro
Montrezl Harrell
"Not a lot of room in the league for a much less offensively skilled version of Montrezl Harrell.  Game changed on Faried, and Faried never tried to change his game.  Dude would still be in the league if he could knock down threes at even just an average rate."
"I’m wondering how them convincing Montrezl Harrell to accept his player option before free agency started, in order for the Westbrook trade to work, is any different than the Lowry trade"
"They were just one example of a team I follow closely because I was too lazy to look up a deal for *your* team. That's your job as a fan, but you decided to just throw up your hands and say it's impossible.  How about the return Washington got for Russell Westbrook? I doubt you could get the picks they got but you probably could have gotten Montrezl Harrell, KCP, and Kuzma for CJ McCullum was probably available and filled a lot of holes in the roster at both the 4 spot (Kuzma/Harrell) and the new void at the 2 (KCP) from moving McCullum.  It's difficult to be sure but not impossible, you're just not putting in the effort and neither is Portland's ownership."
"Another factor to consider is team chemistry and harmony. One thing I underestimated about the 2020 Lakers at the time was just how tight knit of a group they were and everybody was happy and playing within their role and there was no feuding. The same could not be said about the 2020 Clippers.   Whereas this year, by all accounts the 2021 Clippers had great chemistry, the team showed much more resilience, fight, and togetherness evidenced by their comebacks against the Mavs and Jazz, and really all season. Whereas the same could not be true of the 2021 Lakers where Schroder comes into the team and immediately declares himself a starter, Schroder and Kuzma are beefing, Drummond comes in mid-season and is promised a starting role and certain amount of minutes, Harrell is complaining about minutes in the playoffs etc. The 2020 Lakers were all in as a team and had a common goal. The 2021 Lakers were a bunch of me-first players.   The common denominator between the 2020 Clippers and the 2021 Lakers? Montrezl Harrell. I've learned that that dude should not be on a championship contender, not just because of his pick and roll defense limitations, but chemistry wise as well."
The whole Montrezl Harrell debacle? You don't remember ANY racist responses?
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
"I feel like you maybe only mentioned each of these players' best qualities.  Kuzma and KCP are low-level starters or high-level bench players.  Dinwiddie missed all of last year with a knee injury.  Montrezl Harrell couldn't even get on the court for the Lakers in the playoffs (played a total of 39 minutes in the 6-game series).  Aaron Holiday has gotten worse each year, and he looks to be playing himself out of the league.  Isaiah Todd is a 2nd round pick.    I don't think it's a terrible job by the Wizards if the only goal was to get better next year, but Kuzma, KCP, Harrell, Dinwiddie, and Holiday were all players not really wanted/needed by their former teams.  Realistically, even with Bradley Beal, that team may struggle to make the playoffs.  As of now, they have around the 22nd best odds to win the NBA title.    The moves seem to have been made to make Beal happy, but it's possible they may have been better off moving on from Beal and starting a proper rebuild. This group of players isn't likely to have much success."
"We picked him ahead of Norm Powell, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Larry Nance, Josh Richardson, and Pat Connaughton. And now we're trading him for a second rounder *and* uh...some crappy player whose name I already forgot!"
"Contrary to all the people shitting on the Wizards bench here, the top end of the bench is okay and their starting lineup is mediocre, but they're pretty deep. If we assume their first few guys off the bench are Avdija, Kuz, Neto, Gafford, Bertans, Harrell, Holiday, Mathews, Kispert (in that order perhaps), Harrell, Holiday, and Mathews are really solid for 11th, 12th, and 13th spot guys. The issue for Wes Unseld Jr. will be to find all these guys minutes. Neto got 22MPG, Holiday got 18MPG on the Pacers, Montrezl got 23 MPG on the Lakers, Mathews got 16MPG, Gafford got 18MPG and was heating up toward the end of the season (and all these guys played nearly all the games). Scott Brooks caught shit for not playing Avdija more and he still got 23MPG. Positionally, I think one of Bertans/Harrell gets squeezed out of minutes and Mathews gets time reduced to garbage time as they try to find time for Kispert.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Wizards tried to swing more deals because they have too many rotation-quality players now. (Doesn't mean they have any great lineups though)"
You haven't watch enough Montrezl Harrell footage then.
He commented it on an insta post from montrezl harrell about his dead grandmother
"&gt;In July 2020, he even posted it in response to one of a teammate’s (Montrezl “Trez” Harrell) Instagram posts, in which Trez was lamenting the passing of his grandmother and the fact that she couldn’t be there with him on Mother’s Day.  Bruh, wut?"
"I’ve read someone say here on Reddit, that Dennis posts that same thing on practically every single pic or post that he comments on, in Instagram.  In July 2020, he even posted it in response to one of a teammate’s (Montrezl “Trez” Harrell) Instagram posts, in which Trez was lamenting the passing of his grandmother and the fact that she couldn’t be there with him on Mother’s Day."
"Montrezl Harrell once posted about missing his late grandmother, and Dennis… still… replied with it"
"Hit the nail on the head, but...   1. Montrezl Harrell could not get open for his life without a PG and plays defense like an idiot, he buys every pump fake.  2. Drummond was lost on both sides of the ball 3. Schroeder wasn't that good as a secondary creator, often times he looked clueless. Bad shooter.  4. KCP -- plays hard D but can't create his own shot. 5. Markieff -- he's really there to be 6 fouls IMO.  Lakers problem is that the point guard they got wasn't good enough at playmaking for anyone when Lebron went down.   As for 3% -- you could stick a guy out there who makes 100% of his open threes, but if he can't get open, he won't make any. None of these guys were good enough playmakers to get open, the offense stagnated every time Lebron went to the bench."
Loool  Most of these guys going to Nets/Lakers will be unplayable in the playoffs  Remember when people were freaking out over Montrezl Harrell and Wesley Matthews going to LA last year
"Especially when you consider they turned a completely washed up Wall and a protected 2023 pick into Westbrook which will become Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, and the 22nd overall pick of the 2021 Draft."
More like before the Lakers chose Montrezl Harrell over him. It seems more like they had a deal in place and pulled back when Trez showed interest. He either really wants to live in LA or is stupidly loyal to a team that could care less.
"offensive bigs have never been at LESS of a premium, wdym. montrezl harrell is an objectively excellent offensive big and he's basically seen as radioactive rn.  all that matters is if you can guard pnr and/or protect the rim. anything else is dime a dozen"
"Every single draft has some big guy who is pretty decent that goes late. Claxton was pick 31. Mitchell Robinson was 36. Timelord, 27 in the same draft. Thomas Bryant went 42. Jarrett Allen went 22 the same draft. Zubac, 32nd.  2015 had Nance 27, Portis 22, Hernangomez 35, Richaun Holmes 37, Montrezl Harrell 32. The year before was Jokic at 41, Dwight Powell at 45, and Capela at 25. The year before that? Dieng was 21, Plumlee 22, Gobert 27. Before that? Draymond at 35.   Every year, there's perfectly serviceable 5s available between pick 20 and pick 45. Every year."

"Then why didn't he fuckin opt out? This is such a circular argument that boils down to Montrezl Harrell, a full grown adult, picked up his option knowing he could be traded. If he wanted to choose where he lived he would have opted out and signed wherever he wanted."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
&gt; ..Harrell are were two key role players lost  Montrezl Harell who had 2 DNPs in the playoffs and averaged 9.8 Minutes per game in the playoffs was not a **KEY** role player for the Lakers
LeBron/AD’s meeting with Westbrook was “intense” and “at one point Montrezl Harrell was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned.
"Montrezl Harrell should make a fifth of what Westbrook makes, Westbrook averages 10x the assists he gets in the playoffs and 5x the rebounds, plus added in 19 a game.   Harrell is up there with worst Lakers I've ever seen, he is not a smart player."
"Yeah but Montrezl Harrell makes a fifth of what Russell Westbrook makes lol. If you're gonna spend $44 million on a player and they can't shoot or defend, they better be one of the most efficient volume scorers in the league"
"Montrezl Harrell doesn't play D either, it's not a big loss."
"Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and KCP altogether averaged 18 points, 9 boards, and 2 assists per game in the playoffs  Westbrook averaged 19, 10 and 11.   I think we'll live without the less than 20 points a game provided by that trio. Also all of them shot bad in the playoffs. Westbrook shot better from 3 than KCP did in the playoffs.   I'm not buying that the Lakers lost any player of such great value that they can't go find it on minimum contracts."
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"Apparently ""right by the wizards"" is a year of kuzma, montrezl Harrell and kcp."
"They plan to build around their new team. Presenting the ~~Lakers~~ I mean, the Wizards. Built around former Laker players.   PG: 22nd pick   SG: Caldwell Pope   SF: Isaac Bonga  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Thomas Bryant      6th Man: Montrezl Harrell"
"Rob “let’s surround LeBron with Michael Beasley, Javale McGee, Lance Stephenson, and Rajon Rondo” Pelinka. Rob “trade Ivica Zubac for Mike Muscala” Pelinka. Rob “use full MLE on Montrezl Harrell then get Andre Drummond and promise him a starting spot” Pelinka.  I remember when Laker fans were crying about him not getting GM of the year in 2020. Please. He signed LeBron who goes wherever he wants, and traded what was probably too much for an All-NBA player who said he only would go to the Lakers and refused to play otherwise.  What’s he thinking with this move? IDK, circus music?"
"The Los Angeles Lakers are nearing a deal with the Washington Wizards to acquire Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski."
"Woj Tweeted Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN.  That feels like so little for Westbrook, why would the wizards do this? Are they going to move Beal too and go full rebuild?"
"Well, what do you think? Kings fans are elated that Montrezl Harrell is a big upgrade over him. What does that tell you?"
"&gt;It can't be just a straight up trade between Schroder and Westbrook.  Technically the Lakers have full Bird rights on Schroder and thus could offer him a full 30% max and then trade him along with like Alfonzo McKinnie and it would work cap-wise, but I'm guessing the Wizards have zero interest in Schroder on a max.   That extremely unlikely hypothetical out of the way, the Lakers very well may have Montrezl Harrell to also include if he opts in, so it could be some combo of Trez, Kuz and Schroder (on like a $15 million per year deal) going out and Westbrook coming back. Maybe it's a three way deal with some of those guys going elsewhere and whatever they're traded for going to Washington, but from the Lakers end it could be those three out, Westbrook in. Would you still not want to make that trade?"
"&gt; if ppl wanted him then he would already be traded, Woj literally said he was offered to every team and no one wants that negative asset so far lol  That is definitely not ""literally"" what Woj said. He said the Lakers have brought him and KCP up in trade talks with everyone, which is not surprising as they're basically the only guys the Lakers are allowed to talk about right now. They're not offering LeBron and AD to anyone, so the only other guys currently under contract with the Lakers for next year are Marc Gasol, Alfonzo McKinnie (both of whom make the minimum), and then KCP and Kuzma. So if they're talking to other teams, as they should be, that's literally all they are allowed to talk about.   As for why nobody has traded for them yet, that's because a lot of whom they're interested in can't be talked to yet as they're free agents (like Kyle Lowry, for example). And on top of that, one of their best trade chips, the 22nd pick, can't be moved until after the draft. Additionally, they also *may* have Montrezl Harrell to offer in trades, but he has to decide if he's opting in or not first, and they're prohibited from talking to their own free agents about new contracts or sign and trades.   It would be stupid for the Lakers to be making trades now before the draft or free agency when they don't yet have their full compliment of trade assets, just as it would be for any team. That's why we haven't seen hardly any trades from anyone yet. So you can cling to this idea that ""nobody wants Kuzma"" if you want to, but I'm telling you that you're gonna be wrong and end up looking foolish for this take in about a week or so."
"Not yet, but [insider Eric Pincus reported that he heard he's leaning towards doing so.](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/7/22/22589260/lakers-rumors-montrezl-harrell-contract-opt-in-salary-trade-package)"

The Lakers and Kings have discussed a deal centered on Kyle Kuzma and Buddy Hield, as The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported. Multiple league sources told HoopsHype that Harrell and the Lakers’ 22nd overall pick were also discussed in variations of the trade talks centered around Kuzma and Hield."
"Well, speaking as a Laker fan, if the Lakers could get Kemba and all it cost was like a signed and traded Dennis Schroder along with Montrezl Harrell and maybe the 22nd pick in the draft, I'd consider that an upgrade for the Lakers. I'd feel like that even if Kemba wasn't closing games for the Lakers or was a 6th man off the bench (which is all Schroder should have been anyway).   Kemba's not worth anywhere near the money he's getting paid, but the Lakers are capped out anyway, and he'd be a great role player for them. He'd be someone who could help take the load off LeBron when it comes to running the offense and could be a good scorer off the bench or as a 3rd option, and he can hit shots if he's open off ball.   I get why the Celtics did what they did, but if the Lakers pursued him, I'd understand that too. Same with any other contender who's looking for extra PG or scoring help."

"I think it's more likely Lowry uses the threat of getting a 3/90 contract from New Orleans as leverage to get Toronto to trade him to his preferred destination (wherever that is) for similar money.   Like let's use the Lakers as an example, since [there have been recent reports that he's interested in going there.](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/.amp/news/nba-report-demar-derozan-and-kyle-lowry-reportedly-interested-in-joining-los-angeles-lakers) If the Lakers trade Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell there along with the 22nd pick then they too could offer Lowry a 3 year $90 million contract via sign and trade. Up till now the assumption would have been that that's not enough for Toronto to trade Lowry, but now that there's the threat that they could lose him for nothing, they'd probably prefer that instead.   The same thing could apply with the Sixers or any other team he wanted to go to who's over the cap. All New Orleans having this room to offer him a deal means is that Lowry now has the leverage to basically orchestrate his own sign and trade anywhere he wants with little to no pushback from Toronto. I think he's playing David Griffin, rather than him having a legit desire to go play for a lottery team."
"Ah, honestly haven't seen really anything outside of the incident with him and Montrezl Harrell in the bubble"
"Odds are if the Lakers are going to get either one of them it would be through a sign and trade, rather than via cap exceptions. Doing any S&amp;T would hard cap the Lakers, but if they're willing to do that again (they were last year), then it's really not unrealistic to think they could get both players via S&amp;T. Realistically what would it take to get either player via S&amp;T? I don't think either one would be that daunting to pull off.   Reports are that Montrezl Harrell is probably going to opt in, which would give the Lakers his $10 million contract, Kuzma's $13 million contract and KCP's $13 million contract as salary ballast/assets in trades. They also have Marc Gasol's $2 million and Alfonzo McKinnie's $2 million to throw in to help. Then they could S&amp;T Talen Horton-Tucker or Dennis Schroder, and they have the 22nd pick along with their 2027 1st rounder they could trade. There's enough there to execute a pair of S&amp;Ts."
"The 22nd pick in the draft would probably get you someone you could use. I don't know what DeRozan is looking for, but maybe a $15 million contract, signed and traded for Montrezl Harrell, Alfonzo McKinnie and the 22nd pick? Two guys in their 20s on one year deals and that 22nd pick, or would you really rather just have nothing?"
*Future Sacramento King Montrezl Harrell
"Shoutout NC  PG: Chris Paul, Devontae Graham   SG: Steph Curry, Seth Curry  SF: Brandon Ingram, TJ Warren  PF: PJ Tucker, Montrezl Harrell  C: Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside"
"If Montrezl Harrell opts in as is expected then he could get packaged with Kuzma and the 22nd pick for Hield. Or if not just Kuzma, Gasol and Alfonzo McKinnie along with the 22nd pick works. Or if they wait till the 22nd pick is signed to execute the trade just Kuzma, Gasol and that pick would work."
This Montrezl Harrell we’re talking about. Dude would definitely expose that lmao
Montrezl Harrell 2.0. Clippers don’t pay up. Out of spite he goes to the Lakers and gets part or all of their mid-level.
got it.  what do you think will happen with Montrezl Harrell if he opts in like it was reported the other day?
Montrezl Harrell has really become such an asshole since the bubble it’s unreal   He keeps blaming the teams instead of himself for being so shit on defense and therefore unplayable in the playoffs  Lakers when Harrell played in the playoffs: 0-4   When he didn’t play: 2-0
"Look how this thread started. We were talking about the Lakers off-season.   The point is, the you cannot make any conclusions based off this season and 6 post season games where our team had a short offseason, injured at different times, hardly played together, signed Drummond late in the season etc..  The other point is, in the playoffs, a healthy Anthony Davis will play ~42 minutes per game at the center position. Montrezl Harrell is like the 8th man on our team. Rotations shorten. Our title hopes are 1% contingent on his play and 99% contingent on the rest of our players.   What do you not understand?"
"&gt;Remember that Schroeder has to consent to be sign-and-traded, as well.  That's honestly the easy part, assuming there actually is a team out there that wants to give him a lot of money (not a guarantee). You can't combine players in a sign and trade deal, so if Schroder was a part of this it would have to be with a 3rd team, not the Wizards, so presumably Schroder would be OK with whomever this third team is.  So it would be something like Kuzma and/or KCP or Montrezl Harrell (if he wants to opt in), probably the 22nd pick in the draft and maybe the Lakers 2027 1st round pick. Then Schroder gets signed and traded to whomever wants him, with the pieces he gets traded for being sent to Washington.    Complicated for sure, but if the Wizards were wanting to move off of Westbrook and he really wanted to go to the Lakers then I'm sure the GMs would figure out a way to make it work."
"&gt; What is different between these and what Hill did against Lebron?  Nothing, that was a dirty play as well [and was called out as such.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-montrezl-harrell-says-solomon-hills-dive-that-injured-lebron-james-wasnt-a-basketball-play/) If Beverley diving repeatedly at Westbrook's knees isn't dirty, why did they give him a flagrant foul for merely ""going for a steal""?"
&gt; But it still cracks me up whenever someone passionately brings up those silly billboards.  I think it comes up so frequently because it affected the daily life of Angelenos (I had to see a Grit over Glam Montrezl Harrell billboard everyday lol) and serves as the perfect snapshot summary of the Lakers-Clippers dynamic.
He got taken to 6 by Montrezl Harrell and Pat Bev with another MVP and two other all-nba players behind him that year lmfao
"&gt;	Five years later, when Paul forced his way to Houston, Morey merely surrendered Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverley and a future first-round pick.  the author should learn what a free agent is"
"Joel doesn't deserve any hate for his comments but Doc absolutely does. ""Coddling"" when defending a player to the media isn't really a thing. If he didn't hold him accountable in practice leading up to that point, that is a failure as a coach just as much as it would be on Simmons as a player. Not sticking up for your player after the end to a series is just brutal. There is a huge difference between when coaches call out effort or issues during a regular season game, but to do it right after the season ends? Doc is a master of saving his own ass - it's ALL Ben Simmons fault that the team lost in the playoffs and has nothing to do with the terrible rotations or failure to execute down the stretch. Doc leaves path of fault behind him at every stop. Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, hell - he even scared Tim Duncan away from joining the Magic. And once Simmons is gone, he will need to work quickly to find the new punching bag of the team. Tobias Harris better be careful!"

"They did an incredible job.  Wall hadn't played in 2 years, reached his max already as a player, and they got that for a guy who was coming off an injury but is always at least a force and a draw and you never have to worry about him mentally competing.  Then they essentially took Wall and a protected first into  Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' No. 22    The only losers in this are the Rockets. Which under the new owner slowly disengrated a team he inherited in the first place to now chasing off a team President, GM, Ass Gms, Coach, Ass Coach, STars and Role players and ended last year in the bottom of the seeds and almost set a record for multiple losses in a row.   They at least have a yougn direction now, but wow Houston fans got Dollar Value Dolan.  Same Bullshit and Ego, but the reality show version with all talk and no action."
"That Clips team is so entirely different. They had Zubac and Montrezl harrell clogging the paint the whole time + Montrezl getting cooked by Jokic. The lineups where they ran 5 out with Jamychal Green murdered the Nuggets, this is basically that on steroids.   The Lakers haven't done anything to suggest they could beat a Clippers caliber team. Nobody they faced in 2020 was as good, and I doubt AD and Bron both play as well. Also Westbrook has been dogshit in the post season."
"He got a future first round pick, a 2021 first round pick (Isaiah Jackson), a couple of seconds, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Montrezl Harrell (on an expiring contract). It may not be a massive haul but it’s a pretty damn good one for one of the worst contracts in sports."
"In the bubble Boban accidentally fouled Montrezl Harrell, then offered his hand to help him up, Harrell swatted at him, and Boban puts his hands up like ""bro im just tryna be a friend here"""
"AD was also out with an injury during that time period, but nice try. They were literally down to Montrezl Harrell as the only guy to play center for about a month there."
"Lakers were desperate for a big. Gasol was out with covid and Davis was injured. No Javale, no Dwight. Montrezl Harrell was the only big left and he's not even big. Just terrible roster construction all around as usual for the Lakers."
"""It was all Doc Rivers and Montrezl Harrell."" 😂"
"You make it sound like *you* didn't watch. Kawhi and PG each played 11 minutes in the 4th quarter of Game 7 of that series and combined to go 0-11 for 0 points in that period. Explain to me how that is Doc Rivers fault. For the game those two combined to go 10-38 from the field for only 24 points in 82 minutes of playing time. Montrezl Harrell and Ivica Zubac outscored them in only 40 minutes of playing time, with Trez scoring 20 points and Zubac scoring 6.   Your star players choked, there's no way around that fact. Sorry."
Montrezl Harrell was literally the only Clipper with a negative +/- in the series. They were something like +150 without him and -50 with. His presence ran the team into the ground with help from a coach who specializes in choking by not adjusting.
"Kenneth Faried. He was even the starter in the 2014 FIBA tournament for team USA. He was out of the league at 29 and was already declining for a couple of years prior to that.  I think others are Arron Afflalo and Wilson Chandler. Idk why, but I get the feeling that Montrezl Harrell and Jerami Grant will end up being in this category."
"Usually means playing favorites. Just look at how stubborn he was with one of his boys playing big minutes, Montrezl Harrell, against a Denver team that looked designed to destroy players exactly like him."

What ring chasing vets did the Lakers have in 2020 ? It doesn’t really matter.  The ‘19 Warriors were running on fumes. They got taken to 6 by the Clippers led by Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell…  If they’d won that year and run it back they would have been even more beat up by the time the ‘20 playoffs rolled around.  Not to mention that the ‘20 Lakers are very well built to go up against those Warriors. They had a ton of size and athleticism which was always the Warriors weakness. Plus the only two superstars in the league who’ve consistently played above their normal level in the playoffs against Golden State.
"Who made the decision to have Simmons in the game in the 4th?  Was it the same guy who decided to let Montrezl Harrell get chewed up while blowing a 3-1 lead the year before, but stubbornly refused to adjust?"
Montrezl Harrell. He’s kind of in a weird spot. He’s too slow against guards and too small against most forwards and centers.

Do you make friends with the Montrezl Harrell of BBIQ you have?
Are you stupid? Did Lamar win with Montrezl Harrell as the center of his team?
"It's not a weird stat. He is catching all of the blame even though Embiid shit the bed with a 4/20 shooting performance in Game 4 (and was clearly impacted by the injury - definitely not his fault), Doc was god awful all series, and Seth Curry was the only role player that really showed up for the full series. Doc is pulling his classic ""anybody but me"" routine. Guys like Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, and even Tim Duncan when he could have signed with the Magic are just collateral damage for him. Fuck Doc Rivers.  Simmons has a ton of faults, but he is still a plus-player by any stretch and brings a ton to the team. Morey asking for the farm in return is probably because his analytics have him as a massive boost to the team overall."
"Doc is really good at finding other's to blame. It's actually crazy how many players get turned on when he is the head coach. Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, Ben Simmons.. losing Tim Duncan from joining the Magic. ""We"" against ""Them"" seems to be a locker room theme with him."

"I do wonder if our definition of what's neutral or good is different. To be clear I'm talking about his impact and fact he is a center generally helps that.  I can see your point as well though. While Jokic grades as slight positive on most defensive impact metrics LA-DRAPM does have him as slight negative.  In any case overall I guess it comes down to what you consider neutral defense for example. If you compare him to other anchor big's you could say he's below average, however most anchor big's tend to be above average.  On D-LEBRON his last season (0.61) grades him as around top 75 defender out of 247 players that played over 1000mins that season. This would put him among players like KAT, Jayson Tatum, Maxi Kleber, Montrezl Harrell and Pascal Siakam.   For me I would consider most guys in this 0.3 - 1.0 range to be slight positives on defense. Usually these are players that have at least few notable issues or limitations that stop them from being clear positive, but who also have some strong points and do enough to where you can be fairly certain that at least they aren't hurting their teams on that end. I think alongside of Jokic KAT and Josh Jackson are really good examples of this."
"Kawhi had one bad game in the nuggets series and for the rest of the time carried lou Williams, montrezl harrell, doc rivers, and Paul George yet people still blame the loss on kawhi.

"I mean with the Harrell thing it needs to be noted that the Clippers didn't want Montrezl back and made no effort to sign him  (that we or Harrell knows of, you never know now with Rich Paul...)"
&gt; without knowing if he was offered a bigger contract or not  This is from last year so it might not be 100% relevant but it at least shows he had interest the previous year.  https://twitter.com/BA_Turner/status/1329979259645923328  &gt;Sources: The Lakers and free agent center Montrezl Harrell are in negotiations for the NBA sixth man of the year to join them. **Harrell turned down more money from Charlotte to join the Lakers.**  Turner is a Lakers beat reporter for the LA Times
"This was basically what happened to Montrezl Harrell. Lebron and the Lakers know the Clippers are a serious threat in the Western Conference and that Harrell’s contract could of been used as a valuable trade asset for LAC. What do they do? Scoop him up even though the role and fit was questionable at best. When it’s clear he’s not part of the long term plans he’s pushed to accept his player option so that he could be used as salary fodder to facilitate the Westbrook trade. Is it really the best for his career to fight for minutes at a log-jam PF spot that features Rui, Bertans, and possibly Kuzma in a CONTRACT year?   He got pumped and dumped by LeBron/Rich Paul and it’s probably going to crush his future potential earnings."
"It’s clear that Klutch and Rich Paul manipulated earning projections for clients like KCP/Montrezl Harrell because of their affiliation with LeBron “teams”. Trez to LAL has basically been an entire ploy to wrestle a potential trade asset from LAC to becoming one for the Lakers and LeBron. I think Trez would have found a better deal for more money had he opted out and hit free agency. Now he’s been “advised” to opt in so that he could be used as salary fodder for the Westbrook deal. KCP has suffered the same fate as he’s basically been an “affordable contract” for the Lakers for the last few years. He turned down huge guaranteed money from DET but luckily for him he’s made close to most of it back.  What do you get from guys like Noel, Shabazz, ect.? No affiliation with LeBron so you get put on the back burner in negotiations and potential earnings.   This whole agency has been a farce to begin with it’s just been LeBron picking and choosing players to follow him so he can leverage NBA teams when he needs an infusion of talent for his own career goals. Rich Paul is basically just the face and mouthpiece of a pseudo-farm system for LeBron."
Lmao Montrezl Harrell also got fucked
Faried is the pre-evolution of Montrezl Harrell
Richaun Holmes vs Montrezl Harrell
"All stars get better treatment and outcomes than role players under Rich Paul. Even Montrezl Harrell got shafted on his latest deal to LA and I'd be curious if Rich Paul orchestrated that deal against the best financial interests of his client. This could be nothing, but it's definitely possible that it's something larger too."
"Correct me if I’m out of line here but Klutch has always seemed like a “fit in with the big picture” type agency. Big picture being anything and everything LeBron James related. If you’re on the inside doing stuff with LeBron or someway affected by his personnel decisions, free agency, ect. you’ll generally get a good deal - if you aren’t? Your best interest as a player and client are seemingly put on the back burner. For example, a guy like Montrezl Harrell…did he really get the best deal personally? I think most people would agree his signing by the Lakers and opting in to his player option"
"I mean, Anthony Davis forced his way out of New Orleans with exactly one destination in mind. Montrezl Harrell jumping from the Clippers to the Lakers for very little difference in money really upset his former teammates.   Even on a lesser note, you have the entire saga of LeGM in Cleveland where it felt like it was half Klutch guys. I don't necessarily think it's THAT much of a stretch."
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."

"I really don't understand why teams keep trading for Westbrook.  The Thunder ran away with murder by trading Westbrook for CP3 and picks  The rockets traded that horrendous contract away to the Wizards  The wizards ran away with murder by trading him away to the Lakers for Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Caldwell-Pope and a first round pick  Don't teams know just how bad Westbrook is by now???"
"Montrezl is going to eat whoever they put on him alive.   *then he’ll get eaten alive on defense, and such is the way of Harrell*"
"""Kuzma on trade: 'I mean, you gotta do that trade 10 out of 10 times'""  ""Kuzma calls Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Aaron Holiday and himself: 'really good basketball players'""  ""A hall of famer like Westbrook makes trade worth it for Lakers says Kuzma"""
"why feel bad? He's getting love from the crowd. Montrezl Harrell was getting MVP chants from the Wizards crowd yesterday, at this point it's not really a joke anymore, they're just really good players"
"I'm trying to think of a few players who could improve the team and here's what I've come up with: Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Montrezl Harrell."
Ron Artest  Matt Barnes  Javale McGee  Carmelo Anthony  Montrezl Harrell  Dennis Schroder
Team of Current Players:  D'Angelo Russell  Collin Sexton  Malik Beasley  Jaren Jackson Jr.   Montrezl Harrell
Washington DC Has Kuznetsov and uh…. Montrezl Harrell…?
Rough first game for the Raptors. They need some post defense ain't no way we should be letting Montrezl Harrell drop 22 on us that easily.
"In the past 2 years, Wizards had 7 former Laker Players:  Isaac Bonga  Moritz Wagner  Thomas Bryant  Kyle Kuzma   Montrezl Harrell   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Joel Ayayi  If you jump back one more year, you can add Isaiah Thomas to the list too."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
"I only didn't count Bobby as I generally consider him a PF! I don't know how much of it is homer stuff but given he picked up vote(s?) for 6moy (I know Ernie on Inside voted for him) I really do think Portis was one of the best bench players in the league and in terms of big me it's him, Chris Boucher and Montrezl Harrell."
My friends and I have an inside joke that the answer to this is Montrezl Harrell. Man put up like 15 and 7 in 11 minutes when he was on the Clippers. Embiid is probably the true answer but Harrell has gotta be up there.
montrezl harrell?
"They would not have been able to get Westbrook if they did any sign and trades because of the hard cap. But it wasn't even so much about Westbrook, it's just that it would have severely limited the Lakers on what else they'd have been able to do. If the Lakers had got DeRozan at his current contract, just between he, LeBron, AD and THT the Lakers would have had $113 million committed to those four players. The hard cap is at $143 million, so the Lakers would have only had $30 million left to fill out the remaining 11 roster spots. And considering the vet minimum pays players $2.6 million, that basically would have meant those 11 players could only get minimums.  With the hard cap it also means the Lakers could not have crossed that threshold all season long, not for *any* reason. So like if a trade came up or something, they would have to stay under that limit. Last year the Lakers operated with a hard cap because of the signing of Montrezl Harrell, and the reports were that they really hated having to do that. I think the Lakers place a big premium on keeping some flexibility just in case something good happens mid-season, like a trade or a buyout."

Deandre Jordan is a worse defender than Montrezl Harrell and it's not even close
"On track to be DPOY when he was last healthy. He should be playing at the 5, as his rim protection really is something else.   Offensively, he’ll always be a cog in the machine- and that’s fine.   The freakiest part is that his measurements aren’t even that great. He has a 7-foot-1 wingspan which is kinda underwhelming for someone who’s 6-11, for reference AD has a 7-6 wingspan, Giannis has a 7-4 wingspan and even guys like Montrezl Harrell have 7-4 wingspans and Isaac isn’t really that athletic. Just unbelievably good timing and awareness.  Shame he’s also a Covid dummy."

"[Yep, this was just 10 months ago:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)  &gt; ""I did this off-the-bench stuff already in two years with OKC,"" Schroder, who finished second behind teammate Montrezl Harrell for Sixth Man of the Year for his role with the Thunder, said on an introductory videoconference call with reporters Monday. ""I think I try to move forward, and I think with [Anthony Davis] and LeBron, I can be helpful as a starter in the PG position.""  &gt; Schroder said that he has not spoken to Lakers coach Frank Vogel about his desire to start, however his representatives, Alex Saratsis and Jeff Austin of Octagon, discussed that aspect with the Lakers front office prior to L.A.'s trading guard Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in the draft to the Thunder to complete the deal.  &gt; ""I think my agent talked to the organization before they was trading me,"" he said ""So, that's that.""  I guess the selfish approach didn't work towards getting himself paid so now he's willing to try being a team player and see if that works."
"this is a kinda silly argument because a one point difference in dbpm does matter. a .3 this season would have you around 50 in the league while a -1 puts you around 130. granted, dbpm is a fairly useless stat, lu dort was a -1 this year while montrezl harrell was a .3, but when a normal year has no one even reaching +/- 5, a 1 point difference is notable"
When they decided to try to corner the market on undersized centers this summer. The Westbrook trade prevented them from completing the set by also adding Montrezl Harrell to go along with TT and Richaun Holmes.
"Yeah I must have just watched too many highlight reels because I definitely viewed him as a really above-the-rim twitchy guy. He almost sounds like a super montrezl Harrell or something, but again I haven’t seen a full game from him yet so I don’t have much to judge on. Really excited to watch him and Chet in particular from this class."
Yea I was on the fence until I saw the post about Montrezl Harrell getting the vaccine. I immediately made my appointment.
COVID-19 catches Montrezl Harrell
He’s basically one big antibody with some Montrezl Harrell mixed in.
"Montrezl ""Thanos"" Harrell"
"&gt;probably the second worst catch all stat that we have after the king of all shit stats, PER  Lol Montrezl Harrell has a higher PER than KD and basically the same PER as Steph."
yeah thats why montrezl harrell is better than kevin durant it's so obvious everybody knows it
"Yes, he’s not a really good finisher now.  But this team has no spacing around the arc and he often has to fight two guys in the paint since no one could care less about 3 pointers by the Pistons. I do think he takes weird lookin inside shots tho. He can  stretch the floor a little. He’s just not put in these situations even though I’d say he has above average shooting compared to guys in his category.  But he’s also very physical in the paint. He’s very tough to back down and athletic enough to switch on wings from time to time. He’s still got a long way to go but Montrezl Harrell is a comparable growth. Small size, strong centers with a particular skill set."
I feel Montrezl Harrell is probably the closest
Montrezl Harrell and Al Horford
"Kanter and Sabonis remind me of Zeebo, even Sengun a little bit. Gritty, unathletic, skilled back to the basket big man with a good mid range jumper and a low centre of gravity.   Rasheed is difficult, if you're looking at role and counting stats I'd say Montrezl Harrell, if you're looking at build and playstyle I'd say Marcus Morris, maybe a younger Paul Millsap."
Montrezl Harrell is 6'7. Their playstyle makes them bigs. Theis' three is fools gold. 28% last season and 30% this season. Teams leave him wide open and live with the outcome
Rasheed - Jaren Jackson Jr or C Wood with defence   Randolph - Montrezl Harrell
Montrezl Harrell is super skilled to be honest  Stewart needs to look more at traditional shorter rim runners

This is how I feel about Montrezl Harrell
"I secretly wish the refs would give Montrezl Harrell a tech *every time* he dunks. Like please... we get it bro, you can dunk, just go easy on the rim shaking."
"the problem is that his skill set doesn’t really work for the modern NBA. he’s a good, not great post/face-up scorer with a below average jumper, no real court vision, and abysmal defense. he’s basically a 6’10 montrezl harrell who is worse at finishing (and harrell’s main skill is finishing so that’s an issue)"
"Bingo! I wish more of our fans understood that.   Got people pointing at what Garbua is doing w/ RGV and saying he should've got minutes with the Rockets and, no, that's now how that works *at all*. JC really needs to be sent down to RGV to get minutes at that speed for a season or so, then see how he looks getting rotational minutes with the Rockets.  Sengun was the Turkish league MVP - dude is ready for NBA minutes. Garuba is close, but I personally think he needs to marinade w/ RGV for their season. Christopher is incredibly rough around the edges, but he's the exact type of dude that seems like he just needs some minutes at the G-League level to smooth his game out.  Hartenstein, K.J. Martin, KPJ, Gary Payton II, Montrezl Harrell, Clint Capela, Robert Covington - all those dudes put in minutes with RGV and are starting or getting significant minutes off the bench. Still makes me mad we let GP2 go to the Warriors - he was something special with RGV, all 3 times he was with us lol"

Fine. Montrezl Harrell then.
I think Stewart might just hate the Lakers. Last year he outmuscled the hell out of Montrezl Harrell and almost got in a fight with Markeiff.  https://youtu.be/i1eJD04y6ow
I'd put Trez (Montrezl Harrell) in the contenders.  Dude is a beast and has a crazy motor.
"according to Kendrick Perkins, Udonis Haslem, James Johnson, PATRICK BEVERLEY, Montrezl Harrell and Pops Junior Tucker"
"Boucher was never even close to sixth man of the year caliber. To be that caliber you need to have a well-rounded game without many obvious weaknesses. Boucher was always a tall, skinny guy who couldn't defend real centers and couldn't get boards and he never had an offensive game of any kind.  The prototypical energy big off the bench recently is Montrezl Harrell who was obviously weak defensively but skilled enough to score in every conceivable way off of the short roll."
Montrezl Harrell.  He had terrible on/off numbers for the Clips and I thought Doc just hated Zubac
Hartenstein and McGee actually both play 17 minutes per game. Also Montrezl Harrell is 6th in the league in PER and he plays 29 minutes per game
"That was a **great** move.  We traded Wall who hadn’t played in 2 seasons for Russ.  Russ got his stock at a premium again by getting us to the Playoffs and going on a tear.  **We then traded Russ for and get this, there’s a list :)**  **Spencer Dinwiddie (huge ACL comeback season)**  **Montrezl Harrell (current 6MOTY candidate)**  **Kyle Kuzma (improved in pts, reb, assist, steals, blks)**  **KCP (still playing elite defense)**  **Pick 22 in 2021 Draft… that was then on traded for Aaron Holiday and Pick 31 which was Isaiah Todd**  So in total the Wiz built a totally new squad and the Lakers took on Russ and his ridiculously terrible contract…**did I mention that he has a Player Option for next year LOL**  If we win 50 games, Tommy Sheppard is Executive of the Year."
"&gt;Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick  &gt;I think it was worth it for us  No need to be humble, you guys fleeced everyone!"
"We turned broken John Wall who hadn’t played in nearly 2 years into Russ who got us to the playoffs and upped his value.  Then used that to get Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick (traded that for Aaron Holiday and slightly later pick Isaiah Todd)  I think it was worth it for us cause he got us to where we are now lol"
That tracker also says Montrezl Harrell and Giannis have about the same chances of winning MVP.

"Yeah and the Sixers have more than just pissing Ben Simmons to worry about if he actually has a mental health illness. Montrezl Harrell and KAT have well documented mental health issues and Harrell was even paid while being away from the team. In both the NBA and NFL, whole medical teams and coaches have been fired for misdiagnosis or mismanaging injuries. Also it'd be very easy for him to go public the same way Kawhi did when he didn't agree with the doctor's diagnosis.  Moving on from that, based on your logic the NBAPA's job is to keep the players happy. The same way the team doctor's job is to keep the team happy by your logic. The other 14 players on Simmons team likely do not care if he gets forced to go back to the team. That's not money in their pocket nor money they can use. That is a loophole that they can all apply though if they don't pressure it. Also they all are saying they're happier without him. So they probably are fine with him staying away from the team while also having an exploitable loophole in the future.  Also I assume the NBAPA employs are is contracted with thousands of doctors, unless the doctors are told to the players by the Sixers or Simmons, the players won't even know which doctors it is."

Of course they weren't as good as Wood.   But their play immediately fell off when they left a tanking team just like Wood's will fall off when he gets to a contender.  Then he's a malcontent who just happens to be a poor defender.  Players like him are a hard pass for contenders unless they come cheap.  Just see Montrezl Harrell on the Clippers.

"Montrezl Harrell had the 36th best D-RAPTOR in the NBA in 19-20, I’m not sure if you were yet a Clippers fan but if you watched that season would you have considered Montrezl a positive defender? (The answer is no, he was god awful, but he took a lot of charges which this formula clearly overweights extremely)  As much as they’ve tried to implement different formulas and contextualize on-off, +/- etc all in one statistics like RAPTOR remain damn near useless in player evaluation, particularly on defense.

"I’ve been a Christian Wood fan for the beginning and have gone on the record that letting him go was the biggest mistake the Bucks have made since Horst became GM. Wood is nowhere near worth that much. He’s untested in the playoffs, he’s not a shot blocker and he needs the offense catered in some way toward him. He’s been a empty calorie scorer every time he’s got meaningful minutes. He’s a rich man’s Montrezl Harrell. Good player but his not a building block for a young team."

This is wrong because you don’t have Montrezl Harrell on first team.    How can you leave off the MVP?
People are going to hate your comment but you're actually right.  Current Melo is like a 3 point shooting version of Montrezl Harrell.  He'll win you regular season games but you're going to be in trouble if you're reliant on him in the playoffs.  Just ask Portland.
Montrezl Harrell has been disgusting offensively for the Wiz. He was leading the league in win share for a bit. 19 and 10 he’s posting a career high in true shooting too.

So what makes WS/48 (the stat that has Montrezl Harrell over Steph Curry) better
"Luka isn't a bitch, as shown by how he handled the altercation with Montrezl Harrell and how he generally carries himself very well.  Too bad his diehard fans are all insufferable idiots."
"I was going through last year's series earlier today and I realized two key things that would make this swing in favor of the Clippers.   Not having Doc Rivers  Not having Montrezl Harrell  Everyone seems to only remember the Nuggets series on how bad Trez was, but the Mavericks series was just as bad. The Mavs bench would basically cut any Clippers lead or grow any Mavs lead (depending on the situation) the moment he came in. He was getting blitzed non stop by Burke/Curry or just getting destroyed inside by Boban.   His net rating in all but one game (the monster blow out by the Clippers in game 5) were negative. Four of the other five games had a net rating of -19 or worse.   Game 1 - Clippers won by 8. He had a net rating of -19 and a +/- of -7.   Game 2 - Clippers lost by 13. He had a net rating of -30 and a +/- of -19.   Game 3 - Clippers win by 8. he had a net rating of -5.8. +/- of -9  Game 4- Clippers lose by 2. He had a net rating of (get ready for this) -54.3. +/- of -19. His DRTG this game was 162.2. He played 17 minutes. Boban was +11 in the minutes they matched against each other.   Game 6 - a game the Clippers won by 14!!. He had a net rating of -59.4. 59.4!!!!  +/0 -19. In a game the team won by 14.   Despite how terrible he was game in and game out, Doc was still playing him 15+ minutes a game over JaMychael Green.   I know - everyone is gonna say ""well he was playing next to Lou, Lou only had a negative +/- in game 6. His net rating was negative in two games."
"Yes, because the Clippers should've closed that series out in five games. If Doc Rivers had any sense he wouldn't have had Montrezl Harrell on the floor to deal with possibly the greatest offensive center ever, especially since Harrell clearly wasn't the same guy he was on offence before his absence to make up for some of the hemoragghing."
Don’t let the final score distract you from the fact that Montrezl Harrell put up quite possibly the ugliest shot attempt of the year in the 4th quarter.
Fun Fact: Montrezl Harrell is actually incapable of shooting the ball without yelling AND 1.
"There’s no bubble, Doc Rivers, Montrezl Harrell or Lou Williams this time. It took all of these things in unprecedented circumstances for them to lose in the 2nd round in which a lot of people like to conveniently forget they were up 3-1 in, they didn’t get that lead by accident.   A championship coach in Lue who’s willing to adjust and a motivated Kawhi and PG along with veteran teammates in Rondo, Ibaka and Batum won’t let that happen.  The Clippers will sweep the Blazers and at worst will win in 5 games if any NBA fan has paid attention to the complete matchup advantage they have they wouldn’t even fantasize about an upset because barring injuries there’s no chance the Blazers even push that series to 6 let alone win."
