"Zion, BI, NAW, Kira Lewis Jr., and CP3. You can probably tell why."
"Jaylen Brown and then Zion, BI, NAW, and Kira Lewis, Jr."
Kira Lewis Jr. in my unbiased opinion
My totally unbiased take is Kira Lewis Jr
"At some point, SVG has to try something new. Make a change to the starting backcourt. Run Kira Lewis Jr. out there. Hell, play Hayes and Adams out there together. Make a change. It's clear Lonzo flat out doesn't fit and the way things are going, now only are we going to deserve the worst record in the league, we deserve to get screwed into picking fifth."
"Lonzo/Kira Lewis Jr, NAW/Josh Hart, Ingram/,  Zion/Melli, Adams/Hayes.  Once Bledsoe and JJ Reddick are sold to contenders, I want this team to pick up the pace, look at getting more of a floor spacing defensive Center (Myles Turner), and most importantly the point of this season and even next season is to stay healthy and grow together."
"Maybe. Depends on how Lonzo, Hayes and NAW develop. I imagine if they make strides and one of those guys emerge as center prince they can get away with not trading Ingram. I don’t know we’ll see. They also have Kira Lewis Jr. who’s only 19 and could get good. They have the pieces and picks we’ll see how it plays out."
"While we're on the topic, KLJ = Kira Lewis Jr."
Kira Lewis Jr Era starts Tonight (maybe?)!
Huh? Lonzo is the only PG on the team besides Kira Lewis Jr. at the end of the bench. Bledsoe is a small ball SG.

"More than Hayes, Cole Anthony, Kira Lewis Jr, and maaaaybe Maxey."
"Kira Lewis Jr  He’s gonna be a problem when he bulks up, he has a great feel for the game and he’s only 19(!!!!)"
"Even if you want to keep Hart on the bench, you could always start NAW. Or move Lonzo to the 2 and start Kira Lewis Jr at the 1. Either option would be better than the Lonzo-Bledsoe combo."
"Bledsoe's days have got to be numbered. Even if you prefer Hart as a 6th man/closer, you could still start NAW or move Lonzo to the 2 and give Kira Lewis Jr the keys at the 1."
It's Kira Lewis Jr and he's a dog. Got more steals then the whole Pistons team.
"Lol offense was never the problem before all the injuries. Ingram, Hart, NAW and Kira Lewis Jr are all out. Besides Lonzo that’s pretty much all of our 3 point shooters. Defense was always the issue."
Who the hell is Kira Lewis Jr?
"We’re missing BI, Josh, NAW and Kira Lewis Jr. Those are all key pieces for us if we even want to stand a chance."
Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Jaxson Hayes and Kira Lewis Jr all made some strides but then *also* promptly got injured.  I felt like we were really starting to turn a corner post-ASG and post-Minny loss too. Now everyone's just injured and we're trying to scrape by with new vets and.... Eric Bledsoe.
"The answer is somewhat complicated, but the answer is basically: Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Kira Lewis Jr."
Kira Lewis Jr. just got injured but was playing well for us. He's made some really sound decisions as a rookie and doesn't turnover the ball that much.

KIRA LEWIS JR.   ROOKIE TAKE-OVER!
Luka  Trae  Shai  LaMelo  Ja  Sexton  Lonzo  Halliburton  KPJ  Garland  Fultz  Maledon  Quickley  Coby White  Cole Anthony  THT  Poole  Kira Lewis Jr
"For me, it goes (in order):  Luka, Ja, Lamelo, Trae , Shai, Lonzo, Kira Lewis, Quickley, Kevin Porter Jr, Coby White, Poole, Fultz, Sexton, Garland, Cole Anthony, Talen Horton Tucker, Haliburton &amp; Theo Maledon"
kira lewis jr has sm potential
"Use the Butt ton of picks they have to go crazy at the trade deadline.  [http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yj9azueg](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yj9azueg)  This probably like 3 1st rounders 2 2nd rounders to Orlando. 2 1st rounders to charlotte. a 1st and 3 or 4 2nd rounders to toronto. in that deal. If teams want to play hardball they have room to give more picks.  Starters: Lowery, Rozier, Ingram, Zion, Vucevic  Bench: Kira Lewis Jr, Hart, Fournier, Herangomez, Hayes  Thats a team that will be in the play in games. likely win to get into the playoffs. Then tear it up in the playoffs."
Anyone know how Kira Lewis Jr has looked? Have barely seen anything about him this season.
"Legit looks like a really solid class rn.   Ant/Lamelo and Haliburton showing flashes of being superstars.  Wiseman has all the tools to be a star, just needs to put it together.  PWill looks like a young Kawhi, good rookie defender and a solid jumper.  Okoro has been solid for the Cavs from what I've seen.   Okongwu and PA (idk how to spell his name honestly) look like good bigs.  Then you have guys like Avdija/Vassell who could be all-star guys if given the attention they're needed by coaching staff.  You also have Anthony/Kira Lewis jr/IQ/Toppin/Nesmith/Poku/Maxey/Pritchard/Flynn/Kenyon JR/Hayes/Bey who have all had their moments.  Real nice class 1 year in."
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he’s too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he’s probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it’ll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He’s already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"It's a mix of things.  If the shot isn't falling, has trouble getting FTs. He really only drives in the rare fastbreak situation, and sometimes when he gets fouled there's no call because he has no reputation as a slasher. Refs are weird. It's easy to block/foul him because of that. Meanwhile, Eric Bledsoe can't finish at all lately, but he can get the whistle/get easy points that way.  He's been coming off of injuries a lot this season (knees, now hips) and when he does, it's difficult for him to get back into shooting flow. So then it's ""0-5pt"" games. And that's sometimes weeks and weeks of inconsistency. Which sucks. Our backcourt isn't contributing, and then Zion and Brandon are left on an island.  *And then you have...*  Eric Bledsoe and Lonzo Ball have similar issues with confidence/being consistent and I don't think they bring out the best in each other.  It's why I was begging them to play Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis Jr. more in Lonzo Ball line-ups. (And to start NAW.) NAW is more reliable offensively than Bledsoe, and Kira Lewis Jr. is a very good cutter and a fast rookie who helps your point guard get more eyes off of your star players. They're offensive threats and dudes you can swing the ball to, vs. Bled. (Who is left unguarded by other teams *a lot*.)  But, the roster this year wasn't built to help *anyone*. It hurts our star players the most---which is the most important part, but it sure as hell doesn't help the dudes like Lonzo, Josh in the line-up either."
Ingram isn't even the best player on his team wtf  They literally have Kira Lewis Jr.
"It's not intentional. Which is why it's so maddening  I'm just hoping with a real offseason + training camp + practices we can start fixing some of our issues. We're so damn sloppy. We couldn't 'guard a parked car.'  Zion doesn't know what a defensive stance is or how to close out. BI constantly loses his man.  Lonzo forgets that his team needs him to generate points. Bledsoe forgot how to play basketball. Adams I don't even know because everyone around him is so lost on team defense, he's often just left on an island.  And we're not playing Kira Lewis Jr. and letting him get minutes even though he's been promising, and we weren't playing a healthy Nickeil Alexander-Walker, even though NAW was putting up these great 30pt/20pt games and being a *great* SG for us."
"Maybe see what we have with Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Especially in the starting line-up. He's young and has shown out a few times. Ambidextrous finisher, can shoot threes, hit mid-range shots, stepbacks, can be a multi-level scorer and pest on defense at times.  I don't think they'll throw our rookie Kira Lewis Jr. in the fire just yet, but he's crazy fast and seems pretty smart for a rookie. He needs to get to NBA weight and keep learning off the bench probably.  They'll both get more minutes if Bledsoe is gone from the team.  Do we run things back with Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball though?   And please for the love of god sign some shooters who will actually show up and shoot and not drop to 20% when they join the Pelicans.  🙏📿"
"Hart, NAW, and Kira Lewis Jr. are solid pieces I’d want to keep with Zion and BI, but we definitely need more 3&amp;D guys. Please for the love of God ship Bledsoe with a pick if we have to"
"I'd rather start Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Kira Lewis Jr., Josh Hart, and even Naji Marshall our two-way player over Bledsoe."
"well lately all of our guards are injured so he doesn’t have much of a choice, unfortunately. It’s basically just him, Kira Lewis Jr. (a rookie), and Naji Marshall (an undrafted rookie on a 2-way contract who has been playing pretty well)"
Kira Lewis Jr. [Lebron James]
Kira Lewis Jr is lowkey solid
Kira Lewis Jr.   That's a name I now have to remember.
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
"Kira Lewis Jr. earned minutes as the season progressed. Used his speed solidly throughout the season and I thought he played his best next to Nickeil, Zion (duh), and Jax. He almost looks like a vet out there with the composure he showed. I’d like to see improvement shooting the ball and using his speed to turn the corner more on defenders and be more aggressive when attacking the basket.  Naji Marshall is probably the reason Josh Hart won’t be returning to the Pels. This guy literally “just plays hard as fuck.” He’s the best on ball defender on our team and makes winning plays.   Lastly, Didi came over late from the NBL, but he showed signs of being a pesky defender. One of his first assignments was Luka Doncic, and he frustrated Luka a bit. Offense is a work in progress."
One of the major reasons listed for firing SVG was that the front office wanted younger players like NAW and Kira Lewis Jr to play over Bledsoe who was terrible but SVG stuck with diet Eric.   This season was supposed to be about development and chemistry building but we wasted a lot of minutes watching Bledsoe wear a jersey and run around clanking shots
Whats gonna happen with Kira Lewis Jr?
I’d take him over Kira Lewis Jr too
IMO:  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Anthony Edwards  3. Tyrese Halliburton  4. Patrick Williams  5. James Wiseman 6. Isiah Stewart 7. Isaac Okoro 8. Saddiq Bey 9. Onyeka Okungwu (injury concern made me put him lower than I’d like). 10. Cole Anthony 11. Desmond Bane 12. Tyrese Maxsey 13. Kira Lewis Jr. 14. Killian Hayes
"Kira Lewis Jr. Has huge upside, really fast, and has great court vision"
Kira Lewis Jr but idk about on the pelicans; they’ve got too much going on for the next 6 years but who knows
"&gt;*honestly, the Pelicans feel like they're behind even us in roster development.*  Maybe a little bit.  Last season Coach Stan Van Gundy refused to play our younger players. He gave out a LOT of DNPs lol.  Eric Bledsoe was our most played player last season despite the fact that he hasn't acted---nor put the effort in, of an All-Defense caliber guard for majority of the season. He was terrible on both sides of the ball while our younger guys were actually pretty responsible/hard-working.  He really only wanted to play vets, and it drove the fanbase (and FO) crazy.  Because we do have young promising guys on the team that our FO *really likes*, but that didn't get to see the floor and work through their mistakes and grow from them. Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, didn't get a lot of playtime but especially our youngest rookie Kira Lewis Jr. lol. He only gave them minutes when he was forced to because of injuries."
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
"I was on American Ninja Warrior in 2014. I was eliminated on the 3rd obstacle, the falling bridge. The people who are gonna do well, are quick with good body control. Tall people are out. It was much harder if you’re bigger. So probably a young guy. Rookie SGs is who Id put my money on. Kira Lewis Jr on the Pels is my homer choice  Or Wilt, for obvious reasons"
"Kira Lewis Jr., Josh Hart if he re-signs."
"I mean.... Kira Lewis Jr.... Also, I've met alotta great people outta Mississippi and Bama at Pels games. Aint no love lost outside the active college rivalry."
"thank you!!!!!  he was stuck behind Eric Bledsoe, isaiah thomas, and Kira Lewis Jr.   how is anybody supposed to get any opportunity with those guys soaking up all the minutes?   not to mention Zion and Ingram hogging the ball from Lonzo all game. 33 shot attempts and only 8 assists? i’m not a mathematician, but thats like 1 in 4, Lonzo would be way better   stan van is obviously just a hater. pels should get somebody at 17 to build around Lonzo and then buy a 2nd rounder to secure Gelo"
"Kira Lewis Jr is the one that’s more like a traditional PG. NAW is the SG prototype with great defense as well. Both are still pretty raw, but I, and a ton of other Pels fans, are high on NAW."
"You hit the nail on the head. The Pelicans love the futures of both Nickaeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis Jr. But they'd like someone to show them the finer points of running an offense - someone who can lead by example.  Lowry is still good as a player, and potentially even more valuable as a mentor. Which is why the Pels will probably be willing to pay more for Lowry than anyone else."
"Honestly don't think they want to keep Lonzo. They may trade for Lowry and develop Kira Lewis Jr and NAW as their future while pushing for playoff with JV, Zion and Ingram.  Lowry - NAW - Ingram - Zion - JV  To me,  that's some legitimate starting 5"
"Eric Bledsoe, Jaxson Hayes, Kira Lewis Jr. and three first-round picks for Ben Simmons. Wasn't sure about Kira Lewis Jr. but needed to make salaries work.  Pelicans manage to offload Bledsoe, and gain an all-star PG. They also sink further into roster construction hell and lose assets needed to build a team around Zion.  76ers get rid of Simmons but also receive a downgrade at the PG position, their new back-up C for when Embiid misses 20 games is an even greater downgrade than before, and either have to spend the picks to find a favourable trade from Bledsoe, or spend a year with a worse PG than the one they just traded away."
"&gt;So it’s insane to judge a guy based off the high pressure moments of the biggest stages in college but it isn’t to fair to say that same guy might not be ready to contribute in the highest pressure moments of the next level in the nba?  It absolutely is insane, especially when factoring in its a 6 game sample size, and when said player still produced and contributed well at what he needed to do in the “biggest stage” (16ppg on 42% from 3 on 7.5 3PA)   &gt;They have a young core. I don’t understand why you need to add another uncertain young guy into the mix especially when all it sounds like you’re looking for is shooting.  They have a young core that consist of 2 people, those are Zion and Ingram. Everyone else is replaceable and their roles can be moved around. You add another young guy to the mix because this is a player whose skillset perfectly blends with what they need as a team and it’s a player who you are getting on a bargain of a contract because they will be on a rookie deal.   Shooters rise, and shooters get paid.  &gt;Tatum, wasn’t suppose to be in that role for one and guys like him who perform in the playoffs like that are the exception not the rule. I wouldn’t expect Cade, Mobley or Green to have that kind of run in their rookie years if they made the playoffs much less Kispert.  Whether Tatum was suppose to be in that role isn’t the point, the point is as a rookie he contributed to winning basketball even before the post season. It’s something other rookies have done and it’s something teams and draft analysts expect Kispert to be able to do from day 1.   &gt;NAW averaged 11 a game last year in 22 mins of play. He can create his own as well why isn’t he a starter?   He’s not an efficient player, he’s not a good 3pt shooter, he’s not a lead playmaker, and he’s an average defender. Also Lonzo and Bledsoe literally started over him   That being said I think he CAN start and be a pressure reliever, secondary creator and 3rd scoring option. Like I have said before POSITION LESS BASKETBALL. These dudes can co-exist.   &gt;Kira Lewis was a rookie who’s younger than Kispert you can’t write him off as ever been a starting guard in this league that fast. That’s what they drafted him for.  I’m not going to ignore a prospect that fits a clear role and position of need because of Kira Lewis Jr and NAW. Honestly I don’t even know why you keep mentioning them when Kispert is a wing and those 2 are guards.   &gt;Duncan Robinson was just a name. Not necessarily talking about him, there will be more shooters who are available who we know can fill it up. Go after Eric Gordon. Houston is looking to move on anyway  33 year old injury prone Eric Gordon who is making 40 million over the next 2 years and has shot 32% from 3 the last 2 years? You’re kinda proving my point about how hard it is to get actual shooters with the players you’re naming."
"&gt;saying that player could help your nba team push towards a nba playoff berth his rookie year is quite insane too.  Is it really? We’ve seen situations like this dozens of times. This is a prospect that is touted as NBA ready, has a skill that is the single most important in basketball, and is also a skill that pelicans Badly need. Assuming a 22 year old rookie shooter who has a track record of winning and consistency with his shot will help an nba team win games isn’t far fetched. The pelicans already have a team that has the star talent to make the playoffs they just need pieces around those guys.   You as a Celtics fan should know that’s false, we saw rookie Tatum heavily contribute to the Celtics. (I’m not comparing the 2 as players, just what they can provide to a team.)  &gt;They have , Lonzo (for now), Kira Lewis and Alexander Walker, when you is he ever starting?  Neither Kira Lewis Jr, or NAW are starters, I think Kispert could come in day 1 and be a better fit next to Zion over them. That being said I already stated that this is a position-less league he will likely play anywhere from the 2 to 4 spots in the league depending on lineups, and at 10 you’re trying to get a guy that can play a role.  Kispert doesn’t have to start . A guy like Davis Bertans whose one of the best floor spacers in the league comes of the bench and still impacts the game with his floor spacing.   &gt;If you need shooting, you don’t need uncertainty from a rookie   With this logic teams should just always trade their draft picks away if their scared for uncertainty. Everyone has bust potential even LeBron had it.  &gt;go get Duncan Robinson or someone   You mean Duncan Robinson whose looking to get 15-20 million in free agency? Getting shooters isn’t easy, if it was every team would have them"
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
He isn’t on the same level as a player but Kira Lewis jr is crazy fast
"Allegedly the conflict between SVG and Griff came from SVG not wanting to play NAW and Kira Lewis Jr. while Griff wanted them to get more minutes, so it seems like Griff didn’t have that much influence during the season but obviously a lot of influence afterwards"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

Kira Lewis Jr.
YOUR FAVORITE POINT GUARD WISHES HE WAS KIRA LEWIS JR
"I really don’t think trading jrue was that bad. Lonzo looks bad but I think we should still wait to see how Chicago does with a larger sample size plus see how lonzo does. The Steven adams deal, passing on deandre hunter just to draft 2 busts (as of now) are the 2 biggest offenses I think. Kira Lewis jr also looks like a whiff but will see."
"the lineup numbers for the Pelicans starters have been incredible. Any time JV, Devonte, Josh Hart, and NAW have shared the court the Pelicans have been very good, their issues this season have come when they've had to play Kira Lewis Jr. and Naji Marshall real minutes."
"I think a lot of teams would be interested in Kira Lewis Jr as well  That kid is crazy fast, if you can teach him some basketball skills he already has elite physical attributes  Kira might be the fastest guy in the NBA even"
"josh hart is a starter quality player  devonte and NAW should be playing better than this, which falls partially on the coaching.  no real adjustments being made.   kira lewis jr. is a talented player he should be having a better game  and the defense is like 75% bad scheming and bad communication here.   the turnovers are bad coaching.  the lack of being able to get turnovers from GSW is also bad coaching because better teams can do it  like taylor jenkins and the grizzlies coaching staff wouldn't be 1-9 and they would give GSW a good fight in this game.  budenholzer wouldn't be 1-9"
jesus is kira lewis jr. the fastest man alive
