"Well... yeah. Our offense completely opens up when anyone gets their shot going. We have a multitude of guys who could be our lead scorer on any given night. But I dont think Devonte is able to get people going as  quickly or as often as LaMelo. If its Devonte taking the ball up the court, he either passes it away and gets in position (which he is good at), he drives and pulls out of the paint and resets, or he takes a bad shot. Im not gonna try and claim that LaMelo doesn’t take bad shots or that he doesn’t make stupid plays while driving, but he provides another serious threat to drive at the basket, which creates more spacing for shooters like Hayward, Monk, Bridges, Graham, or Washington (hell maybe even a Martin twin if the stars are aligned) to go to work."
"Sick, Devonte Graham with ice in his viens"
DEVONTE GRAHAM IS YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER'S FAVORITE PLAYER
"He's still pretty good...has a 6-1 A/TO ratio....  ""Not nearly as flashy, but Devonte' Graham has been producing for Charlotte. He leads the team in assists with 6.2 while giving the ball away only 1.4 times. The Hornets suffer a huge drop-off when Graham is off the court, as they have a minus-12.2 net rating with him off and a plus-3.2 with him on. No other Hornet has nearly as big of a swing.  Until Ball becomes more trustworthy with the rock, Graham is their best option at point guard to continue winning games.""  https://www.bleacherreport.com/articles/2929200-nba-power-rankings-lakers-fall-from-top-3-philadelphia-76ers-take-top-spot"
Is anyone really aspiring to be the wolves front office? Lamelo has also just shown more so far he has literally been the main reason for some of their wins.   At least GS have Wiseman a shot at the starting spot. Hornets got devonte graham in over him isn't he on an expiring are they really gonna resign him while having Terry and lamelo plus Hayward is a ball handler.
"Draymond and Lonzo straight up would not work in a halfcourt set. Sure you can put five passers on the floor if you want but it won't mean anything unless some can score effectively. The 2x or 3x playmaker lineups work if they can also score. Golden State would be insanely easy to defend if you had both of Draymond and Lonzo passing up open shots all the time.  Melo seems to have enough of a scorer's mentality for that kinda thing to work, and so far it has, as he regularly shares the floor with Devonte' Graham, another guy who is a playmaker first but also a guy who's not afraid to put it in the air. Lonzo doesn't appear to be that guy at all."
"You could have just typed "" I don't know shit about the Hornets"" and could have been done with it instead wasting a paragraph writing about something you clearly are not informed about   Graham is undersized, but he isn't a fucking traffic cone on D. Devonte' also ain't streaky, his shooting has picked up after a shit start. Defenses respect his shot more than Lonzo's bum ass which opens the floor. Devonte' also is a far better half court operator and pick and roll player. He's more confident and doesn't shy away unlike Lonzo. He also has one of the best AST:TO ratios in the whole league at 4.42   Lonzo is literally only better as a defender and, nothing, and I mean nothing else    Just go fullfill your weird ass Chino Hills fantasy on 2k instead"
"Narrative wins awards, devonte graham had the largest ppg increase for his 2nd season since wilt iirc and he didn’t win MiP, also did you not see melo vs the bucks last night? And also the betting odds are the most nuanced because they lose money if they’re wrong and melo isn’t a slight favorite he’s -145 that’s is mighty risks odds on them for just going his shooting improves"
Devonte Graham is the man!

Devonte' Graham for sure. It's like half the sub forgot he was good but streaky last year.

"A lot of hornets fans, James borrego included, seem to have Stockholm syndrome with devonte graham who has been shooting like 36% his entire career. Apparently he’s been in a slump this year, but I’d argue he’s been a “slump” his entire career. Free melo"
"- On-off differential of the entire NBA, Devonte Graham is 98th percentile in the entire NBA, mainly because of defensive on/off. Hornets are +20.4 points better defensively per 100 possessions when he's on the court: https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/players?stat_category=onoff_efficiency - On/off differentials of Charlotte's players. LaMelo Ball is worst on the team, Devonte Graham is best on the team. Particularly on defense, the Hornets are -10.8 points per 100 possessions worse with LaMelo on the court: https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/4/onoff#tab-team_efficiency - FiveThirtyEight's model that looks at on-off data along with player tracking data, LaMelo is worst on the team defensively, Devonte is best: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/"
"One thing that sticks out when I look at the Hornets is that they have a laughably bad defensive with LaMelo on the court. With LaMelo on the court, they are 11 points worse per 100 possessions on defense.   Devonte Graham actually has the highest on-off DRTG differential in the league - suggesting that his backup (LaMelo) could be toxic on defense.   This matches up with the eye test and the general consensus of LaMelo's defensive impact. LaMelo is young and it's probably not that problematic for his future. But it's worth considering that his defense might currently be really destructive to the team."
"I'm a big fan of LaMelo, he's #1 or #2 in my redraft next to Haliburton, and I'm not even that high on Devonte Graham.   But I think benching LaMelo is defensible (as is starting him and playing him 35mpg). I trust Borrego is a rational thinker who is making decisions in good faith."
I’d kill for Devonte Graham right now
DeVonte Graham numbers
Yep he was a beast on offense. Was cooking our smaller wings and was very aggressive. Too bad devonte Graham had like 2 pts in the second half and Terry rozier had 0 in the first and lamelo ball had 5 turnovers with the game's worst -15
Well in first half honestly 1.10meter Curry Devonte Graham cooked us not him
"Just a cursory glance through the Knicks games proves that isn’t really the case. Against the Jazz, Conley shot 0-6, Mitchell shot 2-10, Bojan shot 1-7, those are all good shooters. Guys like Devonte Graham and Kemba Walker have been hardcore bricking and the only case of a bad shooter taking an inordinate of shots is maybe Paul Milsap if you count him."
"I was gonna say, I would drive Devonte Graham to New Orleans if I was a Charlotte fan."
"Didn't realize he was only 22 / year 3. Looking down the list into the late 2nd round, this was a damn good draft. Shake Milton, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr."
Lonzo for Devonte Graham? Would that be something you’d do

"Westbrook doesn't qualify because he's not shooting enough 3's (this is actually a good thing, considering he shoots 30%).   But comparing him to them doesn't do them right. When it comes to TS% Westbrook is #180 out of 185, with an astonishingly low 44.9 TS%; It's really unusual for a player that has such a high usage to have this low efficiency. The other players around him are players like Ish Smith, Devonte' Graham, Kelly Oubre, etc. that use a lot less possessions than he does, so the total effect of their inefficiency is much smaller.  To have a player use star-level number of possessions with scrub level efficiency is practically unheard of."

Also, on average Wiseman has fouled out.  Besides, instead of only saying ""these guys would be putting up Luka numbers if they played more,"" one should also ask, ""if these guys are as good as Luka, why wouldn't they be getting played more?""  Would Luka or Ben be languishing behind Devonte Graham in the guard rotation?  Would the Warriors pass up the chance to play KAT 25 or 30 minutes a game?  Sometimes the status quo is dumb, but a lot of times things are the way they are for a reason.  That said, I don't think this really means anything.  Players don't actually scale to their per-36 numbers with more minutes.  Rookies often get drastically better over a season, or hit a wall partway through.  The rookies coming off the bench are spending less time against opposing starters.  No one got training camp this year.  None of these stats show Simmons' defense and as little offensive data as we have on this year's rookies, we have even less on defense - nothing but the eye test.  13 games in, it's all total guesswork."
Devonte Graham would like a word.  47% would be like double his numbers lol
NBA.com must calculate DWS weirdly because Basketball Reference has Devonte Graham as only having 0.4 DWS (57th in the league)
"We had the 28th pick in 2018, and the 28th and 41st pick in 2019.   In 2018, we picked Evans (28) who was a bust. Missed out on MitchRob, Devonte Graham, and Trent Jr in 2018, but so did everyone else.  In 2019, we picked Poole (28) who it's too early to say anything about, and Paschall (41) who made all rookie first team. We also traded 2nd rounders to get Smailagic (39) in 2019, which hasn't really paid off. Nobody notable who we passed on except Keldon Johnson who looks pretty good for the Spurs  Wiseman will be the first true test of our FO. We'll see how it turns out"
Joe Harris isn’t better than them but he’s a plus defender for sure. People underrate him on that side all the time   Weird to call him out when Devonte Graham is literally #1

"They lost Gasol AND Ibaka. Meanwhile, those two have become the primary centers for both LA teams. Boucher has stepped up impressively (still mad we let him walk away from SeaDubs without a contract, along with Devonte Graham and Kendrick Nunn), but their only true center Aron Baynes understandably pails in comparison this far.  The reason Wiseman only played like 10 minutes is because the Raptors didn’t play an actual center the entire second half.  EDIT: they also gave Alex Len, both he and Baynes received a DNP-CD 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Jerami Grant   Devonte' Graham
"Devonte' Graham was never about opposition tape ""figuring him out"", he just stopped hitting pull up 3s at an insane rate that was likely only due to small sample size volatility in the first place."
"Thanks dude, glad you liked the write up. Also this post finally helped me realise why coach Borengo is still starting Devonte Graham.       Despite his poor shooting, of 74 players this season with at least 30 assists, Devonte is first in the league for assist to turnover ratio at an otherworldly 5.91:1. I still think LaMelo should get the start eventually tho and he's super exciting to watch play."
I watched a few Hornets games last season when Graham was going off. And I knew Hayward would be perfect for them since it was clear they needed a scoring wing. When Terry or Graham wasn't scoring there was no offense at all. Devonte is playing like trash but Hayward is winning them games regardless.
"It’s really down to Devonte' Graham who the coach sees as safer this being his 3rd year but his shooting is .274 FG and .310 3P. Graham is better defensively and probably better integrated coach wise but his offence is statistically awful. As bad a Ball’s first few weeks awful.   He might get the boot to the bench soon but the coach might take some slack, it’s safer starting older players and then letting rooks play longer."
"Devonte Graham, Terry Rozier, Gordan Hayward, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, Bismack Biyombo, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Malik Monk, Jalen McDaniels, Cody Zeller"
Quite a battle [for that last spot between reddish and devonte Graham can cam reddish average more made FGs off drives than TOs](https://go.nba.com/wx4j) stay tuned
Steve Kerr is doing the exact same thing fucking James borrego is doing with devonte graham
I like how he just daps up Devonte Graham right after lol
"the hope is that Collins would help us get to the playoffs this year/next year.  A lot rides on Devonte breaking out of his slump, but a Graham/Rozier/Hayward/Bridges/Collins starting 5 is quite solid."

Devonte Graham has 80 on 99 shots
Devonte graham LOL
"I just don't understand the big deal as to why you can't discuss him without being honest about it. I look at Hornets fans with Devonte Graham, they like him, MIP candidate last yr, bucket getter, but he's inefficient as fuck yet they can admit it freely. I've just never in my life seen fans say ""oh he was just probably really gassed"" as much as Ive seen them say it about Levert. Like this guy is in his 5th or 6th year, he's played and started in plenty of games, how is he was gassed still a thing people use to defend him? He's been inefficient his entire career but ppl still want to defend him like it's just a cold stretch he's going through. His entire career is a cold stretch tho lol, whatever I digress I just don't get it. Hes still a really good player but i just like, I just can't help but laugh when I see someone say, oh he was playing heavy mins the second half, he was shouldering the load on offense. Wow I can't believe no other player has ever had to deal with that lol"
Devonte Graham has a negative TS
"so far it's Devonte' Graham and it's not all that close. I'm sure he'll pick it up though, he's playing the exact same way as last year, just no shots are falling... which is problematic to say the least"
Devonte Graham is horrible

Exactly how I feel about Devonte' Graham. Except Graham does this every game.
First of all Devonte isnt trash.   But I do think a decision needs to be made on the Rozier and Graham backcourt.   It doesnt have to be Melo.
James Borrego stop playing with me man. Devonte Graham was 2-14 with 39 minutes.
Why is devonte graham starting over lamelo? Graham has been playing like utter doodoo
LaMelo  PJ Washington   Miles Bridges  Jalen McDaniels  Terry Rozier  Devonte Graham  Cody Zeller
"All the haters are going to downvote this, but LaMelo Ball is the correct answer.  We're 7 games in and he's already displaced Devonte Graham in the lineup.  That Ball Boy Coming."
Surprise: Julius Randle Disappointment: Devonte Graham
Gary Trent &gt; Devonte Graham and Divincenzo
"Mitchell Robinson, Divincenzo, and Devonte' Graham can probably be added with a chance of Gary Trent and Wendell Carter as well."
"Except we've actually been better with Graham on the floor despite his bad shooting.  [link](https://www.atthehive.com/2021/1/4/22212699/its-time-for-the-charlotte-hornets-to-shake-up-the-lineup-lamelo-ball-devonte-graham)  I know the inclination is to start Ball because he's flashy and DeVonte has been shooting like ass, but we're still better with him on the floor. If he starts shooting worth a fuck, the difference will be even greater. I know it'll be LaMelo's starting job at some point, but I don't think that time is right now despite Graham playing like ass."
lol Devonte Graham
Devonte Graham is horrible lol

"You think arguably the greatest player of all time wouldn't practice more on his 3-pt shot in the most 3-happy era in the game's history?   During the shortened 3-pt line era he averaged 40.4% on 3.3 3PA per game. You seriously think a foot of distance difference would be too much for Michael Jordan to overcome?   I'm not even claiming he'd be a ""great"" shooter either. I'm saying 37.5% on 8 attempts. Tim Hardaway Jr. is shooting 37.8% on 7.4 3PA per game. Devonte Graham shot 37.3% on 9.3 3PA last year. Terrence Ross shot 38.3% on 7.0 3PA two years ago. D-Lo has averaged 36.8% on 8.4 3PA over the past three seasons.  You're telling me these guys are better shooters than Jordan? That he can't do what they're doing at the very least, if not better?  It makes less sense to assume he wouldn't practice more, he wouldn't focus more on it, and that he wouldn't be a slightly above average 3-pt shooter if he played in this era.   The 3-pt average since he's retired has been right around 35-36%. Jordan isn't capable of that?"
Devonte Graham sweating bullets right now
Devonte Graham
"Hornets could make a Fournier-for-Graham-swap (with salary added, maybe Zeller) and even get a little something in the deal, as long as Orlando wants Devonte (restricted free agent this off-season), which I think they should, since point guard scoring has been a weakness of theirs for years."
"I believe the Vuc rumor, not the Fournier rumor. I'm not sure what purpose Fournier serves when you already have Terry Rozier, Devonte' Graham, Malik Monk with that same kind of skillset. We need a center and a bigger defensive wing.  Also, as bad as it sounds, we are like 0 for 3 on acquiring French veterans in their primes. It never works out for us lol. 0-4 if you include drafting Alexis Ajinca in the first round in 08."
"Generally speaking, once Kupchak was hired we started cutting losses from the end of the Bobcats-early Hornets 2.0 era and started drafting a lot better. We didn’t have much to build on and our picks were still in the 9-12 range for the several drafts before last year’s. We let Kemba walk in free agency, along with MKG, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, etc, as all were kinda one side of the ball limited players.   Kupchak has drafted Miles Bridges (12th), Devonte’ Graham (35th), PJ Washington (12th), and LaMelo (2nd). We’ve picked up Cody and Caleb Martin, and Jalen McDaniels as second rounders or undrafted free agents with some potential. We got Terry Rozier in a sign and trade with Boston when Kemba left and the contract was considered iffy, but he’s definitely lived up to it. We also signed Hayward this offseason with a similar reaction from the league and he’s still got a ways to go to earn it, but so far, so good. Only Malik Monk and Cody Zeller remain from the pre-Kupchak era and we brought Bismack Biyombo back.   We’re still kinda straddling building for the future and winning now, but the general consensus is that we’re young and competitive with potential to internally improve. We still need a solid big man or three, but otherwise we’ve got a pretty solid roster for now and the future."
Not when Charlotte could offer Devonte Graham and PJ Washington
Me and someone on here came up with a Josh Richardson for Seth curry fake trade like 12 hours before it happened on here lol but I didn’t actually think he would be available either   Would you do either of these   Thybulle mike Scott and whatever other matching salary for Patty Mills  Thybulle and a 2nd round pick or two for Devonte Graham
Terry was ASS in Boston aside from that purple patch in the 2018 playoffs. We're very lucky he completely reinvented himself. Devonte' Graham blowing up last year and forcing Rozier to be an off the ball shooter is the best thing that could have happened to him.
"look, I get it, you're missing key players, but every team does, especially this season.  Hornets were missing Gordon, Devonte Graham and Cody Zeller (3 starters) through most of this road trip."
"6th man should be Devonte Graham lol. Terrible boxscore stats, but his advanced stats/ratings even on defense are weirdly great."
"People seem to think you're only allowed to have two good guards on the roster and that we'd willingly let Devonte' Graham or Malik Monk walk away in RFA.   It's good to have depth, Devonte' has already said he's cool coming off the bench behind LaMelo and Terry, Monk has been excelling as a scoring spark plug, and some of our best offense comes when two of Graham/Monk/Terry are out there with LaMelo."
"WTH with this nonsense.   First off, Terry is playing shooting guard, not PG. This has made all the difference for him. Big credit to him and the coaching staff for helping him evolve into an elite and \*efficient\* shotmaker.   Second, Terry is playing below average defense. His reputation as a tough defender has followed him, but he is inconsistent on ball, and consistently misplaced off ball.   Third, everyone knows this wasn't Terry for Kemba. It was the Hornets failing to find a good trade for Kemba when they knew they wouldn't be able to (or want to?) resign him. This was a sign Kemba, then, ok here we'll do a sign and trade let's make something work.   Fourth, it was a (calculated) overpay at the time. Some say it's because the Suns targeted Terry (who honestly would have been a nice fit alongside Booker). For those who foresaw Terry improving this much, not to mention the emergence of Devonte Graham last year to take over PG alongside him, credit to you, not discredit to those who dared doubt the gambling overpay. That said, Terry Rozier is a badass and I'm glad to have him.  Fifth, Kemba went to the Celtics, and now he is injury prone. This is part of the Curse of Isaiah Thomas (see also Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving) and what they get for cutting a dude who gave his heart, soul and body to that team in one of the NBA's most legendary single-season performances, but had the nerve to get hurt while playing on a shitty contract. They should have resigned and rehabbed him, but they dumped him on the street for Kyrie. Endure it, Ainge."
"I think he cares a lot more now that he's in the NBA. Like going to the Illawarra Hawks was so he could ball out and get drafted to the NBA, and now that LaMelo is in the NBA, he's he's getting better coaching and he has better teammates around him. I think the most underrated part of this Hornet's team is their collective playmaking abilities. I mean LaMelo is already showing the potential to be one of the best playmakers in the league and Hayward and Devonte Graham are actually like good playmakers as well. Charlotte really was the best realistic landing spot for LaMelo."
"&gt; Actually the guys you mentioned all have relatively lower Defensive FGA per game.   Sure, but that's completely unrelated to the point I made that, on a fundamental level, this stat has significant blind spots as far as capturing good on-ball defense. The sample size won't affect whether a stat is fundamentally unreliable at capturing a certain quality of the game.  Also, cutoff of 10 is completely arbitrary. Why not 8? That way Carmelo and Devonte Graham make it in, and neither of them are ""exceptional"" on-ball defenders. Why not 12? Because Lavine would miss out. It's not like passing the 10 FGA mark suddenly makes the statistic way more meaningful and useful.  &gt; DFG% has historically been used to measure on-ball defense.  By who? In my experience, it's historically been accepted that reliable defensive stats don't really exist because they have so many blind spots considering how complicated defense is.  Again, I'm not doubting that Lavine has improved. It's just that the logic and narrative force of this post and subsequent comments reek of confirmation bias, and seem unwilling to acknowledge the blind spots of DFG% in favor of framing it as some objective measure of on-ball defensive prowess, when that's not the case."
"Kansas  PG: Devonte’ Graham  SG: Oubre Jr, Ben McLemore  SF: Wiggins, Josh Jackson, Svi  PF: The Morris Twins  C: Embiid  The starters look good, but the bench would be awful. There are also 2 Kansas rookies this year that play PG and Center so they could fill out the roster there, but they’ve mostly just sat on the bench all year."
He also was strangely beefing with an injured Devonte graham on the bench
What about Devonte Graham?
"I’d honestly be down to explore Horford as an option   Barnes seems to be the main target within the Cs subreddit but some other names tossed around    Terrence Ross, Devonte Graham, Alec Burkes, George Hill, Patty Mills, Danuel House, Wayne Ellington, Thad Young, PJ Tucker   pretty slim pickings tbh"
Zubac for Devonte Graham. Who says no?
"Holy shit those have to be the worst stats I've ever seen in my life lmfao.  The first one has Lamelo Ball above Kawhi leonard and Kyle Kuzma above Ben Simmons.  The other one has CJ Mccollum at 11, which is laughably stupid, and Devonte Graham at 9."
No one wants to watch Devonte Graham with a green light
"RPM also has Devonte Graham 14th, ahead of Kawhi, KD, AD, Kyrie, Gobert, Beal, CP3, etc.  Just so you know it isn't just that one outlier, Lonzo is 16th, Patty Mills 24th, PatBev 33rd, Cam Payne 34th, and Muscala 37th.  RPM is fucked and nobody uses it anymore."
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"&gt;Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he’s playing just isn’t logical. He’s in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  Except what happens when someone offers him 20 mill, you willing to match that? Because I'm still not, as much as I love Fred, Norm, OG and Siakam, that core taking up pretty much the entire cap is not a recipe for a championship.  &gt;We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  Except we do, everyone saw the Woj tweet and were like ""see he didn't do anything wrong"" but he actually had a plea deal to drop the charges, he still very likely did what he was charged with.  &gt;Even then we’re comparing two players who don’t necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  wtf? You are way overrating Zubac man, come on. He can play decent interior defense and catch lobs, that's it, Maxey is a rookie who has shown flashes of shot creation, which is hard to find in the league.  &gt;The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  Where? I gave you a ton of options that give you what Zubac can do, most of them would be cheap, a player that young and showing promise like him is not cheap, that's literally why they were so hesitant to trade him for fucking James Harden.  &gt;The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Schroeder I'll give you, except he'll most likely get 15 mill, Lonzo is an RFA, you are going to overpay to get him, Graham too, but go off.  &gt; trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird.  dude, like I said, you are overrating the shit out of Zubac, one of these players was the breaking point of a Harden trade, one of these players was dumped for no reason, which one is more valuable/talented? Idk you tell me"
"&gt;it's almost like Norm might be gone next season, and would not be surprised if we just don't bring TD back.  Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he’s playing just isn’t logical. He’s in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  &gt;I was specifically talking about a Lowry trade, give me talent over fit 100%, we are not in win now mode, especially if we are trading Lowry, missing out on Maxey + a first most likely just because Zubac is a center would be the worst thing you could do.   Even then we’re comparing two players who don’t necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  &gt;You can find exactly what Zubac does in the 2nd round of a draft.   The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  &gt;You could go pick up Holmes as a FA. You can just take the salary filler that you get from a Lowry to Sixers trade and go get Mo Bamba or Birch, or Whiteside.  The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Lmao @ Whiteside.  I get our fanbase has a weirdo hate boner for the Clippers because you think they “stole” our players, but taking worse fitting packages and trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird."
"Ojeleye is proooobably a better call, but he still can't do anything on offense and isn't anything special on D.  There's really not a single killer lineup the Cs can field, which is probably why they're so mediocre lol.  Smart will help but he is not going to fix everything -- the team is just not going to be good if Kembas essentially a smaller Devonte Graham"
So what happened to Devonte Graham?  Did he regress?
"Well... That's easy to say in hindsight but his first stretch games last season backed up basically everything we feared would be wrong. He was brought in to be a starting point guard, something he is still terrible at.   He took off once he was mostly moved off the ball by the emergence Devonte' Graham and then completely off of it by LaMelo. I couldn't be happier about how it has worked out but he has completely transformed his game over the last couple years. He is absolutely nothing like the player we signed a year and a half ago, and thank god for that."
"Lmao I was just joking, the draft really is deep as hell. Didnt mean to try and undermine your opinion. Like shake milton, mitchell robinson, hamidou diallo, jalen brunson and devonte graham all drafted in the second round is a great pool of talent to choose from. Could be they are in situations good for them, but the skill and potential between all of them is amazing."

Should trade him to Hornets for Devonte Graham and some other pieces or picks. Graham can maybe bounce back in NO. Maybe send Zeller for Drummond who wouldn't get tempted to handle the ball with 4 other playmakers. Hornets have some young ok but not great prospects and mid firsts they can send out. A Lonzo trade seems more about finding a trade partner who highly values him then getting a specific piece back. Main purpose is to make the Hornets entertaining which seems like Jordans main concern.
"Donte is cheaper and has potential. Brook is a big that you need  More minutes for Devonte Graham and Lamelo Ball.  Better fit  Graham-Ball-Hayward-PJ-Brook with DD, Monk, Bridges, and Zeller off the bench."
Devonte graham has been pretty bad from what I’ve watched. I remember him getting a lot of buzz last year.   Also Cedi has been just awful for us
"Hornets 8:  LaMelo, PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, Gordon Hayward, Malik Monk, Devonte Graham, Rozier, Zeller"
"2018 2nd round draft is panning out pretty fantastic; Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr, Hamidou Diallo, De’Anthony Melton and Shake Milton. Most of these guys are going to make a nice chunk of change this offseason."
Devonte Graham wya
Devonte Graham is the 2nd rated PG according to DRPM so I don’t put much weight into that or other defensive metrics. They’re rarely that useful for evaluating individual defense.
"Ok, but this is all just a discussion of *scheme*. Rudy could be the most switchable defender in the NBA, but if he doesn't play on a team with a personnel that will facilitate him switching, then he won't switch. And when you look at the Jazz there are *maybe* two players in the rotation who could regularly switch onto Rudy's guy? The problem with Rudy in a switching defense isn't Rudy, it's the fact that *everyone else on his team is so much smaller than him* and can't replace the defensive presence he brings to the paint, where he's regularly asked to defend two or three guys at a time - and does so successfully. The Jazz have a lot of decent-to-great wing defenders (Bogdanovic, Ingles, O'Neale, Niang is a pretty solid rotation defensively), but *none* of those guys are equipped to protect the rim or seriously guard the five. And Conley and Mitchell shouldn't be guarding wing players at their size. Clarkson is a defensive liability.  Rudy *can* switch onto elite guards. He just *doesn't*, because if he switches onto elite guards, the Jazz don't have the defensive personnel to support him switching. Apart from Gobert, the Jazz are a pretty small team; their starting PF is only 6'4"". This is the reason why Gobert's defensive numbers in the clutch are [so fucking astronomical](https://www.ksl.com/article/46705809/rudy-gobert-has-been-the-leagues-best-clutch-player--another-reason-he-should-be-an-all-star); because those are the only time that coach Q says ""Hey Rudy, I'm putting you on their best guy"". Because when crunch time happens and everything is on the line, you'd rather lose to Derrick Jones Jr. or Daniel Theis than Dame or Tatum. [Just look at this play here](https://twitter.com/Chase_Observes/status/1210481904085950464?s=20): Dame has the ball with about 20 seconds left; Gobert is his primary defender, he runs Dame off the line, forces a pass out, and then the ball ends up in Melo's hands, which Gobert swats out of the air. The numbers back this up too - in the last two seasons, [Gobert has averaged 0.73 points per attempt on isolation attempts by guards](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208811329873530880) in switches, and that doesn't even capture the amount of times where a guard attempt an iso against Gobert and then thinks better of it and wisely ditches that idea instead.   But just to throw you a bone, here are a few clips of Rudy guarding players on the perimeter and generally doing a good job, in case the numbers aren't good enough for you.  [Rudy on Malcolm Brogdon](https://twitter.com/dsjenson/status/1219486493518913536?s=20)  [Rudy swatting Trae's iso attempt](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1208051219056300033?s=20).  [This play where he recovers from Austin Rivers' crossover and then fucking sends him to the shadow realm](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1222233799729147904?s=20)  [Rudy Gobert stopping an iso attempt by Devonte Graham](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208810396787695616?s=20)  The problem isn't Rudy. The problem is that when Rudy leaves the paint, the entire defensive scheme collapses because Utah's scheme is built on two things: running guys off the 3pt line, and funneling them towards Rudy in the paint because he's basically the one of the greatest rim protectors that basketball has ever seen. And if he's not in the paint, there's nobody to rebound, there's nobody to box out, there's nobody to contest at the rim, which means that if a guy manages to get past his man (this will happen, sometimes Bogdanovic just gets cooked, or Mitchell has a defensive lapse), it's a free two points. And if Rudy leaves the paint, then the Jazz can't be as aggressive in closing out on 3's, because if they sell out too hard to contest, their guy will just drive to the rim and all of Utah will just have to pray that they blow a wide-open layup.  In essence, if the Jazz switch Rudy onto a perimeter guy, they're giving up a thousand free looks at the basket in order to shut down one guy from scoring. Sometimes, that's the right play to make. But for 99% of the game, it's way better to let Rudy camp in the paint and do the thing he's better at doing than basically anyone else in NBA history. Make people shit their pants when they get past their man, then put up an inefficient floater or fadeaway 2."
Yeah it’s tough Philly needs another half court creator/organizer but it’s also  hard to find someone who’ll do that in a way that can really make a difference after the first round it’s not like a defensive big or 3+D wing. Lowry is the dream but I think requires giving up Maxey   Otto Porter is someone I like but his salary is pretty damn big to match in a trade. Eric Gordon might be another option but he’s risky with that contract and both these guys don’t offer anything for playmaking. If Charlotte doesn’t want to pay devonte Graham that might be someone I ask about but idk haven’t heard any buzz about him being potentially available
"Forreal. LaMelo might already be better. plus it's not like LaMelo is out here dominating the ball. He's playing next to Gordan Hayward, Terry Rozier, and Devonte Graham."
Melo and Devonte’ Graham?
"Dawg he’s played like 10 NBA games. Do you seriously not see how disrespectful it is to put him above Tatum  and Donovan, two guys who’ve been LEADING franchises too the playoffs since they where rookies. Tatum went head to head with Lebron in the ECF as a rookie.   Lamelo is the third leading scorer on a mediocre team that has no superstars, and no other player who’s going to even make an all star game anytime soon.... and both Malik Monk and Devonte Graham are only a single 3 pointer per game away from averaging more than Melo as well.   Melo - 15.9 ppg - 5.9 reb - 6.1 ast - 1.6 stl   Graham - 13.9 ppg - 2.8 reb - 5.1 ast - 1.1 stl   Graham isn’t even on the list and his numbers aren’t far off from Melo’s.   Putting Melo ahead of Mitch, Tatum, Simmons, Booker, Bam, Murray just feels wrong to me"
Devonte Graham and Moist Monk
"Yeah Ive been saying for a while now they got lucky with what's frankly a donation from Minnesota with that pick this year in that hideous D'Lo trade for them. Because otherwise this has not been the most well run franchise from a roster building/talent management perspective for a while.   Danuel House, Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang all once on the roster and got waived.   Havent made good use of things like the MLE in the past. Nick Young was useless in 2018. Omri Casspi did dick and pissed everybody off in the process. You can do this with every team I get it...but when the roster is flawed then you cant not look at it.   2019: Select Jordan Poole. The following 3 picks were Keldon Johnson, KPJ and Nic Claxton. 2018: Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent all within 10 picks. 2016: Damian Jones at 30: Following guys went within 10 picks: Ivica Zubac, Malcolm Brogdon  Dont want to relitigate the LaMelo thing, but if the ""fit"" concerns truly played a meaningful role in passing up on him that's not a justifiable process. Only pick I think theyve gotten any kind of value on of the past 5 yrs is Paschall  Last night just felt like Lou Will basically made every key play in the 4th quarter at particular key times. 3 point lead [hits Okongwu on the roll](https://go.nba.com/w5xg). Next play [pull up](https://go.nba.com/i7xn). Next play [baits JTS 3 shots](https://go.nba.com/rpuu). Gallo then the next few minutes decides to smartly do all his foul baiting and drawing before Steph is set to step back in on the next whistle. Then it's back to Lou [pass to Bogdan for 3](https://go.nba.com/nzqb). That entire early 4th quarter stretch felt like swung the game [this one in particular was a killer right before Steph is set to get back in](https://go.nba.com/uu34) you could feel it at the time. Breakdown defensively, Draymond doesnt want to leave the paint because of the Capela roll threat, think he wanted Wiggins to ""X-out"" where Draymond then wouldve taken Snell. [2 more for good count](https://go.nba.com/vxkb) from Lou [this I think was the other play that swung the game](https://go.nba.com/37ok)."

"Agreed, I don’t think Zach should win it this year for that reason, but I wouldn’t put it past the writers who gave it to Luka over Devonte’ Graham even though Luka was clearly special immediately as a rookie and made an expected 2nd year leap"
"Luka didn't win, he just said Devonte Graham should have gotten his finalist spot."
"you cant just use DRAPM and base someones entire defensive ability off that lmao what. devonte fucking graham is like 5th in the league rn in that stat, do you think hes the 5th best defender or even close??"
"yah lol. it is so easy to defend the pnr when it was Biz. He's a slow roller and hands made of concrete slab, he either dropped back immediately or even if he defended the ball handler while the smaller guy was getting through the screen, Biz is just so slow and fumble prone LMA could recover quickly enough it didn't matter.  LMA was brought in so he could defend against guys like Embiid while still being an offensive threat. Let's see how it pans out. But against a Devonte Graham/Biz PnR, LMA looked like DPOY out there."

devonte graham
Anyone notice Devonte' Graham asking for the T on Westbrook?
"Easily, especially with Terry and Devonte Graham playing really well"
"ty lue   (also: devonte graham, jerami grant)"

"I can't believe the Suns found a way to win with CP3 and Jae having bad games, having no production from the bench (aside of Craig), and shooting 20% from 3 against a pretty competitive team in Charlotte.   My takeaways:  - Charlotte wins this game in regulation if they hit their FTs, the sign of a young team. They're right in the middle of the pack right now in team FT%, if they get that up to 80%+, they're going to start closing out games.   - Devonte' Graham went nuclear on us. He hit some shots yesterday that I couldn't believed, with Mikal Bridges draped all over him. Gotta give it up to him for such a stellar performance.  - Defense travels. The Suns are a great defensive team with the best road record in the NBA. I believe that those two things go hand in hand. Mikal Bridges is an elite wing defender at this point that deserves All-Defense recognition. He has the perfect combination of length, basketball IQ, and an elite transition game. He is shooting 41% from 3 on decent volume, firmly placing him in the elite 3&amp;D tier. Eddie Johnson said it best last night: ""Every great team has a Mikal Bridges.""   - Charlotte got rooked by a combination of Booker/CP3 foul baiting and poor/inconsistent officiating. It's frustrating, but they did have an opportunity to win the game at the line. You can't turn the ball over 20 times and shoot less than 70% from the FT line and then expect to win.  - The Suns struggle with closing games comfortably, particularly against lesser competition. Last night, we saw Book iso on at least 3 consecutive possessions late in t he 4th. He took bad shots and Graham made us pay.   - Dario Saric is struggling. He is a vital cog in what makes our rotations work. When he's not playing well, you can tell because our production falls off of a cliff."
"Lonzo &gt; Graham &gt; Schröder, at least for this season. Schröder cant really shoot the 3 (outside of last year which was clearly an outlier season). He also averages ONE whole turnover more than Devonte, even though both of them are at 5 assists per game.  Even though grahams fg% is very low, their TS% is the same. Grahams attempts way more threes at a better % which helps his efficiency.  Advanced stats like RAPTOR also have graham as the better player."

"First, you don’t need to use cap on one player. Devonte + a solid cheap player is better then Schroder. Schroder is also someone that wants to get his. No matter what. Unless there is a superstar in front of him, he is gonna score, no matter how many shots it takes.  It will just take away from everyone’s development whereas Graham would slide in easy."
"So a guy that is a bad 3 pt shooter for basically his entire career including this current one shoots a career high last year and you suddenly use that number to compare it to other people?   Schroder is a capable 3 point shooter but not a good one. Devonte is an actual 3 pt shooter. Aside from percentages, look at volume. Graham is also one of those 3 pt shooters that has a tendency to get hot and knock down 8 in a game. Not to mention he is also a better shooter off the dribble.  Not saying he is a better fit for the knicks but just simply addressing your take on shooting."

So who's paying Devonte Graham
Devonte Graham did and he wasn't even top 3
"There’s a number of moves we can make. Lonzo is a nice one but so is Devonte Graham who is balling right now and is criminally underpaid. Also Malik Monk I believe will be a FA too. There’s also lots of veteran guards that we can go after if we wanna do a Chris Paul/Suns type move, like Lowry. There’s a lot of flexibility for us and we can probably outbid most teams. Really like our position so far."
Devonte' Graham  Miles Bridges  198 other people
"Nets ain’t making the finals, they’re getting bounced by the Hornets. LaMelo coming back to lock up Kyrie, Devonte Graham gonna lock up Harden and Hayward is gonna lock up KD"
"&gt;It's very similar to the Dwight situation last year. Like I said if he can buy in and just be a DJ and not try and be hakeem he'd be a plus. But the ""wants to be a focal point"" that does not bode well.  Of course he can buy in,why do u think Dwight bought in? Do you think Dwight would have bought in if he was on idk the Timberwolves or Hornets last year?  I don’t know why you guys expect veterans to try and slot into a role on bad teams. This happens all the time and I don’t get why it shocks people when guys like Batum or Blake look like shit on bad teams and look good on actual good rosters, it’s not magic. When you ask these guys to come to a good roster and be the 7th most important player in a 9 man rotation rather than idk the #2 to Colin Sexton or Devonte Graham, veterans tend to excel."
"Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Devonte Graham. Maybe PJ Washington. I'd say the hornets have been more affected by injuries."
"Devonte Graham is the 4th guard on your team and you desperately need a center. His value has tanked this year and he's not going to magically get more playing time now that LaMelo hath arrived.  Noel and Graham are the same age, are both expiring, and the trade would fill a need for both teams. Graham isn't moving the needle for the Hornets or helping against elite teams either. In fact, he's been ridiculously inefficient this year.   Noel is better than Cody Zeller and Biyombo. He's a clear upgrade for the Hornets and has not been injured this season even with Thibs minutes."
How would you feel about  Nerlens Noel + Mavs 1st for Devonte Graham + CHA 2nd
"That should be a HUGE red flag to start. The idea that a top 5 defender from a season ago would have dropped off to one of the worst in the league this season should immediately be ringing alarm bells. If you watch him, he doesn't really seem to be worse defensively from last season and has actually looked more disruptive in passing lanes and more athletic overall.   RPM also has Devonte Graham as an elite defender this year, even ahead of AD, Embiid, Ben Simmons, and Giannis. RPM just gives really bad results compared to general consensus as well as the eye test, so it's generally wise to take anything RPM says with a grain of salt."
"7-10 in RPM are Devonte Graham, Mike Conley, Christian Wood, and Lonzo Ball. Even if it regularizes over time, 30 games is pretty solid sample size and none of those guys have been anywhere near Jokic, Dame, Durant, Irving, Kawhi, CP3, and Luka, who are all outside the top 10. RPM just seems like a pretty bad metric."
"This happened to Devonte Graham in college after a game.  I forget the word, but he had a lot more fun with it"
elite 3 point shooter  terrible 2 point shooter  rich man's Devonte' Graham
"Well, in terms of real difference makers that could actually propel them from a 2nd round exit to a championship caliber team, it's probably only Lowry, and as you said, they don't really have the assets to get him, maybe he could nudge the Raptors into trading him there.   Devonte Graham wouldn't be a bad fit though if the Hornets are willing to move on from him, he's better than Lou Will."
Devonte graham so efficient
"Well considering the Wolves have played some stupid small amount of games with their star D'Angelo Russell and KAT on the court at the same time and have had Ricky Rubio in the worst season of his career really Malik Beasley and Ant Man are the only hope outside of the two stars and no one plays defense rlly. The Hornets are so much of a better team lol, between having a healthy Hayward and the best contract in the league with Terry Rozier not to mention PJ Washington, Devonte Graham, very valuable young pieces that scream future starter in addition to Cody Zeller, Malik Monk, Miles Bridges all very valuable role players. Not to mention the Hornets have been mostly healthy for the entire year"
"i like Hill.. i just don't know if he can get in the paint and create, and i think that's what the clippers need  if i were them i'd try for like Devonte Graham"
"Yeah, he's started there alongside Devonte Graham at PG and Terry Rozier at SG, and those three are among our best on court trios."
"Helps that Hornets games have just been super fun overall. Malik Monk, Terry Rozier, and Devonte Graham can all light it up on any given night. The whole team tries insane passes every night as well, even when they maybe shouldn’t."
"Ah yes, the ever so reliable defensive advanced stats. The same ones that say Devonte’ Graham is a better defender than Joel Embiid."
Might be devonte graham but I hope not. I liked him a lot
Get center like theis who is switchable and can shoot.  Trade Adams and bledsoe  Get a decent spacing/playmaking point guard. Like devonte graham.  One more good Perimeter defender.
I don’t think devonte graham really counts as a “fantastic” pick.
hornets are kinda underrated:  Kemba - Shai - Tobi - Washington - Zeller  Bench: Lamelo - Monk - MKG - Vonleh - Kaminshy  Thats a hell of a backcourt but no depth for any forwards or centers lmao. Wouldn't be the best but at least they would be fun to watch.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: forgot Devonte graham if he counts yet another guard that can score
"In my eyes in the not distant future the team that have a lot of great pieces but not a experience coach, Charlotte, Michael hired kupchak and he draft well, and have a a couple of good free agents and a couple of good trades.  And look the roster having a future ROY in melo, and another great picks, pj Washington, devonte graham and miles bridges. Having a great players in a good age bracket, Gordon Hayward and scary terry, a couple of ok role players in Biyombo and Cody Zeller. And a great thing is that the team can improve a lot with a couple of trades for a couple of veterans. Good roster and ok management. A great job for a experience coach. Maybe I’m stretching things, but I really thing Melo can become a great player."
i was deadass at my first NBA game and a pandemic came through and ended that   Devonte Graham and Derrick Jones Jr are dirty af tho. American Airlines arena is awesome too
"Brunson is obvious, yeah? Mitchell Robinson seems obviously better. I'd rather have Devonte' Graham. Gary Trent is obvious. Bruce Brown seems obvious. I can see where you might not be a Jarred Vanderbilt guy, but I am. I love Melton. Hamidou Diallo is better. Shake is better. Duncan Robinson was part of that class and went undrafted. So were Kendrick Nunn and Jae'Sean Tate and Kenrich Williams."
"Its insane that THT is more efficient than Devonte Graham too, doesn’t he start for you guys too?"
"no, lonzo isn’t a guy who gets in the paint constantly and finds teammates, his handle isn’t good enough for that, and that’s what the clippers really need   i think devonte graham would be interesting for them"
Devonte Graham was starting at PG for 65% of the first half.. starting 35% of your team's games literally means you didn't start for the ENTIRETY of the games. Context is hard.

There is nothing more fun to watch for me in the NBA than Devonte Graham in the 4th quarter.
"Wiseman has more tools in his game but he’s like bad at most of them. And the one tool he’s sort of decent at, Gobert is far and away better.  You wouldn’t say that Devonte Graham is better than Prime Klay because Graham has more tools in his game."
RPM is utter garbage. Any stat that throws up as many nonsensical anomalies as that does isn't worth the paper it is written on. Can you honestly tell me Lonzo Ball is the 10th best player in the league? That Mike Conley is the 11th best and Devonte Graham rounds out the top 15? You need to reevaluate your methodology if that's what your metric is telling you...
"Well, no, from a win loss record I didn't expect much improvement.   Last year the Hornets had a completely unexpected boost with Devonte Graham and had a number of highly unlikely last second wins. I expected, even with Hayward, about a similar or maybe even worse record.  [Vegas Insider](https://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/odds/win-totals/) agrees with me: 25.5 wins expected.  In reality, the Hornets were 4th in the east before getting completely ravaged by injuries in March/April. And even still, they've surpassed their expected W/L record and are still in the playoffs."
"There are a ton of possible explanations as to why Devonte has a high on/off that aren't simply ""he's on the court."" You can't take a result and slap a cause on it when there are a bunch of variables that aren't constant. To insinuate that Graham is responsible for the defense being better when he is on is really just absurd.   The way you prove an advanced stat, which are usually some already known stats with an unknown equation slapped on them, is to show contentious ratings because at the end of the day these advanced metrics aren't provable as being useful.   Graham is very clearly not more impactful than Ben Simmons or Chris Paul or Kyrie or Luka and Devonte and Lonzo being ranked the 6th and 2nd best point guards in the league is quite clearly an indictment of the system. Pretty much every other advanced stat agrees that he's the fourth or fifth best player on the Hornets.   No advanced stats should be simply posted by themselves as proof of anything because they all have flaws, it just so happens that RPM has a lot more kinks than most of them."
"It's got some pretty obvious flaws just looking at players on the same teams.   First example I see looking at the charts is Donte DiVicenzo has a 2.27 RPM. Jrue's is a little bit over him at 2.49 and Khris is just underneath him at 1.96. It's hard to imagine how Donte is even roughly as impactful as the other two players.   Devonte Graham is at a 3.72 vs Scary Terry's 2.77 and Ball is at 1.15 and Hayward is at 1.13. I don't think anyone would consider Graham as significantly more impactful than the other players.   Joe Harris ranks above Kyrie but the really baffling part is that Harris is a negative in offense by this metric and just blows Kyrie out of the water defensively while Kyrie is good on offense and just barely positive in defense.   Outside of the realm of teammates, you have some very big ones. Lonzo is the 9th most impactful player. Duncan Robinson rates as a better shooting guard than Lavine and Brown and Spyda. Danny Green and Kyle Anderson are the 5th and 6th best small forwards by this metric.   This whole spiel just to say that it's a wonky stat that isn't trustworthy"
"Right because exactly the 31st pick is what i’m talking about. Just look at the 2018 draft, far back enough to evaluate whether these players are good and still relatively recent. In the 31-40 range, good young players like Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson were taken and rotation players like Bonga and Carter"
"“How impressive is Robinson’s accomplishment? No other player in NBA history has even made 400 threes in their first 152 regular-season games.  Behind Robinson, Hornets guard Devonte’ Graham is next on the list with 384 made three-pointers in his first 152 games. Then comes Doncic (379 threes), Atlanta’s Trae Young (378 threes) and Portland’s Damian Lillard (374 threes).”"
Strangely Pistol Pete went to the same high school as Lamelo’s teammate Devonte Graham
"Ok you sold me. KD is definitely top 100 in the NBA now. I got him slightly above Devonte Graham, showing him some respect as the GOAT bandwagoner"

Devonte Graham and Mitchell Robinson are lottery and you think Duncan Robinson is a reach?
Pretty good. I wouldn't have DeVonte Graham top 10 though.      I wouldn't take him before younger and more efficient guards such as Brunson or Melton.
"Mitchell Robinson is getting drafted after Miles Bridges, Duncan Robinson, Jalen Brunson, 100% of the time  edit: also Devonte Graham is going after the 3 guys i mentioned imo"

"there might be a lot of new blood in the playoffs this year. 12 members of the Hornets were drafted (or went undrafted and picked up) by Charlotte since the last time we made the playoffs in 2016, and have never played anywhere else.

Just wanted to say Devonte Graham still got robbed last year
Not many thought Devonte' Graham could make the leap that he did. I don't know if even Nikola Jokic thought he'd be at the level he is today. It's not unreasaonble to say that it's possible. Embiid is 26 and could be a totally different player by 29.  I agree that it's a very rare level to achieve but I don't think it's stupid to say Embiid *could* do it. The injuries are troublesome but it's not like he's 34 and didn't achieve anything yet.
RPM has Devonte Graham above Jokic if that's what you want me to say
"Graham vs rozier is all about the price tag, if you have to pay Devonte starter salary you let him walk because you have melo"
"What, like PER, where they’re separated by like 0.3, or RPM, that’s broken this year and has devonte graham as a borderline top 5 player in the NBA?  Jokic is leading all of the most respected ones. RAPTOR, EPM, Win Shares/48, BPM, LEBRON, etc."
"RPM is totally broken this year, it has devonte’ graham as a borderline top 5 player, Duncan Robinson as an elite defender and horrible offensive player, etc.   Look at more robust advanced stats like RAPTOR and EPM and Jokic is way better this season."
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
Whomever got hold of LeBrons DRPM last year did it to devonte Graham this year literally the 3rd best defender and 4th best player in the nba as of last week by that model lmao

Meanwhile Deni Avdija's worst outfit is...shorts and a t-shirt with a pair of white sneakers. So apparently the voters in this poll are both impressed and offended by the most basic shit you can wear pregame? Talk about schizophrenic.  3) Meanwhile one of the hardest to pull off outfits is...Deandre Ayton in...a denim jacket and jeans with a black shirt. Dudes come on that shit is so basic how can you not pull that off.  Or Cedi Osman in...a white jacket with a hoodie and skinny jeans. Like what?  4) Apparently LeBron James wearing a denim jacket and black jeans is...edgy? Ummm ok. Seems pretty basic to me.   5) Back to vibrancy. Josh Jackson is the most vibrant in the NBA rocking....a flannel shirt, beanie, black tee and black skinny jeans. Have these people ever been to Portland or Seattle or Brooklyn? Or like..any rural area? Jeans, tee, flannel and beanie isn't vibrant it's fucking basic fall clothing. Also apparently just wearing a bright hoodie with black pants makes you vibrant?   I gotta stop now but this shit is wack dudes."
"That 2018 draft is STACKED....  Luka, Trae, MPJ, Shai, Ayton     And then you have a ton of young talent such Bruce Brown, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Mikal Bridges, Wendell Carter, Sexton, Jaren Jackson, and even Marvin Bagley (still has time to develop and improve)."
"Man, I just looked through the draft, it's crazy deep, too.   Devonte' Graham and Gary Trent Jr were second rounders. Miles Bridges, Divincenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams.. the list goes on. There's probably nearly 30 guys that could legitimately have 10+ year careers assuming healthy. That's pretty wild."
"It'll be hard to pass 1984, but early returns say 2018 is already making a case to be the best draft ever. Ayton, Luka, Trae, MPJ could be equivalent to Hakeem, MJ, Stockton, and Barkley when it's all said and done.  Admittedly, passing those top 4 will be EXTREMELY tough to do by any metric, but aside from the star power, 1984 wasn't that deep, and 2018 is.  Alvin Robertson, Kevin Willis, and Otis Thorpe were the only other all-stars in 1984, but 2018 also has SGA, Mikal Bridges, Sexton, JJJ, Mitchell Robinson, DiVincenzo, Devonte Graham, Okogie, Grayson Allen, Anfernee Simons, TimeLord, Shamet, Brunson, Bruce Brown, and Huerter. Even Bagley too.  Now obviously not all of those guys will be all-stars, or even close, but if when it's all said and done and the 2018 core 4 end up close to 84, there will be WAY more overall production and amount of quality players from 2018.  To be in year 3 and already have 24 quality NBA players from one draft is just bonkers."
I would rather have Devonte Graham tbh. Lonzo is more money and is still a really bad finisher. Vonte is a playmaker and three point shooter for much cheaper  We can't tie our money up when Lonzo alone isn't gonna make us a contender and next year's FA class is huge and could make us a contender
"&gt;Couldnt tell you, saw it earlier in the year on this sub.  So, you once again can't provide evidence.  &gt;Just looking at some stats now, and devonte graham is 24th in defensive win shares. Rudy gobert is 9th in win shares for the whole league. Nikola vucevic is 14th in player impact estimate.

Maybe, your eye test isn't accurate and with context, box score, advanced stats and unbiased eye tests all put together, we can piece together a more accurate image?  Nope, your eye test is above all."

Devonte Graham
"Devonte' Graham, TJ McConnell, Patty Mills, to name a few."
"It might be more beneficial for him too. He might well not be getting the offers he was expecting after his year (extremely inconsistent, with some good but alot of bad), and signing a 1-year and being traded to a team that he could be more ball-dominant on could nab him a longer contract in the future.   Not sure if Charlotte would want to do it, but a sign and trade for someone like Devonte Graham or someone in that vein would go a long way for them."
I think they really did try to level up during the season with the addition of Ariza and Oladipo. Injuries and better coaching on the Bucks part have made a huge difference. I think having another scoring gaurd next to Jimmy would make a huge difference. They still have the chance to pick up Kyle Lowry this offseason or a scoring guard like Devonte Graham in a trade with Charlotte. My guess is that Pat knows how hard it is to run it back so he hedged his bets on keeping the young guys rather than mortgage them for a win now situation.

"2018 Draft had a lot of talent  1st Pick: DeAndre Ayton - Defensive anchor, future all star  2nd Pick: lolkangz  3rd Pick: Luka Doncic - HOF potential, Generational Talent, Perennial  MVP Candidate  4th Pick: JJJ - Solid Starter  5th Pick: Trae Young - HOF potential, Elite Scorer, Future scoring champ candidate  ...  8th pick: Collin Sexton - Future All Star Potential  ...  11th pick: SGA - Future All Star Potential  ...  14th pick: Michael Porter Jr - Future All Star Potential  ...  34th pick: Devonte Graham - Solid Starter"
"That was a loaded draft: Sexton, SGA, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges  And then Jevon Carter, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham ALL in the 2nd round"
"I respect your opinion but definitely disagree. Sure it would be better for college hoops if A-list players still wanted to play 4 years, but I think the sport is still intriguing and fun to watch even with a couple of the big powers (Duke and Kentucky primarily) being 1&amp;Done factories. I would certainly disagree that the NCAA hasn’t been “relevant” in decades, I’d say as recently as 2019 with Zion the NCAA was immensely relevant. Duke was all over SportsCenter and everywhere else. Plenty of good college teams are still built on the backs of numerous 4-year players. This year’s champ, Baylor, was an absolutely incredible squad that shot over 40% from deep *as a team* and featured 6 upperclassmen among their most prominent ~8 players, and no freshmen. I personally am a Kansas fan and though we’ve sent some 1&amp;Dones to the league (Josh Selby, Xavier Henry, Ben McLemore, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre, Josh Jackson come to mind), most of our actual best players over that time frame have been 3-4 year guys like Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Thomas Robinson, Tyshawn Taylor, Perry Ellis, Devonte’ Graham, and Frank Mason. Idk, it probably helps that I grew up a fan of a blue blood, but I love college hoops. I think if anything, what threatens the quality of the sport long-term is the newly relaxed transfer rules. I also have a hard time knocking them though because the kids deserve flexibility, but that will definitely threaten team continuity more than the 1&amp;Done trend."
1. Jimmer Fredette (hometown boy)  2. Kemba Walker  3. LaMelo Ball  4. Dirk Nowitzki   5. Kevin Love  6. Luka Doncic  7. Miles Bridges   8. Hakeem Olajuwon   9. Nikola Jokic    10. Devonte Graham
Cant take this shit award seriously since Devonte Graham didn’t even get a mention last year
the one without devonte graham
"I agree he definitely took the volume to another level, but Steph was doing more than heaves from back there by the time Dame started throwing them up.  I guess you could say Steph introduced the super deep three as a viable non-panic shot and Dame was the first to make it a super regular part of his game, but it’s a little murky imo. At worst, Dame is the dude who made it ok for people not named Curry to shoot them. Now you have guys like Devonte Graham throwing up 30 footers with 10 on the shot clock."

The Hornets are 9-6 when Lamelo starts but with Devonte Graham out.
Lakers should go after Devonte Graham then. Not a great defender but elite at catch and shoot. Also has a pretty decent assist to turnover ratio and won’t warrant a big contract like Schröder
"Oh, yeah, that is a good point about the cap holds.  Although maybe just let Hart walk then and keep Ball and I think team could have some space if it could trade Adams without taking back money (which is obviously a huge if).  Yeah, actually getting someone good in FA could be tough. DeVonte Graham might be moving in FA.  Malik Monk.  Duncan Robinson.  Talen Horton-Tucker.  Dennis Schroder.  Some slim pickings."

"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
There unfortunately aren’t a lot of guys who do that. Honestly I’d love to see a guy like Devonte Graham on the team to run point and move Jrue to the 2. Bucks are capped out though so we need Jrue to step up and he has not done that.
"Booker’s low assists are one thing. The issue is that hes consistently has a turnover problem in the past that hasn’t gone away despite not being the main playmaker. The only guy with at least 2.75 turnovers per game (he has 3.1) and the same or fewer assists per game is Embiid.   It’s just untrue to say all the things KAT’s better at is due to him being a center. Booker’s significantly worse from 3 for example and has been for years.  His advanced stats don’t just look bad compared to KAT’s or centers’, they look bad in general.   He has a negative bpm. Some of the guards above him who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard: Sexton, Reggie Jackson, Brunson, both Murrays, Devonte Graham, Haliburton, Clarkson, Fox, Brogdon, T.J., both Ball brothers, Kemba, Terry, Delon Wright, FVV, Jaylen, Westbrook, Beal, CJ, Mitchell, Jrue, and Conley.  His win shares per 48 is worse than qualifying  guards like CP3, Conley, Mitchell, Jrue, Trae, Brunson, CJ, PG, LaVine, Beal, Jamal, Lowry, TJ, Seth, Delon Wright, Jaylen, Reggie Jackson, Kemba, Clarkson, Connaughton, KCP, Rozier, Hardaway Jr., Brogdon, Campazzo and FVV.   Guys who played fewer games and still have a higher vorp include Kyrie, Russ, Zach, Beal, Jrue, Mitchell, Conley, Jaylen, CJ, Terry, FVV, Brogdon, Fox, Shai, Jamal, both Ball brothers, Kemba, Haliburton, Lowry, Cam Payne, and Thybulle.  There is no reason for Booker to do so poorly in advanced stats across the board on such a good team where other guys do well in advanced stats. Not to mention his advanced stats were still incredibly low when he was a first option."
"  Lou can effectively be their second point guard. I for one wouldn’t want another point guard eating trae’s minutes and stifle his growth.   If I were to look at a pass first point guard, looking at this weak free agency this off-season, I can only see them potentially signing Devonte graham and tj mcconnell for the MLE; or Jeff Teague for the minimum.   If Ricky Rubio gets waived, I think they should try to sign him."
"I think they target and can possibly land Devonte Graham, Richaun Holmes, Bobby Portis, Forbes and David Nwamba in FA. Try and use a S/T w/ lonzo and picks (maybe need 3rd team ~rockets?~) to get CJ away from the blazers"
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4.

"Yeah, in the same sense that Devonte' Graham does the same things as Damian Lillard.  They both run PnR and chuck 3's."
"Man I hope so, I’m so worried since he legit sold an early second that turned into Devonte Graham when our roster was empty."
"You forgot RFA Malik Monk on the Hornets list. Wanamaker is UFA.  Priority #1 should be getting a solid starter at C, or at least a young player with a good chance at being one. If trading for a good one requires pick #11 and/or Hayward going back the other way, do it. (*coughs Myles Turner's name*)  Priority #2 should be bringing back RFAs Malik Monk and Devonte' Graham. Anything under $15M a year should be an automatic match for either player. None of our other FAs except Zeller will receive more than a minimum offer elsewhere.   My ideal off-season is trading Hayward+#11 for Turner+Lamb, and having ~$15M to go after a SF in FA, or stay above the cap, re-sign Zeller as the backup C, and use the MLE on a solid role player SF.   Turner/Zeller/Carey/Richards    Washington/McDaniels   Bridges/Otto Porter MLE (or Oubre at $15M and no Zeller)   Rozier/Monk   Ball/Graham   and picks 56 and 57 and mins to use as roster filler. I guess one or both Martins can be kept too, but preferably not playing.   That's just about the best case scenario for next season. Aside from the backup C and SF that we use cap space on, the whole team would be 27 or younger, Rozier being the oldest of the bunch, most of them being =&lt;23"
"2018 is an unusually deep class. Although I don’t think it could yet be considered the greatest, you have to consider the later picks doing well: Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ, Huerter, Shamet, Brunson, Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, and SLAM DUNK CHAMPION HAMIDOU DIALLO"
"It’s insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I’m probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
"A few more solid players to add to that list: Okogie, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Melton, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn… yeah that draft class was really solid all around."
"Rajon Rondo, Lou Williams, Dennis Schroeder, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverly, Darious Garland, Devonte Graham……. Plenty of guys. The hawks have had 3 guys of these guys on our team alone"
"Trae/Shai/Doncic/Bridges/Ayton is actually a pretty ideal modern NBA lineup, damn. That easily wins the chip, especially if the bench has other 2018 guys like MPJ, Sexton, Donte, Huerter, JJJ, Robert Williams WCJ  Trae/Sexton/Donte   Shai/Huerter/Devonte Graham  Doncic/Gary Trent Jr/ Bruce Brown  Bridges/MPJ/JJJ  Ayton/Robert Williams/WCJ   Fuck that’s sexy"
"PG: Trae  SG: Luka  SF: MPJ  PF: Rob Williams  C: Ayton  Bench options: Mitch Robinson, JJJ, Bagley, SGA, Sexton, the Bridgeses, Huerter, Devonte Graham, WCJ  None of those starters are even 24 years old but would that team make the playoffs in 2022?"
Who gives a single flying fuck about Terry Rozier and Devonte Graham when Cade Cunningham is available?
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
I'd like Devonte Graham if Charlotte moves on because they have Lamello now. or Brogdon if Paces blow it up
"Not the worst I've seen, but I wouldn't do this. Lopez isn't getting faster as he ages. He's a good player but has his limitations and isn't a long-term solution at center. If someone like Graham is going out, it needs to be for that long term answer. Also who plays backup PG for us? Rozier is not a point guard. At all. Malik Monk is a slightly better facilitator than Rozier but not really a lead guard even off the bench. Devonte' has his limitations but he's needed here unless one of those two guards is able to become a legit PG, because nobody else on our bench can create for themselves or others, guys like McDaniels have to be spoon fed buckets.  Graham would be insanely good for Milwaukee though- he is a great PG to have next to a Giannis type who dominates in the paint.  Also your point about LaMelo making Biyombo look good doesn't make sense because Devonte' is actually the only Bobcat or Hornet ever to consistently throw passes that Biyombo can catch. Biyombo was among the worst players in the league this year, and almost looked ok offensively a year ago with Graham running the show."
Devonte' Graham will average 18 and nearly 10ast on 40/40/85 shooting playing with Zion and BI  I don't think it's ridiculous but this sub is quite low on him
I’d assume he gets similar money as Devonte Graham got in RFA
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?

"No Devonte Graham was, Terry was more like a 2"
They get worse by not really improving enough to convince Zion to commit his future. Say what you want about Lonzo but Zion has already said that he really liked playing with him and wanted him to stay and letting him go isn't something he's likely happy about. Zo also shot a better percentage from 3 last year than Graham if you actually wanted to go check plus Graham somehow gives you less inside the arc than Lonzo does. If you don't view Zo as even remotely important to this team then idk man. He's not a superstar or anything but he was still a key guy for them. JV is a better player than Adams but he also requires the ball to be more effective. I agree that Murphy is gonna be good but unless you think he's gonna be like a Donovan Mitchell mid-first round picks generally don't effect your team too much but he's still a great bench piece for them who might start as the year goes on.  Sure they maybe got incrementally better but is becoming a play-in team really gonna be all that exciting for them. NAW and Kira are the big ones that can really push them over the top if they pop. They do beat Memphis a lot but the Grizz have still have finished above them since Ja and Zion came innto the NBA. It's all about making your stars happy and if you think that bringing in Devonte Graham and Jonas Valncunias and becoming a play in team is gonna get Zion super psyched about being in Nola then yeah I guess they did but kinda feel like he's gonna want to be more than that.
"When his 2 point %s inevitably regress he's not more than a good 3rd guard off the bench, a reasonable contract wouldve been like 5-10% more than what Devonte Graham got. Better than Graham in 2021, Graham was better in 2020, 4 yrs $50ish mil wouldve been reasonable. This....like I said great for Rozier glad for him but it's why mediocre teams stay mediocre. He's got a great agent also twice in 3 yrs he's absolutely worked the Hornets."
"It's an overpay by about 5-million a year but Terry is worth that money. He's a clutch-af shooter.  The thing is though that part of why Terry's so solid is because he's an undersized shooting guard that's paired with a jumbo playmaker in LaMelo. LaMelo can guard bigger players so they work out fine.  Rozier didn't play with LaMelo his first season in Charlotte and the backcourt was him and Devonte Graham, which led to a lot of complaints similar to what we're seeing with Sexton and Garland right now.  I think that'll also make his contract harder to trade in the future for that reason. Not only is he getting overpaid, but you need to work around his defensive woes if you're a team trying to trade for him."

Yeah the fact he is making twice as much as Devonte Graham….I get he has heat check moments that look cool but man
"I'm ... cautiously okay with it at this point in time. I would *much* rather have traded him for like a mid 1st and brought back Devonte'+Monk for a combined total of significantly less $$$  We had no choice but to bring back Rozier after dumping both Monk and Graham and Rozier's agent took full advantage of this situation. It's terrible cap management and asset management (par for the course under Kupchak) but with the other moves already done, we simply could not afford to let Rozier hit UFA next year."
"is this post a troll or something? they got rid of adams and bledsoe, but they were so bad they had to waste their 10th overall pick to do it. pelicans keep on downgrading at pg, going from jrue holiday, to lonzo ball (who has become a good defender and shooter now), to bledsoe, to end up with devonte graham. how is this an excellent pickup? he doesn't play defense and shoots the same percentage as lonzo from 3. so griffin decided to flip lonzo to lose his defense and gain what? nothing lmao, lonzo is also a better facilitator than graham because he has chemistry with zion and is an excellent passer. graham will need 2 years at least to build that same level of chemistry. pelicans cannot maximize both of their all-stars without a superstar who plays defense. and this team doesn't have a single defender, so i think they're going to suck even more this year. they will get to the play-ins only if san antonio, sacramento and other teams do worse than them. no way they're getting into the playoffs"
Grizz probably take a small step back but will be more or less the feisty 8 or 9 seed.   Clips maybe just for this season since the news of Kawhi's surgery but that was already expected. None of their moves really made them worse.   Could argue New Orleans depending on how high you were on Lonzo. Valancunias is an upgrade on Adams but still won't really space the floor and needs the ball more to be effective. Devonte Graham is best utilized as like a 6th man/ heater off the bench type. Unless NAW takes a jump I think they got worse relative to the teams around them.   Spurs are the obvious one but everyone said that so decided not to pile on.   Maybe Philly given that it's basically the same roster and it looks like the relationship with Ben Simmons has completely deteriorated and if he comes to camp you wonder if that could be a big distraction if he's really unhappy.
Devonte Graham 29th in the league at 42.3% on catch and shoot 3's? I was told he was worse than Lonzo Ball...
"They jump the spurs because they lost essentially all of their vets (mills, derozan, Aldridge, gay) and don't have any one standout player. There are a few decent ballers but no stars imo.  They jump the Pelicans because I don't think zion is capable of pulling a team to the playoffs by himself. They have 3 starting caliber players (zion, Ingram and valanciunas) and there's a pretty big drop-off in talent from there. They also have a ridiculously weak guard lineup so they will likely be starting devonte Graham and Josh hart which is not a recipe for success. Also how will they be defending other teams? There's no above average defenders to speak of on their roster from what I've seen.  They jump the timberwolves because they just have more depth and more defense. They are in a similar tier to me where they will be in the play in, not necessarily getting into the playoffs. I think the wolves have a bit more star power with dlo kat and Edwards but I much prefer the kings supporting cast and depth wins out for me.  I think that questioning the blazers drop is totally understandable. It's hard for me to really explain but my trust in the surrounding pieces for the blazers is super low. Nurkic has had a hard time staying healthy lately and so has CJ. RoCo I think is a bit overrated as a defender because he has had the benefit of playing with great defensive units in the past (76ers and Rockets). He's not bad but he's not this dominant ballstopper that some would tell you he is. Anfernee simons is fine but not great. I just feel like the wheels will fall off this year. I could easily see the blazers in the 7 or 8 but my gut told me to drop them"
"you say 3rd best guard as if being just a bit worse than Terry Rozier and LaMelo Ball is a bad thing.   I would personally have traded Rozier before dumping either of Graham or Monk. I'm expecting a noticeable step back in Charlotte without those two, unless LaMelo blows up big time. Devonte' is a legitimate floor general that makes his teammates better, if you want to take a look at our on/off numbers."
"I'm alright with people thinking Lonzo to Devonte' is a downgrade. It's wrong imo, but a justifiable stance if you think Lonzo could improve. It's not a major downgrade though, by any stretch of the imagination, especially factoring in how much of a better fit Graham is for them offensively."
Star wise devonte graham seems awesome.  Can anyone tell me why the Hornets would let him go?
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
"He literally wasn’t the first to report any of this considering the entire article is a compilation of reports. Not to mention he’s wrong on the compensation in the Lonzo Ball three way deal since Josh Hart is still on NO:  &gt; There seems to be legitimate traction on a three-team sign-and-trade framework between Chicago, New Orleans and Charlotte that would likely nullify any of the Bulls' fears of losing out on their preferred point guard target. From conversations with multiple league sources, the framework that would be discussed appears to focus on landing Ball in Chicago, Devonte' Graham in New Orleans and Tomas Satoransky, Josh Hart and draft capital to Charlotte."
Josh Hart and Devonte Graham worse than Lonzo COMBINED?? Is this Lavar’s alt account?
The best fit next to Zion is a great spot up shooter who has great synergy with him and plays good defense.   Devonte Graham is a much worse fit. Same for Hart.
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I would rather him do it than poor shooter devonte graham."
"Lol, yeah, because he is going 1-10 most of the time, so they better be prepared.  Bad idea for a player like him to be in NO. They need Zion to be taking those shots, not Devonte freaking graham."
"The article is about the off-season, not just free agency. We will definitely be better next year but we could have just done that by not playing Bledsoe anymore. And we added devonte Graham. I’d give our free agency a D, our draft/trades an A. If we are going just by what we know so far (summer league) we got the steal of the draft in Trey murphy."
"The Pelicans tried that and they ended up with Devonte Graham, Tomas Satoransky, and Garrett Temple instead"
"Devonte Graham is a better “point guard” than Lonzo.  He could start fast breaks and stuff but Lonzo can no create offense for himself or anyone else.  Graham is a much better facilitator and will be able to run the pick and roll in ways Lonzo couldn’t  Graham, Sato, and more point Zion will improve the Pels over last years ball handlers"
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
Devonte Graham
"Not a superstar caliber player, but in 2k19 I'd always trade for Devonte Graham to be off my bench, and I can say that I predicted he'd be a great point guard!"
"Devonte Graham is a cool player, definitely think the Pelicans might be a great spot for him to pop off fully. The fact he averaged 18ppg &amp; 7a the year before Lamelo got to Charlotte, is pretty dope. I think he’d be a really cool guy to see flourish, considering his play style."
I always felt like this award should go to the lower drafted dudes or guys that come from the G League. Brandon Ingram is a beast but he was also a #2 pick. Devonte Graham went from a 2nd round pick averaging 5 points and 3 assists his rookie year. Next season he goes for 18 and 7.5

Yeah I'm reading some of these comments thinking if there's another Devonte Graham in the league I don't know about lol
"&gt; Graham has been a 6th man his whole career  Not that it makes Pellies any worse or better, but Devonte Graham started 97 games and came from bench in 21 games in the last 2 seasons... Averaging 33 minutes per game, the previous season he was 12th in the whole league in minutes per game. He'll possibly play even more minutes in Pelicans, but he's gonna have a much smaller role in offense than in the Hornets."
"Idk where this ""Devonte Graham pressures the rim"" narrative came from but it's been rampant lately😂"
Isn’t devonte graham starting  Edit: nvm u guys got rid of Bledsoe too so I assume u mean at the 2
Devonte had less attempts within 5 feet than Lonzo had makes within 5 feet last year. Of all guards yall have Graham won't be the one driving a lot I'll tell you that.

"Graham is not an average defender and as bad of a anyone who’s watched him you may think Zo is, Devonte’ is much worse"
"I would bet with confidence that some GMs complained because their owners got mad at them  “Wtf man you said you’d get me these studs and you got me Devonte Graham”  “I had them, but those teams were TAMPERING!! We got cheated and I’ve filed a complaint with the league, they’re going to investigate.”"
1.	Jrue asked for a trade and the Pelicans facilitated it by sending him to a championship level team 2.	Lowry and Jrue are different types of players who bring different kinds of leadership to the table 3.	Lonzo is not worth 4/80 and didn’t want to be a Pelican anymore 4.	Bledsoe wasn’t traded for cap space he was traded because he sucks 5.	Devonte’ Graham is going to look at least as good as Lonzo did on the team
"so, the pelicans traded their long time veteran pg (jrue); only to proclaim that they’re in the hunt for a veteran pg (lowry) the following offseason. miss on lowry, who signed the same deal as ball who they had no desire to re-sign. traded bledsoe away to clear cap for lowry, along with adams (who they gave a big extension to); just to give up a first round pick for the consolation prize of devonte graham. what a mess."
Devonte Graham was traded for a 1st
&gt;Talking trash about a man averaging 7 assists to only 2 turnovers last year. He’d be the Pelicans best passer too.  Your response  &gt;Yea but they got Devonte Graham tho
Yea but they got Devonte Graham tho
14.6ppg - 18.4 rpg - 15.7 assists - 1.7 steals - 2.6 blocks  75/37/88 shooting  Team record 68 - 14  Best teammate: Devonte' Graham
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Rozier is bad any time he is asked to handle the ball and make plays for others. After the first month or so of 2019-20, he wasn't really asked to do that at all and has been an impactful player since. He's become a phenomenal shooter two consecutive years, it's not just a fluke anymore. Playing alongside Devonte' Graham and then LaMelo Ball and Hayward, he hasn't needed to handle much and has just focused on being open.   Losing Graham has me a bit worried about this though- if Ish Smith gets hurt or is just not that good, Rozier is going to have to play backup PG again which is where he becomes terribly inefficient."
The Pels shot 30 three’s a game at 34% last season  Devonte Graham and Buddy Hield shot 20 three’s a game at 38% last season
"Agreed. It's not necessarily about the skill but the minutes played. More practice and more tape.  When Devonte' Graham was a rookie, he was constantly sent back and forth to the G-League affiliate. The reason being so he could get a lot more minutes (definitely showed his 2nd year) and luckily for them, their affiliate is only like an hour away from Charlotte."
Devonte graham gets his help
"If another team is interested and you're not going to match, you just tell them and work out a trade package so they don't have to overpay  It just happened with Lonzo and Devonte Graham"
Raleigh:  PG John Wall  SG Devonte Graham  SF Nate McMillan  PF PJ Tucker  C Chris Willcox  6th Chris Clemons
"YES finally   &gt;As sort of an amalgam of the last two points, I’m basically done with fake stretch bigs as topline players. By fake, I mean they aren’t really bigs. They might be tall. But if they can’t do big-man things like protect that rim and/or put smaller players in the basket with the ball if they are being guarded by some random small forward, then they are just slow, often mediocre shooting threes rather than bigs. This sort of walking one-way mismatch doesn’t cut it in modern playoffs.  There is some recency bias with this, like sorry Im not taking Jeff Green over someone like Royce O'Neale if my goal is to win the most basketball games possible next year. Devonte Graham also shouldnt have come this close to missing out is the other thing that came ot my mind."
"The Pelicans did not get worse. They got Jonas Valanciunas who was the grizzlies best player for most of last season. Devonte Graham is still a solid player. They have much more depth than last year by having Satoransky and Temple and another year for other guys to develop.   It may not be a playoff team yet, but I definitely don't think they got worse. I also LOVE their second round pick Herbert Jones. He has the ability to be an impact defender right away."
"this makes absolutely no sense. you cannot look me in the face and tell me the Pelicans had worse offseason than the Grizzlies, Blazers, Spurs, or Timberwolves.  Pelicans got a better center, shipped out Bledsoe to open up playing time for NAW, and got a slight downgrade in Devonte' Graham for $10 million less than Lonzo"
Devonte Graham is a good play making guard.
Those Lonzo lobs are going to look nice. Going to suck for Zion getting passes for Devonte Graham now lol
"It’s worth noting that Real Plus Minus is very conservative with how it does year to year changes because of how it uses on/off data and that can be noisy. A veteran player’s rating is like 30% the current year 70% weighted numbers from previous years. If Devonte Graham all of a sudden puts up slightly better numbers in every way than Curry next year, ORPM is still gonna rate Curry higher. Which isn’t to take away from how good steph has been offensively but RPM is a stat that lends itself to being dominated by 1 person over long stretches."
"Given that Lowry and Lonzo’s sign and trades were announced around 5pm on 8/2/21 and are both under investigation but no one is looking into the Devonte Graham s&amp;t announced at like 8pm, I can only assume that the NBA is only doing this investigation because other a few other owners are mad they didn’t get a shot at two of the best guards in this year’s free agency."
"Given that Lowry and Lonzo’s sign and trades were announced around 5pm on 8/2 and are both under investigation but no one is looking into the Devonte Graham s&amp;t announced at like 8pm, I can only that the NBA is only doing this investigation because enough other owners are mad they feel they didn’t get a shot at two of the best guards in this year’s free agency."
this is all from new orleans cause they're pissed all they got what Devonte Graham
It's the Devonte' Graham S&amp;T combined with the Bledsoe/Adams/Valanciunas move with Memphis
Is it the Lonzo Ball and Devonte Graham Bulls-Pelicans-Hornets three team trade?
"&gt;Charlotte Hornets President of Basketball Operations &amp; General Manager Mitch Kupchak announced today that the team has acquired Wes Iwundu, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick and cash considerations from the New Orleans Pelicans and the draft rights to Tyler Harvey from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for sending guard Devonte’ Graham to New Orleans as a part of a three-team trade. In the deal, New Orleans also acquired Jonas Valuncianas as well as the draft rights to Trey Murphy and Brandon Boston. Memphis received Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, the draft rights to Ziaire Williams, the draft rights to Jared Butler and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick from New Orleans (via the Los Angeles Lakers). "
Fuck it even Daniel Gafford is more relevant than Devonte Graham
Draymond Green  Darius Garland  Danny Green  Danilo Galinari  …  Devonte’ Graham
"Shit, that too!  I didn't even think of him, good catch.  Point being, it's real silly to refer to Devonte Graham as DG."
Devonte Graham and nickeil Alexander Walker?  An above average second unit and concerning first unit
"Dude there are way too many DG's in the NBA to refer to Devonte Graham as ""DG.""  I was trying to figure out who you thought Philly was going to start alongside Danny Green lol"
Devonte graham will average 10 assists and shoot 40% from deep playing with Zanos
"Also, you got a good haul for Jrue. Trading Jrue, getting future assets, then moving to sign a vet PG via free agency to replace him is a pretty solid move, if you can land someone. Unfortunately yall had to give up some future assets to clear space for Lowry/CP3, and then yall struck out on both of them and gave up even more future assets to aquire your back-up plan, Devonte Graham. That's where Griffin really fucked up."
"to comply with all the sign and trade rules, there's almost a guarantee that Mason Plumlee + Martin twins are heading out to one of these teams, maybe one or both of Carey and Nick Richards. We do not have a way to acquire both of Oubre and Markkanen using cap space or salary matching from Devonte' Graham S&amp;T unless Markkanen is making less than $8M or something"
"Came into the league as a 4 year college player. A lot of people might be surprised to learn that Devonte Graham is Giannis’ age, also 26."
The Lonzo Ball/Devonte Graham/DeMar Derozan S&amp;Ts about to conglomerate into a one massive trade that will merge with the Dinwiddie trade to form the largest trade in NBA history.

"Hey, at least they got Devonte Graham 😂"
"We turned Devonte graham into a first round pick, ish Smith, and oubre? Sign me the fuck up mitch."
The pick trade-down was David Griffin undoing his own mistakes (which is kind of a crazy waste of assets) but I do think Jonas is going to be a *big* upgrade over Steven Adams. Mans averaged 17ppg and sometimes got doubled.  With Devonte' it sounds like we had other plans that fell through to be the trade piece to grab him (Josh Hart for Graham) and then we traded the pick for some cap-related reasons when we couldn't do that.  Neither a great look or inspires a lot of confidence though lol.
Famous sayings can be replaced with anyone’s name  Look at Lebron man  Look at Kawhi man  Look at Devonte Graham man
Then he'd be Devonte Graham
Devonte' Graham ?
"Pelicans have Devonte Graham, Valanciunas, BI, Zion, and NAW. I think it’s more common than you think"
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
"Or, hear me out here, fans tend to know more about their players and performance because we watch damn near every game. I know, crazy thought that the people that watch damn near every game for a team might have some insight on how the team and it's players performed last year and what exactly needed to be fixed. Even if Devonte is a downgrade (which if you watched Lonzo last year you'd see that it's a wash if anything with Graham probably fitting our team and what we need better) he's making 60% of what Lonzo is which is very much worth it."
"Coaches: Willie Green, Mike D'Antoni  Center: Jonas Valanciunas  FC: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram  BC: Devonte Graham, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  NO Bledsoe, Adams, Lonzo  Still moves to be made too... it's looking a WHOLE lot better than last year  P.S. fuck r/nba"
"That’s a decent description of Zo too. He’s not a lead PG. he’s a 3-and-D wing with secondary playmaking abilities whose very good offball defensively disrupting and solid but not upper echelon on ball at the point of attack. He’s good passing in the full court, but that can be limited.   In the halfcourt, he’s only very effective at spot up shooting. He doesn’t offer much in the halfcourt offense and struggle to do most PG things (attack the rim, draw FTs, get layups or generate looks for others).   I was saying him and Devonte are similar. I’m not gonna sit here and Stan it and pretend it’s a no brainer great move, but Devonte hits three at a similar clip but takes a much tougher diet of shots and harder ones off the dribble, while being slightly better catch and shoot. Devonte halfcourt passing seems to be slightly underrated, while Zo’s elite transition passing gets conflated with the ability to pass on the halfcourt, which we haven’t seen consistently.   I think it may be a wash, with Graham being a bigger boost offensively and Zo being better defensively, especially offball. But the Pels defense was so awful that I can’t bring my self to believe that it can get worse without him. If Graham can compete at the point of attack and just make his guys work, the Pels can still improve defensively…if Zion and BI just try on defense.   All in all, I can’t say I love the move. But I can’t abhor it either. On paper I can see it as a slight improvement possibly, but the asset management is what I find especially frustrating. Not the moves itselves."
Hold on who are all the players the Pelicans signed again? Devonte Graham? And...?
"my guy devonte shoots 38% on 2pt fga   agree he can create his own shot, but do you really want him creating his own shot?   graham shot 44% within 3 feet of the hoop..."
"Lonzo is a poor facilitator in half-court offense, is an overrated defender (only 6 points higher in DRTG than Devonte’ Graham), and has only had one good shooting season thus far in his career. His asking price was way too high for the value he brings and would’ve crippled the team in future free agent negotiations. I find it funny that the media is chiding our front office for failing to make any major signings when they’re the ones reinforcing the narrative that nobody can win in NOLA; why would anyone ever sign with us when smug ESPN reporters are working overtime to sully our reputation even further? How are we ever supposed to get better when they’ve been ushering Zion out the door since before he even played a game for us?"
"This is a correct take.   I actually do prefer Devonte Graham on his contract certainly over Dinwiddie and what he got, probably over what Schroeder and Reggie Jackson are going to get, and arguably over Lonzo (though really I think Lonzo comes down to more that Lonzo simply does not want to be in NO).  But there's no doubt that the point of everything Griffin did was for Chris Paul and Kyle Lowery, he struck out on both, and punting with cap space/moveable to next year, while not making the situation worse, is obviously not what he paid all of those 1st round picks for."
Tell everyone you haven't actually watched much Devonte' Graham and have only looked at his stats without telling everyone that you haven't actually watched much Devonte' Graham and have only looked at his stats.
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valančiūnas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
Do you think you've jumped a bunch of teams and will be in the top 6? You think this roster is going to suddenly win 45 games because of Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham?
"I mean what else could they have done lol, Lonzo wasn't that huge of a loss and they got devonte graham on a good contract"
He isn’t but he’s much better than Devonte graham LMAO
"If Zion averages 30/10/7 on close to the same efficiency he has now without developing a reliable 3 pointer I will be shocked. You added Devonte Graham, but lost Lonzo who was also a 38% 3 point shooter on 8 attempts a game so that's pretty much a wash when talking about spacing.  Summer league is basically irrelevant to the actual NBA, I'm sure the dude is a good shooter but don't expect him to average 50/40/90 as a rookie. Valanciunas is a good centre and has a better offensive game than Steven Adams, but he's not a good 3 point shooter or passer so I feel like he would just clog the lane when he shares the floor with Zion.   Zion can for sure get up to 30ppg or increase his assist numbers, but doing both at the same time whilst maintaining his current efficiency I really don't think is possible. Would be happy to be proven wrong though, the kid is really fun to watch."
"He increased his fga from year 1 to yr 2 from 15 to 17 and gained 4.5 more ppg on only 2 more fga while simultaneously  increasing his fg eff by 2.7% and his ft eff by 5.8. He didn't start running the point until almost 1/3 of the season and even then Pels players still bricked shots at an alarmingly high rate.   Devonte Graham  hit 38% of his 3s last year which is good but taking into account that 71% of his 12.2 fga were 3s he is a huge add for Pels spacing. Trey  Murphy is one of two players in college to shoot 50/40/90. In summer league he 16.3/7/2.8 on 54/44/100 and was named all summer league. Jonas Valanciunas is a huge upgrade and underrated pick up at Center he avg 17.1 and 12.5 on 59% last season. [Here](https://twitter.com/cclark3000/status/1419809641492619264?s=19) is the comparison of his range of scoring vs Steven's last year. Anyone who watched the Pels can tell you 6'6 Nickiel Alexander Walker is a huge upgrade over 6'1 Eric ""I wasn't paying attention"" Bledsoe.  Not only is it completely fathomable that Zion can hit the numbers I'm predicting, but he could do it on under 21 fga."
Except the Pels have been making shitty win now moves that won't get them anywhere instead of doing a proper full rebuild into a contender. Trading RJ Hampton who has a crazy high ceiling for Steven Adams to give him a huge extension was stupid as fuck. Then trading down from #10 when they could have gotten a potential star in Bouknight was also bad. Then letting Lonzo walk so they can trade away a pick for Devonte Graham also isn't good.  They're going all in to try to be a low seed 1st/2nd round exit every year instead of building up an actual contender. Don't blame Zion for getting mad that his team's management is garbage.
"He doesn’t do well against bigger guys. You saying that shows me you didn’t watch him. Lonzo’s 3pt shooting dropped to 31% in the 4th quarter last year. His overall fg% drops from 42% in the first 3 quarters to 37% in the 4th. His fg attempt rate drops noticeably as well because he doesn’t shoot unless he’s wide open, and he’ll still pass up looks. He can’t attack close outs. He doesn’t playmake in the half court. The Pelicans had a positive net rating in the 4th quarter last year but with Lonzo on the floor it was -4.2.  Devonte is a more versatile 3pt shooter. He can shoot on the move and off screens and on pull ups. Regardless, Graham is replacing Bledsoe, not Lonzo. NAW is who will benefit from Lonzo’s exodus. He’s ask 6-6 guard who can be just as distributive a defender as Lonzo."
PG: Devonte Graham SG: Gary Trent SF: Isaac Okoro PF: PJ Tucker (assuming he'll be starting this year) C: Kevon Looney
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
"He’s an elite three point shooter and shot creator.  I can get more into the numbers if you want but it was getting long so just going to bring up a few points but there’s more data in support of this and many writers/analysts have echoed my claim.  Tatum is 19th in career 3 point % among active players. Of the 18 guys ahead of him, only Steph has been assisted on a lower % of his 3 point makes than Tatum has been: 61.7 vs 64.7 though Steph is also 3rd in career 3pt% which is insane. Meanwhile 12 of the other 17 were assisted in at least 90% of their made 3s. Expand the list to top 30, and the only other guy that qualifies is Kyrie who’s ranked 25th and has a crazy low % of assisted 3s.   Bball index’s perimeter shooting metric is very high on Tatum. It had him as the 8th best perimeter shooter in the nba this past season as well as the 2020 season. The players ahead of him for 2021 were Steph, Dame, Duncan Robinson, LaVine, Joe Harris, Hield, and Ingles. In 2020, it was Dame, Harden, Duncan Robinson, Bertans, Hield, JJ Redick, and Devonte Graham."
Devonte Graham - he had like a month long stretch of hype and faded into oblivion
"John Wall would be an awful fit next to Zion since he's such a poor shooter.  The idea is okay on paper, but I think they'd rather just roll with Devonte Graham at his cost."
"Chris Paul  Smart/Schroder  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons   Kyle Lowry  Harden (or Kyrie)  Lonzo  Conley  Dejounte Murray  Devonte' Graham  Jamal Murray  Patrick Beverley  Brogdon  Rubio  Terry Rozier (or LaMelo)  Lillard  Westbrook  Luka  Sexton  who here is Curry objectively a better defender than?  because if he's not better than at least 4 or 5 of them, he is below average.  that is how average works lol"
"Devonte Graham. Saw him in 2019 against the Pelicans. Had no clue who he was before that game, but I remember him afterwards."
"I wouldn’t say they’re totally terrible, like picking up Devonte Graham and Valanciunas were *fine*, I think they just don’t really move the needle at all. All of their moves are weirdly at the margins which is something only contenders really do, usually. They need to make some splashes if they actually wanna get better at all"
Devonte Graham outperforms Lonzo Ball
"As of right now, both teams are unlikely to even make play in because of their guard  roster. Neither satoransky or devonte graham will get the job done for the pelicans.  Meanwhile, Dallas getting Dragic doesn't solve their problems of getting past the first round of the playoffs."
I’m not trading Satoransky and a youngin for a year/ maybe half year rental of Dragic. Satoransky is already a vet of his own right. They already have Devonte Graham who will take up point guard duties. Kira and Nickeil at backup and keep learning.  Same for the Minnesota one in McDaniels. I’m sure Raptors will take that but why should Minnesota give up on a promising rook for a rental Dragic? They already got rid of Rubio for a future pick. They clearly don’t feel the need for a vet point guard.
"He should be p good this year imo. Ingram's pretty underrated on here tbh(seeing people saying he ain't close to Brown LOL), and last season didn't do him any favors. The Pelicans getting a scorer in Valanciunis and also Devonte Graham who can score better than Lonzo/Bledsoe means he can focus more on the defensive end."
"THE move of the offseason? C’mon. He was the second-4thbest bench piece (depends how you view Reggie Bullock and PJ Tucker) in FA with Batum at 1 but he’s not above Derozan, Lowry, Ball, Fournier, Schroeder, Olynyk or even Devonte Graham in key additions. It’s a good get but it doesn’t put them over the Bulls and Heat with their star level additions or the Lakers with the Russ trade in offseasons."
Lakers will be riddled with injuries again and will be a second round exit  Devonte Graham breaks out on the Pelicans as their main PG  Heat make the ECF  Nets vs. Nuggets final - Nets take it all
Tae is Devonte Graham  TM3 is understandable but it’s not like you’d know if I said Murphy since he’s a rookie   Willy hernangomez goes by Billy
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There’s a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
"Actually... Chalmers.   The twins weren’t that bad (just don’t mess with them lol).   Also, Paul Pierce, Wayne Selden, Frank Mason, and Devonte Graham were all SUPER nice.  Lastly, old man Perry Ellis was QUIET af lol"
**Devonte’ Graham**  8.7 3PA on 37% shooting
"Devonte' Graham will be averaging around 16-18pts, 10ast, over 40% on 3 now that he's playing off Zion and Ingram rather than a team with no interior presence.   Malik Monk will be starting in the playoffs for the Lakers.  Yes I am mad about this offseason as a Hornets fan."
"Kendrick Nunn, Devonte Graham, Dame Lillard"
"Honestly, ""Give him a Devonte Graham"" was not a comment I expected to see in this thread."
"Guys. He isn’t Draymond.   Ben Simmons needs to play with a PG who can play off-ball, and not necessarily an all-star. Give him a Devonte Graham and get creative. PnRs with Ben as the roll man, PnRs with Ben as the ball-handler. Running hella screens. Ben is unique, you can’t shoehorn him into a PG. He also isn’t Giannis or Draymond. He’s his own thing."
"Now you're being obtuse. Maybe deliberately, or maybe you just can't help it.  The Pels dumped Bledsoe and Adams for a better player on a cheaper contract, costing them a top-10 protected pick next year, expected by most to end up in the late 20s, while still getting the player they wanted in this year's draft.  Of course that brilliant move is nothing compared to the genius move of getting the dead weight of Lonzo Ball off the roster. Did you know there's a GM in the league so stupid he thinks Lonzo Ball is a playmaker? And worth $20M/year?  Meanwhile the Pelicans got Devonte' Graham - as good a shooter as Ball and a better playmaker - for almost half as much $$$ as Ball. The better player at half the price."
I don’t really get this. The Pelicans have 7 players on their roster that they drafted (or UDFA). And Two they acquired on rookie contracts.  They have 2 vets. Devonte Graham and JV.  I know the asset management hasn’t been good. But the “win now” stuff doesn’t line up for me.
"I feel like the Pels had a decent off-season. They got rid of 2 terrible contracts, while upgrading one of those positions. They re-signed Josh Hart to a good deal.   The Lonzo Ball deal was bad, but replacing him with Devonte Graham isn't terrible. They also maintain a lot of future flexibility.   Idk, Pels messed up on Lowry, but the off-season as a whole wasn't bad imo and it's not like the gamble left them in a terrible position for the future."
"LeBron will still be a top 20 player in 5 years (age 41-42 season)  Devonte' Graham will average close to 10 assists and shoot over 40% on very high volume from deep playing next to Zion Williamson.  Ben Simmons figures it out on his next team, and averages 23/8/8 whenever he's traded.  Kyrie Irving signs his 4 year extension with the Nets, but randomly decides to retire 1 or 2 years into it.

"Everyone was always bitching how Zion needs spacing. Devonte Graham SPACES THE FLOOR  He lets like 10 threes fly a game, and he's not shy about it. It's what they needed, everyone just needs to shit on one side"
"arguing that lonzo is as good a 3pt shooter as devonte graham, can't help these folk"
"iirc it was no more than 20mill/yr even on a shorter deal so they wouldn’t even do 60/3 which is ridiculous for a player who shot as good as Lonzo the last two years, especially considering age.  Also while PG defense isn’t as important as big defense to the team they still make an impact and the last thing New Orleans needed was to be losing positive defenders when they plan to run Zion and Ingram out there every night.   Honestly they were handed a golden platter by Lakers and are some how fucking it up. I know AD is a monster so he’s more than worth what they got but they got an all star caliber player (maybe more if he ever starts playing defense) in Ingram, an above average starting PG who shoots the 3, plays D, and doesn’t need the ball in his hands, Hart is a quality role player, and then three firsts with a top 4 pick being one of them.   Considering they won the draft lottery a month earlier they basically have fucked this up in a lot of spots. Yeah Zion has been injured and they can’t control his off season habits or injury risk but I mean come on, look at the front office since they got him after the AD trade (which lets be honest was basically telling the Lakers to give them everything that they got).   Kept on Gentry for a single year(Zions rookie year no less) for basically no reason except being cheap, hired Van Gundy then fired him the next year, trade for Steven Adams then extend him unnecessarily, trade for JV afterwards, let Lonzo walk for seemingly no reason and gave up a first to do it somehow and only got back Devonte Graham.   If we were to judge FOs on what happened from August 2019 forwards only I’m not sure anyone has been even close to as bad the Pelicans are."
"Graham has been good. Offensively he does exactly what lonzo does, except I’ve seen Devonte actually drive to the basket numerous times so far. We’d have lonzo do that rarely while also being bad as a primary ball handler in half court. I’ll take what I’ve seen from Devonte so far for half the price of lonzo 10/10 times"
You’re confusing that trade with the Valanciunas deal  The Pelicans sent their own lottery protected ‘22 pick that becomes 2 seconds if it doesn’t convey  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31945250/new-orleans-pelicans-land-devonte-graham-sign-trade-charlotte-hornets
"brandon ingram has been a 38% 3 point shooter the last two seasons.   he's shooting 50% from 3pt this season so far.   NAW is raw but shows a ton of promise.    Devonte graham is 36% and can easily improve from range.  Ingram is an all star and a better caliber of player than anyone luka has or lebron had his first time in cleveland.    End of story.   This crazy narrative that the pelicans aren't giving zion good teammates is straight up false  you're basically saying zion is a bad fit with the center position, there's like 2 centers in the entire league who you actually think would be a good ""fit"" with zion and they are superstars on max deals.   I don't think you actually understand what it means to build a roster that fits, or really anything else about basketball.   He just isn't going to fit with anyone if he can't even stay on the floor or bother to play defense  &gt;Zion also didn’t get to chose the Pelicans. He doesn’t owe them shit.   he chose to enter the NBA draft because he wants to be a famous basketball player and earn hundreds of millions of dollars.   in doing so he agreed to abide by the drafting structure"
Devonte Graham is a really good point guard

"He’s been pretty decent getting downhill too. He’s a lot better at pressuring the rim than Devonte Graham ever was here. Graham is certainly the more valuable player for his shooting, but smith has been such a perfect fit here."
"Griff has mostly screwed up, I'm happy to admit. But honestly if Zion is ever healthy, in shape, and committed to playing hard on defense this roster is more than good enough to get them into the playoffs. They have good young depth, a solid starting 5, lots of shooting, rebounding, and defense around him, and a promising new coach.   Hayes looks like a miss, and did right from when they drafted him. Adams and Bledsoe were terrible moves at the time. But I don't fault Griff for not wanting to pay Lonzo 100M/4. Devonte Graham is a perfectly serviceable replacement piece.   Herb Jones and Trey Murphy both look like real players, and NAW is poised for a breakout season. Valanciunas is a good fit, too. BI is playing hard on defense so far.   This team just needs Zion to show up and give a shit."
Devonte Graham was awful last year on the hornets what was David griffin  thinking.
"To your 1st point, they picked Trey Murphy in this year’s draft, and he looks like he’ll be a much better 3&amp;D player than Deandre Hunter. Not to mention Nickeil Alexandre-Walker straight up I think will be better than Hunter.  To your 2nd point, yea they traded down to dump Bledsoe, but they got back a good player and drafted what looks like a the better player so far.   To your 3rd point, Devonte Graham and JV have looked really good so far? Idk what you are yelling about."
Nice to see Devonte Graham play well.  If your bench stops eating glue you might win some games.
He's kind of a random roleplayer but the devonte graham/lebron pick and roll would be nasty.
"Couldn't really think of all-time, but for right now, maybe:   Devonte' Graham  Gary Harris  Josh Jackson  Marvin Bagley III  Andre Drummond"
"I’m down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric “The Actual Devil” Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn’t land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can’t fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn’t even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We’re also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we’re better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
ROTY: Cade Cunningham  MIP: Devonte Graham  6MOTY: Jalen Brunson  COTY: Eric Spoelstra  DPOTY: Giannis  MVP: Luka
"I'm biased here but Devonte Graham is great to watch as well. Bombs threes, makes nice passes, doesn't turn the ball over, and has had a lot of great clutch shots in just 2 years."
"This isn't an impressive list.   You can't count Bridges. They didn't pick him. They picked him for Phoenix because they wanted Zaire Smith.   Landry Shamet is a fringe rotation player and the very next pick was Robert Williams. Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham and Mitchell Robinson all went within the next 10 picks.   Thybulle is fine for pick 20 but he's not a starter or anything.    Maxey has potential but hasn't really done anything yet. The same can be said for Joe."

"&gt;There’s a huge difference between starting over Devonte Graham and Malik Monk and starting over Klay Thompson. No matter what he does he wouldn’t start. That seems frustrating.  Klay can play the 3. It's not even about starting, it's about PT. They can roll out a Steph/Melo/Klay/Dray/Whoever center as the death lineup and that team will score a shit ton of points. Sure the defense might not be as good but you're gonna smother teams with offense.  &gt;But he will adjust. It normally takes bigs longer than other positions without Covid screwing up practices. And for a big his shooting is actually very promising.  It's not just about the skills, dude looked absolutely lost out there. And it's not even about the fit, it's about production. If Wiseman did produce last year they can either keep him or package him and some salary for a superstar. Now they have no choice but to develop him, no one wants him. That won't be the case with Ball, a shit ton of options would have opened up this year."
"&gt; Ball didn't even start in Charlotte, he had to earn that. I think with GS he would have the same path. The moment he clicks with Steph is the moment he'll start.   There’s a huge difference between starting over Devonte Graham and Malik Monk and starting over Klay Thompson. No matter what he does he wouldn’t start. That seems frustrating.   &gt; But even if he doesn't start he'll still provide the continuity of the ball/player movement because of his high BBIQ.  That’s true but is that good value at the #2 draft pick? A high-end bench player?  &gt; Wiseman had obvious trouble adjusting to the NBA pace, homie can't even shoot. They gave him the starting job outright, and eventually got demoted.  But he will adjust. It normally takes bigs longer than other positions without Covid screwing up practices. And for a big his shooting is actually very promising.  &gt; Isn't this the reason why people are so down on him pre-draft? But still he was stuffing the stat sheet and showing that elite playmaking skill...plus unlike his brother, he doesn't shy away from contact and actually drives to the hoop to try to score and not just pass.  I get that but the shooting and defense is a HUGE concern for the Warriors last season when you know he’s gonna be a net negative (all rookies are) and you are playing him with Curry on defense and Dray on offense. 3 sub 30% shooters on the court with Curry just isn’t going to work. Now if he’s a bench player the only problem is you are using your best pick you want to get for the next decade on a bench player for the next near half decade."
"2018, GSW drafted Jacob Evans over Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, and Jalen Brunson.  You can do this with any team just about every year."
I don't think Valanciunas is a downgrade. Whoever is C next to Zion needs to he able to shoot. Valanciunas looked like the best player on the Pels yesterday; that was kind of a low bar but still!  Who knows about Devonte Graham though.
Devonte Graham.
cap lmao i already knew the pelicans messed up by letting zo walk and replacing him with devonte graham and this just gives me more evidence
"I still don't get why you'd give up assets to get a guy for half the money who isn't half as good as Lonzo. he played so well with Zion, I really don't get going for Graham, and I like Devonte."
people said the devonte graham was better than him 💀💀💀
people were really saying that devonte graham was better than zo 💀💀💀
Bah gawd those are Devonte Graham numbers
Devonte graham. He would make one 3 in the game and then just start firing them up endlessly
I'd say the Miles Bridges + Devonte Graham (2nd Round) draft was a hit as well.     PJ Washington isn't bad either and is coming into the big 3rd season where players tend to develop most.     Last draft we did draft two awful Centers though.  Like almost unusable.  So that sucks.

"The Pelicans could run out two intriguing units:  SPEED: Kira Lewis/Devonte' Graham/Nickeil Alexander-Walker/Ingram/Zion  JUMBO: Ingram/Trey Murphy/Zion/Jaxson Hayes/Jonas Valanciunas  Each of those units are plausible 1–2–3–4–5, at least in short bursts. Neither would be used for long, if at all.  But they would be fun to see. The first could run circles around you, and the second could run you over."
"he was honestly worse last season for the Hornets than he was as a 20-year-old second-year player (he wasn't quite rookie year bad, but still...). At least his rim protection was important, he's somehow regressed as a rebounder, and back in 2012 you could get away with playing 4 on 5 with a defensive center that didn't need to touch the ball.   He's just so incredibly lost with the current NBA, and he just couldn't play LaMelo's style of offense, just couldn't handle the sauce on his passes, and flat out short-circuited the offense when he was in there.  To date, Devonte' Graham is the only PG I've ever seen make Biz look nearly competent on offense. He (and Lance Stephenson for whatever reason) threw passes that Biz could catch... nobody else I've ever seen can pull that off consistently."
"We got barbequed by espn/bleacher/ringer and more, but I like our new coach, I like Jonas Valancuncias and I like Devonte' Graham.   My worry is we're still a little too young, (we didn't get a big vet leader grab either,) but I hope we can make a playoff push anyway."
Would've been a lot better if we kept Devonte' Graham but yeah I'd be down for that without question and run permanent small ball with either Simmons or PJ at center. We have the shooting to make that work.
"Pelicans should full on tank and trade Devonte' Graham for Colin Sexton and filler (Windler perhaps)?  Gives them a younger, better guard. Meanwhile Cavs get a proven guard to take Sexton's minutes, since it seems they'll be in the playoffs this year, and he's locked down for four more years on a smaller contract than Sexton's going to command.  Sexton/NAW/Ingram/Zion/Valanciunas is pretty cool for next season. Especially since they get the Lakers pick and their own pick if it's in the lotto. If they end up with a top ten pick and a pick in the 20s, that would be a good young core."
"What's Sexton's trade value?   Maybe the Pelicans should full on tank and trade Devonte' Graham for Colin Sexton and filler (Windler perhaps)?   Gives them a younger, better guard.

"Get used to it Pelican fans, Devonte' Graham is one of the clutchest players I've had the pleasure of being a fan of. Miss this guy."
I hate JJJ and devonte graham
&gt;GUTS OF A CAT BURGLAR  Devonte' DEEP...OH MY GOODNESS. I DONT BELIEVE IT. A 30 FOOTER DEVONTE GRAHAM. Stooone cold Devonte' Graham
"Devonte Graham got a WEIRD following in Charlotte. Most of my friends who are Hornets fans here were pissed when we drafted Ball because they thought it would hurt Graham's touches. They openly rooted against Monk because of that too.  I have no idea why. Graham is always going to be the hot hand on a shitty team, but they loved him so much.  Other than not enjoying him play, my only opinion on the guy was that he would order Postmates during Covid when I wanted a side hustle and never tipped. Fortunately for me, I just wanted to see cool-ass apartments like his when I did it, but it would suck to depend on that money and get nothing from a guy making what he did/does."
DEVONTE GRAHAM GROWN ASS MAN
"In the UK, saw a guy at the gym wearing a Devonte Graham Hornets jersey"
"Yeah, he was just quietly the 3rd leading scorer, the leading assist player, one of the plus marks defensively that the team could point to. 38% on threes attempting 8 a game (that's a big shooter on any roster). Just don't know what pelicans expected was going to improve without him and bringing in Graham.  Devonte wasn't going to become a passer overnight for them, and ingram/zion were already the top two scorers. I watched some pels games, probably not as many as you, and it seemed like they needed more time and to get rid of Eric Bledsoe's minutes."
The Lakers about to get themselves a gently used Jaxson Hayes and Devonte Graham plus like 2 late 1sts.
"&gt; He’s been given the keys to be as ball dominant as he wants Charlotte   Absolutely false, at least when Lamelo first entered the league. Borreago started him on the bench and kept him on a super short leash to start the season. It’s only when Devonte Graham got hurt and Lamelo started playing well did Charlotte give him more minutes and leeway.   Lamelo wasn’t given the keys, he earned them after he proved he can play. This is very much the opposite with wiseman who the warriors essentially force fed wiseman minutes even though they were a far worse team when he touched the court."
"I think you’re misinterpreting what I meant by getting to the line more maybe. Getting to the line more doesn’t mean foul baiting. Plenty of players are getting to the line at nearly identical rates because they’re just drawing legitimate fouls and playing through contact. Maxey can still be a bit contact averse at the rim sometimes. It’s partially why he does go to the floater a little too much, and you see him contort a lot which gets rid of the chance to get a call. I’m not saying he needs to be top 10 in the league in FTAs, but he can be better than he is. His FTr is comparable to Devonte Graham despite the fact that Graham lives on the perimeter and Maxey loves to drive"
"Great JV and Devonte graham are putting up good numbers while the team is 2-14.  I would rather have Lonzo and Jrue.   Look at what talent the team had and now look where they are.  Charlotte is a better team without Graham, Memphis is better without JV.  I love JV (raps fan) but he doesn't win games."
"The front office isn’t responsible for Zions shape. That’s strictly on the player. Ingram has stated and signed he wants to be here. Devonte Graham is scoring more points than Lonzo per game with less help than Lonzo, so while the return might not have been the best it’s not like we downgraded like most would believe. Jonas is a walking double double and putting up great numbers."
"They let Lonzo go because apparently, they were going to get Devonte Graham.   Also, it's probably worth adding that he has never found the right coach for the team. 3 coaches in 3 years."
he had 52 before lat game which was the same as Devonte graham
what in the absolute fuck were the Pelicans thinking by not paying Lonzo &amp; thinking they could replace him with Devonte Graham???
"Not the best, but the Hornets are pretty good:   PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Malik Monk  SF: Nic Batum   PF: Christian Wood  C: Dwight Howard  Bench of Devonte' Graham, Jeremy Lamb, Garrett Temple, Frank Kaminsky, and Cody Zeller. All in their primes, this is a solid squad."
"Devonte Graham has been amazing and cheap. The pels have opened up cap and assets to make great moves, just waiting on said great move."
I feel like all of these comparisons are completely different situations.  The 76ers traded Jrue because they were ready to tear it down and rebuild. The Pelicans we’re trying to compete.  Middleton and Dinwiddie weren’t the same players that they turned into in Milwaukee and Brooklyn respectively. Jrue and Lonzo were already established as quality players.  The Celtics would have had Kawhi under contract for one year and then he would have dipped to LA. Now they have a star in Jaylen under team control for years on one of the best contracts in the league. The Pelicans got Devonte Graham and likely mid to late first round picks with low odds of becoming players of Lonzo or Jrue’s caliber.
"Jrue asked to be traded.  Lonzo is not a need on this team. Devonte' Graham is providing more offense this year than Lonzo is, and improved guard defense isn't the difference between 2-12 and a winning record.   The issue this year is that we have missed 2 all-stars for most of our games. That's it. What this team needs is a healthy Zion and BI, not Jrue or Lonzo."
"Yea we probably could’ve, but he seems genuinely happy in Chicago and always reiterates he prefers his role in Chicago than he did New Orleans.  Plus I think Devonte Graham gives us exactly what we need from the point guard position for 60% of what Lonzo makes."
"Agreed, I like devonte graham too, I never said they were scrubs but with Zion out it’s unquestionable that the kings have more talent"
"When Rozier is playing his starting role next to LaMelo, he is a near-perfect fit for our starting 5 and I think he was statistically the most clutch player in the league last year.  It goes to shit when he's asked to create for the second unit and make decisions with the ball. It's like if you asked Klay Thompson to facilitate, it's just not part of his skillset.   Terry has had a rocky start to the season, he sprained one ankle in the preseason and the other in his first game back, so he's been understandably rough, but he's looked like himself the last 3 or 4 games and been key to our last couple big wins. I'll take him over Lonzo on this team, but I'd take Devonte' Graham at less than half price leaving enough room for a better center than Plumlee over either Terry or Lonzo"
"there's gotta be a shooting coach savant somewhere on this coaching staff. Rozier going from the inefficient dude he was in Boston to the insane C&amp;S guy he's been in Charlotte is pretty incredible. Between Rozier, Miles, LaMelo, previously Devonte' Graham and Malik Monk, even McDaniels, Cody Martin... a lot of our team has improved their three-ball drastically after coming here."
"Not many players are elite in all of those types of shots, yes. But there are plenty of players who are respectable at most of them. Devonte Graham is a good example. He's not as good at catch-and-shoot situations at Lonzo, but he's a more well-rounded shot maker.       Being good at only catch-and-shoot situations means the opposing team just never leaves you when going for the defensive board, negating your strength on second chance opportunities."
ingram is also out. theyre literally valanciuanas and a bunch of guys....and i guess devonte graham
Of course. The year the Hornets need them to make the playoffs to get their 1st rounder from the Devonte Graham deal.
"The Pelicans *technically* owe their 1st to Charlotte this year in the Devonte' Graham trade. But unfortunately for us, it's lottery protected for this year only and converts to a 2022 and 2024 2nd if it is not conveyed. So they'll own their 1st, they just can't trade it, unless they work something out with us first."
"Because of when they extended JV they literally can’t trade him this year. It sucks cause he’s the only player that’s not really young that would get a decent return on the trade market. Someone like Josh Hart/Devonte Graham probably only gets you some 2nd round picks.  Letting Lonzo go was so dumb. He’s a great fit next to Zion &amp; BI, and they got along great.   Honestly their best bet is to just fill out tank this year (already off to a great start lol) and hope to get Banchero/Holmgren in the draft."

Devonte Graham can create his own shot which is something every field general must be able to do. Lonzo's entire offensive game is founded on catch-and-shoot 3s.
"Then we see who remembers the first rounders NO traded this offseason are top-10 protected (to Memphis in the Adams/Bledsoe dump) and top-14 protected (to get Devonte Graham). *maniacal laugh, eye twitches*"
"Ah gotcha, total RAPTOR has Mikal Bridges at 2 though and Rose at 3. Surprised to see Devonte Graham, Aaron Gordon and Whiteside in the top 10."

Devonte graham not doing bad either !
Should they? That roster is pretty ass with Zion and Ingram out. I wouldn’t expect a Devonte Graham and JV led team to win too many games
"Just wait, honestly. There's nothing else to do. Eventually, Zion and BI will be on the floor with Devonte Graham and Trey Murphy who are both pretty good shooters, and one of NAW, Josh Hart, or Herb Jones, who bring varying levels of slashing, playmaking, and defense.   Our team looks like ass right now because our 6-8 are playing 3-5 right now. The very end of our bench plays significant minutes every game. Hopefully Zion comes back healthy and in shape, and if not, I honestly don't know where they'll go from there."

"Lonzo isn't really a PG, he's a combo guard.  And he's a combo guard that isn't really great in the half court.  Great shooter, good defender, great in the open court.  Re-signing Lonzo for $20 mil wouldn't have been a terrible move, but paying him that much is banking on him to continue his trajectory of improvement.    Devonte Graham is not as good of a defender but he's half the price, he's better in the half court, and he's a better scorer.  Graham gives NOP flexibility without losing much production, whereas Lonzo would've given them more potential.  Judging this trade properly may take a few years.  To early to call this trade stupid for New Orleans."
"idk why you are hating on Devonte Graham, dude has been great"
"Lonzo is definitely worth $20 mill. He is currently slashing 12/6/4.5 and shooting 40% from 3 on 7 attempts a game. While playing far above the NBA average on D. He also doesn't pound the shit out of the rock and take bad shots. Oh and he got Zion 2 or 3 bunnies a game just reading the court before he ever crossed the timeline. Tell yourself whatever you want to sleep at night but not resigning Lonzo will end up being a huge mistake for this team. More so than it already is with Devonte ""Shooting under 35%"" Graham out on the court now.  &amp;#x200B;  edit: Apparently Graham is now shooting 38%"
"I mean, you replaced Lonzo with Devonte Graham who is a less talented player and a worse fit on your roster.  The Pelicans had one of the worst defenses in the league last year, so y'all decided to get rid of the one good defender you had on the roster and replaced him with an undersized PG that's a negative on defense.  Lonzo also slots in nicely next to Zion as a PG who can playmake occasionally but is also more than happy to play off-ball and be a spot up shooter. His fit next to your young core just made a lot of sense."
"Mitch Kupchak is one of the better drafters in the league. He very rarely draft outright busts. I’m not sure how great the Lakers drafting has been since he left though. It’a a bit early to judge their more recent picks.   Since he’s been with the Hornets he’s drafted LaMelo, Miles Bridges, and PJ Washington in the first round. All of those picks have turned out. Devonte’ Graham was a steal in the second round, and his other 2nd round picks have shown potential too. Jalen McDaniels and Cody Martin have been pretty important players for the Hornets this season.   When he was with the Lakers he drafted Marc Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Larry Nance Jr, Ivica Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, and Brandon Ingram. Those are all pretty good players comparative to where they were drafted."

"devonte graham is a mini dion waiters, chuck it fuck it"
"I would've come up to 18 or so but I get it.   Miles' entire reputation as a good player is currently 5 games this season and ~20 games last season.   Aside from that, he'd been just a guy on the Hornets. His first two years were basically Wiggins minus shot creation (not effective but you can see potential), the first 2/3 of his third season were highly efficient but very low volume off the bench.   Then he blew up when Hayward went down and he suddenly became entrusted with Hayward's duties. It's understandable that the Hornets were a bit concerned that he might regress to his previous form as just another decent player. And it's also understandable that Miles turned that down and waits for RFA.  At the end of this year, I will have no complaints if Miles has played to a level where he can command $25M and we have to match it. He'd have earned it.  I'm not of the opinion that you have to extend a player after 3 years, letting the contract play out and becoming a RFA is a perfectly fine alternative so you can see what your guy is truly capable of.  As long as we don't Devonte' Graham him and let him walk free in exchange for a 1st that doesn't convey, anyway... Never know with this org."
"As a Hornets fan, I was not happy about getting Kupchak as GM. But, the guy has proved to be great overall and especially at drafting. PJ Washington, Miles Bridges, LaMelo, Martin twins, Devonte Graham. Rookies this year are buried by depth, but I think they will be serviceable when their names are called. Griz have been solid as well. Hawks, Suns, and Heat also come to mind."
"&gt;THT wanted to stay and the Lakers wanted the same.   lmaoooooo  If someone else wanted to sign THT they would sign him. The fear was that the Lakers would get poison-pilled. But no, crickets.  Let's see who else is earning around THT's range (9.5). I've put in bold text the ones who signed in the same FA year as THT.  **- Richaun Holmes (10.3)**  **- Devonte Graham (11)**  **- Shmurda (10.3)**  \- Jae Crowder (9.7)  **- Danny Green (10)**  **- Reggie Bullock (9.5)**  \- Seth Curry (8.2)  \- Monte Morris (8.4)  \- **Caruso (8.6)**  Source: [https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  THT is the NBA version of ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know""  I mean it's just the price of dealing with LeBron/Klutch. That's just the way it is. At least you already got a ring out of it."
"I hate it. But all we can do is wait for him to get healthy. I hope that an incentive-based on health max next offseason will help convince him to do the little things to take care of his body.     If there are two silver linings, the first is that the 1st we gave up for Devonte Graham is lottery protected. The second is that it allows the rest of the roster time to polish their skills. Herb Jones has been showing up.      If this team goes 3-2 for every 5 games of healthy, full Zion, it's hard to not be excited for the future, since that's just under a 50 win pace."
"I see some ppl calling devonte graham DG, use your theory of mind, who the fk knows who that is."
He’s been spilling hot takes left and right tonight. Siakam a top 10-15 player in the NBA. Devonte graham an all-nba caliber guard. And now Jokic being the 6th best center in the league lol.
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."
Hes underpaid till he has a bad game and then hes overpaid. This logic is why ppl are saying devonte graham shouldnt start while hes struggling
"Devonte ""Numerically Consistent"" Graham"
"Can someone explain to me what devonte graham is doing this season? I’ve never watched a Charlotte game, I only have him on my fantasy, and he must be the most inefficient player who gets usage that I’ve ever seen. How is it possible to start every single game 0-5?????"
How does Devonte Graham keep getting worse each game?? The bar was already so low
Devonte graham is literally worse than kelly oubre but no1 talks about it cause we arent as relevant as the warriors
Yes and no. Is he LeBron? Nah. Is he a solid two-way player? Yes. I'd take him over Tobias Harris and DeVonte Graham for instance.
"Minutes will come. Devonte Graham has been really bad. My guess is within the month, he moves to the bench and they start Lamelo."
Play Melo you fucking cowards!! Why draft him if ur only gonna play him 20 mins a game behind Devonte fucking Graham
bro what happened to devonte graham
It's time to trade Devonte Graham
Needs more playtime over Devonte Graham.
Devonte’ Graham wasn’t even top 3 tho and he fits that bill perfectly
"The Raptors literally lost to the Hornets the same season they won the title, and that was pre-Hayward and before Devonte Graham broke out"
Devonte' Graham
Devonte graham
Lonzo Ball 57% FG within 5 ft on 123 attempts this year.    Devonte Graham 42% within 5 ft on 59 attempts this year.    No idea why you even tried to argue that Graham is better than Lonzo at finishing it's just not true
"Am I the only one that really isn’t that impressed by Lonzo and didn’t like his fit with the Pelicans?  Devonte Graham is no slouch…he may fit a little bit better because he can actually put pressure on a defense.  I know, I know, shooting percentages and all that good shit…I hear ya.  But Lonzo doesn’t seem to be able to consistently get to where he wants to create for himself.  And if you can’t penetrate the defense and draw attention it’s harder to make your teammates better no matter how good of a passer he’s shown himself to be.  They’ll really miss him defensively but then again Idt they were that great defensively as a team anyway.  Might serve them better to try and open up the offense."
"It shows the effort they give. Tiny Devonte' Graham, playing off the ball, still drove the ball much more than Lonzo Ball, who led his team in touches.  Graham also shot better on catch-and-shoot threes, which is Ball's only offensive skill."
These people who only see Lonzo Ball's highlights have no idea that replacing Ball with nothing is a big win for the Pelicans. Addition by subtraction. There is literally nothing Ball does on a court that Nickeil Alexander-Walker doesn't do better.  Adding Devonte' Graham is just icing on the cake.
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain – including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 – all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year – and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
"You think Graham was an upgrade over Ball? I’m a Hornets fan and watched plenty of Devonte last year. Terrible defensive guard that is a streaky shooter reliant on off-dribble 3s. When he’s on, you will swear that he is a top-tier offense of weapon. When he’s not, he can shoot you out of games.   Personally, I take Lonzo’s consistency all day."
David griffin is an awful gm. The best thing you have to show for trading jrue and lonzo is what? 2 first round picks and devonte Graham (you traded one to get him). Feel bad pity shit would really be the only reason for him to stay at a mismanaged small market
I still don't get how you guys literally gave away lonzo for scraps and then you guys give away a first for devonte graham lol. Griff definitely could have gotten more out of the bulls.
I don't think people realize how perfect the fit between Zion and Devonte' Graham is. They upgraded their PG position from a fit standpoint
"No he didn’t fit. They wanted a catch and shoot backup two and he improved at everything but that - proving deadly with the ball in his hands, not as good as they wanted off the screen, but still very effective. Then injured. Then Devonte Graham. Fight back into lineup. Then Drug suspension. Then LaMelo ball. Covid. No minutes. Played a 6’5” turnover-prone guy over him because they wanted size?   He wasn’t appreciated, no role for him, he’s out :("

"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
"So we need shooting and we need guys who can play the 4. We get both in McDermott - who just had the best season of his career - in a market where Davis Bertans is making 16mil/year for 5 years and Duncan Robinson is making 18mil/5 years. Devonte Graham is making almost the same amount as McDermott for 4 years and he's a 5'11"" guard who has shot &lt;40% on 2s for his career.  We're only paying him for 3 years and our young guys **need** shooting around them to develop properly."
Devonte has also quite literally never been the number one option on the team.     Graham lead the Hornets in points per game and attempt per game for the 2019-2020 season.   Isn't that the literally definition of a number one option?  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/team/2019-20-charlotte-hornets-53/2020/stats
"&gt; And Devonte Graham is an inefficient chucker who plays no defense  Graham is average in terms of efficiency and defense for a guard, his passing is great, and he pressures defenses significantly with his spacing."
And Devonte Graham is an inefficient chucker who plays no defense and is undersized. I would definitely rather have Olynyk or McDermott
The devonte Graham sign and trade set a precedent for a first rounder as a price to facilitate the trade. I imagine the Lowry sign and trade is stuck on this as well.
"Defensive raitings for last season   Lonzo Ball - 113.7   Devonte Graham - 116.5     So neither of them are very good defensively, Ball is slightly better, not significantly, and definitely not 10 million dollars more a year significant.    And when you look at this stat:  ""According to Second Spectrum, Graham shot 42.6% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, a mark that was ninth out of 62 NBA players who shot at least four catch-and-shoot 3-pointers a game.""     That is actually significant."
"I think you could just replace the team name and the player names and write this exact article about any team. Let me see if you can:   &gt;After a quiet draft, the Charlotte Hornets had one of their least active offseason days in a long time, acquiring a first-round pick for Devonte Graham and trading for Miles Plumlee.  ​  &gt;The other target the Charlotte Hornets should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  &gt;The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  &gt;There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  ​  &gt;The Charlotte Hornets are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  &gt;Steph Curry’s fit next to LaMelo should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Charlotte Hornets will have the best spacing possibly in league history. They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Charlotte Hornets have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing."

I swear you guys must have never watched Devonte Graham play. Dude is like one of the worst guards at finishing at the rim in the league. Yes even worse than Lonzo. Also shot like 29% on pull up 3s.
He's hating because devonte Graham won't get zion to stay lol?
"He has been doing a shitty job exploring since he got to New Orleans. What does he have to show for lonzo and jrue? Sato, temple, a 2nd, devonte Graham (acquired using a 1st), 1 season of JV (acquired using a first), and like 1 more first round pick? Thats awful. Shit, they probably could have traded lonzo for Graham at the deadline straight up and saved themselves a 1st."
"Man you really buy into the “team targeting player” nonsense that’s built up by agents to increase their contract offers.  They had the cap space to sign Dinwiddie for way more than the wizards if they wanted to. You guys are also way overvaluing Lonzo. He’s a 3&amp;D player who thinks he’s Jason Kidd.  All said, currently they added Jonas Valenciunas, Devonte Graham, Tomas Satiransky and Garrett Temple while losing Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams.  May not be remarkable improvement but hard to say they’re not better. Adding JV and shedding Bledsoe is huge."
"Uh throwing this money at a high ceiling guy like devonte graham or Malik monk? Caruso has reached his ceiling, a team like us that isn't a contender yet shouldn't be paying market price for low ceiling vets."
Devonte Graham to NOP is HUGE!!!
Honestly don’t think he’s worse than Devonte Graham
"I mean the Knicks, one of the teams rumored to be in for him just signed D-Rose for another 3 years  Pelicans got Devonte Graham for 4/45, Bulls have Lonzo.  Schroder has just played himself lmao, he has no leverage with the Lakers anymore at this point"
"I mean I think it's insane to have given him up for so little instead of trading him for more valuable offers during this past trade deadline. I think it's insane to have given up a first round pick to acquire Devonte Graham. People said the LaVine contract was insane too, like I said, in fact the reaction was so much more over-the-top than the negative reception this trade is getting lol.  Lonzo is the kind of player you want to put next to LaVine, so is Vuc. I'm more than happy to give him the kind of contract that might look amazing in a couple years."
And devonte graham is ??

They're honestly pretty comparable value wise, Graham is a better scorer and marginally better overall on offense, but Lonzo is a better defender by a decent bit"
Watching the Pelicans trying to talk themselves into Devonte Graham over Lonzo is hilarious.
Do you think Devonte Graham is a worse player than Eric Bledsoe?
"Devonte graham is good, I hate how this sub still hasn't realized just because he's been in Charlotte"
"NO already suck on defense and now they've replaced Lonzo with Devonte... Graham is not a good defender at all. The contract is fine, its just that he isn't going to do anything for them that they wouldn't do with Lonzo. If they're saving money for next year its ok i guess but they're worse this year than they were last year, barring any major trades where they fleece someone."
That first round pick could be anyone! It could even be Devonte Graham.
"i'm just asking you, who is going to play any defense? you need to play defense to get to the playoffs. it is very important. lonzo was a defender and he is gone. Devonte Graham, if he starts, is an awful defender because he's just a little bit taller than me. ingram and zion don't defend well at all, and the Lithuanian Lightning is only a one-way dude."
"JK, would you be interested in a slightly used Devonte Graham?"
For Devonte Graham.  This tweet is a follow up to that one.
smart move by the hornets teading away devonte graham. they have like 5 point guards lol.
"paying a 1st to pay Devonte Graham market value, yeesh"
take Devonte' Graham and leave us alone
If the best you can do is Devonte Graham and Spencer Dinwiddie then Zion is leaving.
"… he’s an RFA  Also it’s debatable if temple and sato are even plus assets vs just having the cap space. They had a shot at dinwiddie or devonte graham with cap, now they don’t"
"I’m expecting Devonte Graham or Dinwiddie, if we miss out on both this is a big L"
Devonte Graham was a consensus All-American and led a Kansas team on a rebuilding year to a Final 4.
IDK man i watched Devonte graham put up 30 a night in the g league as a rookie and he never did anythign close at Kansas.   I think the G league experience is just all over the place.
Lauri needs a change of scenery and Charlotte might be it.   I also think Devonte Graham is a bit overrated; he’s a 26 year old player in his 3rd year that can shoot well and not much else.
"so far Pels have been linked to Lowry, CP3, Dinwiddie, Brodgan, Kemba and Devonte Graham but apparently want nothing to do at all with Lonzo"
"Ok, I could see that. I think the Hornets might be willing to do just Coby instead, since that’s give them cap space to target other guys. Thad + Sato doesn’t make any sense for them.   They’re letting Malik Monk go, so they’re going to need some kind of backup PG/combo guard coming back if they give up Graham. Otherwise they’d just match any offer for Devonte’.   Maybe the Pelicans would take Graham, Sato, and Thad and the Hornets could get NAW? I don’t know how much they value him."
Would you trade Coby White in a deal that gets you Lonzo?   I could see the following trade as being a decent starting place:   Hornets Get:   -	Coby White -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo Ball  Pelicans Get:   -	Devonte Graham   Some smaller pieces might have to be added somewhere though. I also wouldn’t mind NAW going to the Hornets and other Bulls stuff going to the Pelicans. Maybe:   Hornets Get:   -	NAW -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo -	Jalen McDaniels  Pelicans Get:   -	Graham -	Tomas Satoranski  As a starting point.
"It’d have to be Coby White wouldn’t it?   I’d think about Coby White and Thad Young if I were the GM of the Hornets. That would be around the amount need to match salaries too. It’d give us another decent Center option and a cheap backup combo guard who can shoot.   I want to keep Graham, but I’m not sure if I want to pay a permanent backup starter level money. With all the teams looking for a starting PG, Devonte might get expensive quick."
"Think about it like this... if DG is what it takes to get the Pels to S&amp;T Lonzo, then why tf would we take Tomas Satoransky instead of saying ""Hey could we just get Lonzo and cut out the Bulls?"" Obviously this would hinge on Lonzo preferring to play in Charlotte over Chicago which admittedly probably wouldn't work in our favor, but I couldn't disagree more with ""Much better option than Graham to take control of the offense."" Sato is a good player but have you ever watched Devonte play before lmao?"
Devonte Graham is going to appease Zion?
I'm looking forward to Devonte Graham resigning with us so I can finally re-sign from this sub
It hurts to lose him but drafting Bouknight and (hopefully) retaining Devonte Graham was the right choice
He's a player who 1000% relies on his 3p shot to fall. He has very little game inside the arc.  3p shooting is naturally very volatile but other players are able to have consistency by using other tools in their arsenal to even out that volatility. Even if its someone like Jimmy Butler who amazing at getting to the foul line when his jumper isn't falling. Devonte' Graham doesn't have other tools in his arsenal. So his overall scoring is going to be just as volatile as his 3p shooting is
"&gt;already having 1 player makes us better than most teams  Yeah I totally agree, I guess I kind of misinterpreted the point that OP was trying to make. Trae is the distinguishing factor, watching the Hawks' playoff run made that pretty clear. You can't consider your young core on par with theirs until you have a superstar at that level.  That being said, I think the rest of the young talent on the Hornets is at least comparable to the Hawks. Miles Bridges/PJ Washington are similar tier prospects to DeAndre Hunter/Cam Reddish, John Collins is a tier above right now but tbh I have faith that Miles can reach that level of production next season. Possible we lose one of them this summer but Devonte Graham/Malik Monk is a similar level to Kevin Huerter. We're kind of just banking on LaMelo having Trae Young-type progression through his 2nd/3rd season to try and be as competitive as they were but obviously there's no guarantee in that happening."
"Devonte Graham is interesting.  Good enough for the nba, but not on a rebuilding team that wants to go somewhere and compete.      The kind of player that gets sucked into the 5th circle of hell in Dante's Inferno    The Sacramento Kings"
big facts   the Thunder were offering a fantastic young player plus pick 6 and nobody was biting   warriors could have gotten like maybe Devonte Graham
Hope it also means that nobody is tryna pay Devonte Graham shit lol
"We were literally 4th in the East and right at .500 until:  Gordon Hayward gets hurt.  LaMelo gets hurt.  Devonte Graham hurts his hip.  Miles Bridges gets Covid.  Cody Zeller gets hurt and misses some time.   We're not nearly as bad as most people want to think we are. Kai Jones is raw, yes, but he could easily be an excellent player down the road. Obviously hard to tell right now, so it's foolish to think--today--that whoever the Knicks *might* get will be better than Kai.   Lot of NY copium in this thread."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Devonte Graham is like 26
"If they can't trade for anybody, I feel like an underrated option would be Devonte' Graham. Not a top PG or anything but his shooting and passing would make him a great fit with Zion."
"Well the Hornets' best scorers may have been Terry Rozier, LaMelo Ball, and Devonte' Graham, who are all known as PGs mostly. So if you take out 1 PG and add a SG, your balance may be a little better.  (Rozier and Ball can basically be SGs, but Graham is pretty small.)"
"Good post but  &gt; PG Devonte' Graham was their most active long bomber (firing away 8+ three-point attempts per game) but he's a free agent. Ellington would be a sensible replacement and fit in as a more natural SG.   This part doesn’t really make any sense to me though, I don’t see why their positions matter"
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn’t be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"Doncic, Curry, Devonte Graham, Klay, KD, Jokic, Rozier, Middleton, Murray, Pritchard, LaMelo, Kvon, Herro, Ersan, Barea."
"They probably offering them for like Terry Rozier and a Devonte Graham S&amp;T to us. No will do, LeGM"
"Fantasy was the easiest way for me to gauge the depth in each position. SF has a couple of top heavy guys like LeBron, PG, Kawhi, KD, Butler, Tatum, Ingram then it's a big drop-off to someone like MPJ or Hayward.   PGs you have all 30 starting PGs who are viable options and a couple off the bench like Smart, Devonte Graham, Clarkson, Rose, etc"
Yeah this was expected after devonte graham posted Liangelo working out with the hornets on his insta
Biggest need is obviously center. They actually have a fair bit of cap space and Holmes is the best center on the FA market. I’m not sure what they end up doing about Devonte Graham given that they already have Ball and Rozier but Terry is on an expiring
"The time is perfect for this to happen. Plenty of Alums from KU, KState, and Mizz that would draw interest if we were able to get one or two on a team. Imagine if we got Joel, Wiggins,Morris twins, Svi, Josh Jackson, Devonte Graham, Mason, MPJ and his brother...the fan base is already built in here. We have a fantastic arena that we have proven at a national level that can support and host major events (NCAA Tournament rounds, Big 12 Tournament ECT) The Power and Light District across the street from the arena for an all around great experience when going to a game. Yes we have 3 professional sports teams in our market...but remember this isn't the 90s/ 00s anymore. We have EXPLODED in growth since then. And when we had the Kings her last, Kansas City wasn't built to support them. But our city has become great over time and we have gotten the chance to show that we do support our teams passionately. Two World Series appearances and two Superbowl appearances while wining one of each as well as MLS Championship Cup...all of this has happened within the last decade or so? I think it's the perfect time to bring an NBA team into our market if done correctly. Look at OKC, I don't think they had any idea an NBA team would be a success there until The Hornets and CP3 came and made the city their temporary home after Katrina hit New Orleans. It's, different for KC I believe. There isn't much guess work on wether or not there would be support and interest for a team when you look at the success the NCAA has had here. Those players that we watched grow up in college eventually become household names in the league,"
"OKC Thunder is a perfect example! And they are a way smaller market than Kansas City. The people of Oklahoma City had no idea they would enjoy an NBA team really, until Katrina hit N.O. and the Hornets needed a place to play while N.O. was rebuilt. It was a smash success.   Growing up watching KU dominate our local area and conference for so many years gave me a passion for the sport. Now that I am older and can watch all the guys I grew up watching at KU play in the league, I have become a pretty big NBA fan. I believe with what we have shown by hosting the Big 12 (R.I.P. soon) and NCAA Tournament rounds that we have the interest in basketball as a sport already built in and have show we have the capability to host NBA events. It's all about the Benjamin's...and something tells me that it would blow up. Imagine the people that would go to games just to watch their favorite local college stars in the league. We have 3 major universities that are supported in our city. Imagine a new KC team with Mizz star Michael Porter Jr on the squad. Or maybe reunite KU teammates, starter for Charlotte Devonte Graham and G-League monster Frank Mason ( Still don't understand why he doesn't play in the regular league!)? I can't think of anyone good from K State cause they suck and Mizz got lucky they had MPJ one year... ANYWAYS...You see the picture unfolding? It's the perfect recipe for success for the NBA and Kansas City. I honestly have no idea what goes into making that happen, but I feel like it would be a foolish to ignore the potential it could bring to my city."
"Capela might become an all star, Porzingins can become a beast again, Devonte Graham will go to a contender (I'd see the Lakers) and play awesome"
DeVonte graham is total dogshit and peaks as a backup point guard
Man is some team really gonna give DeVonte Graham a 4 yr $75 mil type contract. And im higher on Graham than most but that is some healthy bit of change.
