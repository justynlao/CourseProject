"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, ‚Äúthe best defense is more offense‚Äù. We should just double down on the offense. Let‚Äôs get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."

"Hunter and I don't think it's close. Better on defense and a better shooter. I think his style is just more effective than Zion's.  Is Zion really anything more than a really strong and athletic Zach Randolph? All he does is score efficiently in the paint and pretty much nothing else. Can't shoot, can't defend, can't pass/make plays. Might as well have Enes Kanter on your team."
"I remember the day we traded Enes Kanter away, I was SO GODDAMN EXCITED for Rudy to get into the starting lineup."
Hey we also took enes kanter
https://youtu.be/y9jhOc7T7Uc  ENES KANTER
Yeah when he carried the team and had such super stars around him like;  - Not good yet Oladipo  - Bad defense Enes Kanter   - Jerami Grant before this year   - Steven Adams who was actually pretty good.   - Ersan Ilyasova before he went to the Bucks for the 237th time.   Yeah those teams were totally loaded with talent feeding him stats.
"Stotts has had several good defences in his reign in Portland. Our biggest issue this season is that we were having to compensate for Nurk not being 100% and for Enes Kanter being Enes Kanter  Our bench is the worst defensive unit in the NBA. There isn‚Äôt much you can do to compensate for Kanter, Melo, an injured Rodney Hood and Anfernee Simons being terrible defenders"
"I just looked it up he played the 5 less than I remembered but that said last year when he did Kings had a net +16 rating in about 450 min of it. He's not a good defender which is the concern but I also dont think he's at the absolute bottom tier Enes Kanter level barbecue chicken.   So same trade off we were talking about again you are picking one of the two only this time by picking offense you are picking a legit offensive weapon. One reason why Im lukewarm on some of those typical floor stretching offensive 5s is they legit do nothing but hit spot up 3s for value. Bjelica is a real weapon offensively can pass, can play in the post even drive a little. He also by floor spacing isnt just only take wide open 3s if they are there like most bigs, he will legit bomb away. That +16 net rating was driven by a 121 offensive rating backup units wont know how to handle him and Simmons where I think the offensive benefits are actually worth it in majority of matchups.   Should note I wouldnt exclusively use him as a 5 or anything, Dwight wouldnt now get DNP-healthy scratched but it's another weapon and in key spots I would use him at the 5 over Dwight"
"Yeah, I'm curious too. Getting to the WCF with Enes Kanter and Al-Farouq Aminu as their frontcourt was huge.   I don't watch Blazers games, so to me, it looks like another year of unfortunate timing with injuries and Olshey bringing in bad talent (last year's Whiteside, this year Covington, who might just be the absolute worst player in the NBA on offense when you consider his contract and the fact that Olshey gave up a first for him), but maybe Coach Stotts isn't getting the most out of his guys."
"So Dame is better than Steph because his coach is stupid enough to play Anfernee Simmons, Enes Kanter and Melo together when Dame is off the court and because the Warriors bench is good ? Gotcha"

"u/-yico a Turkish person commented on gulen and erdogan.  Let me copy the text here.     As a Turkish boi, I felt like I need to explain certain things for you guys to have a better understanding about this situation.  First of all Enes Kanter publicly supports G√ºlen. G√ºlen was a somehow strong politic figure whose organization greatly helped Erdoƒüan to become politically relevant. So basically Erdoƒüan and G√ºlen were best friends for 20ish years. Together, they pretty much fucked this country up. Erdoƒüan even let G√ºlenists to look top secret military documents and Erdoƒüan jailed tons of people because they ""criticize"" G√ºlen. So by saying ""best friends"" I mean ""really best friends"". Later on Erdoƒüan found out G√ºlen was trying to stab him from behind and started to name him as ""terrorists"". People who support G√ºlen quickly became Erdoƒüan supporters, and most of them labeled themselves as Erdogan supporters just because their self-interest not fear.   After those event, G√ºlenist attempted a coup. Since they were like besties over those years, G√ºlenists were common in the Turkish Army. They failed yet killed 200ish people. Now government advertises the whole situation like Erdogan is the one who was against G√ºlen all the time and it is hilarious.  Both Erdogan supporters and G√ºlen supporters are mostly radical-islamist. Some supporters of Erdoƒüan compares him to Prophet I mean fuck my life those guys are freaks and they are earning too much money (thanks to Erdoƒüan! Government is corrupted) they continue to make up those bullshit statements. Now Erdoƒüan is basically a simple minded dictator who can not even stand to criticism.  But Gulen is fucking maniac. He states that he can see see future or talk to god I mean he is nuts. His supporters believe whatever he touches, it becames something sacred. In one of his recent videos, G√ºlen was drinking a cup of tea and after he finished it he said ""Give this cup to Enes Kanter."" I MEAN WHAT THE FUCK MAN.  Basically it does not mean if you are against Gulen you are supporting Erdogan. Almost half of the population of Turkey believes and trusts Erdoƒüan that is so fucking pathetic. Other half is mostly leftists but somehow more educated then the other part and do not buy their bullshit.  So what is my opinion about this particular situation? I dont even feel sorry for Enes Kanter and other Turkish players are doing their best by not talking to him. He supports a freak and government is a dictatorship. I wouldnt even talk to Enes either. You can not say they are Erdoƒüan supporters."

"lollll definitely not. One GTJ hasn't been our 2nd best player anyway.  Two Nurk came in with zero offseason after staying in bosnia dealing with family COVID issues and was super out of shape.  Even with that we were an average defense while he was on the floor. That's massive for a team that's 28th in defensive rating.  He's now had 3 months to get into shape(only dealing with a wrist break) and he put up 18-10-4-2 in the bubble just 6 months ago.    Not to mention we're talking about going from playing Enes Kanter 26 minutes a game against starters with either Harry Giles or Roco having to back him up, to Kanter playing those minutes against bench players and replacing Giles minutes with Nurkic.

"If Shaq could put himself into his 2001 body and enter he league today and play the game the way he wants to see guys like Embiid play, he would basically be a 40/20 threat any given night and regarded as one of the most unstoppable offensive players of all time (again, and probably even moreso now) but would be considered an Enes Kanter-level liability on defense for his lack of lateral quickness and off-ball attentiveness on that end, unless guys charged right at him trying to dunk, and even and especially then he would just rack up so many fouls he'd have to sit most of every 4th quarter because of how protected offensive players are. That's not even getting into the fact that zone defense wasn't allowed during Shaq's peak, so come playoff time guys would wall off the paint and render him useless, so he'd wind up on the bench in favor of....yep, a guy who shoots threes and can switch on defense.   And all of that is WITHOUT even mentioning how often he'd be getting hacked today."

"The worst thing LeBron ever did was not commit to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Had he done so instead of sign one or two year contracts, we would have had the promise of some stability when recruiting free agents and coaches. Instead, the best we could ever do before 2015 was sign guys like Larry Hughes and Mo Williams. Had he stuck to his guns and said we‚Äôre playing for MY team, Dwyane Wade and either Bosh or Chris Paul would have joined instead of them going to miami and we sleepwalk the East for the next 15 years. The biggest question mark is whether we draft Kyrie Irving with the Clippers‚Äô number one overall in 2011 and with Chris Paul and D Wade I don‚Äôt know that we do. At that point was the fo smart enough to avoid the mine field that separated 2 and 9? Best case scenario we draft Valanciunas as the heir apparent to Z but could have very well ended up with Derrick Williams, Enes Kanter, Jan Vesely, or Brandon Knight. On the other hand, maybe we look to add a sharp-shooting backup 2 guard with great defense and championship pedigree in Klay Thompson. Another question is whether David Griffen takes over the GM role? He made some brilliant moves that played a big part in our championship but would we have had a player like Kevin Love in 2015? Would his partnership with AD have started years earlier? Would peak Boogie Cousins or Lamarcus Aldridge have joined up? Would a real coach have come to Cleveland instead of the clown car of HCs we have had?  Safe to say he would have rings. Possible he would enjoy two long spells of consecutive championships broken up by a bad matchup here or there or its not outside the realm of possibility he wins a dozen or more rings"
I'd love one jamal Murray right now please  Enes Kanter is second on the team in win shares right now
The whole team is abysmal defensively. We have Enes Kanter as our rim protector. The real reason Dame's defense isn't talked about is because the whole team is terrible at defense so they don't have to target him like they did when Curry was playing with 4 great defenders every night.
"I swear Enes Kanter gets hit with the reverse of this sometimes, getting called for a phantom foul because of his rep as a bad defender."
G - Terry Rozier   G - DJ Augustin   F - Carmelo Anthony   F - Michael Porter Jr.  C - Enes Kanter
"you are right, he has nothing on enes kanter"
It's hilarious that a fan of a team that saw Rudy Gobert become a star after having to back up Enes Kanter don't understand how important defense is for a big man
He never played there he was deemed ineligible.  He did give us him coming out as the undertaker.[enes kanter big blue madness 2010](https://youtu.be/YE0LG-yLgrY)
"&gt; Enes Kanter  Gotta say, I had no idea Kanter attended Kentucky before this post"
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There‚Äôs also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"He was going against enes kanter and Harrell. But he also dominated Rudy gobert and was good vs poeltl, but he had some good matchups"
"Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond, Enes Kanter, Greg Monroe, Steven Adams, Allen Iverson"
"Yeah, that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre elite at everything. I mean, Enes Kanter is a well above average offensive nba player and he can‚Äôt even pass with his left hand"
"Tatum and Brown are studs and can definitely be part of a championship core in the future.  But last year, especially with Hayward out a few weeks of the playoffs, their lack of a bench really hurt them.  You can't win a championship when your bench is full of rookies, 2nd year players, Enes Kanter and Brad Wanamaker.  The Tristan Thompson/Jeff Teague signings were a good idea on paper but it hasn't really worked out."
Opposite ! I used to wonder why Enes kanter was the truth on all stats ! Watching him on Defense is the most pathetic thing ive ever seen ! Its like he cant move his feet because they are being held down ! His offensive rebounding tricked me ! He sucks !
"&gt; Missing both removes your rim protection, and your only other reliable ball handler.  Lmao that doesn't sound familiar AT ALL   &gt; Montrezl is a good player but his defense is so bad that without AD he becomes nearly unplayable.   We start Enes Kanter.  The Warriors are literally playing with no center.    &gt; You bringing up THT to show how good LeBrons supporting cast is should tell you all you need to know.  Bud you listing players while purposefully ignoring a guy that puts up 14-6 on 67% TS tells you all you need to know"
&gt; anything like he's Enes Kanter.  sigh. i can't wait until nurkic comes back. please come back soon.
"If you use your eyeballs, it's pretty obvious this is not the case. Not saying he's Mikal Bridges out there, but he doesn't get hunted in PNR or anything like he's Enes Kanter."
"C'mon!  A highlight of guy being ""guarded"" by Enes Kanter?  I'm not sure points scored against him should even count in a player's official stats.  The should at least make an advanced stat called ""Non-Kanter Points"".  :)"

"&gt; defensive system   You mean relying on Enes Kanter (and wait, Robert Covington himself) to protect the paint?"
"Enes Kanter @EnesKanter ¬∑ February 23rd, 2021 Take a freaking look at this please  @OfficialNBARefs   @NBAOfficial"
Gotta love the pure hatred Jokic has for Enes Kanter
Enes Kanter is the Turkish Andrew Schulz
Kanter is a bad defender but there's a whole lot of questionable defense on these clips other than Enes.  CP3 and Ayton create a lot of match up problems for this team.
"Oh damn, I looked at the wrong thing and thought I saw Rose on a cheaper contract. I messed up there. That's still cheapish in today's NBA, but I thought read he was on a lesser salary. That's my mistake.  I will say, not being stuck with Kemba's contract would have opened the door for a little more flexibility. We ended up with Tristan Thompson and Enes Kanter with our last MLEs. I would have preferred just upping Timelord's minutes over them 2. People always say players can't be traded such as Al Horford last year, but there's always a way to make something happen. This just sounds like more reason for me to not like our FO, because this screams mismanaged cap along with underwhelming roster construction."
"To go along with your number 1, veteran rotation players who are stuck on rebuilding teams and are not really needed by said rebuilding teams.  Last few years, the buyout market included Jeremy Lin, Markieff Morris, Ersan Ilyasova, Marco Belinelli, Wesley Matthews, Enes Kanter.  This year, I'd imagine George Hill is one of the most likely candidates."
"Dame's series against the Nuggets gets brought down a lot because he struggled in game 7 and CJ went off - no doubt about that. But in games 1-6 that means he was averaging 27/4/7 on 56% TS%, which is damn solid for being doubled. He had 2 really bad games (2/7) that kinda tanked his average. And even in those he was clutch af. Like when we needed him most in game 7, he scored. The biggest play of the game other than CJs midrange stepback was Dame stealing the ball off the inbounds from jokic with  3 minutes left and then hitting a 3 to put us up 7. Plus he was lockdown defensively since he knew his shot was off  Not to mention that wasn't even a favored matchup - the nuggets had swept us in the regular season 3-0, and we guarded the best offensive center in the NBA with a one armed fasting enes Kanter lmao  I just think he gets way way way too much shit for not being able to win it all, and not enough praise for being one of the biggest overachievers of the last 15 years from a team standpoint."
Not much he can do with that roster. They‚Äôre starting Enes Kanter at the most important defensive position.
"It's cyclical,   * Euros started off being underrated * Dirk paves the way becoming the first major European star. Pau Gasol soon follows as does Peja Stojakoviƒá. * GMs in the early 2000s want the next Dirk, spend high picks on players who are not good (e.g. Darko Milicic, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Yaroslav Koralev etc...)  * Euro players are now all busts again. * New Euro player makes it big (e.g. Tony Parker, Marc Gasol, Mehmet Okur) and the Euro hype begins again.  * GMs want the new international superstar/hidden gem. Instead draft busts like jan Vesely or not living up to their potential stars like Ricky Rubio, Enes Kanter or Jonas Valanciunas (all top 5 picks who failed to live up to the hype).  * Euros are back to being soft/not good again. This is why Porzi≈Üƒ£is got booed on draft night by his home ""fans"".  * New crop of Euro talent makes it big guys like Nikola Jokic, Giannis, Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Gobert and Luka dominate.  * Now GMs take a chance and take guys like Poku high in the draft.   Euros because there aren't as many are compared to their peers way more than an american player. The boom/bust scrutiny is 10fold it seems."
"Dame is also averaging mvp type numbers and has led his team, which is missing BY FAR their second best player, to the 4 seed. They‚Äôre constantly winning games with Gary Trent, a 36 year old melo, and Enes Kanter as their top scorers after dame.   Like dame is in somewhat of a similar situation except his team is somehow winning a lot of games and outperforming in a stupid strong western conference."
Elite rebounders know where the ball is likely to go just based on where on the court the shooter is. For example watch Enes Kanter fight for position before the shot enes goes up.
Enes kanter Gary Trent Jr
"Enes Kanter, man has literally every post move, and less emphasis on the pick and roll would make his defense more passable"
"Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter"
Enes  Kanter
"The Blazers roster around Dame for most of this season has been Robert Covington, Gary Trent, Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Jones, Anfernee Simons, Rodney Hood, and Harry Giles..."
Steph has the luxury to play off ball when he has a Draymond level facilitator to still run the offense without him. Who's gonna facilitate when Dame doesn't have the ball? Enes Kanter?
Enes Kanter
He just wanted to go head to head with him like he did with Enes Kanter but Moe pulled out the flop on him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuaVCPKhBJA
"It's tiresome the amount of dumbass comparisons that are getting thrown around using overall team success as a metric to compare players. The Blazers team was rough and has never once had the starpower the Warriors literally always have.  Are we seriously going to argue that a team whose best active 4/5 is Enes Kanter shouldn't be blown bout by Steph/Klay/Dray? Really? Or that a team with two all star scorers and two All NBA Defensive First team players/former DPOY shouldn't be able to guard Dame whose second option is a mediocre (at the time) CJ? Again, really?"
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
"He's not playing good D compared to many other centers in the league, but he's playing good D for Enes Kanter."
"They were, but Dame was playing hurt, and we had a ton of injuries as usual (Enes Kanter playing through a shoulder injury and fasting for Ramadan, among other players)"
1. Aron Baynes  2. Daniel Theis  3. Jonas Jerebko  4. Jared Sullinger  5. Enes Kanter
"With all the statistics thrown about, I'd like to focus on the narrative. It seems like every year the TrailBlazers are counted out due to injuries, lack of depth, or just plain lack of supporting talent for Dame. Every year he wills them to the playoffs. This is something even LeBron or Curry can't do. Admittedly, the playoff success has been mixed, but the Western Conference is a very difficult place to thrive.  This year, the Blazers started fairly poorly due to the wholesale changes in the lineup, which nevertheless added some crazy depth. Then the injury bug hit, taking out the 2nd and 3rd most valuable players along with others for shorter or longer periods. But Dame is making it work somehow. Other superstars might recognize that it's just not their year; Dame doesn't accept that.  Enes Kanter said something the other day that made me think. He said that he wanted to be the best back-up center in the league. It shows that Lillard's leadership has led to a self-awareness for all the players. Kanter is playing like the best back-up center right now-- consistent, active, and a beast on the boards. An MVP has to have statistics, for sure. But making those around him better is what separates Dame from even the most extravagantly gifted athletes."
"The Core 4 sounds quaint and delusional at this point, but it was our first set of lottery picks that we ‚Äúearned‚Äù in decades. Of the top of my head, I think Malone was our last.   They were: Rudy, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, and Enes Kanter.  Gorag Hoaghead could be included, but Tyronius The Lesser liked him.   God those were terrible years. Thankfully Q was hired to heal those wounds."
The players from that year who are still in the league:  Rudy Gobert  Derrick Favors  Gandalf Handlebars  Enes Kanter  Trey Burke  Alec Burks
"Trey Burke, Alec Burks, Gordon Hayward and Enes Kanter"
Rebounding is a much overrated defensive stat. Jokic and Enes FUCKING Kanter are both averaging 11 rpg no one would dare call them good defenders
Also this thing where Embiid's 2nd and 3rd best players are Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris and Dame's are Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr.  And he's in the west.
Enes Kanter  everybody always talk trash about this dude and yea he not perfect but he hustles 110% and is a double double machine ....glad he in a great role rn with Portland
we traded him for enes kanter. somehow.
Need to get Enes Kanter for the Turkish guy
"oh the lakers series that didn't have covington or djj? or nassir little? or rodney hood? or enes kanter? yeah it went pretty bad. still took 1 game, just like every other team the lakers beat on their way to a championship.   congrats on ""shredding"" portland missing their 2nd and 3rd best players, at home, and losing lmao. can't wait to watch zion leave your scrub ass city like AD did."
"You can see teams adjust to try and get Kanter off the boards. The more adjustments they have to make the better. In my mind Enes and Nurk aren‚Äôt far off. Personally I prefer Kanter. Nurk may be better, but I think The way the team plays with Enes is better."
"This team is completely different in flow and style with GTJ starting at SG than CJ. I fear that CJ will return and fuck up the defensive rhythm and chemistry with RoCo and DJJ. Yeah he'll score buckets, but he'll give up more on the other side. And another thing.... the Blazers are playing better with Kanter than Nurk. Enes' play meshes better with the rest of the team than Nurk. In my mind, CJ and Nurk are expendable, and would bring back a serious championship piece in a trade. I'll ride with Trent Jr and Kanter to the playoffs."
you guys are starting enes kanter. Why can't they?
Zion is just Enes Kanter with the hops
"This season, true.  Nurk showed up out of shape and Kanter is probably playing his best basketball ever right now.  His rebounding stats since Nurk went down, especially offensive rebounding, have been nuts.    Career wise, they do really different things and Nurk has overall been better.  Kanter has traditionally been an atrocious defender while Nurk has been an above average starting 5 defensively.  Nurk is also a better passer and an elite screen setter.  Enes is a better rebounder and is more consistent around the basket scoring-wise.  Neither are good at coming out of the key defensively."
"The dude is asked to do so much, literally carry the offense with CJ and Nurk out. But he hasn‚Äôt been perfect so shoutout to Trent Jr, Melo, and Enes Kanter for playing good ball as well on this recent stretch for POR"
"If we‚Äôre only considering the stretch of games while CJ and Nurk have been then Gary Trent Jr has been better than Wiggins. Wiggins has regressed on offense and floats in-and-out a lot. Also, people love to crap on Enes Kanter but he has played really well with Nurk injured. Anfernee Simmons has been shooting 48% since 48% on 3s since 1/24 per CJ McCollum Twitter. A lot of guys have stepped up for the Blazers."
"He already averaged 10 assists with that team, do you want him to put up 15 a night? He was OKC‚Äôs entire offense that season, and it‚Äôs not like it was entirely by choice. When he sat that team went to shit. His best offensive threats were a raw Dipo and Enes Kanter."
I thought he was a great rebounder but when we played the Cavs last week Enes Kanter treated him like a child. The dude looks like he didn't care at all out there
You have a westbrook flair my guy I wouldn't be talking.  How many players in the league you think could have their team 16-10 with Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr as their next best players?
Yeah no way we beat you without Nurkic healthy starting Enes Kanter.   Wait.

Enes Kanter balled out too
It's not though.  We're 15-10 despite having Enes Kanter and GTJ as our second and third options for lots of the season.  You guys aren't even .500 with KP and Hardaway.
"Even out of shape Nurk is a vastly better defender than Kanter. I love Enes. He's a fucking warrior, who rebounds as well as anyone and has a surprisingly sophisticated footwork/post game down low. But despite his efforts, he's a liability on D, and any time with Dame and CJ up top needs a center who is a plus at the rim *and* in the P\&amp;R; Kanter is neither."
Also people forget that the Zach Collins and Enes Kanter frontcourt is what got them to the WCF 2 years ago
"Blazers when healthy has a bench of   - Anfernee Simons - Gary Trent  - Carmelo Anthony - Zach Collins - Enes Kanter  As well as Rodney hood, Harry Giles and Nasir Little"
Enes Kanter was my best waiver pick up of the season. Dude is too consistent
Enter: Enes Kanter
It‚Äôs interesting cause a lot of that has to do with teams forgoing offensive rebounds to get back on defense so a lot of players have simply stopped boxing out on the defensive glass. This actually gives a huge advantage to guys like enes kanter so it‚Äôs a bit of cyclical effect
Enes Kanter was the 2nd best player on the team. A guy who has struggled to get a starting job anywhere in the league
"""The Living Embodiment of the Divine Masculine"" - Enes Kanter, Terry Rozier and Luke Kennard"
"I‚Äôve watched them both play. Steph would not do better than dame, unless he got to take draymond green with him. The blazers have no secondary playmaking, even when McCollum isn‚Äôt hurt. I was definitely exaggerating but there‚Äôs a reason Jones jr, Enes Kanter, and and anfernee simons aren‚Äôt playoff starters on other teams haha. Lillard might do worse, but I think Steve Kerr is a good coach, and he would have draymond, so maybe not."
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."

enes kanter is the most underrated player in the league  he provides so much compared to what he's now paid and what people think he gives
It really is a travesty that Enes Kanter isn't a good defender. He'd be a top 20 player.

"Garbage team with garbage players such as, *checks notes*, Victor Oladipo, Steven Adams, Andre Robertson (one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA before he died or whatever happened to him), Jerami Grant, Sabonis, Enes Kanter. Adams and Kanter were at their peaks. The rest were obviously not as good as they are now, Sabonis in particular was basically a scrub, but they also improved significantly once leaving WB's shadow, Oladipo immediately so. I'd argue playing with him made them look worse than they actually were because the offense was all about WB, all the time. What he accomplished that season was impressive, but basketball is about winning championships, not dragging people to the first round before promptly getting your ass kicked by a Houston team with the guy you beat for MVP surrounded by a slightly better roster. As for Steve Kerr, yes, I'll give you that one but WB has proven that he's not quite the most coachable fellow in the league. I don't want to take away from that point tho because it was super impressive what WB did. It just wasn't championship-level good. Personally, I didn't think he deserved the MVP that year, Harden did. And since then, triple doubles have become mundane, which kind of takes the shine off what he accomplished because to me, it's clear it's as much a factor of the insane pace of the league nowadays as it is a testament to his greatness (which it still is, don't get me wrong).  As for the efficiency argument, yeah, you're right. It's not the end all be all. However, it is when you have two guys averaging about the same amount of points, lol. Please don't tell me you really believe that Westbrook was ever close to Steph on that front, it will break my heart how far education standards have fallen if I need to explain why a guy who regularly flirts with 50/40/90 is better that a guy who never got past 35% from deep. I think you're too smart for that, nobody who could read my smug, annoying arguments and keep going could be otherwise.  We are literally watching Steph play on an equivalent or worse team than that OKC squad and average numbers equal to the greatest offensive season of all time. He is clearly miles ahead of Westbrook. The only reason it might have been kind of close if you make really charitable arguments and ignore the eye test was when Steph first had trouble playing next to KD. But he finished that season tearing through the Western Conference and the playoffs. Yeah he had a better team. Now he has a much worse team than before and he's playing just as good. Yes, he is in fact dragging a sorry-ass team the same way WB did. Have you seen Dray's numbers this year? Only difference is Steph's doing it on a minutes restriction. Anyways, sorry for yelling."
"He is the best perimeter defender.  That said, the impact Rudy Gobert makes is insane. He doesn‚Äôt even have to block it, or have a hand in the face to affect the shot. Grant Williams literally air balled a two footer because Rudy was standing their.   A three contested by Trae Young will be missed more then a layup contested by Enes Kanter. I think interior defense is just more important.  Gobert is a lock in my books for DPOY unless he gets injured or something. This isn‚Äôt to disrespect Ben tho, his defense is still incredible."
"You can't be serious lmao, Sabonis was a rookie who averaged 6ppg that year who by the end of the year was benched in favor of a declining Taj Gibson and Steven Adams that year scored over 10ppg for the first time in his career with a scorching 11. Oladipo was decent offensively coming in but was at best a good role player not a second star yet. Like Enes Kanter took the third most shots that year, literally no one considers a team decent when Enes Kanter is getting that many shots.   Like if you didn't watch them play that year just say that, nobody at the time was considering Sabonis a key contributor or Steven Adams as more than an okay starter. The team looking back has some good names on it but that was way before they developed the games that they have today"

"Like the others have said, a shoot-out favours the Nets.   But if you're dead set on wanting to look at defending Embiid then LMA and DJ are the two big names to look at.   Embiid is freakishly big and freakishly talented but he always plays big before he plays talented. His first option is to try and bully you. The first step to slowing him down is having big post-defending bodies.   Compare:  * Enes Kanter - He's a terrible overall defender but in the post, he's hard to move and he wears you down.   * Myles Turner, Jarret Allen, Robert Williams - They're all really great defenders but they're too small and big post scorers walk over them.   So when it comes to guarding Embiid, you'd actually prefer to have Enes Kanter over the other better defenders.    So now let's look at LMA and DJ for the Nets:  * They're too old and slow to keep up with smaller guards - But Philly doesn't really have guards who can attack them  * They have the size, strength and experience to make Embiid earn his points in the post  They won't be amazing but they should be pretty serviceable in this specific matchup."
"He is above average, but the question is he better than Clint Capela, Baynes,Enes Kanter i would say no."
&gt;the best player on the floor in Luka Doncic.  Suns abuse Luka Doncic similar to how most teams abuse Enes Kanter. Just terrible on defense and makes it very easy for the Suns to win even when they fielded terrible teams these last 3 years.   &gt;The Nets were 4-0 on LeBron during the 2013-2014 season and lost 4-1 during the playoffs.   The Nets didn't have like +5 advantage in net rating over Lebron though I imagine. This isn't just the case where one team does much better than the other team when they vs each other in a sample size but worse against every other team. The Suns have been a much better team overall with the 2nd best net rating in the league and 2nd best record. Even if you only look at the timeframe when Mavs were mostly healthy since like February Suns have also been much better as well. The Heat were the 2nd seed while the Nets were the 6th. If you want to go by the 2013-2014 season the Suns would be like the Heat and the Mavs would be like the Bobcats who were 7th seed. The Heat had the better record on average vs everyone as well as vs the Bobcats.
Same for us and we‚Äôve been starting Enes Kanter. There was an instantly noticeable improvement when Nurkic came back
"They are both elite big men who can hit three/mid range shots to space the floor. They are great FT shooters as well for their size.       Tough to compare their full career given their growth as players combined with injuries, but took from their 3rd year onward:       Jokic 52/36/84, 20/11/7/1.3stl/0.7blk  KP 44/36/80, 21/8/1.5/0.7/2.1blk       I love Jokic and think hes an incredible player who should be the front runner for MVP, but in this comparison, there are only 4 teams.  When the other centers are Enes Kanter &amp;Nurkic (who combined for 54 threes in their career) and rookie James Wiseman, i would put KP closer to the Jokic side of that spectrum (and even this isnt meant as a knock on these players, its simply talented veteran bigs who can space the floor that are focal points of their teams vs bigs who serve more as roleplayers)"
"utah jazz 2011 draft. alec burks and enes Kanter. that couldve been klay and kawhi or klay and vucevic. I think kanter and burks couldve been really good, but kanter never comitted defensively amd burks hust never met his full potential. that draft reaches its full potential utah wouldve not had that dry period between the deron draft and donovon and rudy gelling together"
"Sly cop out to avoid addressing other parts of the argument because you know you're arguing a ridiculous point.  Jokic is a bad defender, especially because he's a Center so his defense is more relevant than if he were a Point Guard. Tape will tell you that. He's also tied for 2nd worst with Enes Kanter (last I checked) in opposing defensive FG% at the rim; he gives up like 66%+ of attempts at the rim when tracked, if you want to use advanced stats there.  Even if you argue Jokic is an average defender you still have no argument for him being Top 5 All Time. Of Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Shaq and Hakeem, name 1 player he's better than there."
"Those two are joined by Ersan Ilyasova, Enes Kanter, and probably Domantas Sabonis."

"Not that difficult. Lillard has has an outstanding season, leading less a than stellar supporting cast to a good record, largely on the strength of clutch heroics. The Blazers have had to play Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, and Anfernee Simons for significant minutes this year. They are known defensive sieves. Lillard is not a great defender himself, so he just makes sure that his team scores more than the other. Now that they are getting more healthy, their defensive rating will go from historically bad to just bad, and their offensive will stay the same. Their net rating will improve, and they will climb slightly in the standings."
"Yep, no one else could waste prime defensive players like Enes Kanter all season."
"I'm not really sure how good a defense a coach is realistically expected to generate with Dame, CJ, Robert Covington, Gary Trent Jr. Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter lead the team in minutes so far this season.   Some of that is on the coach for managing rotations, but a lot of that is injuries and personnel."
"That takes into account the last 3 years, so basically the last 2 playoffs for Harrell.  Whilst I'm sure his grandmother's death affected him, it's more about his skillset and that skillset not being conducive to the playoffs.   That guy who tweeted what I originally posted is the BBALL Index founder and Lakers fan, and what he said is on point, bigs who are post scorers on offense or anchor bigs on defense have a lot less value in the playoffs.   Conversely, bigs that are stretch bigs on offense or mobile bigs on defense, have a lot more value in the playoffs.  Think about it logically, it makes sense. It's why somebody like Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson (god damn it Danny Ainge), Drummond, Harrell etc. aren't valuable in the playoffs, whereas bigs like Ibaka, Gorgui Dieng are what everybody wants.   Celtics played Theis over Kanter in the playoffs for most of last season. Raptors were dominant whenever they played Ibaka in the playoffs last season, but thankfully they didn't play him enough minutes, and we high PnRed Gasol to death when he was out there and exploited him."
"&gt; help defender, he was terrible  Hard to be a good help defender when the defender just runs past Booker or Isaiah Canaan on offense with a new unproven Headcoach.  &gt;A big man that can switch is nice, but rim protection, help defense/nuanced pnr defense is way more important,  The part where bigman struggle with pnr defense is the lateral quickness which Ayton had plenty of and was able to use very effectively. He just had rookie year lapses which was normal but seemed worse than they were due to how bad of a team he was on defensively. The Suns were the 2nd worst team in the league ahead of only the Cavaliers.   &gt;IMO.  You watched Suns games? I hope you don't get offended but I just gotta call bullshit on this. Telling me the fan of a borderline east playoff team was watching a lot of tape of the worst western conference team in the league? Ayton was reason number 5 why they had bad defense out of the the 5 starters on that team.  &gt;least be average at that as a center or you destroy your teams defense.  That is just the thing, Ayton didn't destroy the teams defense. In fact the team was significantly better with Ayton on defense (and offense). Gave up 2.2 less points per 100 whenever he was on the court.   &gt;of course he wasn't Enes Kanter, but if Kanter is the comp every defensive center is fine lol  I only used Kanter to illustrate that perimeter defense is where centers who are bad at defense generally lack. Ayton was already pretty good at this his rookie year and by his sophomore year he was one of the best in the league with Bam. By his third year, he is anchoring a top 5 defense. No way he went from ""terrible"" on defense his rookie year to one of the best defensive centers in the league after 3 years (in which two of them are shortened)"
"Ayton was a good switch defender, but he absolutely sucked as a help defender, he was terrible IMO. A big man that can switch is nice, but rim protection, help defense/nuanced pnr defense is way more important, you have to least be average at that as a center or you destroy your teams defense. of course he wasn't Enes Kanter, but if Kanter is the comp every defensive center is fine lol"
"&gt; He's kinda like a worse rookie Ayton defensively, and Ayton is now a good defender (worth noting that I'm not sure he has THAT level of lateral quickness)  I maintain that Ayton bad defense was overblown. He was really good at perimeter defense right away which is often the big weakness of poor defensive bigman like Enes Kanter. Like whenever Ayton is switched onto a guard, I am always excited to see what happens and this has been the case since his rookie year whereas with Kanter, I am expecting BBQ chicken. Ayton also played the 4 in college and didn't get a lot of blocks and was on a terrible defensive team at the U of A so he got a lot of the blame for that (but still made all pac 12 defensive team and that UofA team was terrible at defensive the year before as well). Similarly, he got the blame for Suns terrible defense his rookie year as well which was also unfair."
"Well duh, shouldn't be hard dunking over Enes Kanter and Camerlo Anthony"
"It's definitely gonna be enough lmao, Dame has to work through Jrue and Giannis and D while Giannis gets to dunk on Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony"
Enes Kanter and Steven Adams starting next to each other for a series was one of the last tall ball successful post season series win
"Why does it have to be title teams?  Derek Fischer 2012.  Birdman 2013.  Boris Diaw 2012.  Joe Johnson 2016.  Enes Kanter 2019.  And in 2020 we have a ton of guys who made contributions including Marvin Williams, Jeff Green, Markieff Morris, Reggie Jackson."
"Yeah, but they play defense, so they don't hemorrhage points even if they struggle scoring. There's two sides of the ball. The warriors are a really solid defensive team this season   Bro, Dame just had a significantly better record with both CJ and nurkic out  He just **did** do better with a worse roster. Dames got the 29th ranked defense around him and had **Gary Trent Junior and Enes Kanter** as his second and third best players for 30 games. Look at our record"
"Backup PG =&gt; Brunson  Consistency =&gt; Too vague so I don't know what you mean by that  Rebounding =&gt; Who should we trade for? Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capela , Enes Kanter , Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson?  I suppose we should offer their current team all our first round picks and give them a max contract post trade.  I think you are searching too hard for holes. Mavs don't need to be perfect to become champions. A little better team than right now and with some winners luck, they can get it done."
"Back in the 2008, the Blazers had Darius Miles. He was being payed like $18 million which was an absurdly high amount for the cap at that time, and he physically could not play basketball anymore. Like, his knees were *gone*. He'd had microfracture surgery.   The Blazers had at least three different doctors evaluate Miles who all concurred that if he kept playing professional basketball he'd wind up in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. At least one of those doctors was *chosen by Miles* and another was *chosen by the NBPA*.  With this information, the Blazers waived him with a medical retirement. What this means is that Miles still gets payed his full contract, but his contract no longer counts for the Blazers cap. In addition, Miles was suspended for 10 games by the league for substance abuse and hadn't played a professional game in 2 years.  This was obviously convenient for the Blazers. But it wasn't bullshit.  If Miles played 10 games or more the following season though, league rules would make Miles contract apply to the Blazers cap again despite the medical waiver. During the pre-season, the Celtics signed him to an unguaranteed contract and played him in every pre-season game. (Eight games I believe.)  Again, the medical stuff wasn't made up by the Blazers, it wasn't their doctors only that made the determination.  The Celtics waived him before the season started. They never had any intention of actually making use of Miles, because the guy couldn't play professional basketball anymore.  Well, the Grizzlies signed him anyway and put his contract back on the Blazers cap.  The Blazers never made so much as a *pick swap* with Memphis again until *this year* when Memphis facilitated our trade of Mario Hezonja for Enes Kanter with, ironically, the Celtics. But the Blazers basically totally froze out Memphis from anything involving us for over a decade."

Come on man. You have to know that's laughably bad logic.   PG has a vastly better roster around him. He isn't even the best player on his own team. They'd better be ahead of us lol  Blazers are barely behind the clippers in the standings despite CJ and Nurkic each missing 30 games  Like our 2nd and 3rd best players this season have been Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Junior. Let's replace them with Kawhi and see how good we are
"Do you actually know how many good *low cost* (&lt;12 mil.) veteran (&gt;8 years in the league) guys that have gone to Boston the last 5 years? Because I'd be happy to list them out.  Tristan Thompson and Enes Kanter are the closest 2 approximations of MLE vets or older composed role players that Boston has had in the last 5 years and both haven't really been contributors of JJ's caliber *even with him having a bad year this year.* I think it's absolutely fair to say that Boston, a team that has been to the ECF 3 times in the last 4 years, should be an attractive destination to the JJ Reddick types yet they're not."
Drafting Enes Kanter.
I‚Äôve seen enes Kanter block a shot.
Enes Kanter wants his joke back
@the club w Dame:  ‚ÄúAYE REMEMBER WHEN I COULD HAVE SIGNED WITH THE LAKERS? DO YALL REMEMBER I COULD BE PLAYING WITH AD INSTEAD OF ENES KANTER? REMEMBER GUYS?!‚Äù
Andre Drummond? Remains to be seen. But his salary is 29 mill this year and the lakers got him for pennies. By all accounts a player of this magnitude should be able to be with a team that is maxed out on cap. But here we are.   Enes kanter helped a Portland team to reach the conf finals.
"He's been absolutely amazing.  After a slow start he's up to 38% from 3 now, and he's ridiculous on defense.  I think now that we don't have Enes Kanter guarding(heh) the rim he's going to really shine.  He can't stay in front of people super well 1v1 but he makes so so many plays it's wild. He's been our 2nd best player during the stretch without CJ and Nurk imo"
"Well, if you actually look at the history of the buyout market instead of just talking out of your ass, you‚Äôll realize that you don‚Äôt have to have that either.  Look at the 2019 buyout market. Some of the big finds there were Enes Kanter signing with the Blazers, Wesley Matthews signing with the Pacers, Markieff Morris signing with the Thunder, Austin Rivers signing with the Rockets, and Jeremy Lin signing with the Raptors.  None of those teams are traditional big-market teams, and you can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I don‚Äôt think any of those teams had one of the two greatest players of all time either.  I know people love to be prisoners of the moment, but come on, that was only 2 years ago, so we shouldn‚Äôt have completely forgotten about all of that by now."
ORTG is incredibly dependent on how good a team is overall offensively. Enes Kanter has the 5th best ORTG in the league as of right now. That‚Äôs more reflective of the Blazers being a good offensive team them him being an elite offensive player
"Yes they would. We know, because Dame had a worse team this season for 31 games and we did way better.  The Blazers went 18-13 with Gary Trent Junior as our 2nd best player because Nurkic and CJ were both out. Dude is 22 year old. We gave big minutes to Anfernee Simons (21) and Nassir Little (20). Steph isn't the only one with bad and young teammates  Wiggins is literally scoring more a game *and* scoring more efficiently than Trent.  Think Oubre's 52% TS% is bad? Try Rodney Hood's **league worst 43.6%**  Harden and Dame are flat out better at carrying a team than Curry is (and Harden is just a better player at this point). Dame would kill to have someone like Draymond on this team to beat traps and an actual defense around him instead of **the 29th ranked defense in the NBA** because Enes Kanter was our rim protector and only big on the roster."
Your so blinded by Giannis hate you really can't acknowledge that he having the better season.  Jokic's defense is Enes Kanter level bad is also the reason your not the first seed.
"He leads the entire history of NBA in rebounding percentage so yes, it's not hyperbole at all. But the top 10 also consists the likes of Reggie Evans, Enes Kanter, Kevin Love so it's not the best defensive list."
imagine going from a rotation of two elite rim protectors (nurk and zach collins) to enes kanter and no other centers lol
Enes Kanter but thinks he's prime Dwight Howard
Considering the alternatives are Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony as a small ball 5 I'd say it's impossible to overrate his importance for their defense \^\^
Imagine running defensive line-ups with Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter.  It's like asking a fat kid to watch the pie.
"The blazers big 4 consisting of Enes Kanter, Derrick Jones jr, CJ McCollum, and Robert Covington combined for 62!"
"&gt; We are the only team with a winning record and a negative point differential.   If you told our subreddit in December that Nurk and CJ would miss 55 combined games by the end of March and we'd still be ten games over .500, nobody would have cared what the point differential was. We're on a 50-win pace (for an 82 game season). You think coaching played no part at all in eking out win after win in close games?  &gt;We also have consistently one of if not the worst defense in the league.  We have a very good defensive big and a good defensive backup on the roster and both missed most/all of the season, and have ended up having to play Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony major minutes at the 4 and 5 instead . The last two seasons Nurk was healthy for we ranked 16th and 8th defensively. I don't see how this is on Stotts at all.   &gt; Dame and CJ are spectacular and carry out offense consistently   They don't do that despite Stotts. He knows what their strengths are and puts them in a position to succeed and the result has been an elite offense every year of his tenure here, Dame's rookie year being the sole exception (when the starting lineup was great but we had a historically unproductive bench). That's not some fluke.   Nurk back will hopefully add some more ball movement and consistency to the offense, at any rate."
"We‚Äôve started Enes Kanter for the majority of the season, your basically capped out at ‚Äúvery bad‚Äù defensively when that is the case  Why wouldn‚Äôt we play to the strengths of our two ball dominant offensively elite guards? A coaches job is to put players in position to succeed and we‚Äôve done that pretty consistently during Stotts time in Portland  You can criticise him but wanting him fired is ridiculous"
"Leo, after OG drives in Kanter: ""not a lot of guys wanna go at Kanter like that""  What you smoking Leo? Enes is a pylon on d.."
"Is this satirical? We‚Äôre talking about basketball.   Jesus.  When it‚Äôs absolutely irrelevant, you get political. When it actually matters, it‚Äôs either silence or brazen stupidity.   I‚Äôm talking about Enes Kanter talking trash, saying Zion is Randle with hops. Your response is to say he‚Äôs fleeing from his home country. Get some perspective.   God damn I fucking hate this sub. Really, you guys are awful."
Do you guys think Enes Kanter feels bad that both Julius Randle and Zion Williamson are far better then he could ever hope to be?
"The other part of it is a player like Enes Kanter can improve super teams anyway lol, you take a team with 3 stars in other positions and then pick up Enes Kanter and that moves the needle. People are really delusional."
"It‚Äôs such a shit logic too, not even him being a dick. Take someone like Enes Kanter, who may not be the best player on the court, and put him on a high school team. Who wins? If every player in the league was as good as LeBron or KD or whatever, they wouldn‚Äôt be considered superstars"
"So, let me get this straight... Your argument is that if more players were stars there would be more superteams? Okay, I guess I can't argue with you there, it's just a completely asinine statement.   Also, in what universe is Enes Kanter a bad player? Lol."
Enes Kanter is the reason the Blazers aren‚Äôt a super team? This makes no sense.
Eh we will see.  Have to remember we're starting Enes Kanter right now and have no backup center.  The same lineup this year with an out-of-shape Nurkic was average defensively.
Our fans overate our roster to an extreme degree. We‚Äôre bad defensively but like...we‚Äôre starting Enes Kanter and have like 2.5 good defenders
"Not to mention that post the other day where someone showed Jokic defends the rim the worst in the league, with around 68% of attempts at the rim going in, IIRC  When a Nuggets fan furiously 'fact checked' his point, he found that Jokic is actually at 66% at the rim, which is tied for 2nd worst, along with Enes Kanter.   Jokic's bad defense is also verified by the eye test."
"Watch the games; individual defense can't be entirely captured in advanced stats. Jokic would 4 hands wouldn't even be half the defender LeBron is.  LeBron is leading the #1 Defense in the league by far without his DPOY runner up from last year and is doing better in those defensive advanced stats than Jokic (D net rating, D win shares, opposing FG, etc). LeBron also passes the vaunted eye test clearly.  Also, isn't Jokic tied for 2nd worst in the league at FG% defending at the rim, tied with Enes Kanter? Lmao, let's get this straight; no offense Jokic fans, but considering he's a Center, Jokic is a *terrible* defender."
"Enes Kanter would be a great option for whoever the #1 defensive team in the league is. If you don't need him to play defense or score and you just want tons and tons of rebounds, he's absolutely your guy.  Unfortunately we're trash at defense and he's part of why."
yeah enes kanter noped out of like 3 block attemps just let him jam
&gt; Jokic is poopoo traffic cone that makes Enes Kanter look good  I was with you until this
Lebron is borderline all nba defender. Jokic is poopoo traffic cone that makes Enes Kanter look good
"Same thing happened with Enes Kanter. He was declared ineligible to play at Kentucky and basically just spent the year practicing with the team.  He‚Äôs not a bad player by any means, but certainly wasn‚Äôt worthy of a top 3 pick."
Turkey:  1. Hedo Turkoglu 2. Mehmet Okur 3. Omer Asik 4. Furkan Korkmaz 5. Enes Kanter 6. Ersan Ilyasova 7. Cedi Osman
"Lol maybe you‚Äôre watching different games than me. The last year we played the Warriors, we had Enes Kanter with a dislocated shoulder as our starting center and Damian Lillard fucked his ribs up in game two, plus we had just played a very exhausting 7 game series, while the rockets just rolled over for the Warriors."
Enes Kanter without the cool facial hair
I would happily trade rosters with the Warriors  We're 29th on defense and our 2nd best player has been Enes Kanter
"Bro our second best player is Enes Kanter.   The warriors supporting cast has been better than ours   They have an elite defense, whereas ours is 29th in the league."
"Yeah the fire stotts crowd points to the fact that we‚Äôve almost never had a top ten defense under him, and usually it‚Äôs closer to bottom third. The stotts stans point to the fact that we had a decent defense when we had batum, Matthews and Aldridge, and again when we had Nurkic for a full season, and we are always near the top offensively. I will say that I find it difficult to believe that even Frank Vogel or Thibs or anyone else could take this current roster and do much better. Enes Kanter is our starting center, and our backup center is our starting power forward, who‚Äôs 6‚Äô9‚Äù Also Melo and Anfernee Simons play significant minutes."
"it's a significant concern and without a doubt the biggest hole in his game.  The Blazers don't need him to be a high level creator for others, but they do need him to make the easy pass quickly &amp; decisively and Trent is frequently unwilling/unable to do that.  You can tell at times he is hunting for his own shot at all costs, which is usually fine because the Blazers need him to shoot &amp; score plenty, but it does hurt them at times because if you run him off the 3-point line he doesn't have a ton of juice off the bounce and he's not a great finisher around the rim in traffic.  As a result, you get a lot of those step-back, contested mid-range jumpers or very, very tough contested 3s.   It shows that Trent has a ways to go in his development and is still growing into who he is/will be as a player.  It's really stark when you contrast him with Kanter.  At the beginning of the year when Kanter was coming off the bench, if he got an OREB he was going back up with it by hook or by crook, you could tell that Enes wanted his numbers and was forcing it a bit because he needed minutes and was providing some offense for the second unit (most of the time that was fine, he finishes well around the rim), but there were frequently shooters open on the perimeter and you'd like to have seen a few more kick-outs on second chances.    As soon as Nurkic went down that flipped immediately, Kanter was far more willing to pass out to the perimeter and wasn't forcing up looks in traffic if he didn't have to, he knew he'd get his minutes either way and would have chances to get his numbers in the flow of the game.  Kanter's a vet at this point and got paid so he's set, he's far more willing &amp; able to adjust his game to what the team needs from him.     Trent is still looking for that bag and so he's using his big minutes as a chance to get buckets at all costs, he's still gunning like he's only going to play 15-20 minutes instead of 30+.  You can almost see him doing the math in his head, like ""if I kick it around the perimeter the ball might not find me again and I need to get paid this summer so we're going to shoot this now."""
"Zach Collins, Enes Kanter, Rodney Hood, 2021 2nd, 2022 First  Collins to build up/around, the picks to supplement, Kanter/Hood as cap filler.  And then we just accept that we'll be terrible after Dame's prime is over and we have no picks."
"As opposed to Dame, who has us positioned this well with Enes Kanter as his second best player?"
&gt; They aren't mediocre teams though  Dame has been so good that he's making people say a team with Gary Trent Jr or Enes Kanter as the second best player is average.
We are getting CJ and Nurk back. We suddenly won't be playing with Enes Kanter/GTJ as our 2nd best player.
Bobby Portis and Enes Kanter have long given the Sixers problems.  Marc Gasol and Al Horford were effective at stopping embiid in their younger days but they're probably a bit long in the tooth for that duty now.

That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Jokic is just Enes Kanter with handles
"Enes Kanter's post game is highly underrated. I don't know why the Blazers don't go to it more often, but Kanter is averaging 1.1 PPP and shooting 65% from the field out of postup situations."
&gt; Kyrie is shooting 50/40/90......   Kyrie and Dame's TS% are .04% apart lol. But Lillard averages 2 more ppg   &gt; plus he‚Äôs averaging 28 sharing the ball with Harden while Lillard can Jack up as many shots as he wants  Weird way to say Kyrie gets to play with one of the best offensive players of all time while Dame's 2nd best guy has been Enes Kanter.  not to mention Kyrie takes 20.3 shots a game and Lillard takes 20.8 lmao.
"&gt;yesterday circlejerking about Jokic being terrible on defense  &gt;Jokic isn‚Äôt Hakeem defensively, he‚Äôs also not the Enes Kanter this sub likes to paint him as  Jokic fans are expert spinners. He is bad defensively."
"Jokic stans are unbearable lol like y'all and Luka stans are annoying asf lmao. Jokic is trash on defense, accept it lol. He's legit letting opponents shoot 63.5% from less than 6ft. literally Enes Kanter type horrible defense lmao"
What's hilarious is this stat literally tells us Jokic is Enes Kanter lmao
"They shoot 63.5% against him, which is fucking awful. This isnt' the hill to die on  Only dude with a worse percentage is Enes Kanter at 65.4%"
"That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs carried the team, that means he‚Äôs a better starting center than Enes Kanter. Which, believe it or not, isn‚Äôt that Herculean a task."

"Considering we have one legit center on the team and that's Enes Kanter, I'm shocked he didn't get more."
The fact that Enes Kanter is still seen by many as this righteous freedom fighter makes me genuinely angry.
Enes Kanter
"Enes Kanter would be my pick. However, he seems to only be good in Portland, anywhere else? Meh."
That's kind of what happens what your center rotation is Enes Kanter with a separated shoulder and Meyers Leonard lol.
"Yes, he was a key piece on getting the team he was drafted in their first and only ring. Few Cav's fans would have imagine him having such a legacy, even though LeBron is the driving force on that ring.   He specially exceeded his expectations when you compare him against the other top 5 picks of that draft:  * Derrick Williams * Enes Kanter * Thristan Thompson * Jonas Valanciunas"
"&gt; Yes it does, which models are you comparing it to?  You have to quantify what an outlier is first. But go look at BPM top 10 and tell me which player doesn't belong there.      &gt; None of that is average, and that‚Äôs on you for not understanding the context   You are not addressing my reply at all. How is a model useful if the benefit of playing with Rudy Gobert increases your PERSONAL rating with 300-400%?     &gt; Not hard to understand if you don‚Äôt realize that the combination on all the injuries and having Enes Kanter as his center makes Lillard‚Äôs defense look even worse this year. Again, context   Jesus man, i don't think you understand RAPTOR. RAPTOR is supposed to be an individual stat that accounts for all players on the floor, but using real-plus minus and tracking data. If Lillard's personal rating is affected so greatly by having Kanter than it a trash model for individual evaluation.     I don't know why you have such a hardon for this model, but this is getting ridiculous, your arguments are literally highlighting why the model is bad rather than defending it."
"&gt;	No, no it doesn‚Äôt.  Yes it does, which models are you comparing it to?  &gt;	Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if Conley‚Äôs defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the model error makes the model itself worthless.  None of that is average, and that‚Äôs on you for not understanding the context   &gt;	This also doesn‚Äôt explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher.  Not hard to understand if you don‚Äôt realize that the combination on all the injuries and having Enes Kanter as his center makes Lillard‚Äôs defense look even worse this year. Again, context"

People talk about Dame being a bad defender literally all the time man.  He's not that bad when he doesn't have enes Kanter as his rim protector
"Looking into this:   Lakers would probably pick lebron, gasol or harrell, maybe the morris twin.     Portland takes Jusuf Nurkic or Enes Kanter.      Harrell and Morris look like they have a lot of anger issues, Gasol has daddy strenght, lebron is strong. I do not think lebron has mental strenght to fight, gasol won't care enough to risk his life. That leaves us with Morris twin and Harrell.     Both Enes and Nurkic know they would easily win with Harrell or Morris, so they both can fight.     Portland wins."
"With Ingles you can keep going.   Efficiency rating. Plus minus.    3pt. Defensive rating.     But thats not my point my point is that Jokic is a horrible MVP choice.   So is Embid. They are payers that fit a system, but they arent as skilled or talented as the stats.   Put Jokic on any other team and watch him be as effective as Enes Kanter."
"Again, I think this minute adjustment thing is a little disingenuous, to use a non-hyperbolic example, it‚Äôs like saying Boban would have the same stats as Enes Kanter if you adjusted their minutes up. There‚Äôs no basis to say that Zion would be able to maintain a similar rate of production playing 42 minutes, and the fact that LeBron contributed more to winning on average in an additional 9 minutes per game is a huge, huge point in his favor  Also, LeBron was already borderline elite on that end, I do think Zion‚Äôs defense isn‚Äôt as bad as people say"
It's gonna be Enes Kanter
probably cuz he was touted as an all-time great but is really just a role player in disguise. Jeanie Buss literally called him Kareem. In reality he's more comparable to an Enes Kanter
Enes Kanter is just Julius Randle with hops
"Julius ""Enes Kanter"" Randle"
"Norman is a slight plus on d, with some occasional lapses  CJ is about a neutral defender on a good day  Melo is good for an occasional surprise block or takeaway, but it a bad defender and slower than ever  Enes is a free bucket if you drive against him like 90% of the time. Roco helps with this (less kanter/melo lineups please stotts)  Simons might be one of the 5 worst defenders in the league, but he's still younger than half the draft picks so ehh. probably will never be a plus defender"
"I definitely think Enes Kanter would see himself as promoting social justice and has clearly made a lot real sacrifices to stand up for what he believes is right, but I'm sure the NBA isn't going to focus in on him anytime soon. Not saying they should (I don't really know all that much about G√ºlenism), just that our ideas of what constitute social justice depend on who you ask."
"I mean you‚Äôre right if it was dame and CJ, you‚Äôre obviously more talented than us.   Bud Nurk and CJ literally both missed 30 straight games at the same time. AD has played the exact same amount of game as them and lebron has played 10 more. We played 30 straight games missing both our 2nd and 3rd best player and starting enes Kanter"
He sucks.  Although his offense has come on but you don't your bigman to be a decent offensive threat if he ain't an All Star.  You want your center to be a defensive anchor otherwise he's just a worst rebounding version of Enes Kanter without the post skills.
Lil franky didn't want any business with my guy. No Enes Kanter to protect him this time Skip.
Better passing Enes Kanter.
So he is a great passing version of Enes Kanter with Draymond Green defense? Isn't that a little optimistic? That would a HOF caliber player easily.
"you made a mistake not knowing who the future Rich Man's Enes Kanter is, big boy"
Conditioning. Also imagine a super-sized Enes Kanter. Depends on the matchup.
Washington Wizards haven't been a great rebounding team after Westbrook insertion while the Pelicans had after Adams. Additionally Steve Adams has really good team rebounding on/off numbers several years in a row (better than Drummond for example) with the exception of the year he was replaced by Enes Kanter on the bench who is one of the best rebounders in the league in his own right.
Enes Kanter
So enes kanter&gt; draymond and bam?
"On the benches are Kyle Anderson, Enes Kanter, Seth Curry, Derrick Favors, Patty Mills, and Nerlens Noel."

"Honestly not worth getting into it with guys like this. Westbrook dragged OKC to 47 wins and the playoffs in 2017. His best teammates were Steven Adams, pre-breakout Oladipo, and Andre Roberson. The rest of the relevant guys were rookie Sabonis, pre-breakout Jerami Grant, and Enes Kanter. Guys like the dude your replying to definitely takes one look at that roster and thinks Westbrook had a good supporting cast because Grant and Sabonis are around allstar level now, but those guys were averaging under 6 ppg and weren't nearly as good as they are now. You can't argue with guys who clearly have never played or watched basketball in a meaningful way and base their entire view off of stats and hot takes. During the Thibs and Butler Minnesota stint, these were the guys calling Thibs and Butler assholes/idiots for having a supposedly antiquated attitude. Now, Thibs is a COTY candidate, Butler took a team to the finals, and the Wolves have sucked ever since. Guys with takes like these have no understanding of the intangible side of basketball and it causes them to spew nonsense because they can only interpret what is told to them or on the stat sheet."
"No one will care because Sabonis is an average player to r/nba. Until he turns into KG on defense, he‚Äôs Enes Kanter with clout on this sub and it‚Äôs such BS. Dude shoots over 50 percent, slaps up triple doubles regularly and plays his ass off."
We got Kanter for Mario Hezonja.  It‚Äôs not like people were clamoring to get Enes.
"Other wings like who? They were all crap. Either were terrible on offense or terrible on defense. They also had trade exceptions many years, so they didn‚Äôt have to match salary. Or they also could have involved a 3rd team. Instead they made trades for Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters."
All he had to do was play Enes Kanter more in 2016 and we makes the finals.
Enes Kanter and Jusif Nurkic are also fasting. Because they‚Äôre Muslim. Just pointing out that he‚Äôs not the only Muslim in the whole league. They probably aren‚Äôt the only other two either.
Ah yes a series where Collins &amp; Nurk weren‚Äôt able to play so Enes Kanter was getting heavy minutes.  You definitely can win games deep in the playoffs with one of the best to ever do it abusing Kanter in the PnR :)
"Are we really sure Luka is that much better at defense? I hear he is ""much improved on defense this year trust me"" about him every year like I do about other bad defenders like Enes Kanter, Devin Booker etc. Not to say on/off is the end all be all but just glancing [at it](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4432/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) Luka is even worst on defensive on/off this year than he has any other year by far and he has always been a net negative on that end."
Enes Kanter almost has too much hair.
"People aren't really noticing the huge jump Portland has made since trading for Norm and getting Nurk back. Since that happened, we have like the 5th best net rating in the entire league. The Dame/CJ/Norm/Roco/Nurk starting lineup also has the #1 net rating in the league. We're a better team than we're being given credit for right now. We're absolutely blowing teams out of the water as of late with by far the best offense in the league (and around a league average defense).  The problems start with the bench though. Kanter is an absolute sieve. Zach Collins would fix so much shit if we had him as the backup 5 instead of Enes. Melo is a minus minus on defense but can space the floor. DJJ/Nas have been pushed out of the rotation by Terry and Simons gets the backup guard minutes (another negative on defense).  If Norman gets re-signed, which I assume he will, this team could be nice-nice. We'll see how things go in the playoffs this year though. This is by far the best roster from a net rating standpoint that we've ever had in the Dame era."
20-12 makes him look like Enes Kanter. He‚Äôs currently a 20-12-6 player and probably the 2nd best passing big in the league behind Jokic.
They still lose tho because the blazers were trying to guard pick and rolls with Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.
Enes Kanter - defense   Ben Simmons - a J  Me - Dame as a cousin or Giannis as a brother
What's amazing with Kanter is he can go up against literal DPOY-level defenders and still get his points like he's being defended by Enes Kanter
"We keep asking ourselves the same shit with Enes Kanter, but Terry keeps playing him. At least he's not starting him, so I'm thankful for that."
"If anyone can make this lakers offense look decent, it might be Enes kanter and Melo"
"[Of all Centers with at least 200 field goals attempted against them, Nikola Jokic is 2nd to last in the entire league. Barely better than Enes Kanter, Jokic is giving up 65.5% of attempts taken on him.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*200&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  Usually stats that measure D are unreliable and way too noisy, but tracking field goals attempted against a Center (where the main role of a Center is rim protecting) is the most reliable out of all of them as it focuses on tracking a specific, defined thing.... and it shows Jokic is a bad rim protector.  Jokic is a bad rim protector, and since that's the most important aspect of a Center's defense (even in today's age), it means he's a mediocre defender. He's also bad at defending the P&amp;R and his lack of defensive ability on the perimeter makes him exploitable when teams specifically attack that in the playoffs."
the words expect and Sacramento Kings go together like defense and enes Kanter.     No offense Kings brethren.
"that‚Äôs not what i said. did you even read my comment?  &gt;	adams and kanter aren‚Äôt hitting those outlet passes to a heavily covered russ sprinting down the floor on a fast break. putting the ball directly in his hands and letting him push the pace puts pressure on opposing defenses and creates opportunities for his teammates.  steven adams or enes kanter can barely pass well in a half court setting. they are not going to make an accurate outlet pass to a speeding russ who is being double teamed running up the floor. russ directly getting the ball isn‚Äôt just the best option, it‚Äôs also the safest option. there‚Äôs a reason his teams average less turnovers as a whole when he‚Äôs on the court."
"Rim protection is still the most important factor in defense for the main big man, and Jokic is a terrible rim protector. He's also a bad perimeter defender who's not versatile in the P&amp;R.  [Of all Centers who have at least 200 FG attempted on them, Jokic is giving up the 2nd highest in the league... only 2nd to Enes Kanter](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*200&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;PlayerPosition=C)  His defense scales down to be even worse in the playoffs because teams focus on weaknesses so they'll attack his drop coverage in the P&amp;R, his low effort (due to carrying the offense on the other end probably) and bad rim protection."
"I mean if we consider the games he started while Nurkic was injured, Enes Kanter is 1000x worse on defense than Jokic"
"Excuse me, Enes Kanter would like a word."
Man I thought he was gonna be decent on defense under Frank. But he‚Äôs been a black hole‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd honestly rather have Enes Kanter on defense.
Enes Kanter is the king of this
See: Enes Kanter
"&gt;	Melo, Patrick Patterson, Jermi Grant, and Corey Brewer.   &gt;	That was much better than 2016 with Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Roberson, and Ibaka.  Roberson shot better from the field than KD and was their best perimeter defender. Ibaka was an incredible rim protector that year anchoring a historic defense. And Waiters was an excellent secondary playmaker. You started watching basketball in 2018 if you think the teams are remotely comparable. Maybe if you stop regurgitating ESPN you might see what I am saying.   &gt;	2014 KD carried OKC to almost 60 games with Russ missing half the season and the other half playing limited minutes.  Ya and then what happened the momment Durant had to increase his volume, playmaking and ball handling responsibilities in the **first round**? He shit the bed and got bailed out and still managed a turnover for every assist he made.  That‚Äôs pathetic for an MVP. It‚Äôs hilarious too even think KD had Harden (future MVP) and Russ (future MVP) and KD *still* couldnt get it done. In fact, 2016 Westbrook was better than Durant significantly in the ability to create for others."
"2018 Thunder was just as good as the 2016 Thunder if you take out Paul George and KD. With George they lost in the first round. With KD they push the 73 win Warriors to 7.  The 2018 Thunder had Melo, Patrick Patterson, Jermi Grant, and Corey Brewer. That was much better than 2016 with Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Roberson, and Ibaka.   2014 KD carried OKC to almost 60 games with Russ missing half the season and the other half playing limited minutes."

I was excited. Until we found out Enes Kanter destroyed Steven Adams left and right. Billy never adjusted. He didn't trap Dame.  Looks at Chicago Bulls right now lol
"If you were to make Enes Kanter highlights, I am sure you can make it look like he has great defensive BBIQ. Point is opinions from highlights are basically guessing and people give themselves too much credit when they guess correctly."
"Oh absolutely no argument that we're poorly constructed. That's actually exactly my point. When we lose two of our best 3 players, the next best guy we are putting on the floor is...Enes Kanter? Norman Powell just showed up, but hasn't been here most of the season. The schedule has been grueling for every team, these guys bodies can't take it. It's messed up. But I guess what I was trying to say was that when the Lakers didn't have AD, they had Bron. When you didn't have PG, you had Kawhi. And vice versa. We had 2 of our 3 best players out for most of the season. At the same time. And Damian got us where we are, effectively single handedly.  And Patrick Beverley is trash, you guys not being able to play him does the entire league a service."
because they are fucking dumb and blame Stotts for not being able to make a good defensive team while having to rely on Enes Kanter and Melo for serious rotation minutes
"Portland started a one armed enes kanter at center for that run backed up by Meyers Leonard, if anything Stotts pulled off a miracle that year.  They haven't had healthy bigs in the last 4 years due to the Zach/Nurk injury duo."
Lol what's the point. This is a nephew that thinks 538 stats tell you who's good and who's not.  I'm not going to comment on 538 stats without any side by side video analytics.  Stats are meaningless without watching the games.  Hell I guess Enes Kanter is the GOAT center if you use his stat metrics from 538.
I mean westbrook did even worse the next season against a team starting enes kanter on one arm lmao
"Meh, you're right if the goal is to protect yourself and your fame, likability, etc.  But there is a lane for rational celebrities to voice their opinion on stuff.  There just aren't that many rational outspoken celebrities... it's hard not to respect someone who is passionate or voices their opinion (assuming it's not completely asinine).  Look at Enes Kanter for example -- imagine if he was just a pacifist and didn't speak out on anything that bothered him or his family.  Imagine if all these celebrities tried to toe the line on the black lives matter movement -- how bad does that look?  Toeing the line on actual controversial issues is fine, but when there is a pretty clear cut right/wrong, what harm is there taking a side?  I'd argue it's worse not to."
Rich man's Enes Kanter
That's what happens when the backup is Enes Kanter
"He was fine defensively both series. And in the Blazers series he was completely hobbled.   It‚Äôs not about the game plan, he couldn‚Äôt score over Enes Kanter cause of the knee issue."
"&gt;  I also don‚Äôt know why the perception is that the Thunder were the favorites in the Blazer‚Äôs series. Portland‚Äôs roster was significantly better and they were the 3 seed. 6 seeds rarely beat 3 seeds  Lol you do realize we lost Nurkic right before the playofs and had Enes Kanter starting, right? PG put up an efficient 28 a game too.  There were two reasons that series wasn't close.  One is Dame destroying them, and two is Westbrook being unbelieveably garbage.  In Dame's 50 point closeout game Westbrook missed more shots than the rest of his team COMBINED"
Did Enes Kanter boink your mom or something? Jesus. Not everyone is a good defender. He‚Äôs not quick laterally. It is what it is.
"I made the mistake of joining NBA discord recently and the takes on Westbrook on there are nauseating. To the effect of he's an average player when you take his shot attempts away or something, the triple double isn't an indicator of performance, he's never carried a team (this was a serious statement, the justification was that Oladipo and Enes Kanter were on the team), just overall bad casual takes."
Steven Adams and Enes Kanter from 2016 actually
"Ahhh, I see y'all have found your Enes Kanter/Carmelo Anthony guy that coach insists on being a major rotational player at the expense of defense."
Steven Adams+ Jason Mamoa  Ashton Kutcher = Kyle Korver  Danny Green = Lionel Richie  Tyreke Evans= Chris Tucker  Enes Kanter-= Freddie Mercury
"Enes ""penis cancer"" Kanter"
"Ah yes, the Enes Kanter special."
"&gt;And as other Wizards fans have told me, thats primarily because of Gafford and Len playing better.  That was me, I told you that. And they aren't the only ones playing better, Russ is also playing really really well now specifically because he has the pieces around him that he needs to start winning. His TS% is the only thing that's stayed the same.   &gt;Westbrook is playing the same he has always played, so why are you attributing all the success to him when there is no clear correlation of how he is driving these wins?  I'm not attributing all of the success to him. But he and Beal couldn't do much as guards on a team that needed DEFENSE. Basketball is a team sport.  &gt;For the record, I've talked about a bunch of other advanced stats, all of which tell a similar story. PER, TS% assist/turnover ratio, box out rates, uncontested rebound %'s, turnover rates....you name it, they all paint a picture of a guy who doesn't contribute much to winning.  The fact that box out rates and uncontested rebound %s even came up in that list shows that you know NOTHING about rebounding. And Russ's A/TO ratio is over 2:1, that's good. His turnover rate is also not bad for a point guard, though it's also not good.   PER is just a box score stat and shooting efficiency is a big part of the calculation (the stat also means a whole lot of nothing because of it's completely arbitrary formula, Enes Kanter was once near the top of the league in PER, for instance).   &gt;Why don't you tell me exactly how Westbrook is responsible for this past month's success and it would be great if you could use stats to support it.  Russ is the engine that drives the team, he is certainly not solely responsible for winning but he elevates the fuck out of his teammates. You can't look at what his teammates are doing without looking at what he's doing to set them up."
"Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum, Doc Rivers, Austin Rivers, Enes Kanter"
"He has 83 more blocks than Enes Kanter, and 95 more than Blake Griffin."
"He's actually Enes Kanter, Sr. so you're kind of both right."
The fact that you don‚Äôt think Enes ‚ÄúThe Turkish Terror‚Äù Kanter isn‚Äôt the greatest player to ever touch a basketball is a great indicator of how much you know about basketball.
"Yes, you are in fact not Enes Kanter"
"""fancier enes kanter"" has me laughing... and i like vuc"
I still don‚Äôt get how adding a fancier Enes kanter had people all over the Bulls.
"Considering it's the 2017 Knicks, if you spotted me that it was the 2017 Knicks, I might not even remember who was on that team. I might have selectively blocked out that team from my memory, like it comes back to me when people remind me of Courtney Lee/THJ/Enes Kanter, but I definitely browned out."
"I'm frankly more impressed that a lineup with Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee, and Enes Kanter held another team scoreless for 5.5 minutes to make that run."

BBREF isn't accurate for tracking data or for O/Drtg. Like it literally has the wrong numbers. I remember for years people used to say Enes Kanter wasn't a bad defender because when he was on the team the DRTG numbers weren't bad but it turns out it was entirely innaccurate and didn't match NBA.com. It is doubtful that in all 3 of the ranges outside of 0-3 feet Doncic hits less than 50% on NBA.com but on BBREF on all 3 outside of 0-5 is above 50%.
"Zubac is better offensively by far.  Both are elite rebounders (Drummond better obviously).  Defensively Zubac has weaknesses but is consistent and a very good rim protector, Drummond can go from good to Enes Kanter on any give possession"
That 28-0 was just 3 players. Points during the run    Tim hardaway jr:  12   Courtney Lee:  9   Enes Kanter:  7
Enes Kanter is an absolute beast under the rim
Enes kanter comes to mind.  Maybe also Clarkson but is less impactful defensively than offensively.
That giant lineup featuring Steven Adams and Enes Kanter was just pure sex to watch on the boards as a Thunder fan. I legitimately could not believe Billy was willing to try it in that series.
Yea every team has a top 5 defensive center that‚Äôs unstoppable 1 on 1 in the paint. He‚Äôs basically Enes Kanter
#ENES KANTER
Complete 180 from the Enes Kanter confrontation Demar
Literally Enes Kanter
"The Blazers get a lot better by making each team full health dude.  We started Enes Kanter against Jokic, who played the entire series with a separated shoulder while fasting for Ramadan lmao.  Nurkic was legitimately our 2nd best player that year. It's like if they lost Murray but won anyway"
Do you know who Enes Kanter is
"When Nurk was out, Blazers went 19/13, with Kanter averaging 13.06 Points and 12.78 Rebounds per game.  Since Nurk came back, we're going 6/10, and Kanter is still outplaying Nurk. In those 16 games, Nurk is averaging 10.08 Points per game against Kanter's 11.13, and 8 Rebounds against 10.93 per game.   Even with the two of them splitting the time, Kanter is still out performing Nurk. If you look at the 12 individual games they have both played, since Nurk came back, Kanter has had more Rebounds in 8 of those games, and had more points in 7 of those games (tying with Nurk twice).  Enes is just playing better than Nurk at the moment, and in my own worthless individual opinion, I would rather play him in the end when the pressure is on."
Are u telling me enes kanter not playing was the domino effect that led to KD joining the warriors LMAO i love kanter discourse
Enes Kanter at 15. The guy is is a regular season advanced stats GOD for a role player.
"Enes ""Cant play him"" Kanter"
"And this, kids, is why you can‚Äôt base your thoughts on stats alone. Enes Kanter was damn near unplayable in that series please go actually watch a game"
"Any chance they‚Äôre compensated at these academy schools?  That would be my big indicator with the ncaa.   Remember enes kanter got like $1,300 when he was 13-14 in turkey and the ncaa said he couldn‚Äôt play at Kentucky."
No caliber of a defensive coach can make the Blazers a decent defensive team when you start and give heavy minutes to 3 midgets and have defensive stalwarts like Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter on the team
Ok so? Enes Kanter does that every year..
"You know what? Time to John Chaney this shit. Enes Kanter, be my goon."
"Lol we would absolutely be a good defensive team. The 30-whatever games this year we didn‚Äôt start Enes Kanter we were 18th in defense. Replacing CJ with a DPOY level guy would have us top 10 without even remedying our dreadful bench.   Dame, Powell, Simmons, Covington, Nurk is a very good defensive lineup."
"Yeah for CJ,Enes kanter, and a second."
"I had no idea Enes Kanter and Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá were born in Switzerland. I just assumed Turkey and Montenegro were their birthplaces, respectively."
Should Enes Kanter work on his defense?
"He got votes for 6MOY and wasn‚Äôt even the worst defensive Blazer player off the bench.  As a caveat, I‚Äôve never seen a worse defensive center than Enes Kanter. Love his hustle and boarding, but he may be the most unathletic player in the league."
Exactly. We were hella injured that series. We had to rely on Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard for bigs. Kanter was playing with a separated shoulder and Dame himself separated a rib.
Last time I went to a game was Celtics-Jazz in Utah. Jaylen Brown couldn‚Äôt hit shit from 3 in warm-ups yet barely missed a shot in game and then Enes Kanter was stroking it from the free throw line with a perfect spin that would bounce right back to him every. Single. Time.
Thing is the blazers with Nurkic were roughly 15th defense in multiple years. Problem is Nurk gets hurt and Stotts had Enes Kanter to protect the rim along with Robert Covington and fuck all to guard the perimeter.
"That doesn't make any sense. You're gonna sit here and tell me that Terry playing Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony 20+ minutes a night each didn't negatively affect our defense? That's not a roster issue, that's a coaching issue. You don't need a scheme to ""fix"" it, you just need a coach that isn't a fucking moron who chooses to play offense only players who don't try on defense. The eye test and the statistics prove that Enes Kanter and Melo are two of the worst defensive players in the entire league."
"DJJ and Zach aren't really part of the core, that's why I listed them the way I did. Zach was hurt last year and would've played instead of Enes at the backup 5 and DJJ for some inexplicable reason got taken out of the rotation by Terry to play shitty ass Melo 20+ minutes a night.  Terry willingly chose to play absolute -100 defenders in Kanter and Melo last season over other options like RHJ at backup 5 and DJJ/Nas instead of Melo. Sure, I wish Neil Olshey wouldn't have gotten those players but it was on Terry to keep playing them heavy minutes night in, night out when there were better defensive options available.  Portland's starting lineup dominated btw. Net rating it was a top 3 lineup in the league. Even in the Denver series the starting lineup was fucking awesome.  You have a serious lack of understanding of Portland's roster. Sounds like you're still bitter from the WB/PG playoff series."
Not when the alternative to Nurkic is enes Kanter  The nuggets and Blazers are both offense first teams. Losing an offensive player is not nearly as significant as losing the one guy that keeps your defense from being the worst in NBA history
ENES KANTER -&gt; PENIS CANCER
That's not our problem. With Nurkic on the floor this season we had the equivalent of the 5th ranked defense.   It's hard to defend when enes Kanter is your starting center
"Because we were even more injured than they were and exhausted from 7 games in Denver with only 1 day off   Add in that Dame was injured and our frontcourt was injured Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard, and it makes sense  Soon as Dame or CJ got tired it's easy to come back when the other teams got literally the worst defensive frontcourt rotation of this decade"
"They said this is his first flagrant in three seasons, but I remember him throwing a cheap shot at Enes Kanter a year or two ago when Kanter was playing with a hurt shoulder, first time he's been caught I suppose"
Enes Kanter can't play defense.
"his defensive stats doesn‚Äôt match up with the eye test IMO, Jokic bleeds midrange buckets and doesn‚Äôt even defend the rim well, he‚Äôs no Enes Kanter but compared to other elite centers he‚Äôs dookie"
Jokic has the 3rd worst opponent fg% at the rim among the 45 centers who played at least 20 games and averaged 20 minutes during the RS. He's 3 spots behind enes kanter.
"Sure, Gobert was lucky to be drafted by this tremendous 25-57 Jazz team coached by the legendary Ty Corbin. And how to improve your defense in a steadier way than by following the steps of a legendary exemple like David Robinson or Enes Kanter ?"
"This thread isn't who deserves a ring. It's who you want to win one.   TJ McConnell, Chris Paul or Enes Kanter are all equally valid answers."
Enes Kanter  Jarrett Allen  Nikola Vucevic  Taj Gibson
Portland offered Enes Kanter a fat deal and okc matched
"The man has got a severe case of Enes Kanter Syndrome (EKS), the inability to backpedal and play defense at the same time"
"I can rant all day about Paul Millsap. Super underappreciated career. Utah Jazz traded for Derrick Favors and drafted Enes Kanter to replace Al Jefferson and him because they had more potential but Paul ended up being the better player. Also, a very interesting old article that was named after Millsap [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080122202848/http://ballhype.com/story/the_paul_millsap_doctrine/) that argues that per 36 stats are actually very accurate and if anything, underestimate how much a bench player would produce if they played more minutes (with enough sample size of course)."
"Portland‚Äôs issues aren‚Äôt offense, it‚Äôs that they have no defense, and that when Nurkic is resting you have Enes Kanter backing him up  Getting rid of Stotts just to bring in another offensive oriented coach doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs gonna make a difference"
I partially agree but it's hard to become competent defensively if you're not quick laterally.   Best case is he becomes someone like Enes Kanter
&gt;and he doesn't immediately go for tip ins like an Enes Kanter either  This is good thing for Kanter why would you not want your big man going for shot 1 foot away from the basket?
"Literally all you have to do is open your eyes, look at the most used starting line up for the season, go oh, why‚Äôs Enes Kanter our most used starting center in 2021? Oh because Nurk went down and we had to, wow our defensive woes make more sense now. Surely we have a defensive minded back up big we can play just in case our extremely injury prone defensive anchor goes down? No?   How about Melo sharing minutes at center with Roco? Oh wait, it is absolutely a roster construction issue. You can‚Äôt be forced to start Enes Kanter the whole fucking season and blame that god awful defensive rating on Terry.  Might I add, Terry was pressured by Neil to play Melo heavier minutes and stunt the growth of Nas because of Melos ‚Äòlegacy‚Äô.  Absolutely fuck Neil for that comment and absolutely fuck him for consistently wasting Portland‚Äôs money and Dames prime in fa for players who never move the needle more than Roco."
The reverse Enes Kanter
After Enes Kanter I gringe when players do this
Gobert is good on the perimeter as well. He ain't no Enes Kanter. Ingles is also better than Johnson imo (and I feel like your players comp are a bit but fairly biased).
"&gt;Like legit worse than Enes Kanter  Nah not that bad, but close"
Not a good game. Awful on defense. Like legit worse than Enes Kanter
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
While starting Enes Kanter at center for most of the season.
[stotts' face when Indiana trade turner and signs Enes Kanter to be starting C](https://i.imgur.com/J64ocUC.jpg)
"Eh doubt.  If Harden stays on OKC it solves literally every problem they had moving forward.  KD+WB were good enough, with a fairly weak supporting cast (Enes Kanter who was a playoff liability at 23 was their 3rd best offensive payer, and most of there other teamates of note were under 23), and this was before Ibaka learned a 3pt shot. With Scot Brooks coaching...  To get up 3-1 on the 72w warriors, and were arguably the better team. They were actually projected to beat the Cavs should they have beaten the warriors...  They lacked a reliable 2nd/3rd option and had an extremely weak bench/2nd unit that constantly undermined any lead they built up. You add Harden to to that team though and all of a sudden the 2nd unit has a great scorer included with it at any given time and a reliable ball handler in either WB/Harden, and you have a decent spot up shooter to give KD/WB space.  You also have none of the liabilities on defense the Nets currently have. IMO  Prime OKC3 would have been &gt; This nets team. Tho we'll never know."
"made the WCF with Enes Kanter, Al-farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless as his starting front court, that alone is a legendary coaching job"
"Are you fucking kidding me? You think that because Durant was out, everyone else on the Warriors were scrubs?  They still had a good 2-3 more All-Stars on the court than we did. Plus we didn't have Nurk, so we had to rely on Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard in the post.  What a shit take."
If we‚Äôre talking about slander nicknames here‚Äôs some of the most hilariously disrespectful nicknames I got on illegal streams chat:  Autism Rivers  Dennis Scrotum  Fluka Dumbcic  Lyle Luzma  Trae Dung  Penis Cancer (Enes Kanter)  CJ McUseless  KCPussy  Bubble Guppies (Lakers and Heat slander)
Oh come on that‚Äôs not what playmaking means lol at that point you might as well say Enes Kanter is a great ‚Äúplaymaker‚Äù because his offensive rebounds create more plays for the offense.
"Sort of. Brilliant and unique offensive player but he's undoubtedly a defensive liability who routinely gets exposed, ends up out of position, and just flat out gives up on plays to complain to refs or commit fouls to stop play to complain to refs.   Not a big believer in individual advanced D stats, but by the numbers Jokic is only a marginally better defender than Enes Kanter. Have a feeling the novelty of his game helped him here."
"he pretty much echoes exactly how I felt about Okafor at the time. If I'd participated in that thread, I would've answered Jokic too, but purely because Okafor had no chance at being a modern NBA center. My answer would have had nothing to do with Jokic.  Unless you're 2014 Al Jefferson levels of dominant in the post, that archetype is pretty much relegated to bench duty, and it was clear by 2015/16 that it's where the league was headed.  Ask Enes Kanter how his career is going, and that's with him being leagues better as a rebounder than Okafor is."
Come to Portland. We could use another center that isn't Enes Kanter on defense
".... Let's see if I can explain this in a way that you'll understand.  There have been a handful of players in NBA history that are speculated to have lied about their age. The Congolese Biyombo, the Sudanese Thin Maker, the Congolese Mutumbo, the Congolese Ibaka and the Nigerian Hakeem.  Notice a trend there? It's very subtle. You see, when an African player comes to the NBA its surprisingly common for people to doubt their age, even when given absolutely no reason to be suspicious. People claimed Hakeem was five years older than he was listed because they didn't think it was realistic for someone to be as good as he was so young. Thon Maker was accused of shaving five years off his age because scouts thought he was too well-spoken to be a teenager.  You'll notice that these rumors don't follow immigrants from other places. No one accuses Doncic of secretly being 30 or Enes Kanter of lying about his age. It's almost entirely African immigrants. Now remind me where Giannis' parents are from?  So yes, questioning whether or not a player is lying about their age based on no evidence whatsoever is a very racially charged sentiment in the NBA. Would you even consider the possibility that he'd be lying about his age if he were from Serbia or France or Brooklyn? Nah, it's only Africans."
Enes is pretty staunchly opposed to a lot of Turkish policies.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/politics/nba-boston-celtics-enes-kanter-cant-leave-us.amp
Enes Kanter
Neil Olshey: The defensive rating of 29th was not a product of the roster  Also Neil Olshey: resigns Enes Kanter
"*Has Enes Kanter as the only available big on the team for most of the season*  &gt;	the defensive rating was not a product of the roster  Uhuh, sure"
"I think it can be hard to judge the talent on a team when there's such a ball-dominant player on the team. Westbrook's MVP year got called out for ""get him some help"", but look at the guys on that team that flourished when they left and got more touches: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant all played 1,500+ minutes that OKC season.  Even folks like Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne are playing key minutes this year for decent teams."
"Luka ""reverse Enes Kanter"" Doncic"
The scenario you just laid out is why I have a gun... Which I would have to choose between keeping and becoming a felon if Enes Kanter had any influence on policy
Because Embiid is easily one of the worst defensive players in the league. Basically Enes Kanter 2.0
"Facts, Enes Kanter is a joke compared to him"
"Arguable - We have had good defensive teams when we had decent defensive pieces. Last 3 seasons our back up centers have been Meyers Leonard, Enes Kanter, Anthony Tolliver? and Enes Kanter again. Can't build any sort of scheme for that + an undersized back court.       Hoping he gets another gig."
He‚Äôs like Enes Kanter but with like 4 more points a game. He‚Äôd be a solid backup center but I don‚Äôt think he has what it takes to be a starter.
Honest question: who‚Äôs more unplayable in the playoffs Andre Drummond or Enes Kanter?
"Dame has literally no help. McCollum is a third option maybe 4th on a good team. OKC had Russell Westbrook, Steven Adam's, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters all who were good at the time. Not to mention Andre Roberson who was shooting lights out in the playoffs that year. The idea that KD left a crap team to join GS is just wrong. Was OKC the greatest team ever assembled? No. But they beat the 60 win Spurs team."
Yeah and we were relying on Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard as our starting frontcourt so
"Enes Kanter has one of the worst defensive ratings in the game.  He just scores.  But cant play defense.  So, no, not the same."
"I know you cant really look forward to drafts as a Portland fan but this team needs to desperately add some bigs to their team. Like actual bigs that are quality  TJ Leaf? Yikes  Enes Kanter? Umm  Harry Giles?? Lol  You're running Robert Covington as a weak 6'7"" 4 out there and wondering why you lose games? that's a good place to start."
"Enes Kanter, Derek Fisher"
Enes kanter was a bad match up for him. The bar for slightly good has got to be at ground level.
"cmon Portland was missing Nurkic and had to start Enes ""can't play"" Kanter on an injured shoulder. Westbrook still had a playoff career low FG% finishing at the rim  can't even blame matchups when Westbrook routinely underpeforms in the playoffs"
Anthony Gill looks like if Enes Kanter and Danny Green had a kid
"tbf i don't think there was much we could have done in 2019, we had literally one day between the denver game 7 and GSW game 1, and our center rotation was an injured enes kanter and famed defensive stalwart meyers leonard lol"
"Think of him as a shorter Enes Kanter. Slightly better scorer, worse rebounder, and still an overall terrible defender. Just not the type of player that really helps you be successful in the postseason."
We had the 6th rated defence in 17-18  You can‚Äôt have a good defence when Enes Kanter and Melo are playing heavy minutes along with both of your 38+ minute starting guards are awful defenders
You do know that Enes Kanter wasn‚Äôt drafted by the Celtics and he didn‚Äôt retire with them right?  Like you know he‚Äôs played for different teams before and after Boston right?
This just tells me you don't watch Enes Kanter lol. We tried him against Embiid - it didn't work. He averaged 30 and 12 that series.
Is that an excuse for getting nobody? Enes Kanter legitimately guards Embiid better than Rob Williams because he‚Äôs 6‚Äô11 and hard to fuckin move.  &gt; His only healthy season  How can you write this out and still not understand why I think its a bad move
That's like saying that Damian Lillard and Enes Kanter combined for 59 points
what's more sad is that 1/13 was literally just an enes kanter putback.... nobody could hit a damn thing
And this right here? This is Enes Kanter and he's 7ft tall and you can't teach that.
Why does Enes kanter run like he has needles in his shoes
I feel like drawing a foul on Enes Kanter is an odd moment for an MVP chant.
Every time Kanter closes out on Jokic on the 3 point line he doesn't even put his hand up. His hand makes it to Jokics chest and is like a foot away. What's that supposed to do Enes?
Kanter comes in.  Enes Kanter: üòÉ  Nuggets Fans: üòÉ  Blazers Fans: üíÄ
enes kanter checking in?  jokic eyes widen
"Yeah that would be the one year dude.   Lol oh no, we got swept by a team with an MVP and 2 other all stars! The tragedy!  Can't believe that could happen. After all we had a whole *one* all star! And he was playing through separated ribs but that's no big deal right? And we had such lockdown defenders on that team cause we were so healthy   Like I'm shocked our center rotation of enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard couldn't stop curry. Truly shocking and embarassing"
"&gt;  you guys couldnt even win one game against GS and KD wasnt even playing.  ...the series before we beat Denver starting Enes Kanter.  Then people are somehow shocked we don't do better playing Dame, CJ, and Enes Kanter vs Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green while Dame is playing with a separated rib.    Our center rotation that series was Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.  We went from starting Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter to Norman Powell, Robert Covington, and Jusuf Nurkic."
"Yeah, with a broken fucking team lmao. Nurkic was out, Dame was hurt, and we were starting Enes fucking Kanter ....who himself had a separated shoulder  Not like the other team still had 3 all stars or anything"
"&gt; But this league is dumb. People give out contracts for upside  How many people can you remember tricking the NBA into ***two*** of those big, ""upside"" contracts, without actually showing that upside (in 8 long years), though?  He already got his ""tricked you guys"" big contract for his supposed ""potential"" ...... And then proceeded to never actually show any of that and get any better, even after two changes of scenery.   He's like Enes Kanter with better rebounding... but with none of Kanter's offensive skill. After getting one big contract for his ""upside,"" Kanter is now making a little less than $5m per year, on a contract that was originally signed when he was 27 years old, with a (supposed-to-be-) contending team that *desperately* needed a big man.  I just don't see how anyone would be looking to pay him more than that (at best), especially after continuing to not even *look* any better while playing with LeBron, who usually makes bigs at least look better, if not actually get any better.  And with the league continuing to get further away from the time when big guys could get good contracts without being able to either defend on the perimeter at all or be a real offensive weapon."
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Jahlil Okafor  C: Enes Kanter
Bro Enes Kanter with defense is like Joel Embiid lol. Enes Kanter has been in top 10 PER for many years because his offense is so dominant.
Gafford is like Enes Kanter with defense
The only way that would work if you have you get in legal trouble but even then it's a pretty slim chance and it's only happened a few times. KCP had to play with an ankle monitor and was only allowed to play at the Lakers home games for a part of the season because he violated probation. Enes Kanter is the only other example I can think of. He doesn't travel to Toronto to play the Raptors or travel to other International games for fear of the Turkish government taking him as a prisoner since he had his Turkish citizenship revoked for his political views.
That's actually the reason why Enes Kanter doesn't travel to Toronto to play the raptors. He fears that the Turkish Government will take him since they revoked his citizenship due to his political views.
"You have no idea what you are talking about lol, people hate on Enes Kanter because of that he supports a terrorist. Not because of that they have to."
I don‚Äôt think anyone likes Enes Kanter
"Hassan Whiteside  Truth is, the Trail Blazers can select any random 7 footer and they're going to average 10+ rebounds in limited time. See Enes Kanter averaging 11 in only 24 minutes a game this year."
"Enes Kanter has a field day when he plays us. As long as you're big, we'll feed you."
"Yea, just wait until Steph and Enes Kanter team up with LaMelo in Charlotte üò§"
Technically we gave it to Enes Kanter first
It's obviously Enes Kanter
Enes Kanter and Embiid aren't far apart in quickness in general
quickness is the biggest thing. Embiid looks like enes kanter compared to hakeem
Enes Kanter is not in this series
literally as long as your rim protector isn't Enes Kanter or Kelly Olynyk you can pretty easily hide a bad defensive guard
Harrell is what happens when you shrink Enes Kanter
Taj Gibson and Enes Kanter are at the top of the Jokic shit-list
Enes Kanter on a convince Dame to stay tour üòÇ
"He would happily turn over Enes Kanter and his family to be tortured and imprisoned, so my opinion is firmly fuck Hedo Turkoglu"
"It did, he just couldn‚Äôt make up for Dame, CJ and most importantly Enes Kanter starting for most of the year"
Enes Kanter
"Great BBIQ is an exaggeration, and his passing isn't to the point that you actually want to have him as a primary or secondary playmaker, so it's pretty whatever. Prkacin is a better playmaker than Sengun at this point.   Sengun's an extremely skilled post scorer and solid passer. The fact that you have to instantly use his stats and resume to defend him instead of his actual game is pretty much all that needs to be said.   What he is just isn't that attractive in the modern NBA. There's a reason Enes Kanter is on a different team for the minimum and Jahlil Okafor barely got a contract on the worst team in the league. Post scoring is close to worthless when it comes at the tradeoff of defense and shooting."
1 - Westbrook  2 - Lou Williams  3 - Ben Simmons  4 - Enes Kanter   5 - Hassan Whiteside
Enes Kanter is a double double machine with a career PER of 20.9. He's posted a WS48 above .200 four times. He's my starting center for sure.
All time? Primo Pasta deserves a shout out. Wolves Wiggins and his 20 ppg on bad efficiency. Enes Kanter as a starter with awful defense and the most meaningless 20/10 games ever. Hassan Whiteside for obvious reasons.
"You have Norman Powell and CJ McCollum in case you are well defended, speaking of defense you have Zach Collins Robert Covington AND Derrick Jones Jr defending. And a great Center in Nurkic and an excellent rebounder in Enes the Big Penis Kanter."
"willingness is one thing, but it doesn't exactly feel like they can even get ""deep"" into luxury tax in the upcoming season, exactly?  like, they're over the cap with 9 players (assuming norm and derrick jones jr opt in), $127M.  then they, i guess, re-sign zach collins and, i dunno, enes kanter for whatever they're worth, use the MLE and maybe the bi-annual and then vet mins for the rest, that still doesn't seem like a lot.  the cap hold for zach is $16M for spotrac, does that seem right?  kanter is like $6M, everyone else is small.  like maybe next year they could demonstrate that they're willing to spend on whoever is deserving, but not sure how much they've upgraded the roster by then or how dame will feel a year later, depending how they've done.  (unless they manage some S&amp;T with their FAs that gets them someone useful, i guess, but base year compensation still means that contract isn't too huge because it's not counted by the outgoing FAs new contract.)"
Short Enes Kanter.
"When CJ is your second option you're not a championship team.  If Enes Kanter is on the floor, you're not a championship team.  If Neil Olshey is your GM, you're not a championship team."
"There were numerous years where the defense was around 16th, which was part of the goal. Have an elite offense and an average to above average defense.   All Stotts ever needed with Dame was a defensive center and some 3 and D wings. He never really got that outside of Nurkic. He got Anthony Tolliver, Mario Hezonja, Enes Kanter Derrick Jones Jr who shoots 25% from 3 and Melo. Robert Covington was the only one and he's a bit overrated on defense.   Stotts failure was Olsheys to begin with."
That's Enes Kanter dumbass
Which was 95% on Olsheys ridiculous roster construction  Him forcing Anfernee Simons into a PG role  His contingency plan for Enes Kanter becoming unplayable was Rondae Hollis Jefferson  Him paying 9 million dollars per year to Derrick Jones Jr who is barely an NBA player  Every issue the Blazers have had over the last 6 years has been at its root because of Neil Olsheys incompetence
"I didn‚Äôt trade for anything, so you can stop typing in a voice as if I have anything to do with the Pelicans‚Äô decision making.  Eric Gordon *isnt* trash, our fanbase hates him because he literally skipped on rehab to get back at our organization for not letting him walk, costing himself more than anything else. He won 6th man of the year in Houston. He‚Äôs not an allstar, but he was a key player on a contender. He‚Äôs not trash, THATS YOU clearly trying to bullshit to paint me in a bad light.  I didn‚Äôt say Mirotic was great. But he‚Äôs a good role player. He‚Äôs better than Enes Kanter coming off the bench. He helped torch the Blazers when the Pels swept them.   Portland didn‚Äôt put LMA next to Dame. He was in Portland since 2006. Dame was drafted in 2012. And he left 2 years later. How many Allstars has Dame played with other than LMA? That would be 0.   Is CJ and Nurkic really a lot better than Holiday and Mirotic? Or Holiday and Cousins? Or Holiday and Randle?   I don‚Äôt hate AD or blame him for leaving, the team missed on signings all the time, and the ones they didn‚Äôt miss on got hurt. That‚Äôs why they literally fired every member of management from the AD era.  Also your Zion take is horrible. He‚Äôs 21. He‚Äôs played 85 games. ‚ÄúThe Pels are wasting him.‚Äù Lmao he was so out of shape his first year he couldn‚Äôt even play. He was virtually a rookie this year. How the fuck do you waste a rookie? Steven Adams is a starting caliber center on a 2 year contract at 17mil. He‚Äôs going to be salary for trade filler."
"Dame was winning games this year with Enes Kanter and Robert Covington as his best teammates. AD couldn‚Äôt do that, plus he gets injured way more than Dame and isn‚Äôt the leader Dame is."
"Plus the knock on Toppin was always that his lateral movement was awful and he wouldn't be able to stay in front of anybody on the perimeter, and isn't big enough to slow down actual big men.    And lo and behold that is exactly what happened, and those are tough flaws to correct.  He's the kind of player who if he comes into a playoff game will be hunted down relentlessly Enes Kanter style until he has to come out, he's that bad at defense."
"Yeah, from what I remember from Junior Euro competitions, I am pretty sure Enes Kanter and Jonas Valanciunas are superstars now."
"""Let me tell you a little story about the 2020 season. I was doing this deal with Houston for Robert Covington, never once touched the salary cap. I'd go to the trade machine, get some Enes Kanter, Derrick Jones Jr, Cup-A-Rodney Hood... baby, I got a stew going."""
"I've always thought that feeding skilled bigs against a switch is under-utilized in the NBA. Enes Kanter is particularly good at punishing switches. I suppose there are a limited number of bigs reliable enough to make it high-percentage, but Ayton sure makes it look easy."
"&gt; while a guy who has had zero titles in the NBA has coasted to gold medals year in year out.  Yeah, Coach K just needed arguably the greatest roster ever assembled to pull it off.  &gt; And that same team choked home court advantage away and were getting wrecked by the likes of Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters. Should have retired in shame after that.  Well it's a good thing Pop isn't a dramatic little bitch like that, because otherwise we wouldn't get to watch him assemble arguably an even better team the very next season.  If Kerr lost that series to the Thunder, would you have recommended he hang himself right there on the court?"
"&gt; Honestly, I'm shocked to see you attacking Pop so harshly.  Because while I think he can be brilliant (most of 1999, 2014) he has his faults. And luke his former franchise star he's been less effective in international ball, while a guy who has had zero titles in the NBA has coasted to gold medals year in year out.  &gt; that same team to a 67-15 record, and a record-breaking +12.4 NetRTG.  And that same team choked home court advantage away and were getting wrecked by the likes of Enes Kanter and Dion Waiters. Should have retired in shame after that."
"I'd even throw Cam Payne, Enes Kanter and Serge Ibaka to an extent."
1) CJ  2) Enes Kanter  3) Stotts  That's pretty much it. The defense was solid whenever Nurkic was actually on the floor anyway.
"Your working theory is that Kanter -- Enes Kanter -- is an ace 3pt shooter who doesn't shoot 3s b/c of . . . offensive rebounding.  And Ayton also has this secret 3pt range.    And Mobley -- note the spelling, as you've gotten it wrong twice now -- is a non-shooter.  You've effectively admitted as such, as ""predicting"" he will develop a 3-point shot means that, currently, he does not have one.    As for the Wizards plan, it doesn't matter what either of us think - a mock draft is predicting the Wizards are going to do based on available information.    The issue isn't even Sengun - it's that the Wiz already have, at minimum, 2 rotation players who can only play center.  They have zero such players who are natural SFs.    I think you are really overrating Sengun. First off, comparing stats in the Turkish league and the NBA is just ridiculous.  Tell me what players have been drafted from the Turkish BSL and dominated the NBA.    Most importantly, Russ &amp; hopefully Beal are going to be on the team for the next two years, and Sengun is an awful, awful fit with them.  High BBIQ isn't going to do anything for him when he never gets the ball - it's not going to help him any more than it did Deni this season.    The Wiz took off when they got Gafford b/c he can rim run and protect the rim, neither of which are Sengun's strength.  He's a slow-footed big who can't shoot 3s - just about the worst combination you could have with the Wiz roster."
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn‚Äôt move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn‚Äôt move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That‚Äôs a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn‚Äôt work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
And you lost to us injured with Enes Kanter starting lmao. Not really much room to talk there my man  It's okay. One day Jokic will be able to outscore teams when he's on the floor :)   Just not today apparently.
"I mean he headbutted Wagner in the bubble once and that's all I can remember. Even when he gets into somebody's face like he did with Bradley Beal awhile back he will very quickly just run away.   Like, the Enes Kanter thing Giannis just walked away even though Kanter was all over him. I really don't think he's ""absolutely"" confrontational or anywhere near that. If he was then he wouldn't have let Collins think he punked him"
[It's pretty hilarious](https://sports.yahoo.com/enes-kanter-ate-seven-burgers-fries-wound-missing-practice-next-day-illness-233209757.html)
"Lol he was still the best player in the entire NBA this playoffs dude  That's like me saying Jokic shouldn't be proud he torched Enes Kanter, since that's the only reason y'all won."
"If you watch Sabonis you‚Äôll see he‚Äôs not a guy you can rely on heavily in the modern game. Can‚Äôt stretch the floor, can‚Äôt protect the rim, and can‚Äôt defend the perimeter. He‚Äôs obviously a better player, but it‚Äôs eerily similar to a young Enes Kanter except Sabonis is a better passer. Great stats, but not a good fit for the modern game"
18 Enes Kanter - Portland
He‚Äôs Enes Kanter 2.0   He‚Äôll be unplayable on defense in the playoffs
who is the worse defender Enes Kanter or DC?
Thank god they benched Cousins. Guy was making Enes Kanter look like Hakeem Olajuwon.
Enes Kanter
No Enes Kanter right
"Once upon a time our FO had the difficult decision of choosing two big men between Enes Kanter, Rudy Gobert, and Derrick Favors."
Enes kanter
he's a guy you can stick next to Enes Kanter and make him playable. The true unicorn
The second player would be Enes Kanter with less turnovers
"Lacking: Currently it's any semblance of offensive rhythm, CP has slowed our offensive rhythm down to a crawl since he's been back and suddenly he's taking 2 to 3 more contested 3's a game while shooting a worse % than the regular season. Incredibly frustrating to watch.   Improve: I want a prototypical defensive back-up center to help DA out. Dario absolutely is not cutting it and I'd be happy to move on from him this summer.  Moves to Pursue: I'd love for us to trade Dario/Jevon and clear up some cap space to pay Cam Payne the money he deserves to be our backup PG. Would also like to see us go after a Daniel Theis, Richaun Holmes, Enes Kanter type of player. I think we're pretty set on long, versatile wings with Mikal, Cam, Jae, Torrey, and Abdel."
"&gt;Enes Kanter - another clout chaser, calls every team he‚Äôs been on ‚Äúfamily‚Äù disingenuously  facts lmao"
No mention of Enes Kanter. Probably most well known active Turkish NBA player. I guess hes not turkish anymore since they booted him from the country lol.
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R. Smith|40.0|35.6| |Tristan Thompson|63.6|0| |Richard Jefferson|51.6|16.7| |Kevin Love|30.4|26.7| |Iman Shumpert|26.3|16.7|  OKC  |Player||| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|42.3|28.6| |Russell Westbrook|39.5|31.7| |Serge Ibaka|47.2|34.4| |Dion Waiters|35.8|31.8| |Andre Roberson|52.0|44.4| |Steven Adams|53.3|0| |Enes Kanter|48.6|0|"
"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters.

"He's much much better defender, playmaker, shooter than Enes Kanter. In fact, only thing similar about them their strong presence in the post."
Enes Kanter punched a chair
"Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter"
"If Tucker wasn't a good defender he would be making 7.5m/y less. There's absolutely no way he'd be in the NBA. If anything, this is against your argument - defense IS what pays these guys. Now if you can't dribble the ball, can't pass and the only spot you can even take a shot from is the corner, yeah, 7.5m / year sounds good to me.  lol what? You think the Wizards, Bulls, Kings had better scorers at his position and that's why he wouldn't start? Because he wasn't good enough offensively? Your comment is funny, because that's exactly what he averaged playing only 25 minutes per game - 15 PPG on these teams, without starting half / most of the games. How come he couldn't be a starter on tanking teams, I wonder. It's the same story with Enes Kanter. You can't play him on the other end.  Breaking news: Rebounding is part of defense.  Also, Rudy is not a good player offensively. The fact the Jazz need him on the floor on defense and spam PnRs to give him easy dunks doesn't make him a good scorer. His offensive boards are also the outcome of that. PnR &gt; Mitchell / Conley have their layup contested by the opposing center &gt; free offensive rebound and putback dunk for Gobert. You need to re-evaluate what good offense and good defense is.  Lmao what? You think I can't find players that would be out of the league / bench players at best without their defense and actually got paid? Simmons. Draymond. Mutombo. Gobert. Ariza. Wallace. What in the fuck are you talking about friend? There are even players who used to be solid offensively but can't score anymore and still make money because of their defense. Iggy is a good example of that."
"With the exception of actual non-shooters like Ben Simmons or many centers, 90% of NBA players aren‚Äôt so bad at shooting that they don‚Äôt need to be guarded at all. Steven Adams and Enes Kanter were the only guys on the OKC roster who you could just completely ignore every single possession if they stood behind the perimeter (which they‚Äôd didn‚Äôt do). The Cavs and Warriors both had players like that too. Every single other person on their team had the ability to hit 3s, as proven by the fact that they‚Ä¶hit 3s. There is your answer. Was their shooting and spacing as good as the Cavs? No. Was that the main reason they lost and the Cavs won? No.  LeBron James, the star player of the Cleveland Cavaliers, played extremely well in 3 elimination games against the Warriors. Kevin Durant can‚Äôt say the same. Parsing the difference in their play in these respective series entirely on the basis of the relative quality of their spacing is a false premise. From the beginning to the end, that has been my argument.   If you really believe in your heart of hearts that spacing is what made that gap, more power to you. It‚Äôs just wrong though."
"The disrespect to my man Enes ‚ÄúThe Sieve‚Äù Kanter is unreal, smh."
"It's not like the games themselves weren't' close though. Plus we were just as injured than they were - just without 3 all stars to make up for it.  That team was supposed to lose round 1 lol. Not make the WCF. Again, a team starting **Enes ""Kan't Play"" Kanter""** made the WCF."
Enes Kanter is smiling somewhere
"The greatest centers and, somehow, Enes Kanter. Dude is just a monster in the post. If only he could play D."
Somewhere between enes kanter and khem birch
Ong Whiteside was amazing even in limited minutes. Enes Kanter as well.
Feel like Ayton is Enes Kanter who can play defense. His touch around the rim is absolute all time
I want to see the rest of this guys too 5. Does it include Enes Kanter?
"Wtf Mark Jackson for the Jazz? Why?   James Harden, Enes Kanter, Michael Jordan."
frfr Enes Kanter isn't on this thread idk what they're on
Worse speed than Enes Kanter? Damn.
I think hes more like a less refined Enes Kanter with worse footspeed. Though Kanter worked on his body a lot when getting in the NBA.
"Against the Mavs, KD shot 36.8% from the field &amp; 26.8% from 3 (48% TS).    He also had more turnovers than assists.    Enes Kanter had a higher average Game Score for the series.    Without Russ giving them 26-7-11 on 58% TS, OKC loses in the 1st round."
who do you mean by enes kanter with passing and andre roberson with a handle are you talking about julius randle and ben simmons
Enes Kanter. He‚Äôs a walking 20/20. Just don‚Äôt ask him to leave the paint.  Edit: Enes
"Indiana will flop again. Can‚Äôt build around a big man that can‚Äôt stretch the floor, protect the rim, or defend the perimeter. Just an Enes Kanter that can pass"
"&gt; On KOC‚Äôs mock draft, he compares him to Sabonis, Vucevic, and Enes Kanter. Honestly, feels like they just picked three bigs who weren‚Äôt originally from america  Yup. Also see them comparing Giddey to Joe Ingles, and Moses Moody to other guys with long arms"
"Yes, Gobert can't even hit a contested layup. He only goes for hard dunks or open layups, how can you expect him to have post moves?Makes you appreciate how Enes Kanter finishes around the rim."
He sounds like a poor mans Enes Kanter which isn't a great player.
oh wow you mean enes kanter is *not* a difference maker?
"Hiding one bad guard on defense with modern schemes is not particularly difficult.  Portland's issue on defense isn't that Dame is singularly awful (he's bad, but not some horror show that ruins everything himself), but that we pair him with another bad defensive guard, and then run an undersized 3, and then whenever Nurkic stubs his toe (which he does, like, twice a year every year) we end up running the worst defensive big man rotation in the league night in and night out. Whether that's Enes Kanter or Meyers Leonard or Hassan Whiteside or... well, you get the picture."
"Oshley constantly shitting on Stotts what world are you living in? He gave Stotts a life-line in attempts to get over the hump, he coulf have been fired after the Pels sweep or the Lakers series last year. He really has had problems getting a good team, but just a few years ago we were starting, Al Faruq Aminu and Mo Harkless. Now we have a good trade piece in CJ a team friendly deal for Nurk, a good defender in Roco and another solid piece in Norm. The only problem I see is the bench, where we were giving Melo and Enes Kanter significant minutes together, which is just not conducive to winning. And litterally no good off the bench player. We have run out of picks (2025 remains) but its not over. The starting unit is the best we‚Äôve had in a long time."
Y'all are better off just signing Enes Kanter after we let him walk this offseason.
Normal Powell? Anfernee Simons? Enes Kanter?
I want to see kemba throw up 40 a game on the Celtics during his revenge tour after presti releases him into the East again.  The kemba-embiid pr would honestly be absolutely unguardable those 2 are filthy.  Kemba was murdering people with enes kanter last season imagine him with Joel.
"Still fun to think Vucevic, Dre Roberson with a handle and Enes Kanter with passing ability made the all star game over him and Trae"
Who is that? And also how is Enes Kanter so skilled in the post?
His dfg percentage at the rim was worse than enes kanter this regular season. What are those win shares based off of?
"Enes Kanter  If you're giving him playoff minutes, you're hopeless"
"I definitely think he can get better. But I think a slightly taller Enes Kanter is about peak. And for clarity, I have 2 Kanter jerseys and love the guy."
"Let's just be happy you aren't stuck with Aron Baynes, Enes Kanter, or Daniel Theis."
"The thing is he isn't really like Ainge who refuses to trade a pick. He actually is willing to trade his picks help the team now. During the Durant then WB he was actually trading his picks example: Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Jerami Grant, Melo, Dennis Schroder to name a few. He only transition to ( for the future) GM  after the WB-PG trade.  During the Durant era contrary to them just chocking and bad team creation they were were seriously hit by injuries. In 12-13, Beverly injured WB in the first round: 13-14, Ibaka got hurt during the conference finals (their only answer to Tim Duncan); 14-15, Durant got hurt the whole season; 15-16 was ther only real chance to make it back to the finals but they choked and Durant bounced. I don't think Presti can be blamed for this injuries.  During the WB era, no one really saw them championship contenders.  During PG and WB era- first year was a classic choke job but the second year PG and WB was playing with injuries during the playoffs. PG was an MVP candidate, got his shoulder injured during early March  never really recovered (his shooting avareges shoots way down) and needed surgery right after the playoffs  Personally, I think he can be a championship level GM just really series of unfortunate events and fucking awful coaching hire. Tho looks like the new coach is way better than the previous two (Billy Donovan and Scott Brooks)"
Presti is a king. Turning Enes Kanter into 3 first and Kemba ain't bad
"You're using cherrypicked stats of a loaded OKC team vs a severely outmatched SA squad.   KD played on a team where Dion Waiters, Steven Adams, and Enes Kanter were outscoring Tim Duncan, Tony Parker &amp; Manu Ginobili.  Comprehend?  That's the reality.   TD+Manu were averaging 6ppg each in 20mpg, TP 10ppg, Waiters 8ppg, Adams 11ppg, Kanter 8.7ppg  2nd year players like Kyle Anderson in his 1st playoffs was tasked with guarding Durant.     The #1 reason OKC even won was because their role players outplayed San Antonio's, they KILLED the Spurs on the offensive boards, Adams-Kanter erased any bricks thrown up by Durant or WB.  That's the problem with not watching games &amp; taking them totally out of context.   Again this series went 6 games because Kawhi managed to slow down KD &amp; WB whilst being guarded by Roberson."
Enes Kanter
"Guard - CJ McCollum (creation/shooting/handles) and Tony Allen (defense, size, hustle, leadership). Easy 2-way all star, someone every team would want. CJ with TAs transition game would be fun to watch as well. Wing - Gerald Wallace (defense, athleticism, rebounding, hustle) and Rashard Lewis(shooting, size, handle). 2 of my favorites from the era, the combo can hit any shot at any time, absolute madman on D.  Center - Enes Kanter (rebounding, size, post, hands, hustle) and Nerlens Noel (lob threat, rim protection, length, mobility, defense in general) just a player I'd love to see. Probably puts up a 14/14 and is a beast on the paint on both ends."
"With Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard, there are effectively 0 ways to defend the pick and roll"
enes kanter take?
"The real answer is that it was an absolute fucking miracle that that Blazers team even made it to the WCF after their starting center, who was playing the best basketball of his life, broke his leg in half. Everyone understood that in the context of the time, now a few years later when memories are fuzzy it‚Äôs easier to act like this scrappy team that somehow beat Jokic‚Äôs Nuggets with a one-shouldered Ramadan-fasting Enes Kanter should have had a real shot at the Finals.   And no one really considered Lillard a ‚Äòsuperstar‚Äô in 2019, few do now, and if anyone does it‚Äôs probably because of this WCF run, not in spite of it. Also, this was the best playoff run in Portland for 19 years!"
"Look at OKC‚Äôs lineup. Westbrook, oladipo, alex abrines, rookie domantas sabonis and Enes kanter. He carried these bums to the 6th seed and people say he didnt deserve his mvp lol"
"remember when the blazers starting center for that series was a one armed enes kanter, backed up by meyers leonard, quite possibly the two worst pick and roll defenders in the entire NBA?  pepperidge farms remembers.  Clearly it was a better narrative for the blazers to have never advanced as they were expected to lose 1st round, and never to build any lead at all against the warriors, gotta lose more convincingly next time."
"Thank you for that Enes Kanter recognition. I think someone made a really good post about Enes Kanter's rebounding skills complete with gifs about how he positions. Or maybe it was Steven Adams, but yeah maybe Steven Adams should be on the list too."
I'm dying thinking about Stevens nuking the team for picks and Middleton lmao..  Starting lineup:  PG: Dennis Schroder SG: Khris Middleton SF: Aaron Nesmith PF: Enes Kanter C: Robert Williams  Come on that gets MAYBE 10th seed in the East..
Enes Kanter - interior scoring and footwork
Ben Simmons  Andre Roberson  Cedi Osman  Carmelo Anthony  Enes Kanter   Coach: Doc Rivers   Good luck.
It's because KAT is absolutely atrocious on defense. Mans is like enes Kanter
"I *just* updated with a new table showing the players nearest the mean. That was a fun one to make. Some surprises there, too. Enes Kanter!  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Or maybe it's because the best players are outliers so the median is below the mean?  I think this is probably it. Or it could be a kind of cognitive bias we're we tend to think of the good players drafted at a certain spot and maybe some of the busts but never think about the overwhelming majority of average NBA players that make up every draft at every position."
"Defensive advanced stats like this that try to track P&amp;R data and put a ranking on players is nearly useless because it's impossible to capture a defensive grade on an individual level like that with so many moving parts. No account for roles, how different defenses all scheme differently, how certain defenders (like Jokic) are hidden defensively in order to cover up for this, etc.  I only use dFG% because it's a huge sample size over the course of an entire season that is the least noisy; it just shows the objective FG% percentage that a player gives up. It still is noisy to a degree because it still doesn't capture the whole picture, but it's the least noisy out of all stats.  Watching tape shows Jokic is one of the worst defenders in the playoffs. The Nuggets, even when healthy and with all their defensive parts, have to scheme so hard to cover Jokic's weaknesses up in drop coverage &amp; at the rim as much as possible. The Blazers were getting anything they wanted offensively; they only lost a close series because they had a historically bad defense too (Enes Kanter is just as bad).   The fact Jokic stans have to keep arguing that he needs more help defensively shows how terrible he is, because the big man should be the one helping &amp; anchoring the defense, not the other way around. Unless Jokic gets prime Draymond and All-Defensive wings around him, he'll continue to be a detriment."
"lol her kyrie defense and slander is so weird. she says nice things about him then in the same conversation she accidentally does full blown racism on him. and had to apologize over it a week later.   that whole crew bill, russillo and jackie. did some of the most veiled anti muslim commentary. source am muslim enjoy most of their podcast until they started to complain about enes kanter fasting. ""do you have to talk about it every game who cares give it a break"". then they went wild with speculation making fun of kyrie missing games right when ramadan 2021 started during the regular season. these guys hate kyrie i under stand that but he came saying he took. a day to learn to fast and play.   its a good way to introduce some people who never interacted with muslims a taste of them. its not like all november and december i am shoved with christmas related event tv show movies and conversation about it. you dont see non christmas celebrating individuals complain over two months. you get those two guys complain over like 5 games enes played during the playoffs.    also johnthan tjarks said something long the lines jlin is a solid and good christian. when atlanta signed or traded for jermey lin right when they got rid of dennis schroder. dennis is a head case but its not definitely because of his religion. which again pretty tiny stuff but they have a long list of balant anti muslim takes. and its not even the funny and full on racist kind which is easily dismissed.  these people try to be understanding of other cultures but that famous oh no my santa monica promenade. go destory something else rant pretty much showed who they really are."
"You should really look up Enes Kanter dude, he's not the one to talk"
"What? How did we luck into the conference finals? None of the teams we played had significant injuries to the point where their star players missed time. We 4-1'd the Thunder with PG and Westbrook fully healthy and we beat a fully healthy Denver squad in 7 games all while we were missing our starting center and best defender, and forced to start Enes Kanter who is possibly the worst defensive center in the league"
Enes Kanter is a brainwashed joke of a human.
"Enes Kanter is a real one. Might be the ballsiest dude in the league. When half the NBA comes off at randos on Twitter like a well-financed troll, Kanter swings at a totalitarian regime."
Enes Kanter is a piece of shit -every Turk regardless of Erdogan supporter or not
"There is a **spurious distinction** that has been uncalled out for far too long.  For those living under the Taliban, Taliban is Islamic law. This applies whether they like it or not. This applies whether Enes Kanter likes it or not. They have de facto sovereignty in Islamic law's name. They will do violence in Islamic law's name. They will strip women's rights in Islamic law's name. They receive support from much of the population in Islamic law's name. By all meaningful metrics, women do not have rights in Islamic law.  The distinction only exists for those with the luxury of living outside Islamic law - very often Western countries. Countries where women have rights. Now certain extremely self-centered people may pretend women don't have rights anywhere, but women in Western countries have more rights than women living under the Taliban can ever dream of.  Stan Van Gundy is correct. The only thing he did wrong was deleting the tweet.  The aggressive tone Enes Kanter adopts suggests hypocrisy, selfishness and an utter lack of empathy towards anyone but himself - in particular women in Islamic countries. His outrage is directed only towards those who will respond to his tandrum softly. It boils down to cowardice."
"We didn't double when nurkic was in, but he fouled out in almost every game. And no question jokic could put 50 on enes kanter , as much as I like the guy."
"We replaced Kemba with Dennis Schroeder and Kris Dunn, and Enes Kanter is our backup big. We have old ass Horford back. How exactly did we get ‚ÄúA LOT‚Äù better?"
"Yea, because he‚Äôs the worst defender in the entire playoffs except for maybe Enes Kanter"
More like Ben Wallace vs Enes Kanter
Depends on the position. Damian Lillard is way better than Enes Kanter
"At the very least he‚Äôs an elite third string C who can be a spark plug off the bench. Look at Enes Kanter, he can‚Äôt play D OR shoot but he gets so many opportunities"
OKC/WSH was a pick they got in the Kemba trade; OKC chose to send the lower of the two.  DAL/MIA was a pick acquired from Memphis in exchange for Desmond Bane and Enes Kanter. The Grizzlies got the higher of these two the Mavs and sent it to Boston.  These are the two 2023 2nds Boston has and they just gave the lower of those to the Knicks.
Enes Kanter = Penis Cancer
"I really don‚Äôt get why most teams weren‚Äôt more willing to take a flyer on him. In my mind he looked like a guy with a 70% chance of never being a useful player, 25% chance of being Enes Kanter and a 5% chance of being KAT. That‚Äôs worth a late first in my book."
If Enes Kanter can do it so can he.
√å think Kanter is a good Comp defensively.   Though Garza has a wider offensive range. Remains to be seen if he'll be the rebounder Enes is.
"Garza fulfills an important niche in the league: Enes Kanter, but not at risk of assassination or prosecution from the Turkish state"
"&gt;Julius Randle made 2nd team all NBA. So Randle&gt;Butler I guess huh?  Julius Randle didn't make an All Defense team sooooooo but last year, yeah you can make the case he was better.   &gt;Also funny how only one of these players averaged 25+ PPG in the regular season and 30+ PPG in the playoffs  All that to lose in 5, yikes.   &gt;I get Heat fans are down bad it‚Äôs okay, let it all out  Down bad? We had a down season, were still better than the Celtics, had a top 2 off-season meanwhile the Celtics added *checks notes* Enes Kanter and Dennis Schroeder lmao"
Luka-Bradley Beal-Jaylen Brown-Jayson Tatum-Joel Embiid with RJ Barrett-Otto Porter- and Enes Kanter off the bench.
"Yeah, I think he'll be able to stick on rosters. But he'll likely be a complete liability in the playoffs. It's the same thing with Enes Kanter. He's a valuable player during the regular season, but you can't play him in the playoffs when teams gameplan to hunt matchups and scheme ways to take advantage of that weakness much more than the regular season."
Garza feels more like Enes Kanter to me. But I understand the Kaminski comparison as well.
"If Enes Kanter can carve out an NBA career, so can Garza.  Dude is a walking bucket."
ESPN: Enes Kanter wants to re-establish the Ottoman Empire
Enes Kanter. He can‚Äôt defend anyone
I'm only 32 that was before my time. All I've seen is about a dozen old games mostly playoffs and highlight reels.  I never said he wasn't good. I said I didn't think he'd be as good (would struggle) in the modern game. He's too slow to be utilised defensively in a switch heavy league. And he's too small/unathletic/unskilled to guard the top tier post players and roll men. Offensively he'd still get buckets to an extent and I'm sure he'd get boards. But there's a difference between being 76ers Barkley and being 6'6 enes kanter or whatever.  He would struggle in the modern game imo.
"This guy gets it, Enes Kanter makes millions of dollars"
"Smoked? Despite him being bigger, stronger then everyone in the league today? Lol. You do realize he used to school Kareem right? You think the likes if Enes Kanter, Jokic, Kelly Olynk are gonna stop a 7'3 310 lbs giant who could bench 600 and had a 40 inch vert? Lol"
Who will be the best player  Also Sengun and Enes Kanter are completely two different players. Only reason you‚Äôd compare the two is because they‚Äôre from Turkey  It‚Äôs like comparing Jamal Murray and Wiggins because they‚Äôre Canadian
"Mobley is a bust, Cade won‚Äôt be the best player from the draft 3-4 years from now. Sengun is basically enes Kanter"
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
"a lot of what Silver does goes under the radar, which is typically a good thing. his accomplishments deserve a post in itself. some highlights i could think of are:    - lobbying for legalized sports gambling - suspending nba season for covid, and organizing bubble (massive logistical challenges) - supporting players/league through high-profile events (protests, social change Enes Kanter, Morey incident) - addressing anti-inclusive behavior with fines (meyers leonard) - G-league transformation (two-way contracts, better player incentives) - attempting to control NBA parity (fining tanking teams, investigating trades/tampering) - improving relations between referees and players - advocating for more female referees and coaches - honoring high-profile players who did not get drafted (isaiah austin, terrence clark) - nba africa (not sure if he has a giant role in this) - new All-Star game format"
I think most teams would have to go small against him though. They‚Äôre not leaving Enes Kanter out there guarding point-center LeBron
"""All-Star"" that can't stretch the floor, can't protect the rim, can't guard the perimeter, etc.   Basically a hyperbolic way of describing him is an Enes Kanter that can pass"
"I was led to believe Garza won't even be drafted, but he's looking like a better Enes Kanter right now"
"I‚Äôm not defending the trade from okc‚Äôs position. I‚Äôm saying, I don‚Äôt think this is a ‚ÄúW‚Äù for Houston if Sengun is Enes Kanter. I think he‚Äôll be much better and didn‚Äôt like the trade for okc fwiw. But giving up two future firsts for Enes Kanter is not a W. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. Feel like getting more than Enes Kanter value from those picks is pretty likely."
If he is Enes Kanter 2.0 this should be fun to return to.
"The population and its government love their basketball players, like Enes Kanter for example."
if hes gonna be as good as enes kanter that's still great.
You'd trade the 16th pick for a 20 year old Enes Kanter?
  It‚Äôs too early for this tbh  But Thunder fans doing damage control by saying Sengun‚Äôs is a worse Enes Kanter is hilarious
Enes Kanter 2.0?  LOOL
"Comparing all white players to white players used to be the laziest player comps.  Comparing Turkish bigs to Enes Kanter is the new one, apparently."
Garza's basically a younger Enes Kanter rn
If this dude's floor was Enes Kanter he would be at least a top10 pick
"So true, people don't realize that if a player's floor is Enes Kanter then they should be a bonafide first round pick"
"yea what the fuck, who's floor is Enes Kanter? Kanter isn't a stud but no 2nd round prospect comes into the league with that high of a floor lmao"
He has no lateral quickness lol. He‚Äôs more likely to be a better looking Enes Kanter than KP.
Enes Kanter and Myles Turner. Complete offensive package and great switchable defense + insane offensive rebounding. Super valuable player
Enes Kanter and Clint Capela
"With all our playoff shortcomings the past few years, I‚Äôll never understand how we made the WCF with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard"
"Losing Trez does not hurt, I'm sorry, that man's a very bad defender for being in the NBA, there wasn't a boneheaded play he didn't love to do, every game.   I slander him but... I think he's an offense only guy. He's Enes Kanter level bad, but he's athletic enough he could one day put together a good defensive season.  I don't think that happens as a Wizard though."
"Wording is confusing but he's basically saying that even if Sengun is good, he might end up having some kind of weakness that makes him unplayable in the playoffs. I guess the player comp is Enes Kanter who is someone most people would generally agree is good (because of his efficient inside scoring and top-tier rebounding) but is easily exposed in certain matchups"
some thunder fan thinks sengun is gonna be a enes kanter 2.0 lmao. them boys mad
It doesn't help when your 3 guard lineup is hella terrible defensively and you don't have any all-nba defensive level player.  &amp;#x200B;  Enes kanter as your backup big also doesn't help a lot
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
Enes Kanter says this about two teams
enes kanter and hedo turkoglu
To realize that Enes Kanter is the best signing of the summer.
I have no idea what any of the advanced metrics are but if you just watch basketball you know enes kanter is not more impactful than the dudes under him on the list. All he can do is grab rebounds.
You‚Äôre not wrong lol.  &gt;the Lakers will spend $44.2 million on Russell Westbrook. During this time the Celtics will spend $2.6 million on Enes Kanter.
"I can't believe people are still taking this clown seriously. he just uses his platform to get support for his demonic cult.   he even said he went vegan few months ago https://www.peta.org/features/nba-enes-kanter-vegan/  Then proceeded to share images of him cooking meat during the Eid. https://imgur.com/zmcXqRD  The guy went on his knees and kissed Knicks logo during the game after playing for them only about one and a half year, then got traded few weeks later lol. I guess people don't learn. just ignore this fool"
"Be nice, we‚Äôre desperate for any signings at this point. Sadly, signing Enes Kanter did nothing for me"
I would rather have Enes Kanter as my third-string center than Drummond. And I'm not particularly high on Enes Kanter.
Enes Kanter hasn't seen his father since he was 19 because he wants his country to be free. It would be illegal for them to talk on the phone. How fucking cynical do you have to be to call praise for him a 'circlejerk'.
"Enes Kanter is a really bad example because of how much he has improved his skill at rebounding, specifically offensive rebounding."
"I love how Kanter went at Lebron for his Morey complaint about how a tweet hurt him financially, physically, spiritually, and emotionally      Wow dude! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è      ‚Äî Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019      SMH      ‚Äî Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019      ü§¢      ‚Äî Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019      -Haven‚Äôt seen or talked to my family 5 years     -Jailed my dad     -My siblings can‚Äôt find jobs     -Revoked my passport     -International arrest warrant     -My family can‚Äôt leave the country     -Got Death Threats everyday     -Got attacked, harassed     -Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia      FREEDOM IS NOT FREE      ‚Äî Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019"
"I doubt that any of them would want to shake or hug, Enes Kanter supports a guy that is considered a terrorist in Turkey and is hated by 95%+ of the country so i really don't think that any of the Turkish players in the NBA likes him."
"Yes, [the other Turkish NBA players barely talk to him.](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2020/07/18/enes-kanter-turkish-nba-players-erdogan/) Some are even outspoken supporters of Ergodan, IIRC.  And the guy Kanter likes is definitely no champion of human rights, so I don't really buy the /r/NBA circlejerk of what a hero he is."
Enes Kanter is a Hairy-Footed Orc
"This is cool. Another one for me is Enes Kanter. Like, do you not care to become a better defender? I don‚Äôt believe for a second that he simply cannot do it lol"
They were getting destroyed inside either way and instead of playing Kawhi at the 4 to force OKC to either bench Kanter or live with him defending spread PNR on every possession they continued to play David West way too much.  Basically the only team ever against whom Enes Kanter has been playable in the playoffs.  Also lost the crucial game 5 because for abslutely no reason they went to Parker on Westbrook in the second half instead of Kawhi or Green.
"who is you? i'm not a Rockets fan  what does the Lakers scoring in the paint have to do with Westbrook shooting poorly? Portland started an injured Enes Kanter in the playoffs and Westbrook still shot poorly, the worst of his playoff career actually"
"They also lost Zach Collins and Enes Kanter, and have brought in Tony Snell, Cody Zeller, and Ben McLemore. So, they have made some other moves, as well as re-signing Powell, but the question is if these move the needle for Dame. Either way, I think he lasts there until at least the trade deadline, if not into next offseason."
I'm low on Draymond. I think he's a great fit for GS but wouldn't be good anywhere else.   I'm high on Enes Kanter. Lol. He's an easy double-double off the bench. And seems like a good teammate as well.
"It‚Äôs not just superstars that have their best seasons when playing with Russ either. Just off the top of my head, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Dion Waiters, Danuel House, Anthony Morrow, and Thabo Sefolosha are among the role players that were at their best when Westbrook was passing them the ball.   He had literal G-Leaguers looking like somewhat competent role players during his MVP season, and he got Kyle Singler a 5 yr/$25 million contract, which could be argued as being the most impressive achievement in the history of basketball considering how ass that dude was."
"Doesn't matter, we got ENES FUCKING KANTER!!!!  https://i.redd.it/6oivh5md3hf71.jpg"
"&gt;Calling Turkey an anti-authority liberal intentioned government (which I think is what sub point B is about) is an odd move  It was meant to mean "" Enes is not attacking Turkey with anti authoritarian/liberal intentions in mind, he is attacking Turkey because the leader of the cult that he is a member of happened to have fought with Erdogan.""  Enes is a fundamentalist Islamist, has been a long time. He is a follower of the US based Islamic cleric Fetullah Gulen. He had no problems whatsoever for years while Erdogan and Gulen were allied and one by one dismantled the secular institutions and individual liberties.  Only with December 2013, when Gulen and Erdogan broke up and started attacking each other, did Enes' views changed and became anti-Erdogan beneath thin veil of ""liberalism.""  This is an article from Turkish CNN, about Enes informally adopting the last name ""Gulen"" after his parents disowned him. https://www.cnnturk.com/spor/basketbol/enes-kanter-soyadini-gulen-yapti  &gt;As messages specificly applied to Turkey and only Turkey. He has done/said infinitely more work on the international political scenes then 99.99% of the rest of the league, but it will never be good enough.   Please, I'm sick and tired of seeing Islamists claiming liberal intentions. Erdogan and his followers had ""liberal"" slogans and campaign pledges until it wasn't convenient anymore.  What Enes says about ""strongmen"" or ""authoritarianism"" has no value because he does not have ideological nor ethical concerns with said terms. I guess he was gonna be the sports minister of the Turkish Khomeyni in his authoritarianist, Islamist government and continue the ""Hizmet"" movement which he likes the talk about.  Instead Erdogan won the 2016 coup and Turkey went into a different path of authoritarianism and Islamist strongman politics.  Attach Erdogan or Turkey all you want, whenever you want. Praise Enes all you want. Just do it with the right intentions and with enough Info. This is an Islamist ally of Erdogan who because of events outside of his control or knowledge happened to have become an enemy of Erdogan."
"It's a winning offense against certain bench lineups, but that's such a marginal thing that it doesn't move the needle for anyone.  Like if the Celtics were running an Enes Kanter lineup you'd put him out there and go even at worst. That's the value of all-offense no-defense guys who thrive on certain matchups."
Misery also loves Enes Kanter too apparently
"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really a fair characterization of Kanter, or at the very least, by using that logic, you can easily discredit nearly every athlete‚Äôs stance on social justice.   &gt; a) authoritarian regimes, he only has problems with a specific one  In addition to his very public spat with the Turkish government, Kanter was one of the few NBA players that made a statement clearly alluding to  [China during the Hong Kong protest, and specifically Lebron‚Äôs response](https://sports.yahoo.com/enes-kanter-lebron-james-nba-china-turkey-051919243.html). Something that no other NBA player did (to my knowledge, willing to edit). Kanter does frame his battle as a personal one with Turkey, but I do think it‚Äôs  disingenuous to see his statements like:   &gt; Rise of Strongmen is a grim reminder that sustained vigilance is a must for every society  Or   &gt; We need to stop authoritarian leadership in its tracks so it doesn‚Äôt have a chance to evolve into systemic change limiting freedoms and human rights.Standing up to Dictators like @RTErdogan now gives us a chance to restore democracy.  As messages specificly applied to Turkey and only Turkey. He has done/said infinitely more work on the international political scenes then 99.99% of the rest of the league, but it will never be good enough.   &gt; b) that specific one with anti-authoritarian/liberal intentions, he's a member of a cult.  Calling Turkey an anti-authority liberal intentioned  government (which I think is what sub point B is about) is an odd move, when [there has been a movement of constitutional amendments to keep Erdogan in power for 3 decades](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/04/13/the-turkish-constitutional-referendum-explained/), including another wave proposed constitutional amendments [including the elimination of the opposition in democratic forums(HPD Party)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-erdogan-idUSKBN2A13EQ)  &gt; Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have criticised what they see as increasing authoritarianism and threats to the rule of law under Erdogan, especially since a 2016 coup attempt that prompted sweeping crackdowns on his perceived opponents in public services, the military and elsewhere.  I guess it‚Äôs a good think you are only calling him a cultist and not a terrorist like the Turkish government does (because it‚Äôs common in the liberal world to put athletes on terrorist watchlist) . At the very least the language of calling people names who disagree is evolving."
"You guys‚Äô sub is‚Ä¶ something. I‚Äôll say that lol. Lots of generic talkin point comments about his defense when he was actually a really good post defender and about average on the perimeter‚Ä¶ until y‚Äôall would leave him on an island wit the opposing teams best perimeter scorer, or pair him w/ Enes ‚ÄòThe Turkish Turnstile‚Äô Kanter. But his late/close game defense was underrated AF. Plenty of sneaky highlights imo."
"Hassan Whiteside: Led league in blocks, good rebounder, nice stats.  Andre Drummond: Led league in rebounding, nice stats.  Enes Kanter: Good finisher under the basket, nice stats.  Future centers wanting to be in demand and earn serious dollars need to work on being a floor spacer, dual threat in passing/defense, and learn how to get shooters wide open whether it is the p&amp;r, screens, etc., If you're just a center who can only get your own opportunities, you're basically a vet minimum player."
Boston‚Äôs big move‚Ä¶.signing Enes Kanter?
"If win shares and Vorp and shit actually accurately reflected reality, Gobert would be the 2nd best player in the world, Cp3, Capela, and Mikal would be top 15.  /#16 in WS last year was Jonas Valanciunas   /#17 was Luka  /#18 was Enes Kanter  /#21 was Montrezl  /#28 Zubac  /#42 Poeltl, 43 Kyle Anderson, 44 LeBron.   Lol"
"If his summer league was legit (which, considering it's summer league, it may not be) he might not be on the fringe for long. His defense was awful, but he can get buckets. At the very least, he can hopefully be an Enes Kanter type of player."
"The issue is though is there never a guarantee that Ben can slow those guys down in a playoff series. People like Durant or Bron at their current ages have pretty much dominated any one on one matchups they have had.   Also as great as Ben has been on a player like Harden or Trae Young, what still gets lost is Embiids help defense. Just the fact that Ben is able to shade those player is more proof that Embiid and him still have to go hand in hand. We saw multiple times where Ben was able to funnel Trae into Embiid and force a tough floater.   No defender is consistently able to stay in front of their guy, or get around every screen. Especially not to the level of rim protectors protecting the rim. Ben would get scored on a lot more if Enes Kanter was at the rim instead of Joel."
"Agree, but also enjoying fame isn't necessarily bad, you have guys like the Artest formerly known as Peace and Enes Kanter who seem to enjoy the fame but not be fame-hungry."
"We played them heavily injured every year lol. Not surprising we didn't win games against the Warriors with Enes Kanter or Meyers Leonard starting against Steph Curry in the PnR lmao   Like nurkic played a grand total of one half against the Warriors in the playoffs ever....and we won that half by 13 lol  Can't exactly blame Dame this year either,  considering he had what was probably a top 5 series in NBA history for someone who didn't win.   The problem is CJ and injuries man. It's that simple. Injuries take out Nurkic, and CJ has literally been less efficient than Russ' career TS% over the last 6 playoff series we've lost (52% TS%)...as a dude that does nothing but score.   You can't win with that as your #2 when your defensive anchor misses every playoffs with leg injuries. It's a miracle we made the WCF starting literally the worst defensive center of this generation"
The crazy thing is that recently he's been getting shut down even by mediocre ones  The 2019 Blazers were an average defensive team(16th in DRTG) that lost arguably their most important player on that end in Nurkic  Westbrook couldn't score on ENES KANTER
I haven‚Äôt heard that but do agree. I love 90s bball and grew up watching it. People romanticize it though. Athletes always improve with time. Especially the ‚Äúit was more physical then‚Äù talk track. If anything that‚Äôs a huge advantage to bigger faster stronger players‚Ä¶  Enes Kanter and Jonas valanciunas would probably average 25 and 20 in the 90s lol
"&gt;He can, but low BBIQ and lack of motivation is the biggest reason he is not.    Not correct, the guy is basically Enes Kanter with montrous wingspan. Awfully slow feet and doesn't box out. I think he's tries and it's not that he's dumb he's just missing a few key ingredients"
Enes Kanter had 30 rebounds in a game this season? When??
*Enes Kanter has entered the chat*
A choice between Al Horford and Enes Kanter
"Okay, what's Joel's excuse for losing to the Blazers last year when Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic, (and Collins if you wanna count him) were all out with injury?  Our starting lineup was Gary Trent Jr., Rodney Hood, Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter.  Our bench was Simons, CJ Elleby, and Harry Giles.  And Joel Embiid lost.  Can you just accept that single game results are just that, single games?  Nearly anything can happen on a daily basis, and you should not come in here and belittle or gatekeep it."
"So I was looking into this a few weeks ago myself, and it turns out there are still two untied threads that started with the trade, at least on the Celtics' side.   In November of 2020, the Celtics were part of a three team trade with the blazers and grizzlies that sent Desmond bane to Memphis and enes Kanter to Portland, giving the Celtics two second round picks, one in 2023 and one in 2025. These are the last two threads. The Cs were only able to make this trade due to getting the rights to draft Desmond Bane in 2019 through a trade that sent Ty Jerome (and Aron Baynes) to the Suns. Ty Jerome (or at least his eventual draft rights, some of the available info is hard to track) was only able to be traded to the Suns due to the Celtics trading away the draft rights to Matisse Thybulle. They only had Thybulle's draft rights due to a trade with the grizzlies that sent Deyonta Davis and Rade Zagorac to Memphis. Zagorac came to the Celtics through the trading away of Brandon Wright, who came to the Celtics from the Mavericks in the Rondo (and Dwight Powell) deal, while Davis came to the Celtics via the trading away of MarShon Brooks and Celtics legend Jordan Crawford. And to finally tie this all up, Brooks was only on the Celtics because of the initial Pierce and KG trade.  The 2023 and 2025 picks are both second rounders, but it will be very interesting to see how the rest of the rippling effect plays out"
May I introduce you to Enes Kanter?
"Since the 1982-83 NBA season, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Willis, Enes Kanter, Dwight Howard, Andrew Bynum, Kevin Love, Barkley, Mutumbo, Rony Seikaly, Michael Cage &amp; Charles Oakley are the only players to grab at least 30 rebounds in one game.  Dwight Howard &amp; Kevin Love are the only ones to score at least 30 points while grabbing 30+ rebounds in the same game.  Rodman had 5 30+ rebounds games in his career while Kevin Willis had 2."
"&gt; Curry could average a lot more assists, but the play is meant to end with his shot and not keep going around.  That's a pretty poor comparison.  Curry is an excellent passer, especially when it comes to hockey assists that keep the offense moving.  MPJ is a poor passer, period, and it's going to become a problem when defenses start treating him like a 24 ppg scorer.  Hassan Whiteside and Enes Kanter have been efficient scorers for years but are still a net negative to a good offense for exactly the same reason.  MPJ is good enough to make him a net positive but it's silly to pretend it's not a problem."
"I didn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs all it is, but that is a huge part of why so many defenders are good defenders. Also, Enes Kanter is slow as fuck. He does not have all the tools.  Your second statement is 100% speculation. Just because he gets beat doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs missing any ‚Äúinstincts.‚Äù CP3 wasn‚Äôt born a good defender. He *learned* to be a good defender."
"Enes Kanter has all the tools to play defense.  Chris Paul does not.  It's not just about body, but also BBIQ and instincts as well as effort. MPJ is bad at all those."
Al Jefferson was both the best and worst mentor for Enes Kanter lmao.
Counterpoint: Enes Kanter is bad at defense I guess
"yep, currently the only numbers available for new players are: 4, 8, 9 (possibly retired soon for Rondo), 13, 27-30, 37-39, 43, 47+  The only ""normal"" numbers are 4, 8, 9, 13, 30 and 50. If Jabari Parker is released then #20 becomes available.   IMO Richardson will take #20, he wore it in high school. Khris Dunn probably takes 30 as he's been #32 most of his career. Enes Kanter has always worn 11 or 0 so it's a bit tricky but probably takes #13 or maybe 9?"
He might do better on defense with Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard behind him instead of Enes Kanter.
"Pts/Reb/Ast/Stl/Blk   Bruce Bowen: 5/2/2/0/0, 5 fouls, 1 MCL tear   Manute Bol: &lt;5/&lt;5/0/0/&gt;8   Shaq: 28/15   Bob Sura: 26/9/11   Chris Dudley: x/3x/x-5/x-4/x-3, where x = field goal attempts (Dudley formula)   Enes Kanter: 20/10 and the L   Brent Barry: 1 Crip Walk"
Murdering helpless defenders like Enes Kanter
"Dragan Bender, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Dario Saric, Enes Kanter, Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, Ricky Rubio.  It's not that hard to understand. The hit rate on the top international guys leading up to Doncic was very poor, and Luka had worse physical tools than most of them. Ricky Rubio was billed as a can't miss guy in a similar vein to Luka, and then he missed."
You managed to go pretty deep on Turkish big men without mentioning Enes Kanter.
"As a Knicks fan we‚Äôve had disillusioned people saying he‚Äôs going to make an all defensive team for years. I truly think that his defensive is overrated, especially when you consider how much of a liability he is on the other end. Not to mention like 85% of his career minutes came in garbage time against 2nd / 3rd string players.  It‚Äôs kinda like Enes Kanter. The guy can double double at will and get offensive boards but he is sooo abysmal on defensive switches it‚Äôs literally not even worth having him out there. Frank literally cannot shoot or dribble to save his life. Hopefully he can change that in a new setting but he really would have to make a 180."
"Jokic, Embiid and Vucevic are all clearly better post scorers.  Even a guy like Enes Kanter is probably a better post scorer. Lets not get crazy with our rose tinted glasses. He was good, not elite"
Love topics like these.  1- Cavs - Kawhi   2- wolves - Kyrie  3- Jazz - butler   4- cavs - klay   5-  Raps- Isaiah Thomas   6- wizards- vuc  7- bobcats- Kemba   8- Pistons- Tobi  9- bobcats- valancunis   10- kings- bojan   11- warriors- Reggie Jackson   12- Jazz- Marcus Morris   13- suns- Enes Kanter   14- rockets- Nikola mirotic
Enes Kanter 82m   Shit
"Why would I compare what Aaron Gordon is going to make in 2025 to what Enes Kanter made in 2020?  You can't know exactly what individual contracts are going to look like, but the distribution of salaries is relatively predictable since that's basically just determined by the salary cap which is determined by league revenue which is largely determined by media contracts that are signed in advance.  Obviously covid has thrown a wrench into some of those projections, but the cap is still going to go up over the course of this contract"
"Small market curse here, trade for a B/C tier player and end up overpaying on the re-sign because you can't afford to let them go. See OKC with Enes Kanter.  On the flip side, props to the Pacers for not doing this with Dipo."
Just being big doesn't mean anything. Enes Kanter is tall doesn't make him a good defender. KD gets beat off the dribble all the time. Just because he's good at rotating doesn't make him a good overall defender.
"And now we get to the strawmans. Obviously summer league is basketball, but not all basketball is indicative of how play will translate to the professional level...  With vonleh, to the point I was referencing, he was above Sengun in points and efficiency. Granted he was a year older but the point remains. But I was saying by your criteria, Vonleh dominated.  And no... the other 15 or so names I mentioned that you conveniently ignored. I couldn‚Äôt care less if you don‚Äôt wanna compare them to Sengun due to age or position, they‚Äôre still examples of mediocre players that dominated in summer league and stars that didn‚Äôt play well.  Again, summer league means nothing. Sengun could be great. He could be Sabonis with a better jumper. He could also be Enes Kanter, a spark plug big man that plays reserved minutes and rides the bench. But either way it‚Äôll have nothing to do with his play against g leaguers in a 4 game sample."
Enes Kanter = Penis Cancer  Someome came up with this early in his career haha
Who has ever overrated Enes Kanter dude lmfao
"He put up just insane stats (on offense and defense) in the Summerleague. Arguably the best statistical stats for a center in summerleague ever. It is only summerleague but I could never see somebody like Enes Kanter, Jahlil Okafor, or Dragan Bender do that. Look up at the last post in my history if you want to see the comparison. It isn't just summerleague in isolation though. He did it in Europe too in a league where he has all ACC players coming off his bench meaning it is a fair bit better than College and he was the MVP in that league at 18 years old."
"His team was far from terrible grant you, but playing next to Westbrook as your number 2 can prove to be difficult regarding his questionable shot selection and efficiency. That Thunder team in general during that series lacked spacing, Andr√© Roberson, Russell Westbrook, Steven Adams, Enes Kanter, Randy Foye, all those dudes are poor shooters. Their only decent shooter aside from KD was Dion Waiters, yea Dion Waiters. Yes KD choked a 3-1 lead and joining the team that beat you is definitely subject to criticism but to say he was surrounded by talent is a bit too much credit imo. Of course letting Harden walk away was a big blow as well. The fact they had 3 future MVPs and blew it tells you how the Thunder organization ruined their championship hopes."
"By most mocks prior to the draft. If anyone compares his passing to Jokic, the best passing big of all time, that immediately discredits his credibility.  Jeremy Woo specifically said his upside relies on his passing and shooting. Don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant to this, it‚Äôs just saying whether he is good or not in the NBA depends on those skills.   Givony is extremely optimistic on him considering there are 2 players that are the focal points of their team that work in the paint a lot, and that‚Äôs Jokic or Embiid. Nobody else, even guys like Sabonis and vuc, are efficient in the post. Their efficiencies are supplemented by cuts and in vuc‚Äôs case, 3s. Also that description sounds a lot like Enes Kanter offensively so his defence is a big question Mark too.   The hollinger quote is the definition of subjectively assessing tangibles. It‚Äôs like the most vague praise you can give.  I‚Äôve watched Sengun a ton cause a lot of mocks had the Spurs selecting him and I wanna know what we‚Äôre in for. He‚Äôs a great post scorer and a good passer but that‚Äôs about it. Based on his predraft play, he can‚Äôt shoot. Defence is his biggest weakness. And I highly doubt he‚Äôll ever be a 6-7 assist guy. He could be but I doubt it. He could be a Sabonis. He could just as easily be an Enes Kanter. In a worst case scenerio he could be Okafor. Well see how he pans out"
Enes Kanter has entered the chat
"I don‚Äôt really think so‚ÄîEnes Kanter is a much better scorer than Jah, and also is an elite rebounder (which Jah isnt) but is still a matchup dependent role player. That type of player just isn‚Äôt fit for the modern NBA."
He could always move to Turkey and play in the Turkish league. Do the reverse Enes Kanter lol. Also could go suck off Winnie the Pooh in China or become buddies with Kim Jong.
"&gt;He and Drummond are players you need to watch to see how infuriating they are, not just look at the box score because it‚Äôs deceiving.  Ah, the Enes Kanter type. Great in fantasy league only"
"How do people come up with these scenarios....  What's the better team?  Luke Ridnour, Aaron Afflalo, Tracy McGrady, Lamar Odom, Ronny Turiaf  Earl Boykins, CJ McCollum, Zach Lavine, Leon Powe, Enes Kanter"
Enes Kanter would be seen as a great asset. A 6th-man big with post moves for days and an incredible eye for rebounds.
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
- Westbrook and three point shooting  - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and shooting  - Enes Kanter and defense  Ben Simmons has to be the biggest one though. If he just up and became a 35% three point shooter with an average midrange he could average 23/8/8. He is already an All-Star but he would turn into a perennial All-NBA player.
"So 2K Enes Kanter? Actually I take that back, they make him a defense god because everyone that‚Äôs 7 feet just auto blocks and defends everything, but he‚Äôs trash on offense in the game."
Enes Kanter with average defense is a star
Enes Kanter would be significantly more valuable if he played league average defense.
CIA Islam - Enes Kanter   Holy Roman Empire - Dirk Nowitzki   Zeus - Giannis
"Enes Kanter, he really does try his heart out and Adams tried to show him the ways in the Stache Bros days but he's just no good."
Also lmao at Enes Kanter trying to defend him at 2:32
"Enes Kanter‚Äîhe‚Äôs such a striver, but fuck, he just doesn‚Äôt have even a soggy shred of a feel for hedging, P&amp;R, or really even help D. He‚Äôs lost on that end and he‚Äôll never ever learn.  I still love the big galoot though."
"Most people who are athletic enough for regular NBA minutes will be not ""really bad"" if they put some effort in, so it's a hard choice.  Lowkey I'd say Enes Kanter. I have an impression that he tries. He definetely looks energetic and positive on the court. And yet it's just hard to have a good defense when your center is Enes Kanter."
Enes Kanter was compared to [Al Horford](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/enes-kanter/) and [Tim Duncan](https://walterfootball.com/nbascoutingreport2011ekanter.php). If only Kanter wasn't so shit on defense.
"The reason why LeBron torched us was because there were no rim protectors. We had been eating the cavs during the regular season, up until game 5. Ezeli as a replacement for Bogut produced some of the worst defenses I've seen from a big, aside from current Enes Kanter."
It was not lock down defense bruh lmao. Aldridge is still a serviceable big man bc of his offensive abilities and IQ but bro his athleticism totally left him. Saying he‚Äôs a lockdown defender is just looking at it with homer glasses. Dude is like enes kanter. He‚Äôll 100% get targeted in the playoffs and it‚Äôll be very bad
"I'm not a nuggets fan and I wouldn't necessarily agree. I would reserve the ""terrible"" as descriptor for guys like Trae Young or Luke Kennard etc.  In fact I don't think I could argue for any center with minutes to be terrible at defense currently. Even guys like Enes Kanter or Jeff Green are somewhere from slighly negative to clear negatives.  With that in mind I don't really get why it's so impossible to argue for Jokic to being between slightly positive to neutral player on defense. I'm not even quite sure if he's in bottom 10 centers last season and I'd guess that there are less than 10 centers with decent minutes who actually were even negatives of defense."
"Enes Kanter is very definitely not soft. This dude has warrants for his death from his home country, where he can't visit or even really contact his family without endangering them. I'm not a Kanter fan, but dude is a tough motherfucker."
"Not really though.  Enes Kanter, Melo, Seth Curry. These are all guys who's defense is so bad they neuter their team's effectiveness on the defensive end.  Harden's defense is meh at its worst. But it's not something that hurts his team and he plays great on ball defense, which is all you want from a wing/guard."
dennis schroder or enes kanter
Embiid but Enes Kanter deserves a mention too.
"Which players complained about playing in Utah besides like, Enes Kanter, lol."
The disrespect to ‚Äúother pro‚Äù Enes Kanter smh
"Enes Kanter played pickup with Lebron, Durant, Carmelo, and said JR smith!!  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2728678-put-me-on-lebrons-team-inside-the-summers-most-star-studded-pickup-game"
Also not noteworthy but saw Enes Kanter walking around outside a few months ago and we just nodded at each other. My wife spotted him first and jokingly asked if he's an NBA player because he's so tall.
"Oof there‚Äôs almost too many to keep track of. Jordan‚Äôs push-off dagger over Byron to start. The ending of the Deron Williams era (culminating in a first rounder that turned into Enes Kanter). The retirement and death of Sloan. The Exum pick. The ending of the Hayward era (as usual, forced a trade to a high action city). The Miller family selling the team. And who can forget the painful playoff choke (it‚Äôs nothing less than one) this year"
Enes Kanter
I knew our season was fucked when Hornacek drew up a game winning 3 for Enes Kanter and defended it afterwards.
bro enes kanter survives the current nba
You don‚Äôt care about regular season games but I‚Äôm pretty sure 2/3 of nba teams would love to win more in the regular season regardless of what happens in the regular season. But if we are talking about playoff games he did finish off the wizards while Embiid was injured. The same Embiid who would go on to go 0/12 in the second half of game 4 against the hawks. Would you have Nurk over Embiid too?   Regardless that‚Äôs Irrelavent because Nurkic *also* underperformed in the playoffs. And he hinders your team by fouling out and making Enes Kanter try and play basketball.   There is 0 situation any team picks Nurk over Ben.
Don‚Äôt apologize I‚Äôm trolling but if they can get Zach Collins back and get a full season from Nurkiƒá in addition to bringing in Nance it could help their defense tremendously. Remember this is a ball club that was giving big minutes to lineups with both Carmelo and Enes Kanter on the floor together. That said they are not a championship threat regardless so that is definitely true. Dame probably ends up in Philly at the deadline.
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
Enes Kanter being unathletic. He just has terrible defensive BBIQ and always is a step late on defense getting cooked because he doesn't have great anticipation. His participated fully in the NBA draft combine and was above average on all the agility/sprint tests. He also did an intense treadmill test were he was the only Center that was able to complete it when only a couple guards were able to also complete it.
"I believe they were exactly that and this is coming from someone who was a fan of the thunder team for years especially considering the narrative where Lebron was the villain of the NBA.   Westbrook is a great player, but he was definitely one of the most overrated players in the league in his prime. His offense was so one dimensional, he lacked much skill besides his relentless attack and his high energy. He‚Äôs a great player don‚Äôt get me wrong, but besides his tenure with KD by his side, he hasn‚Äôt shown remote flashes of why he‚Äôs a superstar. Being his teammate, I would assume KD would see that before anyone else could. Russ not being a superstar would be fine to be honest if your team was deep enough to combat this similar to how the Bucks and Raptors did in recent years to win a championship. Well was it? Their next best player was a young Enes Kanter. This is the same guy who gets passed around the league now as a solid bench presence, but this guy was their third best player. You could argue that Serge was better and I wouldn‚Äôt mind that, but he was dropping around the same stats as Kanter was, barely above double digits. In addition to that, nobody could shoot the 3 as Anthony Morrow and Dion Waiters were the only ones to shoot above 35% from 3, which is barely crossing the average 3 point shooter threshold. So there was no spacing on this lineup, no clear first option and no real help to the lineup besides Westbrook.   So what were his options? If he re-signed with OKC, he‚Äôd probably sign somewhere in the 25-30 million region, more than his previous contract and further below the cap making it more difficult to fill in the roster with the players they needed. The league was also incredibly shallow at this time to the point where the Spurs with an aging roster were his best option besides Golden State. If you could see this argument with a fair eye, it‚Äôs obvious what decision was the right one but you‚Äôre so driven by distaste for this player. But I guess that‚Äôs what sells tickets ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"trust me, us seculer turks were hating kanter, gulen since they were allies with erdogan. you either dont have any clue about politics or gulenist since you think only erdogan supporters hate enes.."
Faried is nothing like those guys playstyle??   Yall just lumping in dudes bc of hairstyle? Faried and Enes Kanter have more in common than he does with any of those dudes above
"""What if Enes Kanter couldn't rebound?"" is Bargs defensively"
enes kanter erasure
Jahlil Okafor  Enes Kanter  Alperen Sengun
there's probably another draft where there was at least a player at each position who was considered to be good. hold on let me check  yeah 2011. Kyrie/Jimmer/Derrick Williams/Tristan/Enes Kanter. didn't really work out but maybe those other guys won't either. who knows
"My old roommate used to call Enes Kanter ""eens"""
ahh defensive stalwart enes kanter and noted ‚Äúnot undersized C‚Äôs‚Äù al horford and Rob Williams
"why is it a midget squad?  they have one of the biggest/most versatile defensive guards in the league, and their centers are AL Horford, Enes Kanter, and Robert Williams.  I feel like the only ""undersized"" player in their entire rotation is Prtichard who is 6'1""."
Giannis vs. Enes Kanter for the #1 contendership for WWE 24/7 championship. Book it.
"Enes Kanter, for his career, averages 19 points and 13 rebounds per 36 minutes, including an astounding 5 offensive rebounds.  Despite this, there is no team that would consider giving him big minutes during playoff games.  That tells you all you need to know about his defense"
Goddamn Enes Kanter got absolutely cooked. Like he was still in the air while Harden was attempting the layup.
"If you play more than 3 years in the NBA, it‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve cooked Enes Kanter at least once."
You know in cartoons when a dog looks at a cat and sees a steak? That's how Harden sees a guy like Enes Kanter
Nah once you're paid for basketball your eligibility is done.  This is kind of what happened to Enes Kanter.  He was supposed to play for UK but they later found out he was paid or something and he wasn't allowed.
You mocked an Enes Kanter comparison by saying Williams doesn't shoot outside of the paint much. I don't know what to say.
"Dame went to a conference finals with CJ and then Mo Harkless, Aminu and Enes Kanter/ Meyers Leonard as the other starters. Magic fans at least know how impressive that is"
"4 turnovers in the span of 2 minutes in a tied game is elite choking. and considering OKC was 1 win from the Finals, his atrocious shooting qualifies to me  however inefficient he was in reg. season, he hit a career low in the playoffs against a Blazers team starting Enes Kanter"
&gt; His vertical reach is nutty  True  &gt; he doesn't take any shots other than dunks or lobs.  Not true.  He is very skilled offensively. Think Enes Kanter with elite rim protection and athleticism.
Dame went to the conference finals in a harder conference with ENES KANTER as his starting center  Saying Dame doesn‚Äôt make people around him better is wildly wrong. Go look at the number of people who have had their best years in Portland or revitalised their career  Dame is ‚Äúass‚Äù in the playoffs because opposition teams don‚Äôt care about guarding 3 of his team mates
"Defense exists. He gets torched at the most important defensive position by little guards and big centers. He allows a higher % at the rim than enes kanter (lol). Just read that. It‚Äôs not the same as saying a guard like dame or trae has bad defense either, which doesn‚Äôt hurt your team as much."
"&gt;Kawhi's DPOYs came with the still-strong Spurs  By 2015-2016 Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter &amp; Steven Adams were outscoring Tim Duncan, Manu &amp; Parker in the playoffs.   It's so dishonest to pretend the Spurs were some kind of dynasty or the big 3 were superstars when they were on the verge of retirement."
"He is incredible on the court, ask enes kanter if what he does off the court is ‚Äúincredible‚Äù. He is at best an average human being at worst he is profiting off of a Holocaust."

Enes Kanter bout to be the new poster child for r/nba
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"We actually flipped Enes Kanter, Mcbuckets and that 2nd for Melo. Then flipped Melo for Shroeder then flipped Schroeder for a 1st and then flipped that first for Pokusevski. So I'd say the Thunder got their guy!"
"People don‚Äôt magically get better on defense by just playing more dude. This ain‚Äôt 2k. Enes Kanter has been in the league forever now, gotten decent minutes and is still trash on defense. In order to get better on defense, you have yknow get better."

They‚Äôre talking about Enes Kanter and the Kardasians.
That Enes Kanter should be talking up about this [modern slavery](https://i.redd.it/cvdtzm378wv71.jpg)
Why don‚Äôt we fly enes kanter into Israel and show him the other genocide he‚Äôs denying
"Gained even more respect for Kanter for doing this. Morals above money, unlike LeBron who is vastly richer than Enes but still doesn't have morals."
LMAO ENES KANTER BASED AF
I fucking love Enes Kanter dude
"Enes Kanter can't enter his birth country because he spoke out about the crimes committed by the Erdogan regime. You might not like Kanter, but that dude sticks to his guns about the causes he cares about."

"So why do right wingers hate Colin Kapernick? He spoke out about a clearly genocidal, tyrannical regime's reign of terror and disenfranchisement of people of color, your fellow Americans by the way, but people who think like you say he hates America and should leave for disrespecting the flag. Why is Enes Kanter your hero for speaking out about the atrocities being done by China, but Colin Kaepernick is labeled as the enemy for doing the same about the United States? ü§î"
Enes Kanter isnt a CIA asset
Enes Kanter is using his platform in a totally appropriate way.
"It's because they want Israel to be completely gone rather than a two state solution.    Obviously the former isn't going to happen so you have to work with what you got, it's the optimal solution for both parties. Enes kanter knows this and he's not evil for wanting a peace deal between them."
"This is a great idea, actually. You won‚Äôt see a single fucking thing there because there is no genocide.  I don‚Äôt give a fuck that you people on here will drag me. The endless circle jerk that is r/nba v china is ridiculous.  Have you ever seen a genocide where the population increases? No? Then learn from fucking history.  Stop being a United States pawn to peddle propaganda with. All they do is lie about alleged atrocities and then backtrack immensely and say they were given faulty information. Re: that piece of fucking shit war criminal bush and his cadet of crooks.  In conclusion, fuck Enes Kanter. That piece of shit must have had to find a new fucking way to get income because his NBA career wasn‚Äôt working out.  Oh + his opinions on the Palestinian genocide (a real, quantifiable one) are quite interesting and indicative of his moral compass."
esp from a dummy like Enes Kanter.
"The angelic enes kanter, the genocide apologist that follows a group that desires ottoman resurgence and sharia back in turkey  Admit tje countless genocides ottomans comited then you can preach about labour camps (lets not forget about jannisarries you hypocrite)"

"In another era, Enes Kanter is probably an all time great I think. Wish the man wasn't such a black hole defensively."
lmao chinas not that fucking stupid. You think the US wouldn't send a message back? ww3 is not going to start over enes kanter tweeting
This post is about Enes Kanter this reply is discussing Enes Kanter that‚Äôs not whataboutism dumbfuck.
You seen enes kanter lately? trust me he ain't risking a lot lol
"Do you know how loosely Enes uses the term friendship? He could have said that just as a gesture of goodwill bc Bolton met with him and listened to his grievances. I highly doubt Bolton and Kanter are friends.  All you are doing is trying to marginalize Kanter. This thread is about how shitty China is to people and how quiet Nike, LB, and MJ are about it."
"This is so aggressive it almost seems like a long-term plan to benefit China. The trio waltzes into a plant that has like 2 weeks to tidy up and hide the shackles and it's now a gigantic, public L for the anti-slave labor contingent.   Not really, but it's funny to imagine LeBron James, Enes Kanter, and Michael Jordan catching the PRC off guard like a basketball-themed special ops unit. A supervisor finds the film roll and they run a perfect 3 man weave with it to make sure it winds up with Homeland Security. And then they each lose like half their wealth as China cleans up its act. Say what you want about Enes, but the dude is GROUNDED..."
"FUCKING RIGHT, ENES KANTER."
China hasn't assasinated an American on U.S. soil in modern history and they for damn sure aren't going to start with Enes Kanter.
No he‚Äôs not man. I promise you Enes Kanter isn‚Äôt moving the needle. These quotes are good for upvotes and Twitter likes.
"The only reason Enes Kanter is whipping up a storm about China, is to prevent the Celtics from cutting him"
Enes Kanter isn't brave for regurgitating Cold War-era State Dept propaganda.
Enes Kanter is a full-of-shit Gulenist who supported a movement that led to the rise of Erdogan. And now he speaks out against Erdogan as if he and his cultists had no part to play in his takeover. He's an attention seeker who 's conservatism leads him down purely anti-communist takes.
"This is false, he has his green card and is working towards becoming an American citizen. He doesn't even have his Turkish passport anymore  [Source](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/enes-kanter-considers-adding-american-name-once-he-becomes-us-citizen)"
"They're not unrelated though, he is part of the G√ºlen movement and that is what shapes all his activism. He draws people in but has a clear agenda to push and tbh I don't find that it's helpful for THIS guy to be the one criticizing China. The messenger does matters, and I don't think a heavily biased voice to be a powerful or useful one at all. I think he enjoys this attention and does what is in the interest of his movement, not because he is just somebody who cares.  I would hope people just wouldn't listen to Enes Kanter about politics, given he is an unreliable source. But here on /r/nba he is a savior standing up for freedom lol. It's bizarre and more people should call it out"
"How has Enes Kanter gone from  ""Penis Cancer"" to voice of the voiceless. Love the trajectory."
&gt; The difference is that these people are unknown to the general public  Most people have no idea who Enes Kanter is.
No because I don‚Äôt know anything about Enes Kanter. And I don‚Äôt particularly care. Can‚Äôt know about every atrocity that affects this world.
Enes Kanter is right.
"I hope people take this with love. Kanter was brought up in a Gulen school and is surrounded by multimillionaires all day. This feels like a path he could take that could end with him becoming a really rounded activist (there are *many* civil rights figures with variously imperfect early platforms, be it religion, politically, socially or criminally).   But also feels like a path that could take him to being like, another shill for the US Government. Like, I guess I have hope he can generalise what the actual issue is‚Äîexploitation of the poor by the rich‚Äîand not get stuck in the weeds of what flavour of genocide is the topic today. But he might think he‚Äôs found the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù in some ideology, an idea of this or that group being chiefly and exclusively ultimately responsible for the world‚Äôs ills.   The media is priming the 2020s for war against China, because all these people know there isn‚Äôt a sovereign nation in this world not guilty of a genocide, or slavery, or an institutionalised exploitation. People can see that something‚Äôs wrong and some of them will be fooled into thinking Chinese people are that problem.  Anyway, back to Enes. Man was literally brought up in a cult, and now has more money than you could imagine. He‚Äôs going to be very imperfect but I hope he can take this stream to the most rounded conclusion."
Enes Kanter going to end up making my next pair of dunks if he keep messing around like this.
"Whatever ur opinion on Gulen is it's pretty huge for anyone as well known as him dropping this and tagging those people. The whataboutism by some people is ridiculous, unless Enes is some saint he can't call out something as horrid as this? Even Pakistan just completely pretends this doesn't exist.    Two things can be true at the same time it's really ok buddy, yes Gulen is a POS and so is what Kanter is rallying against."
"Nobody should be listening to Enes Kanter about global politics either but this, along with all of his other tweets will rise to the top of /r/nba as they always do.  https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWTXSxFTkb/  He has a very very clear agenda and political motive but everyone here seems to think he's just a guy who cares or some shit"
Enes Kanter needs to stop attaching himself to every cause and get better at playing basketball
"Ok everyone, now Google Enes Kanter + Sudan or Haiti or Palestine or any other nation that has suffered a human rights crisis and see how much Enes cares."
"Enes: China Please Stop   China: Wow Enes Kanter a no-name basketball player in the NBA is telling us to stop committing war crimes okay we will stop thank you so much for showing us the error of our waves Enes   &amp;#x200B;  \*\*10 years later\*\*   The world has finally found world peace. All nuclear bombs have been disassembled. Astroids have stopped orbiting the planet. Volcanoes have sucked all of their lava back into the mantle bc enes Kanter said ""guys chill"".    Their is one savior to thank for all of this. The third coming of god himself Enes Kanter"
Man. Totally different situation. Apples to oranges. Kaep engaged in something that could potentially cost the league a major major sponsor. Ben is only costing the 76ers money.   Enes kanter is probably a more apt comparison (but like in a more right wing sort of way).
This mfer always has some progressive talking points I agree with but it's Enes Kanter so I can't fuck with it
"So Reddit is all about taking sides no ifs or buts so who do we side with, Hedo Turkoglu or Enes Kanter?"
Saint Enes De Kanter
Enes kanter is my favorite athlete. Any shoe or apparel companies make their stuff in America or at least not China? They should let kanter make commercials and just say brought to you by apparel company. I‚Äôd buy something from them immediately.   Hell we should crowd source a Super Bowl ad for him.
"no it actually applies to enes kanter, sorry that is hard for you to compute lol"
it's not a conspiracy lol enes kanter is literally friends with john bolton and is using this attention to promote shoes
"Oh yeah, big time. He cut ties with his family over that shit. Enes Kanter fucking sucks, and I wish people would stop treating him like some infallible hero."
Fuck Enes Kanter
"I think Kanter doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about Muslims or he wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here supporting Israel. A lot of politicians, popular figures and ppl here for this matter pick and choose when the lives of Muslims matter   The NBA apologized to Israel for acknowledging Palestine but I don‚Äôt see ppl going at Enes for supporting a ‚Äòtotalitarian, authoritarian, draconian (insert favorite adjective)‚Äù dictatorship everytime he says something like y‚Äôall do with China"
"&gt;Ene Kanter whos good friends with John Bolton  Do u mean an NBA player that became an enemy of the state in turkey had a meeting with a US foreign policy advisor, or do they go to the local pub every Friday after work for drinks?  Don't be dishonest and characterise Enes Kanter as being ""good friends"" with a POS like Bolton because there's an image on the internet together, it ain't that deep."
My mom and I were in a debate about the state of the world. She eventually said ‚Äúwho are the heroes then?‚Äù The first two I could come up with were Enes Kanter and Steven Donzinger.
"If I‚Äôm a dipshit for seeing straight through a painfully obvious grift, sure. He‚Äôs out here wearing custom Enes Kanter x Winnie the Pooh shoes and cozying up to pro-Israel figures. It‚Äôs not Enes‚Äô place to be telling Muslim Arabs and Arab nations to call out or say anything, he can piss off along with Jared Kushner.   If you disagree, you‚Äôre the exact type of person he‚Äôs going to be making money off of as soon as his playing career is over."
2019 WCF easily tbh  Probably the only sweep that legitimately felt like it could have gone the other way  Maybe if they didn't put Enes Kanter on Steph Curry lmao

"I‚Äôm a Chinese shill or bot because I took issue with Enes Kanter for calling out Arab nations, sure dude. Makes total sense"
Exactly!   When is Enes Kanter going to get around to addressing the most important controversies of our day and age!
American politics. [Enes himself](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/477599-enes-kanter-sees-political-stardom-after-nba-and-wwe) has expressed interest in the idea
Enes Kanter doubling and tripling down on being the most BASED player in the NBA. Keep up the good work Kanter üëç
"Enes Kanter is the only player I don't like on court, but do off court. Usually the other way around."
"I'm confused here. Are you arguing the camps exist or not? Because China states they do. If you're arguing that sources are biased, why did the Turkish government, led by a man that Enes Kanter hates, also [call on action to be taken](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/world/asia/china-turkey-uighurs.html). You can keep burying your head in the sand and keep screaming there's no evidence, but all evidence from all unaffiliated non-US or China entities found evidence of categorical human rights violations."

I'm not making this about Turkey but you are questioning my integrity and knowledge of my people's history.   This is purely about Enes Kanter and his dangerous political views.
Enes Kanter is a much better person than lebron james
&gt;It doesn't have anything to do with that but Enes Kanter is a follower of G√ºlen and him doing stuff like this where he goes and builds a brand as a progressive man who calls for peace around the world legitimises G√ºlenism and gives them a spoke person who can show them in a positive light. That type of behaviour is incredibly dangerous in the long term and that's why it should always be noted that Enes Kanter is a wackjob.

wow enes kanter didn't play? maybe he shouldve focused on basketball instead of chinese politics
In what world is JV better than turner on defense? Did you even watch his games?  There is a reason memphis and even toronto traded him. He cant guard for shit especially on the PnR. Similar to enes kanter but better offensively
"&gt; Austin Rivers isn't even a shooting guard so, no?  He was Denver's starting SG in that series and has played the majority of his minutes at SG.  &gt; Denver has 4 players on their roster that are an mvp and 3 legit should be/fringe all-stars.  You...have a weirdly excessive amount of hype about Denver's roster from that series.  But even if we stipulated the accuracy of that hype, how does that mean Dame was let down by his team?  Surely the conclusion should be that the other team was simply better from top to bottom.  &gt; Again in 18-19 we played Russ and PG and Steven Adams, heck Jerami Grant is better than any of our role players in the last 6 years. We started Enes Kanter. Multiple players that were on our roster from that season are not even in the NBA anymore.  Multiple players that were on OKC's roster from that season are not in the NBA anymore.  2019 Russ was not 2017 Russ.  Your assessment of the respective rosters doesn't match how they were actually playing.  However, Nurkic's absence certainly swings the argument here, and I'll concede that that's not a ""Blazers *should* have won"" series as I claimed.  &gt; You didn't see the physical toll that Dame endured to get us there.  And it sure is a good thing that when Dame's toll came due in the Nuggets series, there was a team around him.  While acknowledging that Portland has had bad roster construction for ages, I'm not sure what results you expected such that Dame's results are a historic letdown.  Dame is prodigious, an All-NBA talent...and more playoff teams than not are led by All-NBA talent.  How far is he 'supposed' to get?"
"Austin Rivers isn't even a shooting guard so, no? Point stands. Denver has 4 players on their roster that are an mvp and 3 legit should be/fringe all-stars. We had Dame, CJ...um Nurkic sometimes but not then, Old Carmelo, Normal Powell who seems to be a shell of what Toronto fans think he is?  Again in 18-19 we played Russ and PG and Steven Adams, heck Jerami Grant is better than any of our role players in the last 6 years. We started Enes Kanter. Multiple players that were on our roster from that season are not even in the NBA anymore. Your assessment of the 18-19 is flawed probably because you were too busy watching really good, fun, winning basketball while we ground our way to come see you in the WCF. You didn't see the physical toll that Dame endured to get us there."
"Enes Kanter, I agree."
"To quote a wise man: Fuck you China, China is asshole. And Enes Kanter is now my favorite player"
Enes Kanter. I couldn‚Äôt find Any reason
LeYuan about to orchestrate Enes Kanter playing in the Turkish League professionally.
"A big knock on Brad Stevens (whom many regarded as a good coach) early in his tenure was the lineups he put out were questionable. People freaking out over Udoka after 2 games need to settle down as things like schemes take time to implement with guys who were so used to Stevens‚Äô system (Tatum, Brown and Smart specifically). Yeah we were getting killed on the boards and turning the ball over too much, it‚Äôs gotta be fixed. Could have used Kanter for a bit there instead of Grant at the 5 in the 3Q even if his defense is abysmal, and Tatum/Brown never seem to have good games at the same time. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to question their fit if this continues through this year.  In any case, I‚Äôm not sure why the expectations were so high when all the Bradley Beal to the Celtics rumors months ago fell through and we ended up with Dennis Schroder, Josh Richardson, Al Horford and Enes Kanter, but otherwise the EXACT same team and people thought these guys would move the needle to push them to the 3 seed? It was always going to be a non-contending year and they 100% have to land a guy next off season or you can start to blame the FO for not getting the personnel they need to contend.  Sorry, but a bunch of guys who are basically 6th men/bench guys hasn‚Äôt changed that. It‚Äôs going to be another rough year for Celtics fans I think."
Enes kanter offense + Myles turner defense
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
"Jahili okafor was failed by lack of vet leadership, coaching and front office. He could have easily been a 20/10 guy or an enes kanter type sixth man role. Instead he was forced to play for a team with no point guard, no vet leadership and was thrown to the wolves. He was fighting fans after games for gods sake because he was out on his own after games. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs Tim Duncan come again or anything but his whole career trajectory was screwed up by ‚Äúthe process‚Äù and honestly that aspect of it doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough when this sub circle jerks to it they failed a lot of young prospects and set them up to fail. Guys like Noel, okafor were thrown away or treated as disposable assets    When you create a losing environment and don‚Äôt actually bother to show young prospects the ropes things aren‚Äôt going to go well. In their pursuit to the bottom though it was in the sixers best interest to throw every pick in to sink or swim and scrap anyone who didn‚Äôt swim"
Very cool Enes Kanter. Next time I have cash to waste on something I might buy a jersey.   I do not like organized religion but I like people.  Slave camps are bad if anyone was confused.
In this house we Stan Enes Kanter
"lol as usual r/nba likes to pretend that enes kanter saying this shit is going to do anything about china. kanter is only doing all this ""activism"" so people don't talk about him supporting an islamist cult"
"Turkey already wants to kill him, china just being pussies. Enes Kanter keep speaking your mind man!"
"Enes ‚ÄúJohn Bolton‚Äôs best friend‚Äù kanter, I can‚Äôt believe people are taking him seriously"
Enes Kanter Freedom
Yeah he lost me at praising Enes Kanter Freedom
"Yeah when your star player breaks a 60 year old record that no one would ever thought to be broken, wins the scoring title, leads the league in clutch scoring, is 2nd in assists, carrying what should have been the worst team in the league to 47 wins in the West while our best scorers were Enes fucking Kanter and injured and out of shape Oladipo, yes we‚Äôre gonna push that motherfucka are you kidding me? Fuck outta here and tuck your hate boner away."
Yep. Now imagine if Jokic or Novak said anything like that. Meanwhile Enes Kanter of all people is fighting for the truth in...... China.
That's all I needed to know about Enes Kanter. Fuck off Enes.
I blame Enes Kanter Freedom
"Super cool. The ol‚Äô ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs sucks even worse at [insert country] so you shouldn‚Äôt complain about the issues in America‚Äù reaction. Enes Kanter can fuck right off."
aww man why mods why I'm gonna miss seeing Enes Kanter Freedom posts on r/nba
Enes Kanter has balls so big he needs a wheelbarrow.  The man is a hero.
imagine finding out about a new rule about Enes Kanter in a post about Jeremy Lin
"Holy FUCK dude, if you get called out for not reading an article, consider reading that article.  In the same article I just referenced they talk about how the Chinese embassy literally tweeted about the sterilization. In the fourth paragraph. I‚Äôm not here to click links and copy paste text for you.  While I‚Äôm here though, because you really deserve it, here‚Äôs 400 pages of internal Chinese documents, this time from over two years ago:  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html  I‚Äôm not doing this for your benefit. You‚Äôre going to hand wave this very good ‚Äúevidence‚Äù with some other excuse because you clearly aren‚Äôt interested in learning. But if you‚Äôre going to accuse me of spreading disinformation and then spread it yourself, I‚Äôm going to come back at you on that.  Some of us cared about the situation in Xinjiang before Enes Kanter opened, and will still care after this. But go ahead and ignore it because he said a completely unrelated thing you disagree with."
"Frustration fouls sometimes sure, but he's not trucking people in the backcourt. All of this revisionist history by sixers fans who never watch our games is actually kind of adorable.  In before someone comes through talking about how blocking out Enes Kanter when Kanter had a sore shoulder is somehow also dirty"
"Why do you think politicians don't poke the bear? This is the real world, Enes Kanter has the freedom to publically and vocally criticize the CCP, my prime minister does not (without massive repercussions). The world does not conform to ideological purity, the older you get the more you learn that."
"After the post the other day about him going on Tucker Carlson and saying (paraphrased), ""No one should criticize anything about the U.S. because there are other countries that have it worse,"" the mods finally stepped in and said that would be the last Enes Kanter post allowed (that isn't about basketball.)"
Right wing grifter Enes Kanter Freedom.
"&gt;He‚Äôs been a positive contributor on the court and completely outplayed Horford recently as the primary big man  Well that's a lie and you should feel bad for thinking a Celtics fan is just going to eat your bullshit.   Over the last 5 games, Al is averaging 10 points and 8.4 rebounds (whilst being in a massive slump on his 3pt shot). The Turkish git is averaging 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds. Let's look at the last game against Raptors - Al got 17/11 in 26 mins, Kanter went 9/10 in 22 mins.   We're not going to even bother with defensive metrics because obvious reasons, but even using offense alone (I.e Kanter's only forte) you're full of shit.   &gt;he‚Äôs the only person in the league willing to address any of those issues  People say all sorts of shit behind the protection of social media. Oh wow, he trolled someone via Twitter, he sure is such a brave man!   &gt;I think his basic point is that we at least have political and legal freedoms/protections here which is completely true  Funny way of making that point eh? Shut up and don't criticise your country, you have no idea how good you have it is either dumb (because events outside one's country have absolutely no effect on that person's view of their own country) or malicious (because having the legal freedoms/protections in the first place means the individual can and should criticise the country's failures or shortcomings). Either way, he can fuck right off.   &gt;Try supporting LGBTQ or minority interests in countries like China or Turkey. You can‚Äôt.  Don't really care, am not in China/Turkey and my team doesn't play there either. Enes should however travel and wage his noble battle there. Everyone will come out winning from it."
enes kanter is losing his credibility
"Enes Kanter is not a moral man, he's an opportunist whose support for Uighurs is limited to using them as a stepping stone to a career as a gross right-wing pundit."
&gt;Is Enes Kanter the only moral man in the NBA?  Are you stupid

"Shut the fuck up Kanter. I know you‚Äôre new here so let me break it down for you: *criticizing the government is literally what makes America great.* You stupid ass. How do you think we‚Äôve managed freedom for so long? By Presidents saying ‚Äúno thanks fuck the government I‚Äôm not taking a crown.‚Äù By people saying ‚Äúwow I guess *all* men don‚Äôt really mean ‚Äúall men,‚Äù huh?‚Äù The only thing that keeps us going is a constant and unending fear and suspicion that the government is trying to fuck us over, which it literally always is. Remember the Tuskegee Syphylis Study? That was 1972. But incase that‚Äôs too long ago, remember the fiber optic cable scandal? When government taxed us 200 *billion* dollars and then promptly deposited it into some private companies bank account without getting anything in return? Remember when government bailed out Chase in 2008? Well guess what, Chase is still charging us fees.  I‚Äôm sorry Enes but you‚Äôve gotta lot to learn buddy. If you wanna be American then you‚Äôre gonna have to trade that third world government-worship nonsense in for ‚Äúconstant suspicion and discontent.‚Äù"
Shocked it took this long for him to say something like this and even more shocked it took this long for Enes Kanter posts unrelated to basketball to get banned lol.
The Turkish Enes Kanter
"People in that part of the world are nothing if not what you might call *passionate*, if you were trying to be nice about it.  If you weren't you'd just say angry.  Enes Kanter is amazingly chill for a Turk. Like, he didn't charge onto the court when Steven Adams flattened Beverley and he hasn't pulled a knife on Giannis even *once* that we know of.  Now, it's possible Kanter is too racist to consider Giannis *truly Greek*, but Giannis absolutely *reps* Greece, so.  Meanwhile, Jokic is from the literal Balkans, a region so angry and hate-filled that it gave us the word *Balkanization*."
"Why doesn‚Äôt Enes Kanter, the larger Fascist, simply eat the other Fascists?"
"First off, the point is asinine ‚Äî to the extent America is great relative to more repressive countries, it‚Äôs in large part *because* we‚Äôre allowed to criticize the country/government. (And Kanter isn‚Äôt one to talk‚Ä¶ or is he, since he mouths off constantly.)   Second, what a fucking tool Enes Kanter is for talking to Fucker Snarlson and talking up American democracy while playing directly into Fucker‚Äôs fascist, anti-democracy agenda."
Only because Enes Kanter Project for the New American Century wouldn‚Äôt fit on the form
"&gt;NOTE : As the r/nba mods have said, this is the final non-NBA related post in regard to Enes Kanter.  I was planning to post a very detailed thread where I take this brainwashed clown's mask off.   Is it banned now?"
Enes Kanter CIA Asset
"This just in, Enes ""PsyOp"" Kanter leaves Celtics to sign a supermax with Fox News."
"And just like that, we go back to hating Enes Kanter. Who could‚Äôve seen this coming?  Imagine having your head stuck up your own ass so much that you think people who experience something shouldn‚Äôt criticize it or want it to improve because others have it worse. Maybe we should start telling stabbing victims to stop complaining so much since some people get shot. What a fucking dumbass  Also ‚ÄúNBA Star‚Äù lmfao"
"did you see [tucker's face when he said that](https://imgur.com/a/2AYr4M9)? enes kanter isn't a moron, he's a sex worker."
"So, ""Enes Kanter Freedom"" as in ""George W. Bush""-era concept of Freedom."
I'm glad Kanter got his US citizenship but he also apparently got the neocon brainworms. He also doesn't seem to realize that Erdogan trucks with the Fox News crowd.  Hopefully someone close to him starts talking sense. Enes always seemed like too good a guy to fall into this rabbit hole when he was in OKC.
"When Black people who lurk call this place just another form of racism, Enes Kanter rise on this site is an easy go to reminder"
Kanter did all that shit talking about LeBron publicly and when he seen LeBron in person he didn't say anything to him.   That pretty much sums up Enes Kanter for me.
"I feel like people don't really know the history of Kanter, there's a reason many anti-Erdogan Turkish people think hes a piece of shit. He's a cultist, who's cult leader lost and fled to the US to be used as a CIA asset. So I already saw through his ""freedom fighter"" bullshit for a few years. But his history isn't really known unless you dig a bit. Most people just hear ""Kanter fled dictator and now fights for freedom"" which while true he did flee a dictator, hed be perfectly fine if Gulen was the Turkish dictator (even tried to have his name be Enes Gulen at a time). So his ""I fight for freedom and justice"" has always been lame af. His gift has been starting for a few years, with his pro-israel propaganda and hanging out with US generals but now he's just gone head first into it.  This is speculation on my part but with his career winding down he's found a pretty profitable lane as a right wing grifter and I saw his fox news appearance coming from a mile away. He's set himself up to be a right wing hero post playing career so he's using his last years in the league to leverage the media into a post playing career endeavor.   Enes Freedom does not give a single fuck about human rights and him changing his name to Freedom is so poetic because it's just a token gesture that doesn't do shit just like everything else Enes Freedom does."
"Kanter was a [major BLM supporter and was speaking at rallies ](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/enes-kanter-continues-fight-civil-rights-speaks-black-lives-matter-protest) (did a lot more on it than most players), I don't think this quote was meant to tell black people to shut up or to say you can't criticize cops."
"So to summarize what double-speaking clown Mr. Freedom is basically saying  &gt; I love America because people are free to say as they please in this nation even if it‚Äôs against the government. That being said, people should keep their mouths shut criticizing this great nation‚Äù  Also,  &gt; this is the final non-NBA related post in regard to Enes Kanter.  #Thank fucking god"
"TLDR: the fact that Enes Kanter is going to be an alt right talking head doesn't mean the position itself is wrong.  Hmmm I would say standing up against the atrocities of China, *the only item he emphasized*, is not only an alt-right issue. Mostly if you care about all the countries in South East Asia, like mine.   I get it, Enes turned into Fox News crackpot. But that particular position the guy you commented to, questioned, isn't really wrong.   And, well, others have already turned out a more nuanced reply in this very thread, so go read up on what they said."

"You came back to this thread for that? I've mentioned multiple times I'm not an Enes Kanter fan. I'm not a fan of his teams, I don't care about his play. I appreciate his stance on China, and am confused about this sub doing a 180 in record time."
"If Enes Kanter Freedom is actively playing in the NBA, wouldn't anything he does become NBA-related? Also, if something like this will be stopped for Enes Kanter Freedom, shouldn't non-NBA related posts be stopped for all NBA players, past &amp; present? Or, is it just singling out Enes Kanter Freedom specifically?

The last Enes Kanter Freedom political commentary thread??? Salute to our Turkish king for heroically sacrificing his NBA career for our entertainment with heapings of performative activism and a morsel of actually important information.
Enes Kanter is officially a fucking moron.
I thought that Kanter was out there criticizing China because they use slave labor to make Nike sneakers? But it‚Äôs not okay to criticize the US where slavery is explicitly made legal in its Constitution and is still being used in the present?  It‚Äôs almost like Enes never actually cared about human exploitation and just wants attention.

Sounds like he must have cheated to pass that citizenship test. Finally, a basketball player who *actually* does something that deserves telling them to shut the fuck up and dribble."
Enes Kanter Freedom *Except Speech
Enes Reddit State Department Kanter
"Enes Kanter to Tucker Carlson on Fox News on Americans criticizing America: ""I think they should just give up freedom of speech and stop saying things I don't agree with"". ""People should really be blessed to be in America, they love to criticize it, but when you come escaping from a country because you participated in coup d'√©tat attempts, and you finance terrorist organizations, you appreciate the freedoms you have here (to attack the enemies of the USA on Twitter)""."
"I don't think Enes Kanter Freedom being the token right-winger NBA player really changes anything. His talking points (China bad, USA infallible) isn't going to change anybody's mind about anything. Now he has gone on record saying that America, a country with a literal offshore torture facility and the largest prison population in the world, shouldn't be criticised, his voice means as much as any other token minority voice the right wheels out."
"Honestly, Enes Kanter is and always has been corny and performative as hell."
"That's Enes Kanter Freedom to you, sir."
"I think Bam is a genuinely great defender but when he plays Jokic he looks like Enes Kanter on defense. And when the heat ran Zone or doubled him he had those pretty no look skip passes that lead to open threes for the Nuggets. Teams like Clippers, Heat, Raptors have a torrid time against Jokic because of this"
Hey that‚Äôs what Enes Kanter said not me   But I know what kind of person you are already so I‚Äôm not expecting much in the way of critical thought
Last Kanter commentary thread is funny af tho. Did you guys just realize what Enes is about and no longer fuck with it when it doesn't line up with the people you wanna see him go at??   If we can post all of his free china shit and help signal boost him there we should be able to discuss his shitty takes moving forward.
"Shams: Kanter has decided to rescind his pending name change, now changing his name to Enes Kanter State Deparment. More to come."
"I'm not sure why this has to undermine that.   We can agree with Enes Freedom that China is the drizzling shits while also saying he's a flaming fucking idiot for these comments.   ""Because you have the freedom to speak out against your government/country means you shouldn't speak out against it.""  One of the dumbest things that routinely gets said in right wing circles.   To recap, China sucks, Kanter sucks, I suck, and all of you probably suck. None of us can be trusted to not be shitty.   I'm rooting for an asteroid at this point."
Not only are there definitely people who would say that shit (and have!) but Enes Kanter isn't from this country so the weight of it won't mean anything to a guy like him.
It's fucking hilarious that this sub was pretty much jerking this dude off a month ago. Y'all hate LeBron so much you thought Enes Kanter was one of the good guys lmao.
"If he never said this, it literally wouldn't change any of your opinions on Enes Kanter Freedom"
Well Lebron sends out an occasional tweet then makes a philanthropic donation. Enes Kanter goes on Tucker Carlson then changes his name to Freedom. I think they're handling activism a bit differently.
Enes Kanter shut the fuck up challenge
I feel like Enes Kanter should shut the fuck up.
"It's weird that the guy who constantly swings wildly at people with no regard for what he hits when whining for fouls isn't know for being dirty...  I guess slapping Patrick Beverley, throwing am elbow at Meyers Leonard, slapping Cameron Payne, shoulder barging Enes Kanter when he had a separated shoulder, shoulder barging Markieff Morris doesn't count. Sure as shit makes for a longer video than Isaiah Stewart who's been branded dirty already by some."
"I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs doing anything I‚Äôm saying even something as silly as a name change should spark a conversation rather than making fun of the guy. He had brought up these issues, and it‚Äôs worth looking into the severity of them. I don‚Äôt need Enes Kanter to save the world, or to fight the leader of China with his bare hands. What I want is for people to stop directing focus from what he has tweeted and spoken about and then focus on how he‚Äôs an attention whore or that he‚Äôs stupid for changing his name."
they should ban the enes kanter guy next
Enes Kanter will probably invite those fans to the next Lakers vs Celtics game /s
"Well considering he isn‚Äôt an elected official I‚Äôm not sure what actions you want him to do to change the outcomes of what‚Äôs happening there. But meeting with said elected officials about the countries policies is doing more than literally anyone else. You say talk is cheap yet he‚Äôs the only one trying to change things.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.jpost.com/opinion/enes-kanter-israels-unlikely-nba-ally-opinion-665659/amp  Here is the article, looks like the camp in Israel hasn‚Äôt happened yet it‚Äôs still in the works. So I was incorrect in that it hadn‚Äôt happened *yet* as I got it confused with the one that did already happen in Brooklyn.  Also calling Israel an apartheid state is not correct, it literally cannot even fit within the definition of what apartheid is. Calling it apartheid is disrespectful to those who really lived in apartheid South Africa. Israel has its issues, a lot of issues, but calling it apartheid is just a buzz word thrown around when the definition doesn‚Äôt apply. On the other hand you could apply apartheid state to Palestine as it actually does fit the definition of what apartheid is"

"Names come in all types and players go by all kinds of permutations, people will call him Enes Kanter Freedom if that's what he goes by. Guess what Steph Curry's middle name is..."
"No, I don't. Enes is making Kanter his middle name. Karl-Athony is KAT's first name.  The point doesn't make sense at all. Noone will call him Enes Kanter Freedom, especially not commentators."
Enes Kanter Freedom*
"Dude he‚Äôs a hack. Position yourself against China and every politician will fuck with you, also you‚Äôre a figurehead against Turkey, politicians like that.   Enes kanter isn‚Äôt doing anything new but I‚Äôm sick of this fuck China shit. All it‚Äôs done is given Americans more ways to be racist towards Asian people."

The Enes Kanter Freedom arc this season has been incredible
"Google is free. Like are you that fucking stupid that you can‚Äôt google something yourself? Like it‚Äôs not hidden on the 4th page or anything. It‚Äôs very easy to find.  Also what does Israel have to do with this? Well Israel is currently one of the biggest human rights abusers in the world, yet Kanter actively supports them. Now in a vacuum... whatever, you‚Äôre right in that it wouldn‚Äôt be super relevant for this. However it becomes relevant when Kanter has built his platform on criticizing other NBAers for being active in BLM but nothing else.  In other words, Kanter does the exact same thing that he criticizes LeBron for.   Serious question here: do you have access to google? You don‚Äôt even need to type it in, just copy and paste ‚ÄúEnes Kanter Israel‚Äù into the search bar and press search.  Like this is a literal tweet by him verbatim:   Had a great conversation with my good friend @OfirKatzMK about #HumanRights and Justice.  Thank you for your friendship &amp; support.  Israel üáÆüá± üôè"
"An event about Enes Kanter flexing his supposed moral high ground when he only felt he has the moral high ground due to criticizing LeBron‚Äôs activism doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with LeBron?  ‚ÄúDude, stop talking about the Aztecs, what do they have to do with Columbus Day at all?‚Äù"
Literally just type into google: Enes Kanter Israel  Like you‚Äôre being intentionally stupid
"Yes, the CIA needs to use Enes Kanter, NBA benchwarmer with a lot of Turkish baggage, to escalate tensions with China. Couldn't figure out any other way to do that.  Maybe all you CIA posters are actually the plants. Make it a 'boy who cried wolf' situation when the real whistleblowers try to release CIA information. Or to make them sound incompetent so people don't take them seriously"
Enes Kanter is not black. He should not be talking about black issues or the black community. It's none of his business.
"[For those curious, he said Jordan has done nothing for the black community.](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/582681-enes-kanter-michael-jordan-has-done-nothing-for-black-community) We all know that‚Äôs false since MJ‚Äôs donated millions to charity. I don‚Äôt know where Kanter got that idea from."
When Enes Kanter gets super jacked and becomes President Freedom we will have come full circle into the Idiocracy time line
It‚Äôs not so much that they need Enes Kanter as it is they get unlimited money that they spend in such ridiculous ways to shape public perception to manufacture consent to escalate tensions.
Kanter is on Team F now Enes Freedom
Good thing I‚Äôm not Enes Kanter
"&gt; Well it took Carmelo turning back the clock, 45% on 21 made 3s and a last second foul  Oh that's what it took?  Quiet on us missing our 2nd best player, our third best player, our backup center, and playing Enes Kanter and Harry Giles?"
"Let's fucking go.  No CJ, no Nurkic, no Collins, starting Enes Kanter and Harry Giles against the #1 seed East and go 2-0.  Wild"
Enes kanter touches every single loose ball. Literally every one
I am soooo tired of watching people freak over their center as they destroy Enes Kanter Harry Giles and Robert Covington.  God I just want Nurkic and Collins back
Embiid is good. But embiid is getting guarded by enes kanter and now robert covington. relax
Enes Kanter looking like the Turkish government finally got him
"I agree, he has all the skills and tools to be one of the most dominant post presences, yet he plays less aggressive than Enes Kanter"
Enes Kanter
&gt;Enes Kanter has been our 2nd best player for the majority of the season  Lillard has been the Blazers 2nd best player for the majority of the season (the 13 games CJ played before getting hurt).
"You guys are delusional.  Enes Kanter has been our 2nd best player for the majority of the season, the numbers say the Warriors are WAY WAY better without Curry than the Blazers are without Dame, yet somehow Curry has a ""much worse team"".    Clueless"
"So at worst they've been dealing with similar missed time problems, but one guy is 13-10 and one guy is 11-14.    &gt; CJ and Nurkic each played 13 games so there isn't much difference in time missed.  Nurkic played 12, and Zach Collins literally hasn't played and plays the same spot.  So our center rotation is Enes Kanter and Harry Giles.    &gt; on-off numbers don't tell you much, because you don't know who else is sitting in that time, if they are playing their entire bench line-up or like to stagger. If their bench unit is better than the opposing bench unit etc.  They tell you a lot.  Our 2nd best player has been either Enes Kanter or Gary Trent Jr for the majority of the season.  We have to play carmelo anthony next to Enes Kanter for significant portions of every game."
Enes Kanter: EFG% .596  Andre Drummond: EFG% .481
"Enes Kanter: 11.2 PPG, good for 120th in the league in scoring. Andre drummond: 18.5 PPG, 43rd in the league in scoring"
Enes Kanter moves like he has one vertebrae.
"We‚Äôve literally played the majority of our season with our 2nd and 3rd best players missing. Not to mention Zach Collins gone for the season, and dame roco djj nassir hood and anfernee all missing games.   Our second best player has been enes Kanter"
we have the same record and have been missing our 2nd and 3rd best players(plus a lot more) the majority of the season. Our second best player has been enes Kanter
Ours for the last 10 games of the season has been EASILY bigger. Our second best player is either enes Kanter or Gary Trent jr. But we also had CJ 12 games

"I mean it can also have a lot of truth. For all the guys you listed there were also guys like Monta Ellis, Andrea Bargnani, Antoine Walker. In the current era you would point to guys like Hassan Whiteside, Enes Kanter, Jabari Parker. The reason we forget about them is that teams eventually see how little they impact winning and they wash out of the league."
"Nah, that‚Äôs no excuse because everybody knew Hayes was 2-3 years away minimum body and experience wise alone. Zion is a 4 and he still basically chose Jahlil Okafor over him if you wanna put it like that and that‚Äôs just inexcusable. Jahlil Okafor is a worse version of Enes Kanter and we all know how Kanter is seen in this league. At the least he coulda traded a guard to free up a spot cuz lord knows we had so many of them last year"
"Okafor busting is on his mentality and maturity, not on the league meta.   Enes Kanter is still a credible player in the same NBA that Okafor can't get a minute in. They're similar guys - neither is much of a defender or floor-spacer, and both are best suited to 30 years ago.  But Kanter is willing to work hard on the glass and get his offense off putbacks and dump-offs, rather than demanding a bunch of post-ups while being a lackadaisical rebounder."
Westbrook is a great teammate.    Enes Kanter too.
"Athleticism is not one of Toppin's main weaknesses lol.  His main weakness was specifically being able to translate it to defense, not athleticism as a whole.  It's the difference between him being an Enes Kanter or an Amare, but that's still better than a dude who looks like he doesn't belong in the league."
He cannot defend Steven Adams or Enes Kanter but he can shut down the pick n roll fine   https://section215.com/2019/02/23/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-center/
Fricking Enes Kanter still can't defend shit.
"Enes Kanter doesn't dunk on fools! Yes, I watched your clips. That's a very rare occurence."
Yeah but Enes Kanter would have gotten the Bucks into the Finals since he can do more than one thing on a basketball court
he's on the waiver wire and is basically the antithesis of Enes Kanter. I am ready to die on Thon Maker hill.
I watch plenty of Enes Kanter lol. He made Clint Capela look like Wilt Chamberlain yesterday.
It doesn't care about defense. In that way it closely resembles Enes Kanter.
"Last year the best ones were Marvin Williams, Reggie Jackson, Markieff Morris, Jeff Green, and MKG. 2019 was the best I can remember in recent years, Wes Matthews, Wayne Ellington, Enes Kanter, Jeremy Lin, Carmelo.  Realistic ones I can think of this year are Robin Lopez again and maybe Aron Baynes? If the Raptors continue to struggle"
everyone knows the one true benchmark for a coach is being able to get starter production out of enes kanter
"Because Boston is trying to contend for a finals spot and Portland is just trying to tread water while their key players are injured.   Our standards are higher.  Boston was top 4 in both offence and defence last season. Kanter isn't good enough to play a big role at that level. We were often better without him.  &gt;Enes Kanter has regularly been at least a passable presence on the court  Enes Kanter defensive ratings:  * 2020-21 (Portland) - 111.7  * 2019-20 (Boston) - 103.9  * 2018-19 (Portland) - 109.4   The reason he played fewer minutes for us is because Brad was specifically keeping him in situations where he wouldn't be exposed defensively, which is a big part of his coaching style, he puts guys in a position to succeed.   Kanter is a good post defender and he's decent when he doesn't have to worry about guards who can shoot off the dribble. So that's how we used him."
"Enes played during season for us lol. Once Portland reaches the playoffs, kanter will almost certainly be getting dnp too. What a flawed argument ."
"He's a below average defender, but we do hide his problems decently  After all, we did start Enes ""Kant play"" Kanter in our run to the WCF"
That‚Äôs what happens when Enes Kanter blocks your shot.
I believe in Enes Kanter.
"""I got five blocks?"" - Enes Kanter"
So I guess my Enes Kanter fantasy pickup from earlier this week is about to pay dividends?

"Lamelo Ball is listed at 6 foot 8. Chris Boucher is listed at 6 foot 9.  His last game against Portland. He had 3 blocks. One on Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Jones Jr. none of whom are 5"" shorter.  The last block he had on anyone more than 5"" shorter than him was his last block in Golden State on Steph Curry."
You have to also think about what role he‚Äôs willing to take. Obviously he‚Äôs better than Powell but Powell is willing to only play 15-20 minutes a game and not get any post ups. If Drummond wants to be able to create and post up he‚Äôll almost exclusively be a bench guy ala Robert Williams or Enes Kanter
he has enes kanter and montrezl harrell type of flaws which means very little trade value for his offensive production
"Nah it's me it was weirdly phrased I guess.  I really think he was too heavy since his injuries in NY, like in the OKC series against Utah I'm sure he was playing as hard as he could, he just looked slow as hell, now he's pretty much average moving his feet for a 4. He's not a good defender but he's not a target for every star in the league in PNR anymore (also since he plays a lot with kanter teams may chose to attack Enes instead lol)"
This is kind of crazy but watching Ayton made me appreciate people like Enes Kanter more...
"Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Enes Kanter.  That's half their rotation that are limited to seriously awful defenders.  Hard to get stops with those guys at the point of attack &amp; guarding the rim."
I've always thought that about Enes Kanter too

Idk Enes Kanter averaging a double double off the bench and Portland is right in the thick of it all so he my pick for 6MOTY   MIP I gotta say Christian Wood if he keep it up bc I‚Äôve seen that kid make shots so far that i never expected n he putting up good numbers but I do believe Julius Randle is another contender if he too continues his stellar play as of late  MVP is tough but im leaning towards JOKIC . . . he got most triple doubles already and clearly best passing big man in the game...idk i just love big honey so much and he seem to be playing elite ball so i think he got a shot...  DPOY Andre Drummond perhaps? and I hope Myles Turner makes all defense team
"He is hard to find a comp for me. He has really good defense and is up there with Bam and some others as best perimeter defending big man which is crazy because he is 7'0"". His rebounding is great. I have yet to find any centers that are as bad as he is was at getting to the line. His ball handling isn't good as well. I think he is going to be like that Enes Kanter and Derrick Favors hybrid that Jazz fans wished they had early in both of their careers before they had Rudy Gobert. Enes Kanter on offense and Favors on defense."
This is the point I‚Äôm making... if bill Russell played now he‚Äôd be worse than enes kanter. He‚Äôs a certified grandpa
I thought Enes Kanter would be the next Karl Malone.
Worked against enes kanter too. Man‚Äôs a beast
"Enes ""D-Zero from Day Zero"" Kanter."
Enes Kanter SUCKS.  This guy is so overrated it‚Äôs not even funny. Not that people even rate him to begin with. The fact that he‚Äôs still in the NBA amazes me.
"Enes Kanter, Andre Drummond too."
why the fuck did i read Steve Kerr as Enes Kanter
"After having Enes Kanter, I think that kind of desire is normal."
lmaoo draymond for enes kanter straight up
"As much as I like Knicks legends Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter, having them on the court together is just begging the other team to run absolutely wild on your team's defense."
"Nope, he's a current day NBA big man  His favorite player is probably a throwback type like Enes Kanter or some shit"
"He was good before the hip injury I believe it was. I don‚Äôt think that he sucks or anything, but he‚Äôs clearly more fit for an Enes Kanter off the bench role. He‚Äôs not someone who can replace Marc Gasol‚Äôs impact, especially on defense."
"Nope, we're not gonna be doing this revisionism.  ESPN's 2020-2021 preseason player rankings had Draymond Green at 44th and no other non-Curry Warrior in the top 100.  ESPN's 2016-2017 preseason player rankings had Steven Adams at 36th, Victor Oladipo at 48th, and Enes Kanter at 80th."
Steven Adams and Enes Kanter
Randle‚Äòs and Knox‚Äòs defense has improved tremendously under Thibs. Knox still does boneheaded mistakes but last year he didn‚Äôt look like an NBA player at all. And Randle looked like a spinning Enes Kanter at times. Now he locks down Sabonis

Kanter had a great game. The problem with him has always been he gives up more than he puts in. Paschall‚Äôs eyes light up when he sees Enes guarding him.
Enes Kanter probably has PTSD of this guy by now
Also good ole Enes Kanter
It is impossible to overstate just how fucking bad enes kanter has gotten abused tonight
Bad defenders can stay on the floor. Enes Kanter is a runway.
Because of Giannis. He‚Äôd be basically Enes Kanter on D if not for Giannis
The anti-Enes Kanter
Garza = Enes Kanter
"If he can keep his defense but become Enes Kanter on offense and rebounding I will be happy with that, and that will be a really good player. He doesn't have to be Jokic passing and Giannias ball handling."
"Enes Kanter, Jusuf Nurkic and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson."
I know people are in love with him so they don't want to admit how much of a negative defender he is so I'll gobble those downvotes for truth. When only Enes Kanter is worse in the paint you have a problem.
"When Enes Kanter is on defense, anything is possible"
To look at? Enes Kanter ü§§
Enes Kanter now but if he played like 15-30 years ago he'd be nice. Greatly skilled offensively and ok at defending in the post. He can be unplayable in the current NBA at times because of his defense but back in the day he would be a beast
"When we talk about defence, most people pretend like defence can be summed up in one number or score.   *eg. A level 87 defender is better than a level 74 defender.*   When you're talking about defending Embiid, you have to understand what kind of player he is.    He is very big, very crafty and very talented and it's in that order:  1. Big 2. Crafty 3. Talented   He likes to bully and overpower you more than he likes to out-skill you. If he can't bully you, he tries to get the foul on you. If he can't get the foul he goes to his back of tricks to score on you (step backs, dream shakes, skyhooks, etc. he can do it all).  So when you want to defend him, the first thing you need is a guy who is big enough to match Embiid and hold their ground. You have to take away Embiid's 1st scoring option otherwise he'll eat you alive.  This is why a bad defender like Enes Kanter is better at defending Embiid than a good defender like Myles Turner. Turner doesn't have the size to stop Embiid's first scoring option. Kanter can at least hold his ground physically.  Now look at Brook Lopez.   1. He's big enough to hold his ground.   2. He's experienced enough to defend without fouling.   So against Lopez, Embiid can't use his 1st or 2nd option. He has to use his 3rd option, which harder and less reliable to pull off.   He's still a threat, but he's less of a threat.   After that, one of the only offensive weaknesses Embiid has is that he panics a little bit when you blitz him. Help defence can be pretty effective against him.  The Bucks have Giannis, as others have said, he's is one of the best help defenders in the NBA. The Bucks also love to clog the paint.   So they're in a good position to attack Embiid and stop him from going to work."
"Here‚Äôs my train of thought; if he‚Äôs so slow already, imagine when he becomes even slower in 10 years. If he becomes as immobile as someone like Enes Kanter (he‚Äôs close enough already), and his offensive output is outweighed by it, he‚Äôll get played off the floor.  Currently Jokic is so effective because his offensive output far, far, far outweighs his defense. But what about when both get worse in a few years?"
Enes Kanter is up there
"if centers were relegated to purely defenders Enes Kanter, KAT, Sabonis, any center who's only value was offense, would be out of the league lol"
Credit to Snyder who saw this coming when he traded Enes Kanter to make room for Gobert. Great move
"Nope, nope, nope. Kanter tries hard and is very good at some things Nurk struggles with (motor, scoring around the rim, avoiding turnovers), but Nurkic is *the* key to Portland's hopes of even having an average defense. His defensive value is superior to everything Kanter has going for him--and I like Enes the Menace!"
"People need to compare his MVP season to Steph's this season. Both played at an MVP level, but one got his team to a 47-35 record. The other is struggling to keep his team at 500. For reference, the top 5 scorers on that team were Westbrook, fat Oladipo, Stephen Adams, Enes Kanter, and Andre Roberson. That season was insane."
"Correction, im hearing its Enes Kanter over Serge Ibaka."
"It is very easy to score on that dumpster fire of a bench unit with Enes Kanter Carmelo Anthony and Anfernee Simons. Like, comedically easy layup lines. The starting lineup of Dame Cj Norm Roco Nurkic is shockingly 19th in defensive rating but that bench unit has the two worst frontcourt defenders in the league"
"What do you mean? Are you not intimidated by the wall of defense that is Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony and the corpse of Zach Collins?"
Enes Kanter is actually stateless
It's like he's copying Enes Kanter holy shit
Enes Kanter was born in Switzerland and grew up in the European part of Turkey on the border with Greece and and Bulgaria.
Enes Kanter is literally a pylon
"&gt; No serious playoff team is giving heavy minutes to Enes Kanter, Melo and Anfernee Simons.   Hey it's like my team!"
"[I found this site that shows jump ball stats](https://www.otherbasketballstats.com/pages/jumpball/jumpball) and it's super interesting.  Out of players with 40+ attempts Andre Drummond has the best win% (.82) while Vucevic has the worst (.25).  What's also a little interesting is that the leaders for rebound% in the league are average-to-very-poor at winning jump balls:  Clint Capela - 1st in rebound %, wins .47 of jump balls  Enes Kanter - 2nd in rebound %, wins .28 of jump balls  Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - 3rd in rebound %, wins .46 of jump balls"
"Yup, our roster has so many flaws. No serious playoff team is giving heavy minutes to Enes Kanter, Melo and Anfernee Simons. Our starting 5 when everyone is healthy is mostly fine, our bench might be one of the 5 worst in the entire league"
"I've looked into this too.  At one point this season, Brook Lopez was 32-14.  Enes Kanter was 7-25.  That's as far as I got lol."
You could maybe throw Enes Kanter in their as well
"There are so many to choose from, but I'll go with Enes Kanter (drafted 3rd in 2011)."
"You continue to ignore the fact that he plays the most important defensive position, and is very bad at the the most valuable defensive skill. Jokic has second worst Dfg% on shots at the rim of any center with over 300 shots against this season. Only Enes Kanter is worse.  Edit: [source](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)"
"If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôll have to see the whole breakdown of their methodology and how they track defense accurately, because context is naturally missing in these situations.   I saw a tracking stat that showed (at the time) that Jokic the 2nd highest percentage of makes at the rim (tied with Enes Kanter) in the league at his position... but I‚Äôm not gonna condemn Joker as a terrible defender based on that... watching the games will help us understand his defense   Also, they were targeting Rudy in the P&amp;R at times, and that‚Äôs why I hold the position that Rudy is not versatile enough to be the best defender in the league, but to be fair Gobert was ordered to play drop coverage as he can be closer to the rim  Regardless, there are things Gobert does that make him a top tier defender and Jokic an average one at best, and that can be found in the tape."
wow Jokic is really fucking bad at defense lol. Second worst player in the league at defending the rim only slightly behind Enes Kanter....yikes...and it's not like he's better in the DFG% metric either...he's right there up at the top for worst defenders in the league...
Until it doesn‚Äôt and somehow all our 6‚Äô6‚Äù players or shorter somehow find themselves in the restricted area trying to box out Enes Kanter ü•¥
Sorrry but the lakers will be swept by the blazers in the finals. Enes kanter will average 40 ppg 80 rpg 20 apg. Then Enes Kanter and the blazers will sweep the pistons in the finals
About even. Draymond and Wiggins are better than Steven adams and Oladipo by a significant margin. But some of the bench guys like Enes Kanter and Jerami Grant were better than the warriors bench guys.
"I would respond to your entire comment, but your last line insinuates that Enes Kanter brings some defensive impact and that he‚Äôs a difference maker on the defensive end. For that reason I‚Äôm out. Have a good day sir."
"I used to think Enes kanter was the best scorer in the nba. Doesn't matter which team has the ball Enes is going to help them score baskets, but Sabonis might take the crown with this move."
Enes Kanter  Ense Kanter  Enes Kanter  Enes Kanter  Enes Kanter  Coach: Enes Kanter  Sorry but Enes Kanter wins this game by 80
"Reminder that Enes Kanter called Zion ""Julius Randle with hops"" in the pre draft process."
"Danny had way too many draft picks to use and didn't find a trade he liked so ended up using all of them. Every year we seem to replace productivr established talent with rookie contracts. It all came to a head this year where we lost Gordon Hayward, Brad Wanamaker, and Enes Kanter with Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. This season was always going to be hard with so much of the roster being made up of rookie contracts.    Look at all the other high seeds above above Boston and you see teams that added veterans. Milwaukee went out and got Holiday, Philly got Curry, Green and Dwight, Brooklyn sold the farm for Harden and filled out the roster with cheap veterans like Jeff Green.  The young players needed to get on the court and either show they're NBA level players or not so Ainge can finally make a decision on some of these guys. Pritchard broke out early and Timelord came on strong late."
I would still take Enes Kanter over him.
What about Enes Kanter?
Enes Kanter was on his fucking toes and still made Kanter look like an average guy.
"PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - Marcus Smart  SF - Doug McDermott   PF - Thaddeus Young  C - Enes Kanter    There's no one on the team that can take over and be the main scorer on a night-to-night basis, neither Rubio or Smart are so deadly or consistent from 3 that I think opposing teams would be content with letting them both shoot the amount it'd take for them to create positive offense, McDermott and Young are both role players that'll give you 10-15ish points a game, and Kanter even if he has a god game like he did recently, could still be abused defensively."
"When Nurkic and McCollum were out, Lillard put the Blazers on his back. His next 2 best players were GTJ and Enes Kanter. Russ is playing with the scoring leader."

Enes Kanter
Do they have a game against the blazers coming up? He can smoke Kanter show Him He‚Äôs Enes Kanter with Skills
They were still way more talented then portland lol.. they had enes fucking kanter on one arm at center. I didn‚Äôt prove myself wrong.. I proved you wrong
Don't matter who guards Steph when it's enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard as the bigs
Yeah....but then it has enes kanter ahead of jaylen brown.....
18-19 he was good as well but got injured and was never the same. He got outplayed by an injured Enes Kanter
Basically u want Enes Kanter or do u want Myles Turner
Who‚Äôs the better scorer:  Enes Kanter or Lou Williams?
Myles Turner and Enes Kanter
"No shit. Its almost like I said that Kuzma isn‚Äôt anywhere near as good.  You‚Äôre missing the point. Efficiency stats are not a good indication of how good a role player is. According to them Enes Kanter is an absolute monster, when in reality he‚Äôs a net-neutral player because of his horrendous defense. Kuzma‚Äôs efficiency stats are basically the same last 3yrs but anyone whose watched him can see he‚Äôs much more of a contributor. Overall he is playing far better defense, proving crucial rebounding when most of the primary rebounders are injured and even when the team was healthy, setting screens, and playing within the system instead of yoloing away plays."
Enes kanter and Hedo T√ºrkoƒülu
Enes Kanter should be up there. He is more efficient and has a higher TS% than Lebron.   He‚Äôs the goat scorer of this era!
"All triple doubles are nowadays is guards gobbling up uncontested rebounds and base 10 convincing people that it matters a bunch.  The assists are really impressive, the individual rebounds mean jack shit.    Derrick Favors gathers more contested rebounds a game than Russ.  He averages [5.5 rebounds a game, compared to Westbrook's 10.8](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&amp;dir=1).  THAT is how much bullshit individual rebounding numbers are. Which player do you think impacts rebounding more when he's on the floor? Russ almost averages as many rebounds as Enes Kanter lmao    Same deal with Luka to a less extent.  He's 32nd in rebounding.  He's 96th in contested rebounds.   Individual rebound numbers are not remotely close to representative of who actually makes a difference in their teams rebounding."
Former 24/7 Champ Enes Kanter has entered the chat.
"Better: Chris Paul  Worse: Enes Kanter  CP3 doesn‚Äôt have bad stats, but they don‚Äôt account for his leadership, communication on defense, and accountability. He‚Äôs the guy you want on your team if you already have someone who can get buckets.  Kanter is great at what he does, but he‚Äôs a huge defensive liability. He‚Äôs a good fit for a team like Portland who‚Äôs going all in on offense, but most teams wouldn‚Äôt benefit from playing him big minutes. Without any sort of rim protection, you compromise the entire defense and give up open looks from all over the floor because guards and wings have to overcommit on drives."
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..  With the Olympic games itself I think that team can legitimately get a medal.."

"Terry Stotts has no idea how to play defense, but he damn well knows how to get the best out of Enes Kanter"
"Blazers baffle me.  They KNEW they had major problems on defense after last season, and they decide to puck up Enes Kanter?  Covington's an ok pickup but that's just wing D."
Everyone knows the worst defensive player in the league is Enes Kanter
How could Perk call Nurkic the worst defender in the league when Enes Kanter is in this series?
At least Enes Kanter can rebound. He's bad but I don't think he's the worst.
The disrespect to Enes Kanter by giving Bertans his title.
Enes Kanter is so so much worse
Enes Kanter is terrible as well. Out of the rotation because Jokic is sonning him.
Enes Kanter would like a word
"I can barely remember who is on your bench. Melo, Rondae-Hollis-Jefferson, and Enes Kanter seem pretty weak for a bench."
"Allow me to introduce you to Enes Kanter, who is a beast on the offensive boards but is so overmatched against MVP Jokic.  Great coaching adjustment by Stotts to bench him, which couldn‚Äôt have been an easy decision."
People that don't watch our games don't realize how ass Terry Stotts and Enes Kanter are though.
"Damn imagine being that stupid^   How the hell did dame, CJ, aminu, and mo harkless not win more games against Steph curry, klay Thompson, and draymond green!!   Our center rotation was literally enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard   Not to mention dame separated his ribs game 2 of that series"
so this is the power of not playing enes kanter
"I get you don‚Äôt want to play Enes, but Rondae getting cooked. Maybe play some Kanter when Joker is out."
take notes Enes Kanter
Biggest pet peeve is any minute Enes Kanter is on the court
Or it‚Äôs a flawed roster built by a terrible GM. You can‚Äôt do anything when Enes Kanter is your starting center for most of the year and you also have two starting guards who are not good defensively   We‚Äôre always going to have at least 3 bad defenders on the court at all times because of the way the roster has been constructed
"It's really true--when your guards are Dame and CJ, you're doomed without a superior defensive center, and Nurkic is one. Enes Kanter, on the other hand, for all his many merits (I love the guy fr), is the opposite of that."
Blake Griffin looking like Enes Kanter out there on D
Thread moving so fast nobody will see that I'm strongly considering making the first ever jersey I buy be an Enes Kanter one
"His lack of adjustments usually are the thing we have a problem with.  Many times, he sticks with the ""usual"" and doesn't try new things when that's clearly not working or a bad fit.  For instance, playing Enes Kanter minutes when Jokic is on the floor, or keeping Jones Jr, RHJ and Nassir Little glued to the bench when they'd do better at defending Denver's squad than undersized Norman Powell or CJ.   Especially if we're just going to be hero ball on offense where one player basically isos all game, whether it's dame, cj, melo, whoever - it won't matter whether some of these dudes can space the floor or not, if we won't pass to them anyway."
"Well they've gotten the best record on the league at least once, and they've gotten him two MVPs, and they're set up nicely to sweep the team they knocked them out last year, so all things considered I think the Bucks are on much sturdier footing than a middling team that relies on 75 year old Melo, an oft injured Nurcic, and freaking Enes Kanter..."
"I love Kanter, and what he can do offensively is amazing, but this matchup is horrible for him. he's trying really hard but he can't stop Jokic. Have RHJ come in when Nurk gets subbed out. but obviously, we all know Stotts is too stubborn to make a change.  ""Enes is our backup center, so we just have to play better."""
Bruh Enes Kanter was -15 in 5 minutes
"I mean, yeah, but we also suffered through Enes Kanter himself, lol.    Dark times, those."
"Nerlens by far. Even tho I'm probably sure that in a match up between the two Kanter would kill him.  But Nerlens is a great defensive center who can help a defense be great, and a terrible offensive center. Even on those process Sixers teams, the defense were pretty decent when he was on the floor at the 5 (not at the 4 with Okafor). Enes is a good offensive center, but we've already seen him be on terrible offensive teams/line ups, and like I hate it because he clearly tries pretty hard defensively, but it's just straight up impossible to be a good defense with him at center"
Enes Kanter.
Teams need to stop paying Enes Kanter to stink up the post season
Now Enes Kanter comes in....
I agree. Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony are such negatives as defenders and even sometimes on offense it's not even funny
The nuggets bench literally has a better +/- than the starters because of how shit Enes Kanter is at basketball lol
26-14 to 26-34  Enes Kanter üî•üî•üî•
Yep... they don‚Äôt care when it‚Äôs enes kanter but when it‚Äôs a black man that somehow makes it different
"Yeah, as much as CJ and Dame can smoke the Nuggets...the Nuggets have motherfucking NIKOLA JOKIC BEING DEFENDED BY ENES GODDAMN KANTER."
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
James Harden. Jazz fans were out here at the beginning of the season saying we wouldn't want Harden to come to the jazz because it would mess up our chemistry lmao  Ben Simmons bc he has had beef with both Rudy and Donovan.  Enes Kanter. We just didn't get along with him.
"To be fair, it's not hard to score on the worst defender in the league in Enes Kanter"
"Enes Kanter would never be on a team that gave up 71 points, yet Kawhi is the two-way player?"
"Don't disrespect Enes ""has basketball skills"" Kanter"
I love Jokic but this is a huge overreaction. You're talking this stuff after a game he played against Nurkic and Enes Kanter...
"my friend saw Enes Kanter yesterday walking down 19th street, rolled down my - passenger side - window and yelled ""FUCK ERDOGAN"". I saw Kanter look back, but I was just as confused as he was, my friend was smug and laughing about it though. I think it fucked with Kanter, in a reverse psychology way."
He's scoring on Enes Kanter who's worse than trash on defense lmao that doesn't mean anything
The thing about Enes Kanter is every team likes the IDEA of having him on your team until he actually starts playing for you
Why does Enes Kanter sound like Tony Montana?
"Giannis has almost always been good at keeping his cool when somebody does something to him. Unless you‚Äôre Mo Wagner or Enes Kanter, he usually just takes a few deep breaths and then heads to the line."
Enes Kanter got a MLE after his play with the Blazers on our WCF run after getting bought out.
Wasn't Enes Kanter also dealing with an injury?
Portland was starting Enes Kanter and Al-Farouq Aminu lol
Ik he‚Äôs not in rn but Drummond is a glorified Enes kanter
You guys have a bottom 5 defence without nurk and the second he came back the defence got good again. Gg  Think you guys finished top 5 in D for the span of games since nurk came back.  Jokic would have these battles with kanter and just destroy him. Bring back Enes for 30 mpg!!
"Thanks for taking the bait! You're correct that Portland had a trash defense this year...with \*noted terrible defender\* Enes Kanter as the starting rim protector and Nurkic injured. Since Nurk's returned, Portland has been top-14. And that, friend, is evidence that rim protection &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perimeter contain from the guards."
"The difference between Nurkic being on and off the court was night and day. The second Enes Kanter subbed in for him, jokic looked like a completely different player and picked at him every chance he got.  Not to mention, Nurkic can certainly be a demoralizing player from an offense standpoint, I can't imagine how frustrating it is for the Nuggs to see Nurk capitalize off of so many second chance points. Jokic is a fairly unfazed player but I'm sure those kinds of buckets can definitely get to his head, especially when those buckets are the difference between it being a close game"
"Oh he's a much, much better defensive player than Kanter, and I love me some Enes Kanter."
"You'd just have to watch Enes Kanter try to play defense for 4 minutes in the 4th to see how much of a difference it makes having Nurk back. Enes tried his best, bless his heart, but he just gave up bucket after bucket"
Enes Kanter is the worst player I‚Äôve ever seen.
Nikola Jokic Vs Enes Kanter boxing match. Who wins
Suns don‚Äôt get enough criticism for drafting Bahamian enes kanter over a generational talent
"there‚Äôs Enes Kanter, Andre Drummond rebounds, and there‚Äôs whatever the Hell that was"
Enes Kanter
"I just want to make a trade that ends up with us getting a top 3 pick. We've had a top three pick twice in franchise history. We got Dominique Wilkins, who refused to play for us and forced a trade, and Enes Fucking Kanter  We won the lottery once, though. Pretty big year, class of '79. There was a guy everyone was hyping up named Irving. His nickname was pretty cool though. Shame the League took our pick away and gave it to the Lakers that year."
"Kinda impossible to be ‚Äòrandom‚Äô and have that type of impact in the playoffs but I get what you mean‚Ä¶  **Seth Curry**- can‚Äôt be understated enough how much of a non-scorer Simmons is. All it takes is a smart coach and the right defender and he‚Äôs practically Draymond green. So, Curry will be that 3rd scorer and I can see him having a 20-25 point timely game   **Joe Harris**- Jump shots will stop falling for 2 of the big 3, and Harris will get open looks and have a 20 point game. Media will jump all over it  for the unsung hero angle   **Mikal Bridges**- he‚Äôs not even really random but since it‚Äôs vs LA the masses and media will be shocked at anyone other than the big names playing big. Bridges will have at least 1 game where he‚Äôs hitting open 3s all game   **Enes Kanter** - Kanter always gets buckets, he‚Äôs gonna have that 1 game where he gets enough minutes and shots to score around 20. Denver may be a perfect matchup for him since they will almost always have a traditional 5 in so Kanter can stay on the court"
Maybe the most overrated player in the league. Enes Kanter that can pass.  95% of teams would pass on him as a starter if they have championship aspirations
"Enes Kanter with an all star appearance  But honestly, a post up pf who can't shoot or defend. His destiny is a 6th man, not someone you build around."
Taking [a shot](https://twitter.com/adamcward/status/1124519027710222336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1124519027710222336%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flarrybrownsports.com%2Fbasketball%2Fnikola-jokic-cheap-shot-enes-kanter-injured-shoulder%2F494354) at a player's injured shoulder = a dirty ass player.
"Playing Enes Kanter in drop coverage, and either not double-teaming Steph, or giving up an easy 2 off a cutter was all four of those games. We blew it. That's not all on Dame though."
"I don't remember any incidents from Blazers fans from 2019 like I do for Denver [fans](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/05/02/enes-kanter-nuggets-fans-turkey-criticizes-hurtful-denver-recep-tayyip-erdogan-trail-blazers/) and [commentators](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-jusuf-nurkic-blazers-nuggets-radio-021533406.html). However, if there were, please enlighten me -- I know we get into our little walled gardens and might not see them, or they might just get downvoted to oblivion in our own subs.  (I don't really count Reddit interactions in this because Reddit is just toxic all around on both sides.)"
"I hear that. But when you have comments like [this](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/05/02/enes-kanter-nuggets-fans-turkey-criticizes-hurtful-denver-recep-tayyip-erdogan-trail-blazers/) and [this](https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-jusuf-nurkic-blazers-nuggets-radio-021533406.html) from 2019 when we have those same two guys on the squad, it's a little hard to just let bygones be bygones this time around.  That said, I don't think the teams themselves have animosity between each other like that, so that's good."
"Let me just go down the roster. There's a lot of unknowns.   Dame - definitely staying  CJ - if we make it out of the first round, I'd say he's definitely staying. If we lose in the first round, who knows. Total wildcard  Norm - another total wildcard. Will he want to stay somewhere he's the 3rd best guard? If he does, how much are we willing to pay a 3rd 6'3 guard who we'll have to play at SF? Repeater tax is an issue as well  RoCo - definitely staying  Nurk - definitely staying  Melo - likely upto him if he wants to play another season. I don't see us not signing him if he wants to come back  DJJ - has a PO for 10mil so he could leave for a bigger role, but idk how much money he'll find. I think he stays  Anfernee Simons - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Enes Kanter - likely gonna re-sign him, but definitely possible that we let him walk  RHJ - unless he gets a better offer from somewhere else, I think we'd keep him on a min  Nassir Little - definitely staying (unless we put him in a package for a big trade)  Harry Giles - probably going somewhere else where he'll either get more than a minimum or will get more mins  Zach Collins - another wildcard. How do you come to a fair contract value with someone who essentially hasn't played in 2 years. Gun to my head, we re-sign him even if it's just the QO  CJ Elleby - staying"
"Hard not to root for this Blazers team. Melo deserves a deep run, and they also got another underappreciated ex-Knick, my man Enes Kanter.   Hope they can get past Denver, this might be their deepest team with Lillard, now that Jurkic is back and cooking."
Enes Kanter: first time?
I need the replay angle where you can see Lebron throw up his arms.  Shades of OKC Enes Kanter
Enes Kanter 6MOY? The worst defensive player in the nba ? Fuck outta here.
Yeah the coaching staff should have made Enes Kanter leave drop coverage for pick and rolls. He‚Äôs so mobile and defensive minded
"Individual rebounding doesn't matter as much as team rebounding. Box outs, hustles for loose balls, rebounding numbers don't track those. Prime example would be Enes Kanter vs Jusuf Nurkic. Nurkic's rebound numbers are a lot less flashy, but the Blazers rebound better when he's on the floor because he boxes out, bats out rebounds to guards, and the blazers get scored on a lot less when not playing the worst defensive center in basketball, leading to more rebound chances"
You lost to Ricky Rubio and enes kanter lmao  And we beat your ass in 17 and 20
Still wild we made the WCF with Enes Kanter as our 3rd best player

Enes Kanter will always have my respect for not letting LeBroke Ankles getting away with trying to bully Frank Ntilikina.
Enes Kanter peaked higher in WS/48 than Ben Wallace and has a higher career average.
No we aren't.  We were atrocious defensive when we were starting Enes Kanter. We've been average over about 30 games since we got Nurk back.

KAT defensive fg% &lt;6 feet: 59.7%  Enes Kanter: 63.1%  Jokic: 63.4%....
Delusional. He is useless on the perimeter and is enes kanter or kat in the paint
You forgot the legend Enes Kanter!!
Wholesome Enes Kanter moment
"Also, Enes Kanter is back in Boston. Brad Stevens is really running things back..."
"What do you mean? We got the GOAT, Enes Kanter!!!  pain"
Enes Kanter is bench scoring
"Hot take: Enes Kanter 40/21/5/10 block season and leads the C‚Äôs to the eastern conference finals, where we find out that Kanter is actually an alien (so they ban him and the C‚Äôs lose of course) and it turns out it was all a promo for Space Jam 3"
"Hassan literally closed out on Enes Kanter in the corner when he was with us, he definitely chases blocks to the detriment of the defense"
As a Spurs fan who's watched plenty of Zalgiris games I'm not that exited about the signing. Yeah he's sick offensively but he was an awful defender and defensive rebounder so I'm afraid he'd get eaten alive in NBA. He's a poor man's Enes Kanter.
"Yeah it was epic. Jokic played 65 out of 68 minutes in the game, which is an NBA record that might never be broken.  CJ was clutch as hell (clutch but not particularly efficient dude scored 41 points on 39 shots LOL), playing 60 minutes, with Dame just behind with 58 minutes. One day before he started fasting for Ramadan, Enes Kanter playing with a separated shoulder toughed out 56 minutes. Meanwhile Murry and Gary Harris played 55 and 50 minutes.  By 4OT, Portland's Moe Harkless cramped up after only playing 45 minutes, forcing Terry Stotts to sub in Rodney Hood who had played a mere 20 minutes in the game. Rodney literally galloped onto the court he was so fresh, and scored 7 points in a row for the Blazers to ice the win."
"Why do you think they are even considered dark horses? It's the playoff Dame factor. His team is CJ McCollum then Enes Kanter.   Again, you're a clown."
"&gt;Umm Kemba Walker, Enes Kanter?  Whoops! Forgot about those star players!   You almost need 2 hands to count  all star games between them."
"Umm Kemba Walker, Enes Kanter? Also the Celtics haven't had the cap space since 2019"
Top remaining centers:    Ed Davis	  Enes Kanter  Frank Kaminsky	  Hassan Whiteside	  Willy Hernangomez	  Isaiah Hartenstein	  DeMarcus Cousins
No he has defensive question marks and a crazy offensive skill set that's why he is compared to Enes Kanter. They literally play very similar and are similar in size.
Doubt it. We prefer not to have Enes Kanter 2.0 on our roster.
But I thought it was bad to trade 2 protected first round picks for Enes Kanter 2.0??

"I saw a bunch of reports that the Kris Dunn trade wasn't happening anymore. It had to be completed before Midnight EST yesterday because it was the end of the NBA calendar year, and the Enes Kanter trade exception that Boston had would have expired with the NBA year.   Can anybody confirm is this happened or if the trade went through? I saw multiple people discussing this on Twitter last night but never seemed to get confirmation if it happened or not."
Enes Kanter about to roast this source
"Enes Kanter was outspoken critic against the Turkish government and his family is politically persecuted. His father is a political opponent of Erdogan‚Äôs and was imprisoned for seven years.  Imagine playing a game knowing your life and family are constantly in jeopardy. That‚Äôs pretty rough.  All respect to that dude, he‚Äôs standing up for human rights."
"Quick list of players drafted with the pick immediately after the Wolves for reference - 2008: Rus Westbrook (Kevin Love),  2009: Stef Curry (Johnny Flynn, Rubio),  2010: Demarcus Cousins (Wes Johnson),  2011: Enes Kanter (Derrick Williams),  2013a: Giannis (Shabazz Muhammad,  2013b: Rudy Gobert (Traded pick),  2014a: Nikola Jokic (Glenn Robinson)"
"So Curry is better than Dame and Wiggins is better (and bigger! ) than CJ, and Dray is better than RoCo, yet the blazers who had both CJ and Nurkic out for extended time and had to play extended minutes with Melo and Enes Kanter instead,  still made the playoffs over the warriors?"
Enes Kanter
"Kanter had a better 3pt % than KD, if anything we should be saying Enes had the worst spacing in the league."
"Of course you conveniently left out Enes Kanter, who shot 47% from 3 for OKC that year."
"Yeah maybe ; btw you Robbed Houston with 2 picks for ≈ûeng√ºn , and one of them is 2022 Detroit pick , really ?   ≈ûeng√ºn had great stats on a really bad team and his production is half against Euroleague teams. His ceiling is Enes Kanter with Okur range , like 13-7 from bench and you can get first pick in 2022 for this , wow"
Westbrook had a playoff career low FG% at the rim against Portland starting an injured Enes Kanter lmao
50 points in his first game  then Enes Kanter Dunks on him and he retires in shame.
So this means I never have to watch Melo and Enes Kanter share the floor together again.
Enes Kanter - Penis Cancer
he's not enes kanter bad but he's pretty bad. he really cannot defend in space at all. the jazz series was awful for him.
"Kriss Dunn, Enes Kanter... They're basically the same player"
enes kanter?
"Someone else explained, dunn fits into the enes kanter tpe. Which means they get a 9 million dollar tpe from trading TT.  Also owners wanna save money, I think they‚Äôre super close to the tax?"
The disrespect to Enes Kanter
"Just off the top of my head, guys who are vets and would ring chase for vet min (regardless of how likely). Lots of guys out there, its just about finding the handful needed to play alongside 3 hall of famers.  danny green  james johnson  reddick  millsap  Tucker  derrick rose  jamychal green  avery bradley  mike scott  enes kanter  javale  dwight  stan johnson"
No 3 pointer? Does he rebound or play D? If not then he's Enes Kanter 2.0.
This guy gave up assets to Enes Kanter he doesn't just hoard picks  The only indefensible trade is obviously the Harden one but it's unclear whether that was from ownership
Garza is way slower than JV. He‚Äôs Enes Kanter 2.0.
Lol Sengun does not have neither the passing ability of Jokic or the post moves of Hakeem get tf out of here. Enes is literally a highly efficient back to the basket scorer who gets played off the court because his mobility and defense is so lacklustre. Sengun is gonna get abused in the P&amp;R but he can generate turnovers so I‚Äôll give him that. Sengun also has almost the exact same frame as Kanter. It‚Äôs not only because they Turkish that‚Äôs for sure.
Wtf he is the complete opposite of Kanter. Enes sucks. Does Enes have playmaking abilities anywhere close to Jokic. Does Wnes have post skills resembling Olajuwon? Is Enes quick enough to guard stretch 4s? Did Enes win MVP in the Turkish League at 18 years old?  Does Enes have any skills on offense or any defensive capabilities anywhere even close to Sengun who is only 18?    Oh yeah they're Turkish tho. Wtf is wrong with you?
Sorry I don‚Äôt want Enes Kanter I want guys who can handle the ball and atleast have a chance at playing defence.
If this was even 10 years ago Garza goes first round. I mean Enes Kanter went fucking 3rd overall.   Times are changing.
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
Next Enes Kanter baby
I don't even need to Google Alperen Sengun because I already know his comps are Enes Kanter and Furkan Korkmaz.
Who‚Äôs the GOAT Turkish player? Enes Kanter? Does it even count if he gets banished from his own country?
New Enes Kanter
We lost our starting center right before the playoffs and started enes Kanter‚Ä¶
"I see Sengun‚Äôs worst case outcome being something like Enes Kanter, and his best case being a play style the NBA hasn‚Äôt seen before. Definitely worth it in the 10-14 range IMO. He definitely has flaws, but people completely overvalue picks on Reddit. If you can get a solid role player or better in the mid/late lottery, you‚Äôve done good."
Him and Enes Kanter sit alone
Nurkic and Enes Kanter gonna be shook too lmao
Penis Cancer (enes Kanter)
He's a little bit like Enes Kanter.
"Alright. Let‚Äôs list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable ‚Äî everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can‚Äôt hunt anyone on iso‚Äôs. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there‚Äôs nothing that this team can‚Äôt do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA‚Äôs defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can‚Äôt run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn‚Äôt have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn‚Äôt be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they‚Äôre only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert‚Äôs defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who‚Äôs a spot up shooter who can‚Äôt really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I‚Äôd say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they‚Äôre only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn‚Äôt to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they‚Äôre not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."
Is Enes Kanter from Iran or somewhere else? Is he going to play?
Ur profile picture looks like enes kanter from a distance
Well Bam happens to be a wee bit better than Enes Kanter
"I was also confused. I was like Enes Kanter to POR in 2016!? Lol no worries though, great post!"
"Who was injured when Lillard sent him home in 5 with Enes ""can't play"" Kanter starting?  His ego? Against the Jazz?   Is there a more delusional fanbase than Westbrook's? Every year he disappoints and every year there's a new excuse.  I remember in the beginning of the season when those same dumbasses claimed the Wizards are ""a dangerous playoff team"". I said they'd be lucky to make the playoffs and had a bunch of angry stans replying. Barely made the playoffs with a 34-38 record, got bounced in 5 by Ben Simmons and co and those guys disappeared."
"I can‚Äôt tell if Enes Kanter is the best or worst sitter in the league, there‚Äôs no middle ground, he‚Äôs either the best or worst."
"that 2019 Thunder team was STACKED  How the hell did they lose to Portland it is SO weird. The Blazers 3rd best player was Enes Kanter lmaoooo  Westbrook/George + Prime Adams, Jerami Grant 3 and D, Schroder 6th man  Makes zero sense.  And now Portland has a MUCH more deep roster in 2021 and they got bounced by Nuggets without Murray when in 2019 they beat them with Murray. Jokic was MVP this year but he was already dominating in 2019 playoffs.  Just weird weird unpredictable stuff"
*Enes Kanter shrugs*
Enes Kanter never signed anything near a max contract.
"Chandler Parsons, Enes Kanter, Otto Porter, and Harrison Barnes are all recent max contracts for players nowhere near superstar level. Granted, not every max is the same but it‚Äôs still the max for that player."
There were definitely some centers in this draft:  1.	Jonas Valanciunas 2.	Tristan Thompson 3.	Enes Kanter 4.	Nikola Vucevic
"The author of the article believes that:  &gt; The emphasis on retaining Powell comes from data that shows the starting lineup of Lillard, McCollum, Powell, Covington and Jusuf Nurkic last season had the NBA‚Äôs fourth-best net rating among starters, behind Brooklyn, the Clippers and Philadelphia.  So they think the starting lineup is fine, but:  &gt; Although Olshey has never publicly admitted it, he knows he failed last season in not recognizing a bench centered around Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter was fatally flawed from a defensive standpoint.   So essentially, they want to keep the starters and rebuild the bench from scratch and hope that's enough."
"*He* didn't lose, his pathetic team did.   &gt; That team around him is underrated  You mean the team that plays Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony, 2 of the worst defensive players in the league, real minutes?   &gt; He hasn‚Äôt got close to the resume and playoff runs those guys you lumped him in with have. Tbh he hasn‚Äôt even had *one iconic run yet.  Not his fault. Are we blaming Luka for not having won a playoff series yet? There's a limit to how much one man can do, basketball is a team game for a reason.   &gt; Tons of players have had games with god-like efficiency and volume. It doesn‚Äôt put you up with the greats.  Dame has been doing what he's been doing for years man, he's gotten better every year. Statistically, he's one of the most clutch players the NBA has ever seen and the only player in the league who is better than him over the last few years, is the guy he lost to this year, Jokic."
[Woj] CIA rumored to give Enes Kanter max contract next season
Enes Kanter is my guy &lt;3
what does he think of children being detained at the border? what does he think of woman being by ice and then being sterilized?    any opinion on police brutality or systemic racism? the Armenian genocide?  Kurds?   is enes kanter going to stand with striking workers all over the US? no? just going to repeat lies about a country he knows nothing about and no one in this thread rant really want to understand
"Props to him. Really, as much as you can shit on American politics, the freedom of speech in the western 1st world countries really is beautiful. And Kanter did something incredibly brave.  Qatar is next Enes, you're a great public figure. And even if he doesn't speak about it, tons of respect for this."
Enes Kanter is a true gangsta. He is about THAT life.
Enes Kanter - DNP (None of your business)
"&gt;Kanter's advocacy is extremely suspicious to me. Considering the way he presents what he's saying and who he associates with (ie. John Bolton and Gulen) I can't take him seriously.  I mean, him meeting with John Bolton is weird, but he's basically just looking for any allies against Erdogan. He's also met with Rubio and other conservatives and while that's weird. There is also this weird thing were it seems like liberals have been less harsh in the criticism of Turkey and China because conservatives have also criticized them too. Idk maybe I'm imagining it. Like conservatives are absolute nut jobs, but countries that jail political dissidents deserve all the criticism they can get.   The Gulen movement is like weird, but doesn't seem nearly as despicable as it is portrayed by a lot of people on this sub any time Kanter comes up. [I compared it to being Mormon like in a different common, which seems accurate to me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qdk97o/enes_kanter_doubles_down_on_china_and_calls_xi_to/hhokmj4?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3)  &gt;To me though, it seems Kanter is being anti-china almost for the sake of it. Has he for example spoken out against whats happening in Palestine or Kashmir (I mention these two is because they are persecutions against muslims majority populations). I know that you can speak out against one atrocity and not another, but Kanter's selection of what to speak on and how he presents it is weird to me  I mean, maybe? He's been mostly critical of Turkey. Why China and why now? Who knows. It's not like he's been silent on everything else.  [Kanter speaking out against Turkish violence against the Kurds. ](https://mobile.twitter.com/eneskanter/status/1277334007143976961?lang=en)  It seems like on Palestine/Israel Kanter is more focused on talking about Muslim/Jewish cooperation.  &gt;Kanter has gone full speed ahead, taking steps to the launch a Holocaust education project for Muslim students, and laying the groundwork for a project of the Enes Kanter Basketball Academy in Israel for Arabs and Jews. On Yom Hashoah, he and Erdan even wrote a joint article together speaking out against online antisemitism and racism and the importance of fighting it together.¬†  &gt;‚ÄúWe are an ambassador and an NBA player. A Jew and a Muslim. A grandson of Holocaust survivors and a person taught to despise Jews... Despite this, we have reached the same conclusion: The way to defeat antisemitism and, by default, all racism, is to join forces in the fight against ignorance and hatred,‚Äù they wrote.  [article](https://m.jpost.com/opinion/enes-kanter-israels-unlikely-nba-ally-opinion-665659)  He was also pretty vocal and attended BLM events.  It's not like his stances haven't cost him. It's not likely he'll ever see his parents again and he's unable to leave the US because there is a chance a country would extradite him to Turkey. His comments about China will likely cost him money and I wouldn't be surprised if this is his last NBA contract. He is a pretty goofy guy, but it's a hard argument to make that its disingenuous and just for clout when he's sacrificed so much."
"Love Enes Kanter for this. He will call out whoever, for just causes."
Enes Kanter put out a video today wearing a free Tibet shirt and calling Xi Jinping a genocidal dictator. So now the Celtics are cancelled in china and the NBA as a whole is probably next.
"I haven't really saw anything about him supporting Israel in a Israel vs. Palestine context. [This article is from earlier this year.](https://m.jpost.com/opinion/enes-kanter-israels-unlikely-nba-ally-opinion-665659)  &gt;This past November he met with Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Gilad Erdan to discuss the importance of bridging gaps in society, and expressed his desire to launch a basketball camp for Arab and Jewish children.¬†  &gt;‚ÄúWhat is important is to build bridges and create dialogue between people. Sport creates closeness between people, no matter what background you come from and that is my goal,‚Äù he said of the meeting.  &gt;Since then, Kanter has gone full speed ahead, taking steps to the launch a Holocaust education project for Muslim students, and laying the groundwork for a project of the Enes Kanter Basketball Academy in Israel for Arabs and Jews. On Yom Hashoah, he and Erdan even wrote a joint article together speaking out against online antisemitism and racism and the importance of fighting it together.¬†  &gt;‚ÄúWe are an ambassador and an NBA player. A Jew and a Muslim. A grandson of Holocaust survivors and a person taught to despise Jews... Despite this, we have reached the same conclusion: The way to defeat antisemitism and, by default, all racism, is to join forces in the fight against ignorance and hatred,‚Äù they wrote.  It seems less like he's pro-israel and more so just sees how strained Muslim and Jewish relations have been and feels like the best thing he can do is promote peace and interfaith dialogue. I'm not pro-israel and I am pro-two state solution, but Kanter seems pretty reasonable and responsible here."
Enes Kanter is by far the best social activist in the NBA. I wouldn't be surprised if the Celtics slowly start to give him less minutes to justify a release and then the league black balls him   LeBron is only an activist so as long as it doesn't hurt his pocket books.
"Enes ""Better Than LeBron Lames Could Ever Be"" Kanter"
Enes Kanter supports the genocidal regime in Israel. He is not a moral paragon.
"Damn, enes kanter is the man!"
"literally not a single things you stated serves as evidence against genocide if it were actually occuring. you're implying that western nations are scrutinizing china for their own benefit and drawing a parallel to iraq, a completely different situation.   **the foreign policy establishment in the US is not fixated on ethnic suppression in china.** it barely breaks the news cycle and we have enes kanter making us talk about it. trade relations, and money in general, with china take clear priority over foreign internal human rights abuses."
Lebron about to hire someone to kill Enes lol. In all seriousness though huge respect to Kanter for this.
"Its enes kanter, does he even have any high profile endorsements?"
Enes Kanter is who Kyrie thinks he is
"The ones who didn't want to speak out were higher profile players who were commercially viable in China and make money there.  No one in China was buying Enes Kanter jerseys or shoes, there is zero impact to his income. He has nothing to lose, and if you have nothing to lose there's nothing to fear."
"Right, People who hate Erdogan also hate G√ºlen as much as him in Turkey.They were buddies with Erdogan till 2016. Both Gulenists and Erdogan pulled wires to get their own supporters in goverment and army and both parties are Islamists, anti-secular, corrupted organisations.   Furthermore, they are cultists, yep real cultists. There are videos where followers of the cult dying to eat leftovers of G√ºlen. They even treasure his used napkins. There is a video of g√ºlen gifting his leftover tea to Enes Kanter... And these guys have multiple schools and colleges in poor countries(as well as some devoloped ones) where they brainwash people.  So in my book G√ºlen is as bad Erdogan if not WORSE.    Choose your poison."
Yeah dude but Israel is awesome   https://www.jpost.com/opinion/enes-kanter-israels-unlikely-nba-ally-opinion-665659

"I‚Äôm happy at least one NBA player, Enes Kanter decided to live his life under American rules rather than adhering to China‚Äôs censorship.   I"
"I was thinking ""who the fuck cares if Enes Kanter writes some message on his shoe""  The Chinese government does apparently. Xi really needs to read up on the Streisand effect."
I dunno  I certainly won't compare Lebron to Ali. Def. Not Kyrie   But  I'd compare Enes Kanter to Ali tho.   Enes is out here calling out injustices regardless how it impacts his wealth and the league.
probably settling for a enes kanter public apologize or just ban kanter
This is just pure lunacy. Enes Kanter saying free tibet hasn't probably registered anywhere in China. These fuckers go and drop the Celtics game and now the focus is on Kanter and Tibet. At least some of the fans in China will see why it happened.
It's so childish. If it was another government saying we don't acknowledge Tibet as part of china then sure they can do whatever geopolitical manuevering they feel necessary. But its just Enes Kanter lol
**Enes Kanter** is a good man. A strong man. Not afraid t stand up for what is right.
"enes kanter is a fraud of the highest degree. he doesn‚Äôt hate erdoƒüan for any of the thousand valid reasons, he hates erdoƒüan for splitting with g√ºlen, fucking fetullah g√ºlen, who is even more manic than erdoƒüan. he doesn‚Äôt care about ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù or ‚Äújournalistic freedom‚Äù, those things were already under attack when g√ºlen and erdoƒüan were still besties and would continue to be if g√ºlen had succeeded with his coup. the only reason he cares about the situation in turkey is because he can‚Äôt enjoy the benefits being a g√ºlenist got you in all spheres of life any more.  Edit: not that anybody in this sub actually knows anything about Turkish or Tibetan politics though, which is fine, this is a basketball sub."
"Enes ""International Incident"" Kanter strikes again.  I love this guy."
"Enes ""International Incident"" Kanter strikes again.   I love this guy"
"Yeah I was referencing their streams. Tencent (which has a minority stake in Reddit) stopped streaming the Celtics - Knicks as well.  The team social media accounts are still active, but searches for Kanter are being blocked on Weibo, from what I understand: https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbas-enes-kanter-calls-for-a-free-tibet-sparks-chinese-backlash-11634814575"
"""NBA too popular in China""   Does that also mean the CPC would trod carefully with NBA censorship if the league backs Kanter, given the massive NBA following in China?  China's Twitter-like platform Weibo also seemed to be erasing ""Enes Kanter"" from online presence, as nationalistic calls of his boycott were trending.   From Weibo:  ‚ÄúFrom now on, the homepage will no longer report any information about the Boston Celtics, and our Weibo will stop updating!... Resolutely resist any behavior that undermines national harmony and the dignity of the motherland!‚Äù"
"Boston Celtics games were abruptly pulled from the Chinese internet on Thursday after a center on the team, Enes Kanter, said on social media that the country‚Äôs leader, Xi Jinping, was a ‚Äúbrutal dictator,‚Äù citing his government‚Äôs repressive policies in Tibet.  The incident could spell fresh trouble for the N.B.A. in China. The league has millions of devoted fans there but has also just spent two years mending its image in the country after a Houston Rockets manager tweeted support in 2019 for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  That tweet, by Daryl Morey, now an executive with the Philadelphia 76ers, was quickly deleted, though not before setting off an uproar in China. Sponsors in the country severed ties and the state-run broadcaster stopped airing games, leading to financial fallout that the league estimated cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.  Geopolitical tensions and rising nationalism have made China a minefield for multinational companies, whose access to the country‚Äôs 1.4 billion consumers is often contingent on not taking the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù stance on issues such as Beijing‚Äôs rule in Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.  An N.B.A. representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In a video that was posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on Wednesday, Kanter spoke into the camera for nearly three minutes and decried what he called a ‚Äúcultural genocide‚Äù in Tibet.  ‚ÄúI say, ‚ÄòShame on the Chinese government,‚Äô‚Äù he said, wearing a T-shirt with the image of the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing considers a criminal separatist. ‚ÄúThe Chinese dictatorship is erasing Tibetan identity and culture.‚Äù  Another social media post by Kanter on Wednesday showed off sneakers emblazoned with Tibetan flag motifs and the words ‚ÄúFree Tibet.‚Äù  By Thursday, recent Celtics games were marked as unavailable for replay through Tencent, the Chinese internet giant that has partnered with the N.B.A. to stream its games in the country. The website for Tencent Sports also indicated that upcoming Celtics games would not be livestreamed. Tencent Sports has not been livestreaming games with the 76ers, either. The team hired Morey last year as president of basketball operations.  A Tencent spokeswoman declined to comment.  On the Chinese social platform Weibo, a Celtics fan account declared that it would immediately stop posting about the team.  The account told its 615,000 Weibo followers: ‚ÄúResolutely resist any behavior that damages national harmony and the dignity of the motherland!‚Äù  China considers Tibet part of its historical empire, though the authorities have long confronted protests against their rule there. The Communist Party under Mr. Xi has intensified efforts to defray ethnic tensions by encouraging the region‚Äôs residents to assimilate into Chinese society and making Mandarin Chinese the dominant language in public life.  Kanter, who is of Turkish heritage, has been an outspoken critic of Turkey‚Äôs president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish prosecutors have sought Kanter‚Äôs arrest, and his Turkish passport has been revoked. He has expressed concern that Turkish agents might kill him overseas."
"It is unlikely, until you realize it's Enes Kanter. Then it just makes sense."
Enes Kanter supports Israel. He is not a moral paragon.
Losing KD actually hurt the Thunder though.  This is more akin Enes Kanter turning on the Jazz tbh.
"Idk why your management has a hard on for keeping CJ. He‚Äôs just Monta Ellis 2.0 to me. That, and your weird pingpong fetish with Boston in regards to Enes Kanter."
"SENGUN IS A WORSE ENES KANTER, ILL TAKE THE EXTRA PICK"
"He really isn't match-up limited. He'll get pushed around by Embiid, but almost everyone either gets pushed around by Embiid or watches Joel go right by them anyway. Centers just don't need to be 275+ lbs anymore and don't have to defend guys like Enes Kanter very often.   As for offense, he's an elite rim-runner, fairly good rebounder, and good passer. And last year he showed jumpers from the elbows and baseline, though we don't know if he'll make them enough to be respected from those spots. But it shows that he has worked on those shots and is trying to improve his game, and isn't afraid to shoot when open."
"Gonna use this question to remind people Portland made the WCF while having to start Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter who was playing with a separated shoulder lmao."
"Bigs are only worth that much if they can defend as well. Not saying he can't, just that offense for that position isn't the #1 priority. It's why Enes Kanter bounces around so much."
Yeah and jokic really took it to all defense enes kanter and jusuf ‚Äú27 fouls per 36‚Äù Nurkic. I would hardly say jokic even outplayed dame: 33/10/4 w/ 62 TS% versus 34/4/10 w/ 66 TS%. That blazers offense WAS dame and his teammates sold
"I personally wouldn't view Robert Williams as a better player then Horford right now, especially since Al still can space for their ISO scorers and is still a pretty solid defender.     Higher on the chart then Kanter i can get behind, but I guess Enes was fine signing to be third on the chart and barely get playing time?  He started 35 games last year would just be surprising he would go to a situation for little money and not receive some run."
&gt;Just ball hog and stat pad his way to a first round spanking?  Ok so who on that thunder roster should've ran the point than? Enes Kanter? Cam Payne? You tell me mister basketball genius.
"did you just watch the video attached? How many game winners and clutch shots he hit that year? His second best player on the team was Enes Kanter, who could barely find a roster the next season after this.    Westbrook was also the best player on the court in the playoffs that year against the Rockets, he was playing like 45+ minutes a night and had a positive +/- for the season. The few minutes he sat, the team just got decimated. Harden had Lou Will in that series. Westbrook had (checks notes) Andre Roberson as the next best scorer"
"You mean the series I mentioned where injured enes kanter was our starting center? Lmfao didn't realize we were joking around here, that's a good one"
"Yeah and in case you forgot, those guys are pretty good. First and second in 6MOY voting last year. Who do the Blazers have? Enes Kanter? Good luck with that. Not to mention the Jazz had Conley, Bojan and Royce O'Neal who are all excellent fits. Plus Mitchell and Gobert is already a better combo than Dame and CJ."
Yea man he should have defered to Enes Kanter in 2017 instead of being so ball dominant tf was he thinking!
" Only players that would struggle today, are bigs that can't/don't defend.  Enes Kanter would be a fringe all star if he could play defense for example. But he's such a liability on defense, you can't play him too much.  Not sure anybody would be worse. The best bigs of the 2000s were usually defensively great. Maybe Amare? Amare would still be good though and his defense was bad back then too. So idk if much would change."
I feel like the only player who ever says anything good is enes Kanter lmao
‚ÄúEnes kanter punching the bench‚Äù levels.
Hassan Whiteside jumped on an Enes Kanter pumpfake once. Anything is possible
"$10 mil has pretty serious cap tax implications. Plus in 2022-23, Al's contract will be over 14 mil guaranteed while Kemba initially would have been around 37 guaranteed, and is currently a 26 million a year dead cap hit for OKC after waiving him.   Based on his health and initial contract, Kemba was a negative asset. Obviously at around 8 million + a year with the Knicks, he's a steal, but he wasn't worth 8 mil a year with the C's.   Buying him out would have been horrible. Can you imagine having 26 million worth of dead cap space for 2 years as the C's try to compete. It's fine for OKC since they could take the hit and is currently in a full blown rebuild.   The 16th pick seems promising, but on the larger scale of things, for flexibility's sake, this is the right move.   They tried to recoup Kemba's value. Hell, the dude didn't even play back to backs for an ENTIRE SEASON. The knee just didn't hold up.  Plus if it wasn't for Al, their big man depth would be Robert Williams, Grant Williams, and Enes Kanter. I can't emphasize how much better Al makes the bigs rotation"
"Enes Kanter is one of the best rebounders in the league. Per 36, he would have averaged an absurd 16.3 rebounds for POR. To his credit, he did 11 rebounds for around 24 minutes a game. He just kinda sucks at everything else (except scoring in the low post)"
Enes kanter did it better
"Yeah, I feel like, at the very worst, he's Enes Kanter with better passing and mobility  Going to give you great rebounding and interior finishing, creates great looks for his teammates as well. Even if his jumpshot never improves he's still a great rotation player for a long time"

"PER isn‚Äôt adding any contribution to player evaluations. It ironically undervalues efficiency and assists, ignores non-box defense, and overvalues scoring, rebounding and steals. PER has a fetish for offensive rebounding. It has JV 67th, Greg Monroe 77th, Enes Kanter 60th and Andre Drummond 38th all time. The margin of error is just so high. It‚Äôs worthless."
"It's obviously true, like didn't they say last draft had 10 people with Nigerian origin? That's absurd considering the percentage of the US population.  Basically a Joel Embiid type is not gonna come out of China, but there's no reason even someone as good as Enes Kanter isn't out there."
"Enes Kanter  Rebounding god and world class finisher around the rim, but zero defense"
"Enes Kanter says hello. He'd just be a sixth man if he's a good scorer and a terrible defender. It's enough to make a career but perhaps not the one everyone expects right now. We're talking about a Jabari Parker with the ability to pass. Or Michael Beasley. Not terrible, not great."
"Losing that 40 pounds or whatever also made a world‚Äôs difference, I legit think he‚Äôll get rotation minutes with how skilled he is offensively. He‚Äôs basically a 3-level scoring Enes Kanter"
Kanter is great offensively if he played 30 years ago enes would be a menace. Still wouldn't be stopping anyone on defense but would peolly put up like 25 ppg
"Feel like they‚Äôd get it if Kanter actually became a prominent name in world news. But I‚Äôd say almost no Jeopardy contestants would have any idea who Enes Kanter is now, let alone 15 years from now. Most of the people on Jeopardy know very little about sports from what I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve watched a lot of Jeopardy, and I‚Äôm fairly confident that if I were ever on the show I‚Äôd sweep any category about NHL/NBA/maybe even NFL and fail miserably at everything else.  An example: [you can see how disappointed Alex is in this clip.](https://youtu.be/h33u2eeVqXo)"
"Defense is the main reason  Centers are the only guys who can put up tons of points and boards on good efficiency and still be not a starter level player because of defense  Look at Enes Kanter, he would probably put up 20 and 10 every game if he played 35 minutes but you can't do that because he gets cooked"
‚Äú TIL before overthrowing the Turkish government in a violent coup Enes Kanter had a 55% career FG percentage ‚Äú
"Except Enes Kanter was on TV shitting on anti-vaxxers and calling out LeBron for not taking a stronger stance. The NBAPA gives players their official position, but has no mechanism to force them to stick to it."
Thats enes kanter take not mines and you missed the key word **NOW**  You do realize most of this didn't start from this CNN clip right?
"Credit to him, but he was also playing against Enes Kanter due to Nurkic being in foul trouble (due to him picking up self-inflicted dumb fouls)  That Blazers team with CJ, Kanter &amp; Melo on defense was abysmal. Blazers are upgraded huge by just getting rid of some of the deadweight"
"Kanter had a similar take, but it apparently really takes someone of Kareem's stature to make a difference in the conversation. And this is exactly Kareem's point in why LeBron, Draymond and others matter. They are public figures, and what they say matters to many people who look up to their heroes as gods (whether this is at all a good thing to do isn't up to debate here). People might not listen to an Enes Kanter, but they might listen to Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Others might not listen to Kareem Abdul Jabbar, but they might listen to LeBron James.  Which, inversely, LeBron and Draymond acknowledge and embrace when they're talking about a topic that they endorse. What they are not taking into consideration here is, as Kareem points out, is that when they're ""honoring"" vaccination hesitancy they are sending a message that does not play into the hands of the society getting better. Their actions are not those of a neutral observer that results in nothing.  It's the same old adage of ""with great power comes great responsibility"" that predates even Spider-Man. And the thing that many public figures (in this cases, athletes) fail to recognize is that they are held accountable for what they say and what they don't say and how they say things. Even if they don't like it."
Enes Kanter and rebounding
Enes Kanter shared a similar sentiment and I saw Bron stans unloading on him. Hopefully Kareem gets through to those dopes.
"Nah LeBron is one person I always thought was either a legit 6ft8 guy or even 6ft9, there is that time he had a minor scuffle with KD in the finals I think were he stood face to face with him and he did not look shorter at all. He also is literally the same height as Kevin Love, in his scuffle with Enes Kanter, Kanter does not tower over him"
"Draymond's comments were laughable and LeBron agreeing is a fucking pity.  People need to stop worshipping LeBron like he's this untouchable positive force in the world (he's not).  He's an aspiring billionaire that could give a fuck about things beyond his profits and basketball legacy.  His comments (or lack thereof) about the vaccines have not been positive whatsoever and I'm glad a player came out and criticized him, even if it was somebody as stupid as Enes Kanter."
Enes Kanter continues to be a good dude.  Really don't understand how you could get vaccinated but also just think it's a personal choice that doesn't really matter.
"Braat, braat, I am Enes Kanter up in 'em  Up in it, lovin it, yes I made Erdogan say ""don't come again!""  Lock up your tweets, twits, and troll scene, yuh,   it's hard to play, Kyrie, if they won't let you in arenas"
"I have to say, as a Jazz fan, I'm finally starting to like Enes ""Penis Cancer"" Kanter again. We shipped him off to OKC and kept Gobert, despite Kanter being the 3rd overall pick just 3 years earlier, in large part because of immaturity on Kanter's part. It really is rare in this league for the attitude cases to finally get solved, but he's really shown a good attitude on his part, wherever he's played since.  I'm also impressed at his willingness to stand up for what he believes, between this, Erdoƒüan, and gun control, even if his politics aren't that great"
"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get into a word or sentence feud with Enes Kanter, but I believe he wasn‚Äôt educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.‚Äù"
Hedo Turkoglu out there helping him. I wonder what Enes Kanter has to say about that...
yeah but what's the relevancy of this sub being echochamber and enes kanter words
"Not defendin bron on this but Enes Kanter is one of the last people on the league to criticize someone. He is known cultist, who eats leftovers of his ""grace"" and shit. Kyrie would be Einstein compared to Kanter."
ENES KANTER REDEMPTION ARC
"I am very glad to hear players and other people speak up about their personal choices. Players like Enes Kanter(Had no respect for him to begin with) have lost a ton of my respect. Not because of their personal choice, but because of their arrogance and ignorance.  Some players are sounding like redditors. And when you sound like a redditor, you should recheck what you're saying."
"I think that Enes Kanter would win, he has the right disposition to win in my mind.   Who would be the two goofy guys that die first in the 'Red Light, Green Light' game? I could see it being Javale McGee and Terrence Ross."
"Jokic is a terrible defender. His dfg% within 6 feet of the rim is identical to enes kanter at 63.5%, with them tied for 5th worst among starting centers who played at least 20 games per NBA stats  Embiid is 53.9 dfg% at 11th  Rudy Gobert was first at 48%  46 players overall"
If Nance is nothing than sure. Also Cody Zeller is replacing Enes Kanter which is a massive W.
"Nah you can't say that because the Warriors cooked the amazing Enes Kanter without him  /s  And then they lost to the ""great"" Raptors team that suddenly gave up 34 points in a quarter when KD played  For real that Blazers defense was HORRIBLE and people act like KD wouldn't have easily beat them as well with Klay and Dray, he beat plenty of better teams on OKC"
*Enes Kanter sweats profusely*
"I want Lebron for games 1, 2, and 5. Luka for games 3,4, and 6. For 7 I‚Äôd like Enes Kanter and it‚Äôs not even close."
"Can we do a crossover of different eras? Mehmed the Conqueror, Mehmet Okur, and Enes Kanter against Jakob P√∂ltl, Marcin Gortat, and Jan III Sobieski - winner takes Vienna."
"Against the amazing Enes Kanter and the 16th ranked defense of Portland  You can say ""game 6 vs Houston"" but the only reason they were there is because Curry sold game 3 and missed 4 layups"
Our defense with him on the team was worse than it was the previous season when we had Enes Kanter in his position. That should tell you all you need to know about his ability to get on guys to play defense.
2011 Enes Kanter - Tristan Thompson  2012 Kevin Murphy - Kostas Papanikolaou  2013 Shabazz Muhammad - Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014 Dante Exum - Marcus Smart  2015 Trey Lyles - Devin Booker   Just wtf
Weird you think how good we already were when we weren‚Äôt starting enes Kanter is our top end lol.   Our starting 5 was already 6th in defense when they played together but our bench was absolutely miserable(which played out in the playoffs too).   Going from melo and Kanter on the bench to the guys I mentioned earlier is a big improvement
"We were 17th in defense in the games Nurkic played(29th overall when starting kanter). We replaced Enes Kanter and Carmelo Anthony with Nance, Zeller, and Snell.   Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to believe we can be a top 10 defense again(were 6th in 2018 starting dame, CJ, aminu, harkless, Nurk)"
"Enes Kanter said he‚Äôd change his name to something more American-sounding when he becomes a US citizen, and for the life of me I hope he changes it to Dennis Kanter."
"I agree with Steph being a great playoff performer but attributing him cooking Enes Kanter on pick and roll to not being ""held back by KD"" is pretty dumb  Enes Kanter can't even guard average players, let alone superstars"
Enes Kanter is a great dude.
"What an idiot trying to gatekeep peoples emotions. In the heat of the moment people POSTURE then use their better judgement to NOT actually fight. FUCK Rudy Gobert lmao what a tool, shutup and standup for something real like Enes Kanter"

Love that he pretends to care about labor camps when the dude is [also an ethnonationalist](https://www.google.com/amp/s/zartonkmedia.com/2020/12/26/critic-of-erdogan-regime-turkish-nba-player-enes-kanter-makes-the-grey-wolves-sign-prior-to-game-against-the-rockets/amp/)
Here he is admitting to wanting a career in politics https://thehill.com/homenews/house/477599-enes-kanter-sees-political-stardom-after-nba-and-wwe
"Well, we know LeBron isn't actually watching the trial while he's rehabbing. Kyle Rittenhouse is a stupid motherfucker, but his little breakdown was real. And nothing about the whole case is worth celebrating either way the verdict goes (it's obvious what the outcome will be with the prosecution making the defense's case for it). It's all shit. Including LeBron's laughing emojis. I can't believe this jackass is on the Lakers. Trade him for Enes Kanter."
so hes Enes Kanter?
&gt;Celtics star Enes Kanter
"I never thought that ""Enes Kanter (burgers)"" would be one of the smartest NBA players in recent times."
Yup this is why I don‚Äôt take his opinion seriously. As Muslims it is important for us to speak out against abuses against ALL Muslims. The fact that Enes Kanter literally supports Israel and then claims to care about Muslims in China shows me that he‚Äôs being disingenuous.
enes kanter stop being cringe and reddit challenge
LeMao about to put Enes Kanter in a concentration camp
&gt;Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter says he felt encouraged to speak out against China after the NBA supported players in fighting other injustices and human rights issues.  Boston Celtics WHAT
"Exactly. You can play the same word games as Kanter, in fact.  ""Enes is a hypocrite because he cares about China's abuses but not [insert any of dozens of authoritarian countries.]""  How could Enes abandon the people of Belarus, Russia, Poland, Brazil and Saudi Arabia??!?!?"
also‚Ä¶. isnt Enes Kanter pro-israel or did i mishear that somewhere? if that‚Äôs true i dont want to hear any ‚Äòim not pro politics im pro rights‚Äô bullshit outta him
Enes Kanter do Palestine
The most shocking thing about this post is that Enes Kanter is introduced as ‚ÄúBoston‚Äôs Celtics star‚Äù
"Enes Kanter gonna end up like Kaepernick after this season, just watch."
"Except that's also the card he's playing. It's a common move. ""BLM? What about China??"". Pretty obvious line for the NBA to draw- black people living in the US care the most about issues that affect black people in the US. Kanter's line of caring about China but not other major issues makes less sense.  Also I died at the opening line ""Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter""... Not really a star ever, but certainly not a star this year."
"But did Enes Kanter think about how his actions would affect himself and others financially, financially, financially, and financially?"
"The NBA has made me, Enes Kanter, a friend of many political war hawks that are responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians in the Middle East, follower of a religious leader who has been paid by the CIA, to speak oddly convenient talking points that the the Pentagon endorses."
"I think China being a big revenue source is certainly a piece of the puzzle, but not the whole thing. A predominantly black group of people caring more about issues facing the black community in the communities they grew up in and live in isn't surprising and also contributes.   Then there's the impact factor - do I think race relations in America are healed - no. Do I think we've made progress - yes, do I think, even if it's a small impact, that activism by NBA players on race relations in America has helped - I do.   Do I think Enes Kanter and the NBA for that matter could have any impact on China's human rights violations? No. China doesn't fucking care what athletes or sports organizations in America think or say.   Making China the focus of your efforts in activism is a very sisyphusian task. Everyone is limited in impact they can make by time and a number of other factors. One could much easier organize a turkey donation or coat drive or raise funds for afterschool programs or go full LeBron and open up an entire damn school and see real tangible impact, than one could do anything to help the situation going on in China at all.   I feel like Enes is getting lots of self-righteous gratification from his activism - but what impact is he making? In my eyes, none. But I do think if he were to focus is energy elsewhere - he could have a real tangible impact."
"Whenever China is brought up, somehow all the Black NBA players have to have a take, while no one asks Tom Brady or Sidney Crosby why they aren't speaking out.   Sorry, but Enes is out of line, if others want to join him, great, but quit throwing everyone else under the bus.  Le Bron is not responsible for the NBA being in China, it's the owners and corporations -  Many of you who are mad about Lebron are typing this on Chinese made Iphones.  Boycott stuff from China if it means that much, but a guy who has dubious politics like Kanter needs to back off."
Enes Kanter supports a dictator and is friends with an American warmonger.  Hypocrite fuck.
When did Enes Kanter defend the US government?  I feel like tankies constantly bring up the US to defend China by creating a false dichotomy between the two
"&gt; ""People think I do politics, I don't do politics. I do human rights.""  Also Enes Kanter: https://twitter.com/EnesKanter/status/1420790640024109056"
Enes kanter 40/20 +/- -32 game inbound
"If Portland can land Enes Kanter next year, I think they‚Äôll be able to make the 2nd round for sure"
This strategy of hoping Dame can carry again and again while signing Enes Kanter every other year wasn‚Äôt sustainable. They are the DeRozan Raptors of the West and need a massive change to the roster.
"Yeah dude, because of defense. Even in the games we lost, we had a ridiculous offense.  We finished with the highest ORTG of any full run in NBA history.   We literally won every time Nurkic wasn't in foul trouble, and we lost every game he was. Why? Because we got fucking abused on defense the moment Enes Kanter stepped on the floor to replace him  Like in game 7, we had a 126.9 ORTG when Dame and Jokic were on the floor. Clearly scoring wasn't the problem.  The series came down to Stotts being a dumbass, blazers bench sucking, and Nurkic being immature and picking up dumb unforced fouls."
"I mean, the Nuggets should have beaten us 3 years ago man  They were 100% the better team. Swept us 3-0 in the regular season and we were starting Enes Kanter lol. They were the higher seed even when we were healthy for a reason. HCA that series too   Likewise, we should've beaten them last time cause we were the better team. We just flip flopped. Worse team won both series"
"Cam Payne, Pat Bev, and Enes Kanter: ""Yeah! Someone should respond to Jokic's cheap and dirty plays!"""
"He's actually becoming prone to this, he did to Cam Payne, Enes Kanter and now Morris."
"Enes Kanter - Seems like a nice fun guy, I like the old school center bully ball down low.  But then he came to my team and I saw the defense."
I loves enes kanter
Because Vuc is in the enes kanter class of defense and Patrick Williams is injured
Chris Paul is old and can‚Äôt waste a year. He has to ball out to get moved to a playoff team. On top of that the thunder are a class act organization who always try to do right by their players and make sure they‚Äôre taken care of. Seriously read how they hired special chefs just for enes kanter when he was there because he didn‚Äôt eat a lot of foods they served   Ben is in his prime and on a four year deal. He has zero I ne give to help the sixers out after they threw him under the bus.
"I would honestly assume if he purposefully doesn't try they will suspend him for ""conduct detrimental to the team""   Because if you try and are performing like Enes Kanter on defense it's okay.  But if you're not trying and are performing like Enes Kanter on defense, it's not okay.   Therefore potentially a suspension.  At my work if I show up and purposefully don't try, I get written up/suspended/fired.  I'd assume if he is *purposefully* not trying and it is evident. They can suspend him.   I may be wrong, I'm probably wrong. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
"AD looking like fucking Enes Kanter there. Flat-footed as SGA comes off the screen, feeble swipe at the super slow cross-over, then clumsily pursues and just runs into him.  Did he put on weight or something? His feet are just looking really heavy here, kinda laboring to move."
"This happens when every player starts declining, people always think they are in their prime until 2-3 years after they clearly aren't  It's just that with Russ it's harder for people to accept because his volume numbers still optically make it look like he's still in his prime but he's not  He's gone from beating playoff teams with Enes Kanter and Andre Roberson to not being able to beat a tanking team with Anthony Davis"
So does Enes Kanter actually exist?
"Yes, we know this to be true because Enes Kanter played in every game last season and is clearly better than Jimmy Butler, who missed 20 games.   Also because it rhymes."

Best bad player is probably someone like Enes Kanter(back when he used to play) who is good at one thing but so bad at something else that he doesnt get to start
Lol Steph went against an Enes Kanter / Meyers Leonard center rotation and Stotts was dumb af and played drop coverage  That's asking to get burned  Point is AD doesn't usually shoot 75% from mid. Even uncontested. Which his shots weren't
"Yeah but I think that one can be defended, it was wrong IMO but I understand why.  Being the only coach ever to allow Enes Kanter to be playeable defensively in the playoffs is IMO worse"
Seems he's the next Enes Kanter... on the court that is.
simpson's nelson  Haha!!  fuck Tom Brady and Enes Kanter.
Bro he‚Äôs Enes Kanter if he was younger and black.
"good, fuck Enes Kanter and the Celtics"
"&gt; Making up literal bullshit about me to try and bait me into hearing nonsense from a clown defending a hate group isn‚Äôt going to work  This was your entire first reply to me, you can't be serious.  I also never said you said that, can you read?  What is the point of bringing up Farrakhan on a post about Enes Kanter other than to make that point?"
"I agree but I don't think it really has anything to do with those guys.      For sure they have less of a ceiling because they don't have the size and athleticism of those big swings like Durant, Lebron, etc., but they mostly just didn't have anybody good on that roster.   Like there should never be a situation where Carmelo Anthony and Enes Kanter and Robet Covington are fighting out for the second-best player on the team, even with injuries.  The Portland FO has been absolute ass for most of the last ten years, which is also one of the reasons they have so many injuries.   That's what happened with Lob City, they had the best starting five in the league but they only had one player on the bench worth playing.    At some point injuries are inevitable when you have to play every one of your starters 40+ minutes a game in the playoffs.    That's the unspoken fact when everybody talks about that Clippers collapse against the Rockets, they could barely run up and down the court those last few games."
I bet enes kanter would go silent if a war broke out. Dude wouldn‚Äôt get near the army or sign up
"Pretty much, the NBA and NFL donated to specifically poor black neighborhoods instead of poor neighborhoods in general, and I get that‚Äôs because most of the players in those leagues are black I just thought it was ironic that the NBA has been a league that talked a lot about social issues and had ‚Äúequality‚Äù everywhere especially during the bubble but donated to race specific neighborhoods  Like you said, people only generally care about that which benefits them. So yeah true equality probably won‚Äôt ever exist which is sad, and I feel for the people in countries who are being oppressed, I admire that there is a player like Enes Kanter but most players and celebrities won‚Äôt do what he‚Äôs doing because they have a lot of businesses in China"
its going to take someone a lot more relevant than enes kanter to get Nike's attention
Do they have a responsibility to respond to Enes Kanter?
"At no point have I disagreed with ""slave labor is wrong"". And I have at no point deleted any comments. I don't know wtf you're talking about.   I never dismissed Enes comments. But I don't care for him using slave labor and people suffering for his own personal and political gain if there won't be any real actions behind it. Hell, not only won't there be any action, he'll keep on playing for an organizational and a league that does everything they can to appease China.  Again, I have at no point said that what's going on in China is right or something shouldn't be done about it. But Kanter tweeting about it while supporting people who literally bombing women and children and while trying to advance his own political career is some bullshit I will never get behind."
"It is a bit frightening people upvote ""This dude fucking rocks in terms of activism."".   Um yeah, people, that Erdogan fellow managed to turn Turkey in an authoritarian dictatorship because of Gullen, who Enes Kanter supports. What happened aftewards was basically a Night of the Long Knives for the Gulen movement."
Bro what. No where did I say China is good lmao. Enes Kanter just isnt the man to listen to when he says it cause it‚Äôs plainly obvious the agenda he has
Enes Kanter is bad at basketball and irrelevant lol
"I fully agree with you there....but I don't have to agree with everything someone's said to agree that slave labor is wrong. So his cause here is right, and I support it. That in no way whatsoever means I suddenly support everything Enes Kanter supports. You can share some opinions with someone and differ on others.  Even if it's for political points, is it a bad thing for this situation to be called out? Should Kanter have to establish his views on everything before he earns the right to speak out against this?"
"Lmao this guys comment history is almost 100% pro-CCP. He‚Äôs made hundreds of comments on the Enes Kanter situation and before that, his comment history is almost entirely about Chinese politics.  This dude is 100% a CCP shill and it‚Äôs insane that so many people in this sub have bought in hook line and sinker."
"For anyone following along, you'll note that /u/ApplecakesMcGee once again didn't actually provide any evidence or back up anything. He won't ""go into [his] education"" because he can't credibly actually debate any of this. Not Kanter, not Islamic jurisprudence, not Turkey, not international relations. Because he has nothing substantive to say, because he's entirely uneducated on the subjects.   In effect, this is his argument. Enes Kanter and John Bolton took a picture, and Kanter tweeted about it. This means they're in cohoots of course, and Kanter is a neocon. Now, pressed to defend this stance, here's the series of connections that we're supposed to believe makes this is a credible argument. Neocons want a more aggressive stance towards China; now, don't stop to evaluate ""why"". It certainly isn't anything related to foreign policy, national security, and international relations, because everyone knows that neocons aren't concerned at all about that. It's definitely not economics and business, because again, this is not something the neocons are concerned with. No, just accept that because Ted Cruz wrote a bill about Uighurs, at a time when that was prominently in the discourse and an opportunity to score easy points, that that's what he cares about. Again, no one has ever accused Ted Cruz of political opportunism. Not a once. Now, Ted Cruz is a neocon. So is John Bolton. Thus, they believe in and care about the same things. Thus, John Bolton cares about Uighurs, and that's why he is concerned with China. And thus, John Bolton and Enes Kanter are the same. It's...well, logic isn't quite the word that applies.  Rather, it's an argument so facile, so bizarrely incongruous with reality, that one is tempted to call it satire...except it's clearly not. And to heap another dose of absurdity, pointing out reality (that neocons don't care about Uighurs, they care about things like international power dynamics, in a very hard power sense, and national security interests, including economic interests) is ""carrying water"" for them. Now of course, I despite Ted Cruz, John Bolton, and the neocons. Their worldview is fundamentally wrong, and they have caused more damage to the US and to international stability than any other group, foreign or domestic, over the past three decades. But you see, understanding=endorsing. It's really some Trump-caliber mental midgetry."
"Son: Mom, can we have Enes Kanter on the way home?  Mom: We already have Enes Kanter at the refrigerator.   Son: \*checks fridge\* *Sees Kyrie Irving*"
Enes Kanter CIA Asset
"I've laid out most of the things that the right wing, including Cruz (Cornyn isn't really a foreign policy guy, I don't think he serves on any committees related to it or has any involvement), care about with China. Their issues are based around economics and international relations. Currency manipulation, IP theft, state involvement in coporate affairs (e.g. Huawei), South China Sea, etc. They don't care about Uighurs. They don't give a fuck. Fox News primetime isn't doing shows talking about China's oppression of Uighurs. IP theft, national security threats, threats to allies like Japan or Taiwan, sure...Uighurs, fuck no.  There is no evidence he's a Bolton supporter. There's frankly no evidence he agrees with any neocon views, and almost all of his espoused views are fundamentally contrary to neocon positions (i.e. pro-BLM, pro-LGBTQ, pro-Muslim). Your entire argument comes down to ""I saw a picture he took with John Bolton where he said he enjoyed talking to him about human rights in Turkey""....that's it. That's all you've got. Which, as previously mentioned, is a pretty obvious pragmatist move to talk to a **sitting administration official** about the cause he's an activist about. You think John Bolton gives a fuck about human rights in Turkey? FUCK NO. The only right John Bolton gives a fuck about is the right to invade, usually with a preference towards invading Muslim countries (off the top of my head, the only non-Muslim state I can remember Bolton being particularly aggressive towards is North Korea). Somehow I don't think Enes Kanter is exactly in favor of invading Iran.  So again, I think you're entirely talking out of your ass about something you clearly have no real understanding of, or education about."
"because those people don't support black lives matter and the china stuff was mostly a way for people to discredit any of lebron's activism against antiblackness. enes kanter isn't a hypocrite for being a far right nutjob zionist, but lebron is a hypocrite for being hesitant to take a side and not knowing whats right in a propaganda war? it just comes down to the fact that these people take an issue with black lives matter and don't take an issue with supporting gulen or israel."
"&gt; It's just weird that this sub has NEVER taken that stance with any other person, but decides that ""we don't have to agree on everything!"" suddenly applies to Enes Kanter of all people.  Wait whatt??? How is THAT, of all possible things, your takeaway?   ""We don't have to agree on everything"" is the GOOD thing here, not the bad thing. That creates the breathing space to accept and celebrate Kanter's very appropriate criticisms, also accept that he's got some bad takes, but being able to think both of those things at the same time without losing sight of the big picture.  The takeaway is NOT ""we should be more ignorant and less nuanced about Kanter's views."" It's ""wow, somehow we're getting it right with Kanter and should do that more often."""
"Gonna say it again, this man is who Kyrie thinks he is. Kyrie thinks he's standing up for the ""voiceless"" when truly its Enes Kanter"
No. The person Enes supported was just as shit as Erdogan.   Ask Turkish people and not many actually respect Kanter at all. Americans love to slurp his dick cheese tho.

"Last year we started enes Kanter for 30 games and when we didn‚Äôt we had Carmelo Anthony and Kanter off the bench. We were average defensively in the games Nurkic played.   This year it‚Äôs Larry nance, Cody Zeller, and nassir little(who is turning into a contributor this year). That plus the new defense and guys are trying really hard is making a big difference"
diehard neoconservative right-winger? Didn't Enes Kanter literally campaign for Democratic Party politicians?
Ain‚Äôt nobody care about enes kanter lol
"We were 6th in 2018 and 15th in 2019. Only the last two years were we that bad, coincidentally both years we started enes Kanter for long portions of the season.  Last year in the games Nurkic played we were the 16th best defense, and we went from Carmelo and Kanter to nance and Zeller. Plus a new coach."
"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=enes%20kanter,%2Fm%2F0c9ny1  Pretty close considering people look up players for stats more than theyd look up a GM they know of but still more searches for Kanter"
"I mean, I'll bet more people know who Enes Kanter is than Daryl Morey"
"My previous comment on Enes from 2 years ago still proves to be right today:  &gt; Well people who spoke against Gulen were the targets 5 years ago. You could not get single fucking job at any government position without knowing someone from either his cult or Erdogan's party. You could be arrested with false evidence if you openly criticized either sides. Not only Erdogan's supporters but also people from different political backgrounds despise Gulen and his religious zealots and they have every reason to do so and how cringeworthy someone like this man (Enes) has become the spokesman for the democracy in US it is unbelievable really. Even if Erdogan falls today it is assured no one will welcome Kanter with open arms in Turkey.  This guy is a first class hypocrite. We all see through him in Turkey. I am seriously thinking adding the word Enes to my filter in this sub because it gets annoying everytime someone posts about him, people think that he is some kind of a typical freedom fighter."
Most of the reports that people like Enes Kanter or China watchers cite won't stand up in any academic setting either...
this is it. enes kanter will 100% run for office somewhere as a GOP member.
"Hottest new pod on the ringer, FUCK CHINA with Enes Kanter"
"Enes Kanter has sacrificed more for the sake of freedom of speech than almost anyone on Reddit. He‚Äôs not allowed to return to his home. Turkey won‚Äôt even air games in which he plays on TV. His family was jailed as a result of him speaking out against the Turkish government. Other Turkish NBA players won‚Äôt even acknowledge him after games.   I‚Äôm not saying Kanter is always right about his politics, but the dude puts his money where his mouth is. He‚Äôs shown that he‚Äôs willing to accept significant personal costs to exercise freedom of speech and stand up against the Turkish government."
"Each time one of these Enes posts pop up there‚Äôs a baffling number of pro-CCP accounts who come out of the woodwork to talk shit about Kanter. Which is funny, they can‚Äôt even defend the claims he‚Äôs making about the Uyghur camps and just proceed to criticize his last actions which aren‚Äôt even that detestable. Some people are unable to talk about the issue at hand and just insult the opposition bringing up valid points."
"I love Kanter. What a guy. Just wants to ball with his friends in Boston and Portland, run his free basketball camps, and condemn some of the most deserving villains currently in power on a global scale.    Enes the Menace! üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº"
"So instead of trying to discredit the argument Enes Kanter is making, you're just going to assault his character because you don't like some of the other things, unrelated to China, that he supports? In any academic setting, you'd get tossed. You need to discredit the argument."
The whole league is culpable with the long exception of Enes Kanter.
"Enes Kanter doesnt tho thats why he is friends with John Bolton one of the architects of the Iraq War. Thats why people are calling him out, do you have the mental capacity to understand that or am i wasting my time?"
You did not just put Enes Kanter into an American political party lol
Yea but you live here i presume as does Enes Kanter. The people in America who are evil love that you guys focus so much on china. Makes it way easier for them to pick your pocket.
Love Enes Kanter‚ù§Ô∏è
"Dude follows a fascist cult leader, hangs out with American war mongerers and is pro Israel but he tweeted some bad stuff balut China so he's a reddit nephew hero now lol  And let's not act like the only reason he isn't doing this is to stay relevant as an NBA player. Nobody gives a fuck about enes Kanter otherwise"
"It's just weird that this sub has NEVER taken that stance with any other person, but decides that ""we don't have to agree on everything!"" suddenly applies to Enes Kanter of all people."
I disagree. It's not really admirable because absolutely nothing has come from it. Bad shit is still happening. He just talks a lot of shit about powerful people. That's it. Not exactly changing the world now is it? And he's not saying anything we don't already know. And he's caused his family to get fucked up back in Turkey. That's just selfish. Seems like he's just making life worse for himself and his family. That isn't admirable. Shut your mouth and do what you can to change the lives of the people around you. Tweeting inflammatory things about governments and business owners isn't doing anything for anybody. They're still doing the fucked up shit they've been doing. Not a single life was saved or improved because of the tweets of Enes Kanter. How is it admirable?
He's looked terrible every single playoffs for over half a decade straight man.   I'm not talking about young Russ. He used to be solid. But post MVP season he's just been legitimately terrible Like the thunder never should've lost to us so embarrassingly. We started Enes Kanter lol.   **Russ literally missed more shots than the rest of his team combined** in a home elimination loss where they were up 10+ in the 4th quarter....in a series they were expected to dominate
"yes, very briefly and then he fell out of favor because he's actually terrible despite putting up good counting numbers occasionally.  The dude is clueless about where to be on defense, tries to block everything and jumps at pump fakes all the time (in the bubble he jumped at an Enes Kanter pump-fake from 19-feet out, got blown by &amp; the Blazers gave up an And-1), doesn't roll hard to the rim on screens if you didn't give him the ball last time and his effort comes &amp; goes unpredictably.  He's a total mirage player."
Enes Kanter has entered the chat
"He'll change his name to freedom while supporting an equal POS as the one who he opposes lmao + pro zionism....yeah, Enes Kanter should be a role model that we should all strive to be, fucking lmao why don't the mods remove the posts that have anything to do with this clown?"
Can we have a flair to block all enes kanter posts

"Until now, I would probably have agreed with you. The thing is that Kanter changing his name makes everything else he is doing and saying seem weird. If Kyle Kuzma had changed his name to Kyle Kuzma Freedom, the reaction would be ""Eh, whatever"". But because Enes Kanter have decided to use his platform to critique the people holding power, rightly in most cases, his critique will now be coming from someone who changed his name to ""Freedom"". And that discredits everything else he's saying, because can we really trust what a guy who changed his name to ""Freedom""?"
Kanter is the neocon version. Enes World War.
Don't think there's enough demand for Enes Kanter jerseys in any country for Nike to actually print any out in advance for people other than Kanter himself..... let alone in China where buying one would probably make you a pariah/target.
"I appreciate that he wants peace and security for the Uighurs, and that's about all I need to say or know in regards to Enes Kanter Freedom."

"Gulen and Erdogan were close collaborators. Gulen is just the leader of an Islamic sect (kinda cult like but ignoring that) that had a ton of members throughout the government and country in general. Together they undermined Turkey's secular democracy and gave themselves and their supporters power. Erdogan wanted to consolidate power in just himself, so he blamed a coup on them and now Enes Kanter hates the guy.   The main provide with Kanter's China stance is that he supports people like Kushner and John Bolton. He is a puppet of the military industrial complex and calling for us to ""do something"" about China usually just means war to these people. Which is absolutely fucking insane."
"&gt;They won 1 game without KD in 2019  They finished the Rockets  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Anyone could cook Enes ""can't play"" Kanter     Lmfao, you do realize this could be said of literally any player having a good performance? ""Lebron wasn't that good, anyone can cook Demar!"" ""MJ wasn't that good when he averaged 40 in the finals, anyone can cook that 90s bum!"" NBA is all about matchups, creating opportunities and taking advantage of opportunities."
"Last time I saw an Enes Kanter post, people were talking shit about how he's friends with Jared Kushner.  I'm not the biggest Kushner fan, but that shouldn't negate the good things he says"
"They won 1 game without KD in 2019 and then beat the Blazers who haven't been real contenders during their entire run   Anyone could cook Enes ""can't play"" Kanter"
"I wonder what is Enes Kanter doing about the human rights violations happening in Turkey. We all love to point fingers on others and turn a blind eye on our own eyes. He is not American and he is not Chinese, turn your attention to need of the Turkish people."
"Not just Israel, Enes Kanter also loves American war criminals  https://twitter.com/EnesKanter/status/1420790640024109056?s=20"
"People don't hate Kanter for the message. If anything, people hate the method with me personally being annoyed with how he's propagating a narrative people use to shut down other important issues.  Really infuriating is how he will call out others' passiveness without understanding his own problematic history. And this may be unfair, but him being a scrub of a player doesn't help him either.  What makes Pop different and why people love him is that his message is just about building people up. If Pop was anti-LeBron/Joe Tsai/MJ in this quote, you'd have more pushback, but this quote is about affirming Enes rather than destroying someone else."
"Kanter himself said the same thing about LeBron, except he didn't specify BLM, he just generally said that LeBron and other athletes [""pretend to care about social justice"".](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2021/11/20/lebron-james-not-giving-energy-enes-kanters-recent-social-justice-tweet)"
&gt;does anyone on here try to discredit support for BLM because of Lebron's stance on China?   Yes. Literally Enes Kanter did this. Lol  &gt;Money over Morals for the ‚ÄúKing‚Äù üëë   &gt;Sad &amp; disgusting how these athletes pretend they care about social justice  &gt;They really do ‚Äúshut up &amp; dribble‚Äù when Big Boss üá®üá≥ says so
"It's tough to tell because guys like him are a dying breed in the NBA and most of his modern player comparisons didn't last long in the league. It also doesn't help that he still looks uncomfortable in his body; I have a suspicion that he hasn't acclimated to his new weight yet, so his footwork and timing feel slightly off. I think his ceiling is likely Enes Kanter or maybe the 2017-2018 version of Dirk Nowitzki, assuming his body control and footwork improve.  He could also be in Europe in three years. Like I said, really tough to project even if everything goes perfectly for him."
"Well the Gulen thing is a fair thing to point out I suppose, but beyond that it's literally just that someone posted a tweet where he met Bolton and Kushner to discuss human rights during the Trump administration. Something Kanter has [routinely done on both sides of the aisle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/19/capitol-hill-officials-line-up-back-enes-kanter-nba-player-political-dissident/).   Other than that there's the failed ""purity test"" of supporting Israel and LeBron fans being mad."

"This was more about the NBA. It‚Äôs a news worthy thing now. Enes Kanter was finally put on all the major news stations, is bringing attention to massive issues of social justice, and the nba is absolutely silent. That‚Äôs very different than ‚ÄúAmericans care about Americans‚Äù. A big chunk of NBAs money comes from China"
"Umm obviously the entire country had time for BLM. They had months to talk, destroy, protest, change the league, everything. But won‚Äôt give Enes Kanter any airtime and purposefully shadow ban people trying to stand up. That‚Äôs very different than ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time‚Äù"
"Enes Kanter here who's keeps on criticizing LeBron and the NBA is pro Israel, why aren't you heckling him for not speaking out on social issues like that?"
nekmunnut: Enes Kanter (Nike) DNP
"I am well aware of everything surrounding that situation. he has been heavily criticized because  a) he wanted to avoid controversy because nba teams were guests in china for preseason  b) people ignored that he clarified that this was the reason for his comments, and he was not the person to talk about these issues. and finally  c) there are a lot of people here who only talk about lebron's ""stance"" on china to discredit the black lives matter movement within and outside the nba. blm is constantly mocked alongside misinformation surrounding the china ordeal. what makes it weirder is how differently other parties are treated. enes kanter for example has received support for his stance against the treatment of the uyghur peoples. Comments about his ""protecting all muslims"" stance disappearing in regards to the treatment of palestinian people is met with ""why can't someone be right on one issue and wrong on another?"" not only does kanter openly support fascist nutjobs, but all his public politics have been in bad faith. but people give him more wriggle room than lebron, who has objectively done more good and a lot less harm.  edit: since you don't follow the nba i think you might appreciate an article about the subject.

"Guys bust all the time though, it wouldn't be unprecedented. Truthfully, even if Chet's offensive game translates as well as we could hope, what do you think is the best case scenario for his career if he doesn't put on any weight? It'd be for different reasons, but it's not crazy to think he'd fall into a category with Marvin Bagley and Enes Kanter as productive offensive players who get pushed off the floor for their defense."
Enes Kanter is a moron and will remain a moron.  &amp;#x200B;  he may be right with what he s saying but he is an absolute imbecil.

"&gt;Kanter has made like 30M+ in the nba, very little he could do would be bad for business.  This isn't really a strong argument. Athletes always try to make more money as long as their bodies allow them to. What they've already had as income is not relevant because it's about maximizing profit because they know  they can retire at any moment. This is why Steph got the second supermax despite being well covered for multiple generations already. This is why the Brock Lesnars, the Roman Reigns haven't stopped wrestling even though they are settled for life. This is how the business work: maximize profit before my body, which is my source of income can't hold no more.  &gt;And he‚Äôs getting ppl on this sub talking about forced labor and the Uighur genocide that‚Äôs happening today. Most ppl don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs happening. So yes, he‚Äôs making some small difference.   I don't know if this is factually correct. The demographics do favor the youths here, but even then, China and its regime is brought around from time to time, even without this whole Enes thing. I'd say majority here already knew, since LeBeijing happened 2 years ago."

Comparing my criticism of Enes Kanter to Neo Nazi propaganda as if they‚Äôre anywhere in the same ballpark lmao   You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd side with the holocaust enablers is something sick.

Also just to let you know my relatives were lost in the fucking Holocaust you twisted presumptuous motherfucker  You‚Äôve won the award for dumbest take I‚Äôve heard thus far.

Yeah let's make fun of enes kanter for... talking about human rights.  Very cool.
"Enes Kanter dogwhistling against China as well as the media doing so actually does create more hate against Asian people though. The problem is that racists will make it about race, and they will attack Asians for it, regardless of if they're chinese or not.

"Can we just have a sticky ""BASED ENES"" thread for all the alt-right trolls? I'm tired of all these idiots brigading the sub every time Kanter posts something on twitter."
"[Enes Kanter is a mouthpiece for the most vile neoconservative war-mongers the world has to offer](https://twitter.com/eneskanter/status/1420790640024109056), and isn't doing shit besides ramping up war drums for western oligarchs."
"All I ask is that anyone who wants to make the tired ""well he met a Republican once so he must be a rightwinger"" post takes just a few minutes to read [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/19/capitol-hill-officials-line-up-back-enes-kanter-nba-player-political-dissident/) about the amount of time Kanter has actually spent meeting with both Democrats and Republicans at different levels of government.  He's not some scrub trying to throw people under the bus for relevance, and he's not just firing from the hip at random. Kanter gives a fuck about these causes and is forcing important conversations back into the spotlight. Republicans hate the majority of his social views, so he wouldn't have much of a home there in the first place."
If I wanted to see every Enes Kanter tweet I‚Äôd just follow him.
"&gt; I may have miscommunicated. I didn‚Äôt mean to say that the CCP put him there to have some sort of power over the NBA  You said; ""Joe Tsai is quite literally bought and owned from CCP. His acquisition of the team was another ‚Äústrengthening the league in China‚Äù move."":   The first part of that sentence is a very explicit statement that Joe Tsai is a CCP 'agent' or 'asset', or acts on the CCP's behalf. The most charitable interpretation of the second part of your sentence (that the league passively enjoyed a new of a Northern-American Asian owner) is undermined by the first part such that there is a clear implication that Joe Tsai buying and owning a sports team is inseparable to his status as some CCP puppet.  &gt; I want to let you know I consider myself a huge leftist  That's great - and wanting to challenge capitalism and oppression is a great impulse that I support. But I think it would help your ability to articulate those critiques if you tried to learn more about how the right-wing (including Enes Kanter) employs a specifically *racialised* critique of capitalism that seeks to spread xenophobia as much as it seeks to support domestic capitalism (by characterising systemic problems of capitalism as racial, foreign, or 'othered' qualities). Consider the obvious fascist argument that George Soros is a puppet of Israel and operates to spread a """"globalist"""" agenda. I'd hope you'd have a lot of alarm bells ringing when you hear something like that, and it's worth thinking *why* that is and what might be the overlaps between what you said about Joe Tsai (this is not me suggesting you're a fascist, just to be clear!).  When talking about this stuff it's worth stopping to consider if you are criticising capitalism - and if so is that clear, or if what you're writing or saying seems more concerned with *foreign* capitalism than with capitalism itself. That can sometimes be difficult, and it's a common difficult trope that appears *everywhere*. Consider depictions of cyberpunk or dystopian futuristic societies; who are the antagonistic corporations? Are they something like ""Johnson-Frank"", ""Build Co."", or obviously anglosphere names? Or are they Yutani, Ishanti or Arasaka? ([Here](https://www.wired.com/story/orientalism-cyberpunk-2077-yellow-peril-science-fiction/) is a decent read on this).  And beyond all that, consider whether the U.S. right-wing is a trustworthy advocate of human rights."
"Definitely a factor. ""Former NBA athlete Enes Kanter"" would not be dominating headlines like this. Hell, mods probably would have banned the posts by now."
So about the same production as Enes Kanter then?
"&gt;Friends with Jared Kushner and John Bolton  [Here is an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/19/capitol-hill-officials-line-up-back-enes-kanter-nba-player-political-dissident/) that namedrops like a dozen different, significant Democrat politicians Kanter has personally met with, and in one case introduced legislation with.   Him having met with Republicans in addition to Democrats does not make him the devil. But more than that, why would he not meet with Republicans about world politics when the Republicans were the ones in power?   So sick of reading this dumb narrative over and over. Y'all saw one tweet get posted on here, saw a name in it you didn't like, and tried to extrapolate the dude's entire worldview from it without taking three minutes to check Google. Despite the fact that he publicly compared Trump to Erdogan and sent Biden a gift when he got elected."
"I support what Enes is saying but I can‚Äôt help but find it a little hypocritical and performative. Westbrook, Kyrie, Durant and others have sneaker deals with Nike yet I haven‚Äôt seen Kanter single any of them out other than LeBron. Kyrie especially, with all of the misinformation he spreads and the civil rights activist image he tries to cultivate, seems like *the* player to call out if Kanter was really that passionate about the issue itself, but they‚Äôre tight so it doesn‚Äôt happen. Like how strong does he really feel about this and how much of it is him attacking big names he doesn‚Äôt like for clout? Shit just feels weird to me."
Enes Kanter is a CIA operative
Enes Kanter shitting on everyone for attention to set up a post NBA career is not pertinent to the NBA. Stop posting this shit and the mods need to delete it for violating rule #8.

"I walked threw the living room a couple days ago and my dad was watching MSNBC-- they were interviewing non other than Enes Kanter about the Uyghur situation. Kanter was asking influential companies to stop doing business in that part of China and asking for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics to send a message about the human rights situation  Most people watching MSNBC that day probably didn't know about Enes Kanter or his controversial beliefs/affiliations. They just saw an NBA player putting the spotlight on humans right issue. It cannot be overstated how important it is for someone--anyone-- to be talking about the Uyghurs during prime time on the national news. It's about getting the message out there, even if you don't 100% support the messenger"

"All the shit Harden used to get on defense came from that year or two where he literally didn't try.  The highlight video that came out of 2016 was legendary.   Dame tries.  That's not an issue(well actually has been a bit this year while he's carrying this load, but it isn't typically).  Lowe in his pod a couple weeks ago said he was below average but not terrible.  Have to keep in mind he's literally playing with Enes Kanter as his starting center, on a team where Carmelo is getting significant minutes."
"Yeah and Dame creates something from nothing more than anyone in the league lmao. Have you seen him in the clutch? No one comes close this year to what he's done there.   He's carrying a team down it's 2nd and 3rd best player to 21-14  Like seriously man, in what world should a team with **Enes Kanter** as the 2nd best player over the course of the year be 21-14?"
"The thing that bums me out the most was that Spurs vs Warriors was hyped up for three straight years and we could never quite hold up our end of the bargain:  2015: After our dominant championship, the Spurs slept-walked through most of the season, came on strong late as Kawhi got healthy and emerged as a stud, but we dropped from the 2 seed to the 6 seed on the last day because we lost like 6 winnable games throughout the season (DAE Portland 4th seed??). Lose in a first round series for the ages against the Lob City Clippers  2016: Win 67 games and Kawhi emerges as a bona fide MVP candidate, have a better net rating than the 73-win Warriors and have everybody saying ‚Äúthe WCF is the real finals this year.‚Äù Shit the bed against OKC because Steven Adams and Enes Kanter are mean while Tim Duncan lost his good knee, David West was old, and Boris Diaw was fat. Also that KD fella was pretty good.  2017: Kawhi‚Äôs still doing MVP-level shit and the Spurs win 60+ in B2B seasons for the first time in franchise history. Finally make it to the WCF to play the Warriors. Shit‚Äôs going groovy in the first half, and then Kawhi gets Zaza‚Äôd. Spurs play it cautious with his health and hold him out for the series, get swept. Then we basically never see him again lol"
"woah come on now guys. LA at this point is much more of a 5 than a 4 who can provide an interior defensive presence, at least more so than Kanter (not shots at Enes, he's made improvements defensively!)  plus unlike Melo, LA can work in a Dame pnr. Both players are undoubtedly washed but LA could contribute in a much more team oriented role than Melo, who outside of spot up shooting adds little value."
He probably doesn't love Denver for [this incident](https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/05/this-is-hurtful-enes-kanter-responds-to-abusive-nuggets-fan-who-yelled-go-back-to-turkey-oh-wait-you-cant.html).
"Enes Kanter is another that fans spoke into existence. I don't think this will happen this season though and for a reason people have ignored. This will trigger the repeater tax for us unless we can ship out about 10M the other way. If we don't, we get at least three more years after this before getting into the repeater. I'll leave the cap whiz stuff to other people but that's not easy without including one of our 3 Cs and big 4."
"Oof, I disagree. See Enes Kanter."
Much rather have Enes Kanter.
"&gt;even with this supporting cast.  This supporting cast, which is better than Dame's right now man. That's my point. Steph has a worse record despite a better team.  Our 2nd best player this season has been Enes fucking Kanter lol.  &gt;Dame hasn‚Äôt had terrible teams lol  You sure about that man? Because you're talking about how bad this Warriors team is, yet it's significantly better than Dame this year and especially his team last year  For example, did you know that Bazemore was our primary SF for the majority of last season?   The team was so bad that despite shooting 34.7% from the field and 32.7% from 3, he was playing **26 minutes a game**.  Despite supposedly being a much worse roster than what Dame's dealt with, y'all can only find 17 minutes a game for him, even with him shooting the lights out from the field and from 3  &gt;If anything playing with great players means it shouldn‚Äôt be as impactful when he sit  ...??? That's not how it works lmao. The Warriors don't stagger. If all your main guys play together, then all sit at the same time, you have massive swings in your on/off stats (ie, what Draymond and Curry are doing this year). Meanwhile the Blazers generally sit CJ while Dame is playing for a good chunk so that they can play CJ for every single minute Dame isn't out there.    &gt;d he‚Äôs a negative offensively if the ball isn‚Äôt in his hands  Because Curry depends on him desperately and his shooting stats fall off a cliff without him this year"
Is Enes Kanter considered a rebounding specialist?
"Robin Lopez, Channing Frye, Enes Kanter before his return"
"Joel ""the thrilla"" Pryzbilla is a Portland cult hero. Others are Robin Lopez, Enes Kanter before this season, and Steve Blake"
Well with the Rockets he was a terrible defender and basically just rebounded. You can get guys like Dwayne Dedmond and Enes Kanter who do that just as well and more. Dario Saric this year and he at his peak have similar rebounding numbers.
"Honest opinion. Vogel did bench him for his effort and overall terrible D at one point. He's decent at protecting the rim but has 0 perimeter D. He will have to play drop down D and will be a liability against portland, golden state, or any team thats deadly shooting off of screens. But he is one of the best rebounders in the league and one of the best rebounders in our franchises history. Basically enes kanter in his prime, but with a silky wet jumper that hits from everywhere."
"Noted high flyer Enes Kanter actually has a 69"" vertical."
"WCF starting Enes Kanter, and Meyers Leonard as the backup C‚Ä¶"

Just a LeBron lead team? So another HOF player with a claim to GOAT. Ok, I didn‚Äôt know anyone had Dame at that level of expectations."

I think our defense is going to be better this year by default because Hassan Whiteside/Enes Kanter won‚Äôt starting for us for most of the year like the last two years
"This article affirmed my previous suspicion, I‚Äôd rather hang out with Enes Kanter than Kyrie Irving."
"&gt;Enes Kanter ‚Äî the veteran center, devout Muslim and outspoken liberal ‚Äî senses a creep of the religious right upon his workplace, which just happens to involve players like Isaac sweating all over him and yelling in his face: ‚ÄúIf a guy‚Äôs not getting vaccinated because of his religion, I feel like we are in a time where the religion and science has to go to together,‚Äù he tells¬†RS. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked to a lot of religious guys ‚Äî I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄòIt saves people‚Äôs lives, so what is more important than that?‚Äô‚Äù   Give Kanter Kyrie's position at the NBPA"
"Oh look, it's alt-right figurehead and mouth piece Enes Kanter."
"Enes Kanter is like the Hasanabi of the league, mega douche larping as a political activist by just talking a whole lot of obvious progressive talking points and not really doing anything.. seems like dude is just fiending for quick attention and his shoddy history doesn‚Äôt prove that he really cares about these things beyond the attention they give him for saying them."
"That's ridiculous. This idea that hypocrisy, even when you are forced to commit such hypocrisy due to it being a pre-requisite of you having to do your job, which you have worked your whole life for, should mean your original point is void, is frankly just immature. Enes Kanter wearing nike because he has to to perform his job is not evidence of his moral compass, you're just making a ridiculous request of him."
"No, the guy who said ""emprisonment"" doesn't have sources for his slander.  It should only take a few seconds of critical thought to eliminate the possibility that Enes Kanter wants Palestinian people wrongfully imprisoned, which is the implication here, and yet this persists in every thread about the guy.   I'm gonna say the man loudly talking about human rights abuses in places where such comments can have real and negative consequences for the speaker probably doesn't think that human rights abuses elsewhere are acceptable.   Maybe it's just me though, and Enes Kanter, a pro athlete with 0 to gain from all of this, is a cynical mother fucker trying to distract from the truly bad stuff that he supports.  But I doubt that. I really doubt that."
Enes Kanter vs China... Enes is gonna go missing one day.
Enes Kanter is lame as hell carry on
If Enes Kanter goes to China and shoots a basketball into a hoop it will free all citizens of oppression
Enes Kanter
"&gt;supporting a guy who is just the other side of the same dickhead coin.  Facts: Gulen was basically just Erdogan with a desire to fight Erdogan's corruption. Came from the same party, basically support the same things.  Meaning: currently, Enes Kanter supports a candidate accused of being against the peace process with the Kurds, an ethnic minority in his home country who live under some serious persecution and resort to terrorism, while supporting a human rights argument regarding the Uighurs, an ethnic minority in China who live under some serious persecution and resort to terrorism.   I think the man's gotta look in the mirror at some point with this discrepancy, at least you'd hope."
It‚Äôs a shame this comment will be lost in a thread about Enes Kanter
"&gt;If we should take a holistic view of LeBron's positions and non-positions, shouldn't we also do the same with Kanter?  ...just piling onto your point. It *shouldn't* be a holistic view of anyone's positions. There's this growing concept that someone must align with us on *everything* in order for us to accept their word on *anything* and it's a destructive mindset. It's okay to agree with Enes on one subject and with LeBron on another. It's also okay to agree with Enes' criticism of LeBron while disagreeing with his stance on Turkish/Palestinian politics."
"Not really, no.  Nothing Enes Kanter says on Twitter will convince Xi Jinping to change China‚Äôs stance on labour   The only way for that to happen would be for our country to embargo all products made in China via slave labour  And good luck with that üëç"
I support Enes Kanter and all of his social Justice pursuits but can we pls stop spamming this sub with his tweets. We get it bro
There was a time when the thing I knew most about Enes Kanter was how Jazz fans would chant ‚Äúpenis cancer‚Äù after he left them and the Thunder came to town. (I don‚Äôt condone that either). Now this guy is the most vocal social voice of the NBA.
"Chinese bad, John Boldon good  - Enes Kanter, probably"
Here's your daily dose of CIA sponsored propaganda brought to you by aspiring shill Enes Kanter.
Daily Enes Kanter circlejerk thread.
"What if I just don't care very much about Enes Kanter randomly deciding that this was the hill he wanted to die on and suddenly he won't shut up about it?  I also thinks it's important to understand what is realistically possible in this situation as well.  Should we condemn human rights abuses in China and use what leverage we have to try to get the PRC to clean up it's act?   Absolutely.   Should we advocate for Tibetan or Hong Kong independence?   No, it is complete waste of time. Beijing views those territories as integral parts of China,  there is no room for negotiation and no discussion to be had.   Giving a speech next to a Tibetan independence and East Turkistan flag just makes oneself look like a delusional fool who doesn't actually understand the situation he won't shut up about."
"Yes it is me, Enes Kanter. Lol."
I remember watching Black Ops 1 leaked gameplay when i found out Enes Kanter dropped 30 points at some rookie showcase
"I did some back-of-the-envelope math. Nike has paid $625M in the past 5 years for that deal. Total NBA revenue in that timespan is about $40B, maybe up to $44B.  So about 1.4-1.5% of every dollar earned (by the players and owners) comes directly from Nike. Enes Kanter has earned about $57M in that time so he can count over $800,000 in his bank account from Nike."
Nike pays the NBA $125M/year for their NBA apparel deal.   That means each owner - after the players get their 50% cut - receives $2M directly from Nike.   It also means that approximately 1.3% of all player earnings since 2017-18 have come directly from that Nike deal. Enes Kanter has made $57 million in that timespan.
Ok? So you have successfully proven that Lebron is a hypocrite?  How does that help the slaves in China?   Also the last person who should be talking about hypocrisy is Enes Kanter.
"Enes Kanter: ""Charania too scared to tweet about Uyghurs getting killed"""
"dawg wtf is wrong with him...  Are we really going to start hating on LeBron because he doesn't champion the cause you care about?   Everyone can play that game.....Why does Enes Kanter not care about the children mining rare earth minerals used to make the phone Kanter tweets from?  Why does Kanter say nothing about the Tigray conflict?  Why does Kanter say nothing about the Amazon forest disappearing?   Lastly when was the last time Kanter checked the label on a Nike product because most of it says ""Made in Egypt"" or a South East asian country now...  Kanter you still living in 2000s. Stuff that companies like Nike make get outsourced to third world countries, not China."
Doesn‚Äôt Enes Kanter usually wear Nike shoes?
"literally anybody can ""speak truth to power"" lol, it's just a verbal action, nobody said Enes Kanter is a pillar of morality for this, just that he's right, and the only player standing up for this. It kinda seems like you just wanted to call somebody cringe bc it's just the reddit thing to do lol"
"We shouldn‚Äôt be defending him? Ok, well then perhaps we shouldn‚Äôt be attacking him either. Which is exactly what Kanter‚Äôs dumbass is doing. Maybe instead of arguing about Lebron James we should be going after China? You know‚Ä¶the people actually responsible for the slave labour?  So no, I don‚Äôt ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù Enes Kanter for making these tweets. In fact I think Enes Kanter should honestly shut the hell up. Not only is he a huge hypocrite, his ‚ÄúTwitter Activism‚Äù is going to be used to invalidate the BLM Movement while also doing absolutely nothing to address the slave labour in China he apparently cares so much about.   NOTHING good is gonna come out of these Twitter rants."
Well obviously Lebron isn‚Äôt gonna care about slave labour in China as much as he does about police brutality against African Americans.   It feels foolish to me to expect that from him and to hold that against him.   I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inherently wrong at all for someone to be allowed to pick and choose which social causes to invest themselves into personally. Just because he supports one cause doesn‚Äôt mean he needs to denounce every single human atrocity in the world.   Calling Lebron names on Twitter isn‚Äôt gonna do shit for China. All this really does imo is give fuel for the people who wish to invalidate the genuine good that Lebron has done for social justice in America. There‚Äôs a reason why Enes Kanter is suddenly Fox News‚Äô favorite NBA player.
I have a feeling that Enes Kanter won‚Äôt be playing for the Lakers this year
Enes Kanter a real one
[Grant Williams asking Enes Kanter if he farted on the bench](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ie7htx/grant_williams_asking_enes_kanter_if_he_farted_on/)
"&gt;Sad &amp; disgusting how these athletes pretend they care about social justice  r/NBA is just eating up Enes Kanter yelling ""All Lives Matter"" at black basketball players every day."
Celtics essentially replaced Enes Kanter with him when they picked him up so that‚Äôs a W in my book
Enes Kanter
Enes Kanter is such a cornball. That dude has always annoyed me.
way more relevant than Enes Kanter and funny accents
"I honestly can't tell if you're trolling.  If you are, good work.  If you're not, I just assume you're using the word ""popular"" to mean ""highest ratio of time spent discussed by sports commentators per minute spent on the court"", in which case Ben Simmons and Enes Kanter should be included as well."
"It happens within the fans too. Totally understandable to shit on Karl Malone as a person, but many can\`t get past that and can't recognize what a great player he was. I've seen in on this sub constantly with players like Derrick Rose, Terrance Davis, Malik Beasley and more recently Enes Kanter."
So deflating. Every time he hits one of these I can still see Enes Kanter questioning existence after the OKC shot
nba said fuck enes kanter
"PG Elfrid Payton   SG Tim Hardaway Jr.   SF Carmelo Anthony   PF Marcus Morris   C Kristaps Porzingis  Bench: Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott, Bobby Portis, Reggie Bullock, Justin Holiday, Wayne Ellington, DeAndre Jordan, Austin Rivers  I knew we would be bad but yikes"
How does Kanter get to take the and-1 FT from Tatum's 3. Okoro didn't even foul Tatum he fouled enes. Shouldn't it be 2 shots for enes or 3 for Tatum or they get the ball out of bounds.
Enes Kanter sighting
Could the CIA not do any better than Enes Kanter lmao. Could they not target someone who actually plays? Seems much more likely he knows his career is almost over and wants to make one last splash.
"""doing their research"" lol  Dwights one of the best defenders of all time, but Jokic is one of the best offensive players of all time, just because Jokic's team didnt lead the league in ORTG doesn't mean he wasn't the best offensive player.   Dwight led the league in DRTG because he was an all time defender and had a solid defensive supporting cast. If Dwight went off the court and was replaced with Enes Kanter do you think the Magic would have led the league in DRTG? No, but that wouldn't be Dwights fault.  Last year the Nuggets had a 121.5 ORTG with Jokic out there and a a 107.8 ORTG without him. No they did not lead the league in ORTG, but that hardly invalidates Jokic's impact"
"[I think he might be referencing this, not Ime](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/ahnfiredigital.com/nba/celtics/enes-kanter-says-2-nba-officials-begged-him-to-take-off-his-free-tibet-sneakers/amp/)"
I‚Äôm a Enes Kanter fan and I support him and all his public stances but enough with his tweets taking up the top of this sub everyday man üò≠
"You just **know** that like Kaepernick, his supporters who don't even follow the sport are going to point at select stats as evidence that he's being silenced. Especially because Kanter posts pretty gaudy counting stats.  *""Enes Kanter averaged 17/16 per 36 last season! With a 22.4 PER and .636 TS%!""*  ... while completely ignoring the fact that Portland finished 29th in defensive rating last year, that Kanter could only get a league minimum contract this offseason, and how he is completely useless anywhere outside of the restricted area."
"yea it makes no sense. why sign him and then say ""oh he doesn't fit anything we are trying to do here basketball-wise""? anybody who has heard the name enes kanter knows he is a defensive liability."
"Yep and that‚Äôs okay. I think the guy is asking left leaning media and those who have public influence, including nba players or celebrities, to speak out about it. If instead of right wing Enes Kanter speaking about it we had left leaning Steve Kerr or Lebron James speak about it everyone would be more inclined to either do something or at least bring more awareness.   I agree with all your points of course that people use a bad thing to virtue signal and pretend that just because they‚Äôre shining a light on evil all their own evils are some how not bad as well."
"Kanter lowkey pulling a Kaepernick. Wasn't getting much playtime, might as well start calling out the league since you got the free time. At the very least, he is bringing attention to some real shit going on with China, Taiwan, etc. Just like how Kaepernick was bringing attention to some real shit going on with racism and police brutality in the US.  That aside, Enes has to be real with himself on this. He wasn't getting playtime cause he's boo-boo. Defense is not good, one trick pony offensively. Sure he'll can possibly average 10 and 10 a night, but he'll also allow the other team to score 15-20pts when he's playing center. That's more of the reason as to why he's not getting playtime than him talking about China's injustices."
Enes Kanter will never be an elected official.
"The problem is that nobody really cares what Enes Kanter says. Lebron, Nike, and the NBA in general are much larger entities who make a lot of money in China. Kanter knows that he wont have much of an affect on China or the NBA's stance on dealing with China, so he wants those in power to do it. He is not misguided.  And to be clear, the Chinese government (not people) IS a monster and American companies and celebrities do business with it because it has over a billion people despite knowing how atrocious they are."
"Enes Kanter is well and truly fucking insufferable. To be all 'WAAH CHINA"" while openly supporting Israel is hella dissonant. Plus, now he's the right's version of Kaepernick"
"Ah yes because everyone should look to Enes Kanter, friend of Jared Kushner and John Bolton for their awareness on human rights. He‚Äôs annoying and trying to push shoes too! The hypocrisy of trying to call out LeBron and Nike when he‚Äôs trying to sell his shitty shoes is hilarious."
Our frontcourt was worse defensively than our backcourt that 2019 series man  I dare you to find a worse defensive center rotation in NBA history than Enes Kanter/Meyers Leonard  That's why we got lit up. Who plays drop coverage against Steph?
"sorry, gotta make room for more Enes Kanter tweets"
enes kanter used take a stand  it's not very effective...
Enes Kanter is doing this for clout lmao
Still more about basketball than posting enes kanter quotes every single day

"Enes ""I now work for the CIA"" Kanter"
"Woah woah woah I must be real out of the loop. What did Enes Kanter do? Also, why is the sentiment here so pro-China all of the sudden?"
Exactly. Does Enes really think tweeting is him doing his part? Get off the internet and actually try to do something about it if you are so passionate about it kanter.
"Yeah because the Knicks have definitely been known to take big talents from small teams the last 10 years‚Ä¶ like Bargnani, Dennis Smith Jr and‚Ä¶. Enes Kanter??? The last big trade we had was Melo over 10 years ago."

Enes Kanter try bring back world peace dude
Wait til Enes Kanter finds out where they be gettin them shin bones üò≥
Yeah he is but he‚Äôs also a late bloomer. He‚Äôs already improved a lot from Year 1 and has even more potential. I mean everyone said he would be a Enes Kanter level defender but he‚Äôs been actually solid on defense this season.
Enes Kanter while right most of the time loves the attention hes getting. I saw him on CNN and he could barely keep a grin off of his face

"Enes Kanter doesn't play much either, and gets shut down during the playoffs"
can I introduce you to enes kanter my friend
If I‚Äôm honest I hated Enes Kanter with a passion in the mid 10s. Every time my C my player would go up against him. He‚Äôd always somehow out rebound me and draw charges against me.
i will not openly support or agree with  anything enes kanter says because i dont like his face
I want Enes Kanter to only sign 1 year deals between the Blazers and the Celtics for the rest of his career
Enes Kanter kinda sucks at basketball and therefore I don't take him seriously on social issues.
I hope everyone has a lovely time at the Beijing Olympics just so Enes Kanter can cry about it.
I genuinely hope the Nuggets never win anything after their standings manipulation in 2018. They got way too much of a pass for losing to the Blazers with Enes Kanter as their starting C and Dame not playing all that well. They‚Äôre forever pretenders in my book  Anything they did in the bubble was luck idc
"Honestly, I'm just tired of hearing about Enes Kanter. Dude getting more attention than the actual issues... If he believes he missed his vocation, by all means drop the basketball and go make a difference. Taking on MJ in the media won't do much for anyone, really. Fighting for Uighurs from the comfort of the USA is better than not doing anything, but if you're so passionate about it, go advocate.   Maya Moore left basketball to free a wrongfully convicted man from jail. Not a global issue, but one she could and chose to influence. That's amazing and not nearly talked about as much as Enes Kanter."
Enes Kanter wants attention
LeBron beat Stewart like a Nike slave. -- Enes Kanter
I‚Äôm just tryna figure what Enes Kanter has ever done for any community other than the community of Lebron haters by giving them edgy tweets to circlejerk to
Yeah I know. I don't get your point though? What's that got to do with me or my post? You know I'm not actually enes kanter right?
"So why isn‚Äôt LeBron allowed to be focused on his own community if Enes Kanter is, by your words?"

Enes Kanter knows his play will never make headlines so now he‚Äôs gotta resort to this? What a clown
Alright it's time to set up an Enes Kanter filter.
Anyways Enes Kanter isn't black so I don't think it's his place to judge what someone has done for the black community.
hmmm maybe someone from the turkish-american community should highlight what enes kanter has done for them &amp; that might give michael jordan some ideas for the black community then
The Israel supporter Enes Kanter lol
"I think one of the difficulties you encounter is that Bron has had such a long career, that even if these came up at a below average rate, you are still left with a high amount of incidents.  You also need to take into account 'dirty' plays that he is on the receiving end of.  In total, I think there is only a handful of genuinely dirty players (ones that come MY mind: Zaza, Pat Bev, Ron Artest, Bruce Bowen). And the ones that get accused: Russell Westbrook, Enes Kanter, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo... I think they get involved in a couple of hairy instances and people make the jump. People were calling Dellavedova dirty back in 2015."
He's half joking. Like it or not but some of the black community prefer light skinned black folks. Hell there is even a novel about it (among others) called the bluest eye where african americans deal with their own racism with regards towards lightskinned being beautiful.  Gil's post is a meta joke/commentary about superstar treatment in the NBA and fake machismo.   The lightskinned bit is a callout towards his colorist remarks towards Lupita.   The gun bit is his own incident with crittenton.   Rondo and Cp3's beef is on the nose and obvious.   Pippen's issues with the last dance is obvious as well.  Enes Kanter bit was Erdogan cracking down on the Gulen supporters with a shade towards Bron's sway with the NBA (which Gil's joke was the real reason why Erdogan is after Kanter's ass).  Vanessa Bryant was because the academy dropped Mamba from its name because of Respect for Kobe (supposedly).

"Stotts would be fantastic for them honestly. Still feel he got unfairly scapegoated, even when he got that team to a WCF.  The defense was bad last year, but that‚Äôs more on Olshey for constructing a roster that required him to play Carmelo and Enes Kanter next to Dame and CJ for heavy minutes. No coach can make that work on defense.  When he had Aminu/Harkless and Nurkic next to Dame/CJ, the Blazers had a really good defense."
Enes Kanter
"Hey Enes ""Gulen is actually really cool' Kanter- What about the regime you support moving actual residents out of their homes?   oh i'm sorry, Lebong bad, nike bad, but israel actually good and cool and based. Got it"
Ok. Which one do you think me you and enes kanter have a better chance of changing?
Go around the internet and you can find a bunch of them bashing Enes Kanter for his criticism of LeBron's support for China's regime b/c apparently it will hurt LeBron's feelings.   I wish I were joking. But such is the LeBron stannery.
Imagine if Enes Kanter started dissing Kobe for having a long partnership with Nike
Daily reminder that Enes Kanter wears Nike shoes
"It's honestly fucking incredible the people in this thread calling Kanter a coward and a clout chaser  He's literally an enemy of his own country. His life and the life of his family are constantly under threat by Erdogan. Enes is speaking on a massive fucking platform, so much more vocally than anyone else. But that gets lost on all these Americans because we're too coddled to believe there's actual evil people out there trying to hunt down people like Kanter.  The moment he sets foot in the wrong country, he'll be in cuffs.  He's so incredibly far from being a coward. He's brave, and I respect the fuck out of him."

I don‚Äôt have an issue with what Bron said. I don‚Äôt have an issue with Enes. The simple reason as to why Enes Kanter walked past Bron is simply because he has little to no respect for him as a man
"&gt;Enes has the history of coddling up with right wing chuds.   You people are such lazy liars lol.

He's been very publicly pro-BLM, pro-LGBTQ, pro-pretty much everything the left likes except Israel. He compared Trump to Erdogan and sent Biden a gift in addition to publicly celebrating his election.  Stop trying to craft fake narratives."
"What exactly is LeBron supposed to do? Even if he spoke to Kanter, Enes is acting like Lebron has the power to change Geopolitical relations in a foreign country. I‚Äôm not sure what he wants from LeBron exactly."
It sort of does though. Like why should we care about something Enes Kanter is telling us is a big deal when his own actions tell us it's actually not that big of a deal to him?
"Who cares how genuine kanter is when hes calling some evil fuckers? What bigger impact is going to make than publicly calling out lebron? You think he would ever have a conversation about the slave labour lebron uses to make a greater profit that lebron hasn't had before? That it's up to kanter to expose the disgusting scene behind the curtain, and not on lebron to make sure hes 1. Not signing with a company that exploits their workers and 2. And that the company continues to not use slave labour to boost profits.   Why do you think lebron is so na√Øve and stupid that he has no idea about any of this. Why would enes kanter have better insight into the slave labour that lebron profits off of?   Stop letting slave labour lebron off so easily just to deflect and throw doubt at kanter for doing the right thing, properly motivated or not."
"Enes isn‚Äôt wrong targeting LeBron for his criticisms. Bron is one of Nikes premier athletes and has a voice they‚Äôd more likely listen to. Him calling out LeBron for his hypocrisy is valid. Him walking past LeBron is indicative of how little he respects LeBron as well. Call it corny or whatever but thats the reason. Besides, was Enes and Bron bout to have a 5 minute discussion on China worker laws and slavery going on over there then go play a game? All this, ‚Äúits not a good look for Kanter‚Äù really doesn‚Äôt matter because his point still remains"

"This thread is obviously inspired by Kanter. Funny thing is Kanter had an opportunity to talk to LeBron and educate him on his views yesterday. What did Enes the Penis do? He walked by him like a little bitch and didn‚Äôt say a fucking thing.   Enes Kanter is a guy who stands up for human rights, but he too does it in a self serving way. I may not like him personally but at least I can acknowledge that he and LeBron are both making a positive impact on society."
"Enes Kanter is in a cult. He does the most popular thing to get attention and to recuit more people to Gulen cult. It is like scientology but much more dangerous because they literally try to take over Turkey by force. I am not an Erdoƒüan supporter and he was the one who helped Gulen cult to get this powerful in the first place and after they had a dispute over money, Erdoƒüan tried to cut of Gulen cult and he responded by a coup which failed. Everybody in Turkey agrees with these facts. If you meet someone who does not agree with that, you probably met a Gulenist. Which Kanter is. He even changed his last name to Gulen. So Fuck him."
better than getting Kyle Rittenhouse or Enes Kanter types of articles.
One Enes Kanter coming up
"Enes Kanter on who's better, him or LeBron James: ""I don't compare myself with anybody."" Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of John Bolton. ""I'll let you interpret that however you want,"" Kanter said."
"No, we're talking about Enes Kanter (vs LeBron) lmao. Let's not pretend like this is actually bringing about any meaningful conversations and awareness about what's happening to Uyghur Muslims."
Yeah I think he just doesn‚Äôt fuck with Lebron. You think Enes ‚ÄúI got an entire country with shooters after me‚Äù Kanter is afraid of Lebron James? Hell no.
"We are talking about why Enes is a hypocrite. I provided multiple examples as to why he is a hypocrite. Pls defend why he wears Nike gear off court. Pls defend why he supports other atrocities, but is against certain ones that fit his agenda. Do you just see the world as black and white?  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2807252-enes-kanter-criticism-of-turkish-government-preventing-nike-endorsement-deal  Why was he mad at Nike for not sponsoring him? Another example of him being a hypocrite."
&gt; I‚Äôm sure Kanter had 2 minutes to spare to invite him &amp; Nike to a slave camp again  Let's imagine LeBron telling that story on The Shop about Enes Kanter confronting him about Nike slave camps at an NBA arena before or after a game. Do you redditors hear yourselves?
"He's really saying he wanted Kanter to confront him about China before an NBA game.  As if that scenario wouldn't be 100x worse. Imagine that story. ""Then Enes Kanter walked up to me before an NBA game to confront me about Chinese slavery."" Absolutely absurd. Why are redditors agreeing with LeBron that this should have happened?"
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2807252-enes-kanter-criticism-of-turkish-government-preventing-nike-endorsement-deal  He is salty he didn't get a Nike deal. He's also wears Nike.
"LeBron would just take a few minutes to explain to Kanter that Mao was a necessary transitory leader whose phase unified China after the warlord period and the civil war against the hated nationalists. He would say that in later years Mao got bad advice about agricultural policy, or even that he thought with his dick. But Mao was a CILF, says LeBron, and Enes should understand why he takes it to be a complement.  But he would offer to get some literature for Enes, as understanding Mao Zedong-Thought is a necessary precursor to grokking Xi Jinping-Thought. He would tell Enes that he has a duty to him as a teacher does to a student, but that Enes in turn must commit himself the way the drummers at the 08 Beijing Olympic opening ceremony did."
Lebron has dedicated 0 thoughts to Enes Kanter
"He‚Äôs saying Enes Kanter is a pathetic little bitch who wants attention from the media, not justice for Uighurs, so stop giving him your attention.  Any man who will talk all this shit in the media about another man but walks past him with his head held low instead of confronting about it in person is a coward and a bitch, a punk who wants attention not an organizer trying to bring awareness."
"Enes Kanter is the worst player on his team and most likely won‚Äôt be in the league after his contract is up so he‚Äôs not actually risking much. He may be raising awareness which is great, but he still reps Nike every game.  And they were in the same building after the game too so that argument doesn‚Äôt track."
"So basically, you call out the president and the media but not China? But I am asking if there‚Äôs anything new or recent with China. Why wasn‚Äôt this said years ago? Or is it just Enes Kanter trying to make headlines since he‚Äôs always talking shit about politics"
"Because he's a billionaire whose success means he doesn't have to listen to Kanter at all if there's no media/public pressure. And knowing what I've seen and heard about each of them, I don't think LeBron would change anything that Enes told him to."
He doesn't genuinely care about bringing awareness.  My entire point is keep that same energy when you're actually around someone. Enes Kanter would be a bitch for this no matter who he was calling out.
"Kanter got intimidated. Lebron just exudes big dick energy and especially in that cramped hallway, you have this 260 pounds, 6'8"" man walking towards you, arguably the GOAT, I'm not surprised Enes KANT talk to him and sheepishly just walked past him."
"I don't give a shit about ""what it would accomplish,"" it's about Enes Kanter being a coward by insulting LeBron through the media instead of to his face. If he has a problem, he can bring it to him; but Enes is just piggybacking off LeBron for surface-level attention.  Don't talk about another man to the media if you're radio silent when you're in the same room as him. That's basic fucking principle, but I forgot most of r/nba are a bunch of college aged kids that are used to just talking shit on the internet with no real life confrontation."
His point is that Enes Kanter should leave his name out of his mouth if he's not even going to talk to him directly. LeBron's not the one bringing up Kanter's name repeatedly for right wing brownie points.
"Why is Enes Kanter calling LeBron out through the press instead of talking to him directly when given the chance? We already know the answer, of course."
"""Enes should talk to him man to man"" What do you guys who say this think LeBron would change about Nike after a conversation with Kanter? If he wants change, this is Kanter's best path"
Because ENes Kanter has been calling LeBron out for weeks? Do y'all just have selective readinf or something?
Yeah what exactly are people thinking LeBron would change about his lifetime billion dollar Nike partnership in any private conversation with Enes Kanter?
Maybe Enes Kanter should also denounce multiple sclerosis too because it‚Äôs ruined so many lives   God I swear bozos like you who use the most pathetic tropes lack the critical thinking skills of a 5th grader

"He once wore white Jordan's that said ""modern day slavery"" and ""hypocrite Nike"" with red splatters on them  [https://www.google.com/search?q=enes+kanter+blood+splatter+shoes&amp;source=ln](https://www.google.com/search?q=enes+kanter+blood+splatter+shoes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOgdm_lqb0AhURRDABHcV6DHUQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=736&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=KdT5nWfolh8gvM)  Jordan is owned by Nike."
"This is disconnected from the right wing part of it all. The right doesn't like China because the virus that originated in Wuhan, China made Donald Trump look inept with his pandemic response and lost him the election.   They also hate LeBron James because he kept talking about BLM.  People on the right are just using Enes Kanter as a useful tool to criticize LeBron and China for reasons other than the human right abuses, which they don't care about.  The actual valid criticism of LeBron using slave labor to make his sneakers is a separate thing from the right wing component of this if that makes sense."
"The US military has wrecked so many nations, Enes kanter should denounce America too if he actually gave a shit, which he obviously doesn't"
"Kanter wouldn‚Äôt talk to him without it being publicized because he doesn‚Äôt actually care about this. Y‚Äôall really eat it up, nobody gives a shit about kanter if it weren‚Äôt for this.. I saw an article from this year referring to ‚Äúnba star enes kanter‚Äù baha"
When Enes fucking Kanter hit that LeFuckYou 3 I was out screaming at my window and got a noise complaint
"LeChina 0 -1 Enes ""Patriot"" Kanter"
CHINA BTFO BY ENES ‚ÄúSTEPH CURRY‚Äù KANTER
ENES KANTER +21  LEBRON -4
Did Enes Kanter just hit a 3
Wheres Enes Kanter?
"Man. Every time I try to go back to enjoying basketball and the NBA, someone has to open their mouth and drive me away. This Indiana boy just wants to watch some basketball in peace. Can we please just leave the woke politics out of the game? I don‚Äôt care what Steve Kerr has to say. I don‚Äôt care what Lebron thinks. I am not interested in what causes Enes Kanter supports. I don‚Äôt care what Kyrie chooses to inject himself with. I just want basketball."
"""I'll show you a clear path to the Chinese slavery camps making your shoes LeBron!""  \-Enes Kanter (probably)"
Making Bill Russell watch Enes Kanter is a war crime.
"Enes Kanter be checking in so he can post up on LeBron and be like ""Did you see my tweet lol"""
I‚Äôm not understanding why Enes Kanter wears the Nike jersey when he plays??
"\*Enes Kanter consistently plays horrible\*  Also Enes Kanter: ""The celtics don't play me because I hate China"""
What does Enes Kanter say?
LeBron James vs. Enes Kanter @ halftime..who ya'll got?
"Yeah, no  Im not gonna let y‚Äôall act like Enes Kanter and Fox News have the moral high ground"
Enes Kanter used to be chill but now he‚Äôs just a loud mouth piece. Annoying dude
THATS MY ENES KANTER ALWAYS A THUNDER
Fuck Enes Kanter
"This tells me you have never had to watch Whiteside play for an extended period of time. Whiteside would be 5 times the defensive player he is (which is to say, average) if he didn‚Äôt chase blocks. Constantly out of position try to block shots and giving up easy layups. Dude gave up an easy bucket trying to block a three from Enes fucking Kanter."
"Okay, so now I'm googling ""Enes Kanter John Bolton"" and I see they meet once in July. Yeah, John Bolton is a piece of shit. ""Literally hangs out"" seems excessive, unless you're telling me they've met more than one time.  I'm really not here defending Kanter from supporting Israel, because I still don't really know what his thoughts are on it, but if you think you've made the case that ""the guy is so obviously pro-Israel,"" then I'm not sure what to tell you. You haven't made that case at all. You've provided one meeting with one piece of shit, and he says they talked about Turkey."
"bro he literally hangs out with Likud members and Jon Bolton. ACTIONS speak louder than words. Do you really need a quote like ""I'm Enes Kanter and this is what I believe...""?  The guy is so obviously pro-Israel, which means that he supports the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, since thats Israel's entire national project."
"His opinions about Israel? Or Palestine? Or Jews? I Google ""Enes Kanter Jews"" and ""Enes Kanter Israel"" and ""Enes Kanter Palestine"" and all that comes up is that he tweeted support for Jews (note: not Israel), he had a basketball camp for Muslims, Jews, and Arabs, and he wants to educate his fellow Muslims about the Holocaust.  If you're saying that he said actual pro Israel and actual anti Palestine things, then it would be great if you could drop some links or just anything that I can Google and fact check for you since you seem opposed to saying anything specific."
"I quit being a professor to go to medical school and become a medical doctor because I decided that lecturing people about social issues was hypocritical when I had absolutely 0 political power to change things.  Now I get to make a tangible difference in people lives who have been left behind by their failed state on a daily basis.  If you actually read my comment you'd probably be able to tell that my point was that LeBron has as much power to change things in China as you or I do, and that focusing on lambasting celebrities instead of policy makers is exactly what they want you to do in times of creeping authoritarianism.  LeBron has done more **as an individual** to change his community than any one random celebrity I can think of off the top of my head. What do you want from him? Did you want him to fly into Hong Kong and protest in the streets? Did you do that? Him and Morey both shared their opinions on social media. Thats all that happened.  The situation in Hong Kong fucking sucks, and it was terrible, but why the fuck are you talking about it in the context of LeBron James and Enes Kanter instead of the absolute dumbassery of the way that the UK handled the transition of power back to Hong Kong? Sorry that LeBron didn't virtue signal in the exact way that you wanted him to.  The fact that you're conflating my comment about propaganda with tangible accountability for government systems is literally performative of what I was talking about in my original comment."
"I'll take the time to provide a coherent response to this.  Whether Palestinian people are or are not wrongfully imprisoned in an open-air prison is not relevant.  What is relevant is whether or not Enes Kanter WANTS that to be the case, which is what you are implying.  You were asked for sources, you have given none.  The reason YOU need to source your shit is that Enes Kanter is speaking out AGAINST human rights abuses at great risk to his personal safety. Taking such a stance makes it unlikely that he finds ANY human rights abuses acceptable. In order for an impartial observer to accept such a contradiction of character, comprehensive proof should be provided.  &amp;#x200B;  You attempt to frame me as ignorant, responding to me as though I stated anything about the plight of the Palestinian people. This is either willfully disingenuous, or you are not able to grasp what is being written.  Either way, you are wasting mine and everyone else's time here.  Source your claims. Do not attempt to curry favor by asserting ignorance where there is none. Or, see yourself out."
