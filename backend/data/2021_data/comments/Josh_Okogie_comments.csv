"I like how the Wolves are starting Josh Okogie, a 6'4"" guy who isn't a threat on offense at all (although he does have a 7' wingspan) at power forward because they're so void of defense at the 4.  Aaron Gordon would look immaculate on this team man."
&gt; guards Josh Okogie
A little late to post! But here it is for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (9-11) | [](/MIN)Timberwolves (5-14) ---|---   D. Garland | D. Russell  C. Sexton  |   Malik Beasley Isaac Okoro |    Josh Okogie T. Prince |  A. Edwards  Jarrett Allen |   Ed Davis  &amp;nbsp;  **May not play:**   [](/CLE)Cavaliers (9-10) | [](/MIN)Timberwolves (4-14) ---|---   L. Nance  (OUT) |    K. Towns (OUT) M. Dellavedova (OUT) |    J. Culver  (OUT) K. Love (OUT) |        A. Drummond  (OUT)|
"This feels like a pretty gross overstatement. The Wolves are not just missing KAT. They were missing 3 front-court players.  They’re already one of the smaller teams in the league and are missing their top 2 centers. They were forced to start their 3rd string center and the 6’4” Josh Okogie at PF. Their backup PF who weighs 214 pounds served as the backup center and had to guard Embiid despite giving up probably around 100 pounds.   While neither KAT nor Naz are going to shut Embiid down, they definitely aren’t going to get absolutely steamrolled like Vanderbilt who’s built more like a 3 than a 5. While I don’t think Embiid is getting shut down by many players, most teams at least have 1 or 2 legitimate center sized guys to throw at him.   Also, Embiid benefits greatly from the improved spacing of the modern game (especially now that the Sixers have some) and the way it’s led to more small-ball. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a fantastic player. But he’s not in Shaq’s league as an offensive player. Shit, teams brought in 7 foot 270 pounds stiffs just to throw fouls at Shaq. If Shaq was matched up against a team with no one over 6’9” and whose second heaviest player was their 19 years old SG, he’d have dropped 50."
"There was a stretch in that game where the warriors just decided not to guard Josh Okogie and he just bricked like 4 or 5 threes in a row in consecutive possessions. Honestly felt really bad for him. I like him as a player.   Also, hope Naz Reid is okay, love his game."
"Don't worry, they got the warriors tomorrow which means expect any player in a shooting slump to turn into prime Klay Thompson from 3 (except for poor Josh Okogie today) and for every big man to turn into Dennis Rodman on the boards."
"You're right about them needing time adusting. Since last season they've literally played 5 games together. They win their first two games of this season against the Pistons and Jazz but then KAT is out because of a wrist injury. KAT comes back like a week and a half later but it's for only one game. Now he has COVID. All this constant on and off will always makes things difficult.   As for your starting lineup comment:  Dlo - 2nd best player  Malik Beasley - 3rd best player  Josh Okogie - He was out for some time but he may be the Twolves' best defender.  Juancho Hernangomez - Probably the worst starting PF in the league. This guy sucks.  KAT - Best player but has been out more games than he's played.   Another significant problem with the team is the coach. He is arguably the worst coach in the NBA..although Scott Brooks maybe takes he cake. Ryan Saunders is so intent on playing Dlo with Rubio, trying to mimic the Rockets' small ball but without the personnel. Oh Rubio can't play? No problem, let's play Dlo with another PG.   Given the circumstances Dlo is actually playing well. Shooting 40% from 3 on high volume and he's actually playing the best defense this season compared to his other seasons."
KAT and D'lo.  Malik and Court Dates  Josh Okogie and Gorgui Dieng was one also before Dieng got traded.
"His takes all summer were trash, including football. Shitting on Josh Allen for at least half the season. His analysis of the Wolves was “they didn’t really change anything about their roster” like dude, we traded everyone except KAT and Okogie and then played like 5 games. We changed fucking everything and added a #1 pick. Just seems like he’s expired, doesn’t seem as connected to the non-Boston teams anymore"
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
Malik Beasley and ...idk...Josh Okogie?
"honestly combined with saunders shutting the bed, you're telling me josh okogie has developed at all and KAT as well is just the same shit every year, it's like their player development is just ""okay guys try your best to be better :)"""
"You haven’t watched the Timberwolves this year Kat has tremendously improved on defense, he’s acknowledged his defense has held back the team. https://www.google.com/amp/s/dunkingwithwolves.com/2021/01/11/impact-karl-anthony-towns-josh-okogie-minnesota-timberwolves-defense/amp/"
"Yeah his defence on Pat Williams, Kyle Anderson and Josh Okogie has been so impressive."
Josh Okogie is so good on defense man.
My point was that people that only watched Covington whenever he played their team or in highlights only thought of him as the second coming of Dennis Rodman because he was a prominent piece on his team's defense.  His last full year in Philly he was guarding the top wing scorer a lot of time cause Ben wasn't Ben yet (defensively). Then he went to the Wolves and continued getting the top wing assignment because who else would? Andrew Wiggins or rookie Josh Okogie? Then the Rockets traded away a first in a confusing 4-way deal where he was the main piece they were getting back. And continued getting the top wing assignment because Harden definitely isn't the one to get it. Then the Blazers traded two firsts for him.  If you're an NBA fan that just hasn't watched enough Covington analysis you 100% think he's some defensive guru based on the fact that he always gets the top wing assignment wherever he ends up playing for and the fact that teams trade away picks for him every deadline without him being a good scorer
"We’re not just missing KAT, who obviously is our best player. We’re miss our best defender in Josh Okogie too. It’s brutal right now."

Right lol--nevermind the fact that Josh Okogie had been guarding opposing teams' power forwards before he got injured as well.
Josh Okogie...shhh....just do it. Pls
What about Josh Okogie?
"&gt;I thought earlier this year it was all Saunders, now it's all injuries?  Because it wasn't just one thing but even with Saunders this team would be at least 22-30 if everyone was healthy.  &gt;I'm not saying he's holding them back. I just don't see how his role would be different when it's still a bad team.  His role doesn't need to change, he just needs to stop playing with Rubio,Josh Okogie and Naz Reid and start playing with KAT and Beasley..."
Josh Okogie is an otherwise average player who becomes a lights-out shooter against the Lakers
Josh Okogie stops himself well enough thanks
Do they do that to Josh okogie too?
"Idk, i usually judge a players defense by their ability to guard James Harden  Therefore the best defenders in the league are Lu Dort and Josh Okogie"
Did that commentator say Thybulle was our version of fucking Josh Okogie? Bruh I don't mind Okogie but please Thybulle is an elite defender already and so many levels above
Biting on a Josh Okogie pump fake should get you benched immediately
"Certainly better than Josh Okogie,Jarred Vanderbilt,Rubio,Culver and Junacho Hernangomez.  The only positive shooters on our roster are D'lo,KAT and Beasley. KAT missed 20 games of the season and Beasley was suspended for 12."
1. KAT  2. D'lo  3. Beasley  4. Rubio  5. Ant  6. Jaden McDaniels  7. Naz Reid  8. Jaylen Nowell  9. Josh Okogie?
"In 2017-18 the Timberwolves beat the Nuggets in game 82 to go to the playoffs, so not a great point there. Otherwise I’d say KAT was the best player in 2017, Jimmy was injured and KAT was the Rockets’ sole priority in the first round hence his poor first two games.   In terms of teammates KAT’s easily had the worst of the bunch, and he’s been through 5 coaches now. Look what competency did for AD or Booker, and hopefully this post-All-Star Break stretch is a signifier of that for going into next year. KAT’s finally the focus of the Timberwolves and has some players who can draw the focus of the defence or make them pay in DLO, Ant and Beasley. You can say what you want about Embiid or Jokic but when Towns is getting tripled in the post and his best passing option is a wide open Josh Okogie from 3 you know the record isn’t his fault."
"&gt;Yeah I was kind of cringing at them trying to trade for Gordon or Collins  Why? Gordon would be the perfect fit on this team and Collins isn't actually a terrible defender.  &gt;I think that’s the last thing they need lol. They need to be pursuing more defensive wings besides just McDaniels, especially on a team with KAT and D’Lo (Ant too right now, but he projects to be a better defender at least, but so did KAT...)  Our team is full of defensive wings (Josh Okogie,Jaden,Culver) what we need is a honest to God PF."
JMac has far better natural instincts than Okogie. Josh is really good. Josh is physical and quick and has great hands but JMac has all of those things and great IQ.
"I mean, josh okogie does exist lol.  But I hear you."
Mightve been josh okogie
Hakeem played for team USA (lol) and Giannis plays for Greece but in recent years Nigeria has been represented a lot with Josh Okogie and Al-Farouq Aminu as the most prominent ones.
How about josh okogie and culver ? You like smaller wings who cant do anything except try on defense? Oh they can also get about 5 rebounds each if you leave them out there for a half hour
&gt;Josh Okogie shouldn't be playing and Jake Layman isn't starting caliber.  I mean we have Culver also for the 3 spot and Anthony Edwards was actually our SF for a good part of the season. And Josh Okogie is fine in lineups with KAT and D'lo since he brings good defence and with offensively potent lineups his non existent offensive game isn't that deal breaking.
I think frontcourt depth in general is what Minny needs but I'm surprised you'd say the 4 is in more need of help than the 3. Josh Okogie shouldn't be playing and Jake Layman isn't starting caliber.
"And Ant was coming off the bench for josh okogie?? They became starters around the same time, if you watched the wolves you would’ve known that lol. Also tell me how many games lamelo played without rozier and Hayward"
Imagine the TWolves without Josh Okogie.  He's extremely valuable in their quest for the #1 pick.
He got less free throws than Josh okogie ffs chill
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
Marvin Bagley   Josh Okogie   Lauri Markennen    Coby White
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"Athleticsm boost on D-Lo (athletic d-lo with improved foot speed leading to better defense? Subfuckingscribe) Skill boost on Josh Okogie (Okogie with some offensive contributions would make him a solid 3&amp;D player in the league) Size boost on Malik/Vanderbilt (Taller malik hopefully helps him become a better defender, he’s already lethal at shooting/ just gonna throw it out there that 6’11 vando could be the wolves version of javale mcgee)"
"My point was just that many superstars get easy rebounds as teammates cede them.  James Harden (8 REB/game), Bruce Brown (5 REB/game), and Malik Beasley (4 REB/game) all average about 1.5 contested rebounds a game. Some rookie like Okoro is averaging 1.1 contested rebounds, but is totaling under 3. Josh Okogie is similar (1.3 contested but 2.9 total)."
"He did hit the open man out of doubles.  That open man was Ricky fucking Rubio, Josh Okogie, Jared Vanderbilt and Juancho Hernangomez.    DLo, Beasley and McDaniels were out.  They can hit open shots.  Miami only guarded KAT and Ant to close the game."
Jaden McDaniels and Josh Okogie have been very nice in that role.
&gt; Culver  Culver arguably has a great work ethic but we were the worst situation for him because of Ryan Saunders being coach and having a glut of young wings on this team (and Culver's negatively impacted Josh Okogie for 1.5 years since Okogie would be jerked in and out of the lineup for much of that time).  Culver is now relegated to DNP-CD status and Okogie is playing more and Okogie is looking like a competent player again. My guess is Culver will get better wherever we end up trading him to but I'm also not convinced that he was ever going to be an elite player (or even very good) in the league given there were issues with his shot in college.  We should never have drafted Culver. Gersson really f'd up that pick.
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5. Jaren Jackson Jr  6. Colin Sexton  7. DeAndre Ayton  8. Mikal Bridges  8. DeVonte Graham  9. Gary Trent Jr  10. Mitchell Robinson  11. Miles Bridges  12. Robert Williams  13. Jalen Brunson  14.

Is Josh Okogie and Seth Curry allowed? Because that
Unbiased opinion  MVP - KAT  DPOY - Josh Okogie  ROTY - Anthony Edwards  6MOY - D’Angelo Russell (He’s been coming off the bench for the past few weeks)  MIP - Jaylen Nowell  COTY - Chris Finch  EOTY - Gersson Rosas   What do you guys think?
"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."
Whats the alternative for our team? Josh Okogie jacking up shots? And those metrics also include the first half of his season where he truly was the worst player in the league.
"&gt;Ant also hasn't been hurting his team to same extent by the on/offs - Wolves are basically even with Ant on the court vs. off it for the season and I think he lately has probably been a clear positive, since the coaching change.  If we forced Jaylen Nowell or Josh Okogie to take the shots Ant has been forced to take we'd be even worse off. Honestly do you even watch the Wolves?"
"He’s actually been doing great defensively, leads rookies in BPG last time I checked. But a rookie and Josh Okogie is nowhere near enough for you to be considered a good defensive team"
"I now realize that Josh Okogie is the answer to the question ""What if Jalen Brown, but bad?"""
"You rarely see a max player playing with Josh Okogie,Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"i'm arguing against the OP who said he's untouchable because his offense is still 'developing' when in fact the complete opposite is happening  never said anything against his defense but that can only get you so far as noted by his low MPG this year and last.   Josh okogie is a great example of how much more important offense is than defense for a wing. Dude can play D, not as well as Thybulle, but he can play D. He's also only 22 years old. You don't see people oozing over his potential offensive game haha  And again, Thybulle is already 24...he should be far more developed offensively at this point and the fact that he's not is not a good thing for his 'potential'"
Josh Okogie in shambles.
Anyone who plays Josh Okogie at the 4 deserves to catch strays.
"I'm confused. Why does it not overshadow a multi-billion dollar company? That's a very opinionated statement. I disagree with you on that one, and I think Josh Okogie is currently leaning that way as well. Human lives are more important than dollars."
"Uhh, what does having a job have to do with this? Some things are bigger than your job, homie. Maybe the betterment of conditions for a disadvantaged group matters more to Josh Okogie than a basketball game? It's not all about dollar bills, ya know."
"More context for anyone who can't read the article.   &gt;When Daunte Wright was shot and killed by a police officer Sunday in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, it touched off another round of protests less than a year after Floyd’s death.   &gt;“What hurts the most is when you are vocal, you try to do things to help, you try to do what’s right, and when nothing changes and the same thing happens,” Wolves forward Josh Okogie said after a 127-97 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. “I think for me, that’s the most difficult part.”"
Much easier to get assists passing to Terry Rozier and Gordon Hayward than Josh Okogie and Juancho Hernangomez. Just saying.....
"He’s not a god he’s just better than Josh Okogie lol, no where in here have you explained why this deal would be good for the sixers. Move Thybulle just to move him, and hope we make back up the defense? What’s the point?"
"Maybe when they are not playing, but the team plays their home games at Target Center in Minneapolis. They play their away games all over. Josh Okogie was at Top Golf yesterday also, he loves that place! (As do I!)"
Pretty sure Josh okogie had the worst
You really think a highlight of say Josh Okogie setting a moving screen and then turning it over would have 1000 upvotes?  I'd argue the only reason this is even posted is because of LeBron and that only him and a handful of other controversial players would have a highlight like this posted at all.
Timberwolves: 2014: Glenn Robinson #40  2014: Markel Brown #44  2014: Alessandro Gentile #53  2015: Rakeem Christmas #36  2016: Kris Dunn #5 (19 or 20th best in his class)  2018: Josh Okogie #20  2018: Keita Bates-Drop #48  Traded on draft night excluded.   That’s worse. Happy?
No.... it is Josh Okogie in the right corner. Except he likes to pumpfake then go into an out of control drive followed by him tossing the ball at the rim wildly.
"Josh Okogie slapping Curry's leg from behind, while airborne taking a 3. Pretty bitch move.   https://twitter.com/NBCSWarriors/status/1111820159998529536  Ref called it a correct no call, just a hot stove contact, Curry came to the arena with oven mitts the next day."
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
"You almost have to throw the advanced numbers out when evaluating this Wolves team due to injuries and the resulting lineups it resulted in.   KAT missed 22 games. Russell missed 30. Beasley missed 35. That sometimes meant guys like Ant had to play alongside some BAD teammates in some BAD lineups. This was especially apparent early (when KAT missed time), when Ant was coming off the bench. There were tons of games where Ant was asked to lead a second unit of Jordan McLaughlin-Josh Okogie-Jarred Vanderbilt-Naz Reid. That meant he was either jacking up contested 3s or driving into a jam-packed paint. There were numerous games where he was something like 4-18 and it wasn’t because he was just jacking shots. The Wolves before the break were PAINFUL (they had the worst record in the entire league for a reason). Because Edwards didn’t miss any time and was there for all of those god ugly days, he’s naturally going to have a gnarly set of advanced statistics."
"I don’t know about the whole NBA, but on the Timberwolves it’s Jaden McDaniels.  After a slow rookie start, he shot .383 from 3 with a .600 TS%.  He was the best defensive player on our team, and that’s saying something with Josh Okogie.     He was a top 5 rookie post all star and is going to be a 3&amp;D menace for the next 15 years and people are acting like he’s a nothing bench prospect.  Every Wolves fan has him pencilled in as our long term starter without any hesitation."
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
They already have Josh Okogie. No room for Dame
"Not really. Nigeria’s leading scorer, Gabe Vincent, averages 12 minutes a game in the NBA. Josh Okogie averages 5 ppg in the NBA. Chimezie Metu averages 6 ppg.    Mills and Ingles are legit NBA players, but they’re role players. This whole thread is full of jokes about Keldon Johnson, and he’s better than anybody on either Australia or Nigeria. Team USA played 7 NBA All Stars."
"Watch Josh Okogie from this year. They tried desperately to have him at the 4 and he just could not learn how to play as a 4. Different assignments all together. Okogie is a fantastic defender and a really smart guy too, making the change to focusing on bigger guys and screening and how to guard off screens can be a very difficult change"
Nigeria doesn't have superstars who are used to playing by superstar rules.  Do you think Josh okogie gets the whistles Damian lillard does?
"There was one moment where the commentator said something like “Josh Okogie, he’s their shooter” and the dread I felt for Nigeria fans in that moment was palpable"
2022 co-DPOY Josh Okogie.
I could have guessed if Nigeria was 20-42 from three Josh Okogie would be 0-3.
"\&gt; Most of these guys on the roster were helping their NBA squad try to get into the playoffs a few months ago  Team USA has like 5 guys that average more ppg INDIVIDUALLY than Josh Okogie, KZ Okpala, Gabe Vincent, Ekpe Udoh, Michael Gbinije, Chimezie Metu in the NBA combined. Combined.  Granted smaller roles and less overall playing time, these guys aren't even in the same stratosphere at least yet. They are all bench players / rotational players. I mean Gabe Vincent is averaging 4.8ppg and .38 fg%.  You acting like you're some kind of basketball savant that saw this coming is incredibly disingenuous.  The reality is 7 guys shooting between 50-100% from 3 is highly unlikely (understatement) to be sustained and USA will adjust."
"Nigeria was lights out from three, they were locked. Dame, Tatum, and Durant went like 9-30 or something. Weird to see Josh Okogie winning!"
Bam: I played for the wrong team.   Josh Okogie: I told you.
The good: Literally nothing  The bad: You lost to josh okogie and precious achiuwa
Josh Okogie is on the Nigerian team so it explains a lot
Do I cheer for America or Josh Okogie???
josh okogie fan club checkpoint:
"Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat   KZ Okpala, Miami Heat   Miye Oni, Utah Jazz    Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves   Jordan Nwora, Milwaukee Bucks   Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings   Jahlil Okafor, Detroit Pistons   Gabe Vincent, Miami Heat  Alzo Michael Gbinije and Ekpe Udoh have experience in the NBA."
"NBA players on their roster include:  Precious Achiuwa, Kezie Okpala, Miye Oni, Josh Okogie, Jordan Nwora, Chimezie Metu, Ekpe Udoh, Jahlil Okafor, Gabe Vincent."
Josh Okogie
"Nigeria is ranked way too high. Australia and France are definitely better. Not only is the NBA talent on Australia and France better but their players also haven’t played much with each other.   I think you are overestimating exactly which NBA players are projected to be on the Nigerian team. The best player might end up being Monte Morris and the rest of the team will be some combination of guys like Precious Achiuwa, Jahlil Okafor, and Josh Okogie."
Josh Okogie. Whether he’s open or has a hand in his face he’s still going to miss it.
Gerson Rosas took over the wolves after the 18-19 season. By the time of the nba shutdown in March 2020 the only players that remained on the roster were Kat and josh Okogie.
Josh okogie
"Wonder if they could pull off a 3-way trade with Toronto &amp; Philly. Something like:   - Wolves get: Simmons / George Hill (for cap purposes), 76ers 2021 1st #28  - 76ers get: Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), Malik Beasley, Best of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks.   - Toronto gets: Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, Worst of Wolves/Raptors 2022 1st round picks."
You can have Josh Okogie and Rubio. I'll even throw in a 2nd
"&gt;He's your Josh Okogie  &gt;He ain't Dort  And you trying to come at me because he ""only"" made 2nd team all defence? While playing the lowest mpg of any player to ever make a defence team? I'm embarrassed for you man 😂  Goddammit I love Matisse, what a fucking player."
"Malik Beasley, Josh Okogie/Naz Reid and a 1st?"
I think this framework makes sense for everyone. Even tho Simmons stock is at an all time low. Philly probably needs to receive another legit rotation player. Maybe throw in Zach Collins or Josh Okogie to Philly.
Played AAU/high school ball with Devin Vassell and Anthony Edwards. Met Chris Paul when i was 10. Teammates with Josh Okogie in high school. Played against Marvin Bagley in the 8th grade and plenty of other future NBA players.  Here I am Chegging my way to a bachelors degree
I'd love to text this hypothesis and see Jokic play with Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver instead of Jamal Murray and Gary Harris
"&gt;Yeah but only one of those players the offense runs around is an MVP who's won heavily in the both the regular season and the playoffs.   One of the players didn't play most of the season with Josh Okogie,Ricky Rubio and Juancho Hernangomez as his shooters."
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
Na his defence is still fine. And he can playmake a bit. But he was a black hole on offence.  At the end of the day he was completely redundant to us when Josh Okogie and to an extent Jarred Vanderbilt do the exact same things as Culver but better. We couldnt have 4 bench guys all incapable of scoring. And thats why Jaden McDaniels and Jaylen Nowell both got chances ahead of him
Haven't watched him play but would you say at best he could basically be a josh okogie? 1 year of Pat Beverly may get the young guys fired up to play defense and he's not going to take the 3rd team to beat the starters to try and motivate them.
Jaden McDaniels is a very good defender and Josh Okogie is pretty good outside of they they don’t have any defenders KAT the last couple years has improved and after their coaching change KAT was guarding the perimeter more and looked pretty good but still wouldn’t trust him to be an above average defender
"&gt;He might be the best 3 point shooting center in the league but he doesn't make anybody around him better.   KAT is the best 3pt shooting Big of all time and one of the best shooters ever in general. KAT is one of the best playmaking bigs in the league, saying he ""cant make his team better"" is just BS and only shows your lack of knowledge on KAT outside of surface level knowledge or how the media views him.  Its clear you dont know anything about who you are talking about, and this isnt the rabbit hole you want to go down.  This season, KAT was averaging 5 assists on a team who had guys like Josh Okogie being a catch and shoot option and Ant being a poor shooter to start his year. KAT playing with better floor spacing and hes averaging at least 7 assists. Dlo, Edwards, and Malik are all either good or elite 3pt shooters and next season I expect people to actually catch on that KAT is a great playmaker.  &gt; I do watch and pay attention his best defense was played during his rookie season and has gotten noticeably worse since then.   Another BS take, KAT is a neutral defensive center that has gotten better every single year on that end and is on a bad defensive team, so he is looking a lot worse on D when his team isnt helping either.  KAT is actually a good defender when he doesnt have all the pressure on him to be the guy on offense.  I find it ridiculous how people will try to discredit KAT for not taking his team to the playoffs when his 2nd option was mainly Andrew Wiggins, a man Steph Curry couldn't lead to the playoffs himself."
"If only he had Bam, Dragić and Robinson and not Josh Okogie and Andrew Wiggins"
"&gt;Get some great defenders and some pass first players and you'll have a great team  Like Ricky Rubio, Josh Okogie, and Jarred Vanderbilt? It was sure better than having DLo to have Ricky out on the floor with those guys. And yes, I am telling you he is just as good as those guys as a playmaker. In fact, he has better passing touch and a wider pick and roll vocabulary than those 4 minus Ja. When he was the sole focal point of the offense in Brooklyn (like Ja and Lillard are), he also averaged a couple more assists getting him to 7.0 apg and led them to a playoff berth. I'm not saying he's as good a player as those guys, because he isn't as good as them, but as a passer, he's undeniably gifted."
"Timberwolves:  Jarred Vanderbilt is extremely replaceable and not worth $5 million a year.  Jarrett Culver should be ahead of Josh Okogie in the rotation because he has more upside on offense.  A team can never have enough offense, so signing Lauri Markkanen to a deal worth $15-$18 million a year isn't a terrible idea.  If we don't get a PF, Nathan Knight should start at C while KAT moves to PF.  Naz Reid is best suited for a bench role."
"Julius Randle will be sent to Philly in a 3-team deal sending Ben Simmons to Minnesota. The Knicks will receive Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, and Ricky Rubio."
Josh Okogie
josh okogie lol
Okay well we need to send you 11m. We can only do that by sending you Josh Okogie - whos a phenomenal on ball defender and a solid cutter as well as one of Jarrett Culver and Juancho Hernangomez. Juancho will shoot well but nothing else. Culver will defend well and probably wont do much else
Incorrect.  2021: #7 traded for D'Lo  2020: #1 Anthony Edwards (got an issue with that? I didn't think so)  2019: #6 Jarrett Culver  2018: #20 Josh Okogie  2017: #7 traded for traded for Jimmy Butler)  So we have had a top ten pick four times in five years. One was used on Anthony Edwards and another two were traded for D'Lo and Jimmy Butler.   Get your facts straight.
Manu will always be best one unless satoransky or josh okogie or someone pulls out gold imo
"Isaac Okoro, not Josh Okogie, whose a Timberwolf"
"Still have to hope for more offensive development because defensive stoppers that make you play 4v5 on offense don't have a ton of value in today's league (looking at you, Josh Okogie and Kris Dunn).  There's hope though, almost 10 points on 42% shooting as a rookie isn't anything to scoff at. Just needs some work on his 3-ball."
"right the difference between luka and the 40th best basketball player in the world is gigantic.  but the difference between the 380th and 423th isn't as much.    Italy its actually a good test of this theory  fontechio and polanaro are two top 30 players in Europe. Plus they have galo who might be the best player between italy and nigeria.  but nigeria has more nba players.  gabe vincent, kz opkala, precous achuiwa, josh okogie, miyi oni , chemezie Metu, jordan nwora.  almost their whole rotation besides agada and emegano"
"I mean what else were they gonna do? Draft Jahlil Okafor?  Same with the Edwards pick, they already had D'Angelo Russell, they were not gonna take Lamelo Ball.  Josh Okogie was a decent find at 20th though"
Josh Okogie is the modern superstar of headband forehead coverage. Even Myles Turner is impressed with his fivehead.
"There’s still a ton of non-star NBA players in international teams right now.   Satoransky, Ntilikina, Batum, Luwawu-Cabarot, Fournier, Mills, Josh Green, Ingles, Thybulle, Exum, Baynes, Bonga, Wagner, Mannion, Gallinari, Melli, Okpala, Metu, Oni, Okafor, Okogie, Vincent, Nwora, Achiuwa, Campazzo, Deck, Vildoza, Hachimura, Cancar, Rubio, Marc Gasol and Juancho Hernangomez are all at the Olympics and on NBA rosters right now. That’s 32 guys who aren’t stars providing depth. Plus a bunch of guys who were very recently on NBA teams (Pau Gasol, Poirier, Abrines, Delly etc).   And there’s a bunch of others from countries that just didn’t make it. Depth is fine."
Don’t forget Josh Okogie
"**Team Africa**  C: Joel Embiid, Precious Achiuwa.  PF: Pascal Siakam, Chimezie Metu, KZ Okpala.   SF: Josh Okogie, Luc Mbah a Moute.  SG: Victor Oladipo, DJ Strawberry.  PG: Miye Oni, Gabe Vincent."
josh okogie was running through the okra patch?
"Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, and maybe Josh Okogie and some picks or some shit.   I don't fucking know, just give him to us already. We'll be a dysfunctional mess, but at least we'll be fun to watch."
"You're surprised that they know the name of the GM, the 3 most famous players on the roster, plus Malik Beasley and that they once notoriously overpaid for Wiggins?  I'm about to blow your mind... Josh Okogie"
"the only one that could arguably start for the Sixers would be Malik, 33 year old Pat Bev is not getting the start over Maxey or Curry, neither is Jordan McLaughlin, or even Josh Okogie.  Idk how you think you have 3-4 starting caliber guards on your team excluding Ant and Dlo.  Like you understand by definition any team can only start 2, maybe 3 guards if you get funky with it anyway right?"
"What’s with philly fans not understanding that some people just don’t like Ben Simmons and don’t care to have him on their team, much less trade a kings ransom to get him? It’s not crazy, regardless of how good players are fans don’t like some and like others. I like josh Okogie for instance and don’t want to see him traded but that does not mean he’s a good player. I also don’t care to add RJ Barrett to my team but that doesn’t mean he’s bad or wouldn’t help with winning."
He’s had the most abysmal supporting cast out of any star in the nba. Hard to win many games when you got Wiggins going 6/24 and your spot up shooters are josh okogie and Jarrett culver
"Man… I don’t know what to tell you if you expect him to lead a team starting guys like Jarrett Culver, Shabazz Napier, Jake Layman, Josh Okogie, Hernangomez, and a whole host of other players who shouldn’t even be in the league. Now he has Russell, Ant, and Beasley, but they haven’t gotten a chance to play a full season together. What KAT is working with, in the west, you can’t expect him to will them into the playoffs."
[future all star josh okogie 😎 ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-projections/josh-okogie/)
"Josh Okogie = Josk, it's his nickname"
So who tf are they trading? Pat Bev and Josh Okogie?   Edit: Malik Beasley exists but my point still stands
"Michael Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Josh Okogie, 2022 1st MIN unprotected, 2023 swap rights, 2024 1st MIN with minimal protection"
Or is  Simmons just Josh Okogie with better passing? 🤔
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are a bit better than Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver I think
I think you misremembered then. This was a dunk attempt by Josh Okogie.
"the last year he was healthy, they won 36 games where the leaders in games started were: Andrew Wiggins (at his worst arguably), Taj Gibson, Josh Okogie, Jeff Teague, Dario Saric, and Tyus Jones.   he was +11 in on/off last year.   the growth in his passing is what has prompted me to believe this really. i really think he is in a tier of his own after Jokic. KAT can do just about everything at a high level on the offensive end"
Josh Okogie top 25 player confirmed
"Who you think is part of the “can’t beat 5 with 3 people” quote? D’Lo, KAT, and… Josh Okogie?"
"He's as big as Josh Okogie, who's starting at the 3 for Minnesota."
"we'll give them derek chauvin, a tub of hummus, and a young player with potential in josh okogie"
Josh Okogie
KAT/Ant/DLo gonna get the headlines. But Jaden McDaniels and Josh Okogie where great on defense.  Rockets might need to go pick up a vet PG. They needed someone that could handle the rock and run the offense.
"It’s saddening that the Wolves are so devoid of talent that they’re playing Josh Okogie, a 6’4” complete non-factor on offense, at power forward"
"Height wise, but Okogie is probably a lot stronger. I would expect them both to pick up 4s just based on who is closer. Okogie is a better point of attack defender tho so if it’s somebody who like to play outside josh probably takes him."
yeah morey get it done. Malik beasley and Josh Okogie are waiting.

"First off, the only players that are still with the team since then are josh okogie and kat, and none of the coaches since then are the same. Second, the past is not always a good indication of the future, third, the last time the kings were over 31 wins (2018, the year you're referencing) the coach was not luke walton. The coach was dave jeorger. And fourth, both in 19 and 20 the wolves were extremely injured."
"Yup. Most of the really good defensive guards have a crazy wingspan. Makes contesting shots and getting deflections that much easier.   Josh Okogie has a 7'0 wingspan, but is only 6'4. Reggie Jackson is 6'3 with a 7'0 wingspan. Jrue Holiday is 6'3 with a 6'7 wingspan. Etc."
"&gt;Lavine was a tiny fraction of what he is now in Minnesota. You’re purely speculating that his time there played any role in what he became. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt regarding Lavines playmaking but that’s probably the worst aspect of his game outside of his defence so it doesn’t influence how good he is for the most part. His playmaking is also largely just passing out of doubles.  He was averaging 18.9 ppg before he went down with his injury and was clearly on the trajectory to be where he is now. He was empowered to be the #1 option in Chicago which certainly helped but to act like what he did in Minnesota is a tiny fraction of his development is a laughable take.  &gt;The issue is basically every athletic fringe rotational player is a good defender. Defence is largely based on effort and players who are fighting for minutes will often provide the most effort. What makes defenders stand out is impact and okogie is not an impactful defender. Wings and guards are less impactful as is, so you generally have to be like an all defence guy, or have some offence too.  Not every ""athletic fringe rotation player"" is a good defender because you can't teach motor and instincts and Okogie is certainly an impactful defender because of his giant wingspan that allows him to play SF and in certain lineups to guard PF's. Try watching Josh play sometime?"
"Ah so now its our fault Juancho is a shit player? And in the 2010's we hit on KAT,Edwards,Lavine,Josh Okogie and McDaniels so miss me with that revisionist history."
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
"BULLSHIT. Hindsight is everything. If you believe that shit I got a fucking bridge in Brooklyn you can buy from me.    Look at the guys he drafted: Kris Dunn, Josh Okogie, Keita Bates Diop, Josh Patton, the dude when given full control doesnt know shit."
"I hate the narrative that it's his fault the team is bad. What, he's supposed to carry treveon graham jeff teague andrew wiggins jarrett culver and josh okogie to the playoffs? In what universe? Its a team sport and when he finally gets a modicum of help he's ""carried"""
Prediction : Josh okogie gets exactly 2 steals and 1 turnover
"You still would've had the Butler drama with KAT.  Thibs also drafted Justin Patton and Kris Dunn vs. one ""hit"" in Josh Okogie.  He also handed Wiggins and Dieng albatross contracts."
Josh Okogie.
"It's mostly our early picks though. Kris Dunn, Jarrett Culver, Justin Patton, Shabazz Muhammad, Derrick Williams, Wesley Johnson, Johnny Flynn all inside the the top 20 and are all busts surrounded by better picks in the draft. Add to that Wiggins and Rubio not living up to the hype. Even going way back and trading Brandon Roy for Randy Foye.  Then you look and see Gorgui Dieng, Tyus Jones, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Nikola Pekovic, Glenn Robinson, Nemanja Bjelica and none of them are world beaters but they all will have/had nice NBA careers. You need to hit with your early picks more often than we did. It seems things may be changing but I won't believe it until it's actually happened."
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough… seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I’d say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he’s already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"Most overhyped nobody in the world, litterally with 1 search I found Josh Okogie has the exact same height and wingspan   Where is the hype for Josh Okogie?"
"And it's all down to the good defensive schemes laid out by Coach Finch. Everyone is going all-in and the defensive results shows.  Wolves are currently ranked 2nd in blocks, 3rd in steals, and biggest surprised is ranked 1st in turnovers. For 3-pointers, Wolves are ranked 10th for 3-points allowed with 3rd for opposition 3-point percentage, which I hope will get better with Pat Bev &amp; Josh Okogie getting more minutes to defend above the 3-point line."
"Trade Luka for a defensive minded guard like Josh Okogie, trade KP to an Israeli team, then relocate the team to St Paul"
"Thibs handling of the PG position was weird. Rubio, Butler, Taj Gibson - that's the start of a really nice defensive core.     For the coup de gras he drafts Kris Dunn and Josh Okogie - two of the very few perimeter guys in the league with less offensive punch than Rubio."
"I think the only question then is who on the T'Wolves should be in the discussion? Their main plus defenders have been Patrick Beverley, Josh Okogie, and Jarred Vanderbilt.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*50:PLAYER_LAST_TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*min"
Josh Okogie
Literally everyone: hey let’s put our center on josh okogie since he can’t shoot and double KAT.   Lakers: let’s not do that and lose by 30 points instead.
"Josh Okogie kinda looks like Ben Simmons, think its the nose"
"It's 2021, the NBA has been dominated by forwards for the last decade, and the forwards on that roster are Jaden McDaniels (pretty good defensively, but ultra raw on offense), Jarred Vanderbilt (great rebounder, has some talent, but a bench guy), Josh Okogie (really a guard, can defend, is abysmal on offense),Taurean Prince (is in the NBA because for some reasons NBA teams always assume a guy with dreads plays good defense) and Jake Layman (is in the NBA because he's white so people assume he's a shooter)  You don't win in the NBA with 0 quality forwards"
"Timberwolves 1st round draft picks since KAT: Kris Dunn, Josh Okogie, Justin Patton, Jarrett Culver (traded up), Ant, Bolmaro, McDaniels.   We also traded 1sts for Adreian Payne and DLo.   It's pretty obvious why this team is successful and it has nothing to do with KAT."
"KAT 100% could be/could have been the guy.  Here's what we've done with every 1st round pick we've had since KAT.   Kris Dunn, traded away for Adreian Payne, Josh Okogie, Justin Patton, traded up for Jarrett Culver, Ant, Bolmaro, McDaniels, and traded away with Wiggins for DLo.   I could accept trading KAT away at this point as a ""we blew it"" move since we failed to put a team around him and it may be too late now.  But it wouldn't be a ""KAT's not that guy"" trade, imo."
"Dude this whole “KAT can’t lead” is such a bullshit narrative  No, he can’t. Does that matter? Not really. The issue is the rest of the roster sucks they are depending upon Jaden McDaniels, Jared Vanderbilt, and Josh Okogie to make shots for them  KAT can’t just make those guys hit their shots. He’s got a shit team around him"
"Ooh boy where do I begin with this?   * He never knew when to call timeouts. Coaches generally call timeouts when the opponent starts to get some momentum, but Ryan would wait until it was too late.   * Never really figured out how to get Anthony Edwards involved in the offense. This is the big reason why Ant had a great second half last year, Finch was able to figure this out.   * Power forward Josh Okogie   * Insistence on jacking up threes despite the lack of personnel to attempt threes at a high rate. We were top 3 in attempts and bottom 3 in conversion. If the threes weren't falling, there really wasn't any other gameplan. In postgame interviews, his solution seemed to be that eventually they would fall.   * Speaking of postgame interviews, it often seemed like he was struggling for words when asked questions by reporters. Things just seemed to be moving too fast for him."
"Yes, I snuck Josh Okogie out of there. Obviously given such a small sample size, these stats are bound to be noisy. However, I do have to give credit to Drummond this year. He has made large strides on defense when it comes to defending the PNR and he isn't a black hole on offense at all anymore (only attempting about 1 post up a game now). He is additionally able to rebound at a very high level despite his limited minutes."
Jaylen Brown &amp; Robert Williams for KAT &amp; Josh Okogie?
Your alternative was Josh okogie so
"Jarrett Culver and Josh Okogie for Kyle Lowry, who says hell  no??"
"Just because you don't have three half of famers don't mean your team is trash. Like jesus, you have a team with a bunch a good wing players, Draymond and the second overall pick. T-wolves are starting guys like Josh Okogie, Naz Ried and  old Rubio. It ain't comparable. Detroits second best player is Josh Jackson. Even without Curry you are not that bad."
Without Harden on the floor he's Josh Okogie with better passing but Harden opens his game so much.
Rubio would be an upgrade. But he's been dreadful for us this year outside of perhaps 4 games. Obviously some of that is down to roster and Saunders' rotations. But it just hasnt worked.   Culver is just...bad. He's a decent defender but his offense is woeful. Same with Josh Okogie
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
Have you heard of Josh Okogie?
yeah maybe he’s not just good he has had so many elite teammates like Treveon Graham Jeff Teague josh okogie Juancho Hernangomez Taj Gibson Jake Layman and more.
"Can you imagine if it had been chris paul's jersey untucked and josh okogie had pointed it out, they would've told him to sit the fuck down lol"
"I see what you're saying there. I would say that with the amount of close games we have been in this year, the hope is that a coach who is adapting to the game and making proper adjustments is able to put us in better positions to win. And/or to hold the players more accountable for their mistakes.  An example from this year alone is playing Rubio and Dlo together so often, especially at the end of games. Both guards need the ball in their hand to be successful. The issue is when you are putting the ball in dlo hands, that is essentially making Rubio a shooting guard. He is having a terrible year from 3, which opponents take advantage of. Same issue playing Josh Okogie so often when teams are able to literally leave him wide open.  I'm all for a coach believing in their players, but the coach also has to have the ability to look outside of their personal relationship with the player and making decisions that put the team in the best scenario to win.  If the new coach is able to make these adjustments and adapt to each game, while also installing an offense that sets up and runs plays, I will personally be very happy."
Have you seen josh okogie touch a basketball?
you guys want players right? I'll trade you Josh Okogie and saunders for silas
Josh Okogie is the worst offensive player I have ever watched.
Josh Okogie fouled on 3-point shot: no free throws. Kyle Lowry fouled on 3-point shot: 3 free throws. what
Bro you don’t know what you’re talking about.  Those Rubio &amp; McLaughlin lineups are 🔥🔥🔥  And why not pull out Jaden Mcdaniels for... Josh Okogie?? Sure why not!
Josh Okogie has a TS% less than 45 and he doesn't pass or do anything well on offense.  He's a decent defender but it's pretty ridiculous how bad his offense has been.
"RHJ is miles better on offense than Okogie. He sucks, but holy hell Josh has no offensive skills whatsoever."
Why let KAT shoot when we have notorious offensive threat Josh Okogie?
Everybody that says RHJ should be a major part of a team should watch josh okogie. It doesn't work
Apparently you shouldn’t close games with Ricky Rubio and Josh Okogie if you need offense. Who knew?
