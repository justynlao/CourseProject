"True, from Wikipedia:  &gt; He (Gary Payton) married Monique James on July 26, 1997. They later divorced. They lived in Oakland and Las Vegas and have three children: Gary II, Julian, and Raquel.[32] Payton also has another son named Gary Payton Jr with a different mother.[33]"
Pretty sure he has a son that’s a jr and one that’s Gary Payton II lol
Gary Payton II* put some respect on his name
"Yeah, but it's usually the sons of players that were journeymen or roleplayers that seem to thrive and not the sons of stars. They can reach the league and have the blueprint for getting there, but I can't think of any that followed up their fathers with similar greatness. Like I can't think of any father/son duos where both were similarly great if the father was All-Star caliber.   You see it with the 2nd gen stepping up if their dads were in the league but not stars (Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Klay Thompson, etc.) but if their dads were stars, they're usually roleplayers (Barry brothers, Luke Walton, David Stockton, Gary Payton II, etc.).   I feel like it comes down to having something to prove per individual. And to be honest, based off people I've met all through my life, it's usually the people who are already well off that don't have much to prove. Not saying Bronny can't be great, but I wouldn't put any money on it."
"This is reactionary nonsense.  The Warriors had exactly three players that were net pluses on offense: [Curry, Jordan Poole, and… Gary Payton II](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html), who played 40 minutes on the season.  He had nothing to work with. The fact they got close to the playoffs at all is a huge credit to him."
"It's hilarious to me that one is Gary Payton, Jr. and another is Gary Payton II."
"Kenyon Martin Jr/Sr, Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr, Gary Payton II/Sr, Cole Anthony/Greg Anthony (never realized he was his son until just now), Seth and Steph Curry/Dell Curry, Austin Rivers/Doc Rivers, Glenn Robinson III/Glenn Robinson Jr, Domantas Sabonis/Arvydas Sabonis, Jerami Grant/Harvey Grant (and uncle Horace Grant)...  There's so many more current players whose fathers played but I don't remember watching their fathers... it's crazy..."
Damn. Gary Payton II has played 71 career games over the last 5 seasons and has never crossed paths with LeBron
Gary Payton has 2 sons named Gary Payton. Gary Payton II is the one in the league Jr is not
Gary Payton and Gary II are right there.
He has...  3. Rick and Jalen Brunson.  4. Gary Payton and Gary Payton II (on roster but never logged minutes against Lebron)  5. Glenn Robinson Jr/III  6. Gary Trent Sr/Jr
"Bob Myers and Steve Kerr met with reporters on Monday afternoon, wrapping the just-completed Warriors season. Myers speaks far less regularly than Kerr and isn’t often as forthcoming as he was in this interview. So his answers, leading into this crucial offseason, were the most noteworthy.  It isn’t too difficult to read the planned direction the Warriors intend to take. Myers said he’s “pretty confident” the team will work out a contract extension with Stephen Curry this summer, which will be the formal $215 million max commitment to the next five seasons of Curry’s closing title window.  “When you’re lucky enough to kind of fall into a player like that in my position, you owe it to them to try to win,” said Myers, the president of basketball operations. “Those people don’t come along too often.”  Does that mean a home run swing to maximize next season’s roster, at all costs? No. Because we know, even before the summer market materializes, there will be teams willing to trade bit parts for long-term control of a prospect with the upside of James Wiseman. Think Boston would flip Marcus Smart’s expiring $14 million deal for him? Would Chicago send Thaddeus Young? Would Orlando part with Terrance Ross?  Of course. The decade-long possibility of Wiseman is more valued than a season or two of a steady role player. Smart, Young and Ross are better 2021 NBA players than Wiseman and would presumably nudge next season’s Warriors team closer to the title conversation, barring a huge Wiseman sophomore leap.  But the internal belief within the Warriors is that’d be bad business — selling low on a 20-year-old you drafted second overall seven months ago before giving his talent a chance to blossom. That’s why Myers delivered this quote when asked about the idea of trading Wiseman for immediate help.  “No,” Myers said. “I think he can help us. I expect him to be on the team next year. We don’t want to trade James Wiseman. I think he’s a tremendous talent and he was put in a position where, again, the guy is taking hopefully all of his lumps early in his career, but I think he can be very helpful to us in the future. I think he can be helpful in the present. We plan on him being on the team. We plan on him helping us.”  It’s naive to read that quote as an iron-clad lock. Remember this soundbite?   Seven months after delivering that quote, Myers did trade D’Angelo Russell in the first season of a four-year deal. But that reroute was only made when a delicious enough deal materialized — Andrew Wiggins plus both of Minnesota’s 2021 draft picks. If the Timberwolves aren’t obsessed with him, who knows when or if Russell is moved.  Myers can’t say it and shouldn’t say it, but of course, the right offer could move him off Wiseman. What if a rebuilding team like the Thunder dangled Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for Wiseman and these two upcoming first-rounders? Or if Houston suggested a Christian Wood center swap to better fit each other’s timelines? We could list 25 other intriguing hypotheticals.  But as of now, the Warriors seem to be operating under the assumption that a can’t-miss deal won’t arrive at their doorstep and are comfortable entering the season with an older Wiseman, who Myers said should be ready for training camp after rehabbing his knee injury this summer.  “We really hope and think that he’ll be available for that,” Myers said.  If the Minnesota pick conveys, it’ll most likely be in the six to eight range. The Warriors’ own pick is almost assuredly going to be 14th overall. Lottery night (June 22) is the first big summer checkpoint. It’ll deliver them a better idea of which prospects they could possibly draft and give trade partners a better ability to evaluate what type of package the Warriors could offer.  Myers wasn’t dismissive of the idea of adding two more rookies to a roster that already includes Wiseman. But it’s clear, if that’s the path they choose, the Warriors will be searching for more polished players ready to compete immediately. The idea would be to go into the season with Wiseman as the biggest project on the roster.  “I do think young players can help,” Myers said. “It depends on when or how.”  But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up.  “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”  Myers even further clarified his free-agent preferences.  “The ones that have kind of done it before, maybe been in playoff series,” Myers said. “Guys that maybe can stretch the floor, maybe a shooting big, maybe a play-making guard. Our defense I think finished fifth. Maybe some more offensive-minded guys."""
"I don't think [Myers](https://theathletic.com/2610671/2021/05/24/bob-myers-on-the-warriors-offseason-veteran-help-needed-no-plan-to-trade-james-wiseman/) would disagree.  &gt; But changes are still coming. Alen Smailagic won’t populate the roster. Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Damion Lee have a tenuous grip on their non-guaranteed spots. The meat of the Warriors rotation needs a boost and Myers made it clear what type of players those have to be, a mandate internally agreed upon by Curry, Draymond Green, Kerr and on up. &gt;  &gt; “I do know we need veterans,” Myers said. “We have to add some veterans in free agency. We just have to. We’re well aware of that. We’ll try to do it. We actually tried to do it last year with a few guys, so it wasn’t as if that mindset didn’t exist. It doesn’t matter, nobody cares, but we were in second place with quite a few guys that I think could have helped, but they chose to go to a team after Klay (Thompson’s) injury that they thought they could win it more and that’s fair to them.”"
"Yup. If Mychal Mulder was not going to play much, why not play Damion Lee or Gary Payton II a spell?"
"Imagine Kerr looking down at his bench for a spark and he sees Jordan Bell, Gary Payton II, Nico Mannion and Alen Smailagic   Masterclass by Bob Meyers of how to build a shit team around a GOAT level player"
Joe Bryant Darryl Dawkins Dennis Rodman Kobe Bryant  Gary Payton Ervin Johnson Andrew Bought Gary Payton II
We picked him up a bit ago. We signed him and Gary Payton II around the time JTA got his contract.
"&gt;	warriors had multiple open roster spots and after seeing him in the bubble chose players like JTA and Gary Payton II over him  It was more about fit and need than anything. JTA fills a need for a big man with skills who can do it all at an acceptable level and GP2 is a defensive specialist at the guard position.  They didn’t have an open roster spot for someone with Lin’s skills.  They already have Poole and mannion at that point guard spot so Lin would be redundant.  Not saying that he’s not as good as them, but they’re both already contracted to the warriors."
"Guys like Wanamaker and Teague have been on teams all year. All the other top-10 scorers in the G-League got some kind of look this season. Yogi Ferrell and Gary Payton II got signed after putting up much worse numbers. It's not a conspiracy, but you can't say Lin didn't get the short end somehow.  Ultimately I think Lin missing some G-League games to injury hurt him. It was always gonna be an uphill fight no matter what numbers he put up, but once you get that injury-prone label, it unfortunately sticks with you."
Warriors basically had no point in signing Lin. They had Poole and Mannion. JTA and then the signing of Gary Payton II served a specific purpose that did not require another offense first PG.
I think it just shows he doesn't have it anymore. The warriors had multiple open roster spots and after seeing him in the bubble chose players like JTA and Gary Payton II over him. We desperately need experienced players and passed on him which I think is telling.
"Dray and Wiggins are off limits. But I wouldn't mind taking KCP for Mychal Mulder, Caruso for Gary Payton II, and Zubac for Jordan Bell.  Oubre's kind of a moot point right now since he's out another 7-10 days before reevaluation.... and I think that news was broke Thursday or Friday? I get the feeling dude probably needs to either shut it down or get surgery for the torn wrist ligament and broken palm, but he's holding out until Warriors get eliminated before completely ruling out a return because there appears to be a chance that he can still play without getting surgery or shutting down in a best case scenario."
"Jonas Valančiūnas absolute abused us. Don't worry. We don't have much in the way of reinforcements (Jordan Bell, lol, and Gary Payton II signing again this weekend)  By the way that is also me right now."
"Also I get that signing Oubre meant taking a huge tax hit, but then when guys like Chriss go down for the season, don't sign a vet big man (lots of fans wanted to sign Dedmon, for example), and run an 8 man rotation ragged hoping nobody gets injured while leaving roster spots open until the deadline before signing Jordan Bell and Gary Payton II (to be done over the weekend) just to meet minimum...  It's a weird dichotomy between spending huge and trimming at the edges. I get that every bit of extra tax bill hurts, but still... gotta protect the players you already have, or else franchise is DONE done."
Jordan bell and Gary Payton II coming to play tonight
Gary Payton doesn't have that problem. Man had sons with 2 different women and called them Gary Payton Jr and Gary Payton II 😂
“Gary Payton Jr. errr the Second”  Because Gary Payton II and Gary Payton Jr. are two different people.
"Warriors' scout read u/Zachtpres [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/mmgz8v/gary_payton_ii_in_the_gleague_is_a_shame/) and was actually impressed by him, oh and Gary Payton II too, probably."
Gary Payton II? They did get into a bit of an extended argument over seemingly nothing
Hence Gary Payton II. His half brother is Gary Jr.
I still believe in Gary Payton II.
Is Gary Payton II legit?
Gary Payton II would be the best option for them to take
Would he be a servicable PG though?  We're picking from.  Quinn Cook Isaiah Thomas Arcediacano Avery Bradley Darren Collison Gary Payton II Chris Chiozza  Cook has a Championship or two... always shot well.  Knows the system extremely well.  I think this is actually the one they pull trigger on gut feeling.
"The Glove and Gary Payton II aka ""The Mitten"" (he only played 71 games over 6 seasons)"
"Melvin and devin Booker, Gary trent and Gary trent Jr, Larry Nance and Larry Nance Jr, Stan and Kevin love, Mitchell and Andrew Wiggins, doc and Austin rivers, Wes and Wesley matthews, Gary Payton and Gary Payton II, Terry and Ed Davis, there are way more"
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
"They don't have a true backup PG. I personally think Poole can get there but right now he's at best a combo guard who probably can be relied on to run your offense if Curry's not available.   That was one of the biggest problems for the Warriors last season. Curry was amazing but he had to be. That roster didn't have anyone on it who could take some load off of Curry and punish teams for loading up on him. Wanamaker just didn't play well and the only secondary ball handler the team really had was Draymond.   Training camp will be a competition between Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder and Darren Collison. If Collison looks at all like he used to he's the obvious choice, to me at least."
"As of now, it’s GP2, Gary Payton II. Very good on defense, G-League DPOY as well but he’s very limited offensively."
Chiming in to remind everyone that Gary Payton has two sons with two different mothers - one is Gary Jr. and one is Gary II
"Joke's on you, OP is actually Gary Payton II"
"Yeah G-league talent isn't indicative of NBA young talent. NBA level talent tends to be playing in the NBA regardless of age.   The Rockets' affiliate Rio Grande won the last G-League title and their best players were Hartenstein and Gary Payton II, Hartenstein is a role player for the Nuggets now and Payton is on a different G-League team. Rio Grande is also the most successful G-League team ever but the only player to sign for Rio Grande and then make the Rockets in the last 10 years is Isiah Taylor. (Players like Capela and Beverly signed pro contracts with the Rockets before being assigned to Rio)  There are a few individual player success stories but overall most teams are hoping their G-League program can turn a late second rounder or an undrafted FA into an end of the bench NBA player. Having a good program is important for those reasons but W/L is essentially meaningless."
Wait…that’s why he’s Gary Payton II and not Junior? Woooooowwww
"also, he named the oldest son gary payton ii.  why not jr?  did he already sense he'd name another son gary payton?  (ii and jr. are half-brothers.)"
I think you qualify as an insane person when you name one kid Gary Payton Jr and the other Gary Payton II.
Gary Payton II and Luke Kennard
How is he Gary Payton II if there's already a a GP Jr?  He should be GP III
Gary Payton II: The Mitten
"Sons of NBA stars rarely almost never become stars themselves. Idk why.  Klay Thompson is the closest example I can think of- his dad was really good, a #1 overall draft pick and averaged 18/9 in his prime but never an all star.   Thinking about NBA legends kids who have made the league or even come close- Patrick Ewing Jr was a nobody who had a 10-day once, Gary Payton II keeps going in and out, Wade's kid is a D-League guy now, Luke Walton had a decade long career as a scrub, John Stockton's kid maybe had some 10-days, and that's really all I can think of."
"His brother, Gary Payton Jr, got his hops from his dad. Gary Payton II got the mom's DNA."
"His mom, on the other hand, haaates that nickname:  &gt;“Who wants to be a mitten?” Monique said in disgust Sunday. “That is whack!”  https://www.si.com/college/2015/02/11/gary-payton-ii-oregon-state-pac-12"
"Draymond with the Draymond, Wiggins with the Wiggins, Curry with the LeBron, Gary Payton II with the Gary Payton I.  Interesting how much of a back seat Bjelica took tonight once Kerr figured out the problem was staying in front of Fox/Mitchell/Barnes.  Nice to see Barnes doing well, by the by.  I swear I thought Poole had a terrible game from all the hero shots he threw away, but I guess he was making them while I wasn't looking."
Gary Payton II was huge in this game. So many defensive plays. Our bench looks solid this year too.
"Gary Payton II played great on both sides of the court.  Defense was special, man should get paid if he keeps this consistent."
Gary Payton II was huge in this game. So many defensive plays. Our bench looks solid this year too.
Only Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II have better shooting splits than Draymond this game.  I'm sure we all expected that of course
Eric Bledsoe on a contender: Gary Payton  Eric Bledsoe on the Pelicans: Gary Payton II
Feeling like our decision to take Gary Payton II was a good one
"GP2 actually costs them a little more, i think.  GP2 has some gauranteed money, AB has no details like that noted about his contract, i guess, means he can be cut whenever and he just gets paid whatever the prorated portion of his contract is...?  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/avery-bradley-6901/  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/gary-payton-ii-20272/"
Make Gary Payton II the starting point guard
Every time I read “Gary Payton II” I say it “Gary Payton two” and then I imagine a movie franchise called “Gary Payton”
&gt; I went to middle school with Gary Payton Jr. Not Gary Payton II  TIL lol
"Speaking for just the 538 model here, and it's that [they're not confident Klay will be back to top form](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-bucks-run-it-back-can-lebron-win-his-fifth-ring-how-our-model-sees-the-2021-22-nba-season/).  It also looks like [Curry has a wider variance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/stephen-curry/), possibly in part due to the change in the rules for drawing fouls.  &gt; We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games.

"Fun fact: I went to middle school with Gary Payton Jr. Not Gary Payton II, his other son named Gary Payton who’s basically the same age as Gary Payton II but has a different mother.  I remember Jr loved basketball, but he wasn’t really good at all…"
"*clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game*  *ball is inbounded to Avery Bradley who turns face to face against Gary Payton II*  ""You took my contract""  *moves to the left*  ""You took my friends""  *moves to the right*  ""You took a deal that was guaranteed for me""  *clock winds down to 2*  ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR STEPH AND DRAYMOND""  *goes up, fire coming out of his shoes*  ""BESTORGANIZATIONFROMTOPTOBOTTOM""  *Ball flies over Payton's head, goes straight into basket.

"There was one game where Gary Payton II played and looked great, so Bradley kinda picked it up since they were both gunning for that 15th spot, but other than that he was pretty bad.  I wonder if he was just coasting, because he felt like he had the job in the bag with Steph and Andre on board with signing him?"
"Imagine calling picking gary payton II a developmental move when hes literally in his prime at 28 years of age, Marcus a clown for that disrespect."
"In this case I think Steph and Dray were wrong. AB looked pretty washed in most of the preseason, and what we'd need him for, Gary Payton II would have been better at."
"Didn’t look great in preseason. I counted at least two instances in which the commentators were praising his defense only for him to get blown by and give up an and-1. I think he’d be a more favorable signing if we weren’t already considering Gary Payton II for the final roster spot. He’s younger, more athletic, and has flashes where he looks like his dad harassing the POA.  It’s tough to evaluate either because of small sample sizes but GPII still looked solid in limited minutes last season."
Gary Payton I  Gary Payton II  Gary Payton III  Gary Payton IV  Gary Payton V  Gary Payton VI  Gary Payton VII  Gary Payton VIII  Gary Payton IX  Gary Payton X  Gary Payton XI  Gary Payton XII
Gary Payton II almost pooped himself in a preseason game and still got the job over him
Makes sense. Gary Payton II is just a younger and better version of him at this point
"Well, the Warriors only have three RAPTOR positive players: Curry, Draymond, and... Gary Payton II?  So, obviously, we're going to get our asses kicked this season.   I would love it if they'd just put their money where their mouth is on these ""predictions.""  They could make an absolute fortune just betting over/unders on this nonsense."

"Gary Payton has two sons, Gary Payton Jr. and Gary Payton II"
Why you go at Gary Payton II like that 💀
PSA Gary Payton II and Gary Payton Jr. are two different people.
Gary Payton II deserves a spot that Avery Bradley looks like he’s going to win
Gary Payton has two sons named Gary: the Gary Payton II in the NBA and another Gary Payton Jr. by another mother.
"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
I don’t really have a firm stance. I’ve literally just been asking for more details on how he was an All League level guard defender.   The two explanations I’ve got is that he’s the worst offensive player in the league so surely this must mean mean that he’s an all league quality defender because he still got 17 mpg over 27 games played. The other explanation is that he had two games where he had six steals.   Apparently it’s controversial to say that this isn’t enough evidence for me to buy into their claim? It’s been all “trust me bro” and no real substance. I could list out all of the 2020 guards I’d confidently take over Gary Payton II purely on defense if you’d like. It’d be at least 10-15 guards.
Gary Payton II would kill for Mattises offensive game (and more importantly his size)
"I went to a local community college my first year out of high school in 2013.  As I was walking in the campus I saw advertisements for tickets to see the basketball team play.  Front and center I say the name #**GARY PAYTON** in the middle of the advertisement with ^^II barely visible.  I thought it's got to be a coincidence, why the hell would Gary Paytons son be playing college ball for some random ass community college in a suburb of salt lake city?  But sure enough it was him.  His best year that he played here he only averaged like 14 points, not surprising to me that his offense isn't even below average at the NBA level lol"
"I was gonna say, those 6 steals were wild  Was legit magnet tier  Most of these dudes have never watched a full NBA game lol nvm a Gary Payton II game"
"Of course, we shouldn't also confuse them with Gary Payton II II, and Gary Payton Jr. III, both also from Gary Payton Sr.'s balls."
Everybody please make sure that you don't confuse Gary Payton II with Gary Payton Jr because they are both real people who exist and came out of Gary Payton's balls.
"Zach is using hyperbole here, but a bunch of you haven’t watch Gary Payton II.    If you’re a Wiz fan, you’ll remember his 16 steals in 4 games, including 2 games with 6 steals each. The dude is an absolute lockdown defender.    His issue is he’s a complete zero on offense. Like he can’t even dribble."
"Gary Payton and Gary Payton II are not the same player, one came first.  Also calling Gary Payton a role player is absurd, he averaged 24 ppg on 50% fg% along with *9 assists* and being the best defensive PG in the league during his best season, and led the sonics to the finals. Matisse Thybulle averages 4 points in 20 minutes despite being a great defender"
Yeah Gary Payton II would be a nobody in today’s game
"&gt; Im pretty sure OP is Avery's burner just trying to see how many fans would agree with him  This suggestion implies that you think *I* agree with him.  Maybe he's still got the ability to be that good and has just been half-assing it lately but on recent performance the ABC Fact Check rated this one a ""bro are you ok""  *If* he makes the Warriors squad I'll be hoping he returns to form, but I'm not sure I'd take him over Gary Payton II after how they both looked last season."
Should they bench curry for Gary Payton II
“Without him contributing” I wonder why Gary Payton II has like 6 open dunks/layups
"Holy shit, Gary Payton II is +16"
"Gary ""flying glove"" payton II"
"Man, Gary Payton II is such a steal. I hate how competent the Warriors front office is."
Can't say I saw Gary Payton II being the best role player in the NBA but here we are I guess.
Gary MF Payton II
Gary Payton II is +144 in 267 minutes btw…
Avery Bradley is 2 years older than Gary Payton II
"That was a money saving gamble:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmurray/2021/10/25/gary-payton-ii-shows-why-the-golden-state-warriors-paid-an-extra-10m-in-luxury-tax](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmurray/2021/10/25/gary-payton-ii-shows-why-the-golden-state-warriors-paid-an-extra-10m-in-luxury-tax)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;But that wasn’t the end of the story. Gary Payton II had been previously signed to a partially guaranteed contract at the end of last season. By waiving him and then re-signing him to a new veteran minimum contract the Warriors ended up with their 15th man, and a smaller saving of $1.7m in luxury tax, thanks to the difference between Payton’s contract signed last season and the portion of the veteran minimum that actually counts against the salary cap."
"I mean… it has John Collins, Fred VanVleet, and Alex Caruso as better players than Durant  And it has Gary Payton II as the 21st best player in the league  And it has the Warriors at 4% chance to win the championship at this point in time (with an 18-2 record!) even though it assumes Klay will return."
Is he a better defender than Gary Payton II?
"People still consider him as a meme player, and at the most as a ""hustle guy"", but after watching him for 20 games, he's much closer to Draymond Green than to Gary Payton II. He's very very good. Just makes any team a lot better. Can't believe he's signed to the MLE"
"rookie mistake from the Warriors front office. they could've kept Gary Payton 2.0 alongside Gary Payton II, and used a Polymerization spell card to combine them into Gary Payton 4"
I think we need ESPN to come out with a top 100 Gary Payton II nickname list for us all to argue about. DeRozan will still somehow be 82nd.
"Whenever you devise a metric, you always want it to spew out like 90% what you'd expect and 10% you didn't.   Unrelatedly, the top 6 in EPM are   1. Nikola Jokic  2. Steph Curry  3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kevin Durant  6. Gary Payton II  Who would have expected Durant to be up there?"
"Gary ""Catholic Bishop"" Payton II"
Gary “Bad Touch” Payton II
Gary Payton II is higher 🥱
"Gary Payton II also made it out of the G league and is a defensive dog and became massively popular this season. Caruso's looks contribute to his popularity but I think it's more that he looks goofy (in part because of his whiteness) than his whiteness  I mostly agree with the broad point about white players but it's not like guys like Plumlee are massively popular just because they're white, most popular players have other reasons that make them notable"
Or in Gary Payton's case he has two sons named Gary Payton Jr and Gary Payton II. If both of them have sons that follow suit there might be two guys named Gary Payton III playing in the NBA in 20 years. Or would one of them be named Gary Payton III II to avoid confusion?
"Thanks. And a good example is Gary Payton I and II. ""The glove"" and ""the mitten"" etc. I do feel like some of the hype wouldn't be there if Junior was actually named Doug Payton."
"Bingo! I wish more of our fans understood that.   Got people pointing at what Garbua is doing w/ RGV and saying he should've got minutes with the Rockets and, no, that's now how that works *at all*. JC really needs to be sent down to RGV to get minutes at that speed for a season or so, then see how he looks getting rotational minutes with the Rockets.  Sengun was the Turkish league MVP - dude is ready for NBA minutes. Garuba is close, but I personally think he needs to marinade w/ RGV for their season. Christopher is incredibly rough around the edges, but he's the exact type of dude that seems like he just needs some minutes at the G-League level to smooth his game out.  Hartenstein, K.J. Martin, KPJ, Gary Payton II, Montrezl Harrell, Clint Capela, Robert Covington - all those dudes put in minutes with RGV and are starting or getting significant minutes off the bench. Still makes me mad we let GP2 go to the Warriors - he was something special with RGV, all 3 times he was with us lol"
Poor man Gary Payton II
Already happening:  Gary Payton II starting PG for the best team in basketball.
"Gary Payton II- about 2m. Shoots 70%&amp;47% from 3. Obviously on very low volume, dunks&amp; open 3s, but good shot selection is difficult to come by&amp;does it while playing amazing defense   Patty Mills- 12m shooting 48% from 3"
"Yup, one is Gary Payton II, the other is Gary Payton Jr"
funnily enough Gary payton has one son named gary payton jr and one named gary payton II. Payton II is on the warriors
"Gary Payton II, on the warriors."
"Minor injuries on the later half of a back-to-back means its a good idea to rest any of your veterans that need rest. Also Klay and Wiseman are legit injured.  It also gives a good opportunity to see what players like Gary Payton II, Jordan Poole, JTA, and Wiggins will offer with more of a primary role. And in addition it gives our good rookies some needed NBA minutes and playing time."
Only Gary Payton II could start instead of Hayes
"Remove Curry, he is all defense this season and has been playing the best defense of his career, he's a combination of Gary Payton and Gary Payton II and locks kids left and right  The Massive Glove"

Will Gary payton ii win most improved player of the year award?
Gary Payton II has entered the chat
This was true last year but Gary Payton II is filling a very similar role now for the Warriors
Gary 'The Jump' Payton II
So no one is tuning in for Gary Payton II?
"Bucks: ""can we have Gary Payton II?""  We have Gary Payton II at home.  *Camera pans to Semi missing a dunk"""
gary payton II is the GOAT conversation ended
Where is Gary Payton II?
No go overreact with your bros u get free upvotes  Gary Payton II is literally better than his dad
Gary Payton II is the unanimous best player in the league.
Is Gary Payton II the Lamonte Wade Jr. of the NBA?
Other teams traded for a difference maker while all we got was Gary Payton II.
"DSJ is only 23, I think there's still time for him to turn it around, refine his game and get himself a role somewhere similar to Gary Payton II but he has to put in the work, get into the right mentality and get in the right situation.  His defense has improved since he's came into the league, from what I remember watching a few games with him on the Pistons he looked good, he still has ways to go though."
And his name is Gary Payton II.
thats his other son. this is gary payton II
"Damn I had no idea that Gary Payton II was Gary Payton's son, thankfully the broadcast cleared it up"
Gary Payton II is so dope
I think Gary Payton II is actually Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton's son. That's where he get his hops from.
Battle of the Centers: Bruce Brown vs Gary Payton II
and gleague dpoy gary payton ii!
"The Mitten (Gary Payton Ii) may not me as good as his dad was, but he's still pretty good tbh"
"Dumb move, should have held on to Caruso. I think Pelinka has done a good job overall, but the list of players we've given up for nothing could make a pretty good squad...Randle, Brook Lopez, D'Lo, Caruso, Thomas Bryant, Gary Payton II, Dennis Schroeder, and David Nwaba. You gotta get SOMETHING for those assets. Not to mention the Westbrook trade, which has a chance to be Pelinka's Mozgov/Deng signing...the one move that unwinds years of otherwise solid work. I do like THT though, 3/$30M was a good deal."
Time to trade steph and build around gary payton II
"Kevon Looney and Gary Payton II should both be able to stay over 50% at low volume, considering most of their shots are layups and dunks and they almost only shoot when wide open.  Bjelica also has a chance to stay above 50% if his shot selection stays smart."
"Gary Payton II, Cam Payne, PJ Tucker, Joe Ingles etc"
"Oh glad you put other markers for athleticism. Also again Cade has been injured and again has had limited games to feel out the NBA game.  You classified Cade as a non-starter due to all those reasons but again Andre Miller, and Nate Robinson have been on the smaller side but still had success.  As for acceleration and deceleration, and shot creating Jamal Crawford has that and he became a starter himself and a great 6th man.  So again maybe give the kid some time. Look at Gary Payton II took some time to discover his game and now he's got significant minutes on the Warriors."
"It's way to early to speculate, but I think a team with proven playoff performers in Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Andre will be alright. The young guys will have some shaky moments, but Bjelica and OPJ ought to be up to the task, and Gary Payton II is a nice situational defensive stopper when one is needed. Looney is also a steady sort of guy who is underrated defensively"
*putting my homer goggles on  with martians pointing death ray at earth  I WANT GARY PAYTON II
Gary Payton II dude averages like 10 steals per 36!
"I just wanna point out that Gary Payton II is averaging 2.3 steals per game over his last 6 games, since he's been getting some real minutes and not just 3rd team time."
"well considering that the Warriors have had pretty low draft picks in the Kerr era, they’ve done alright with Jordan Poole, and given other teams’ discarded players (Marquese Chriss, Gary Payton II) some decent looks bodes well. But i’ll agree with you, before Jordan Poole’s recent rise, I was disappointed about our player development, until I realized late draft picks don’t usually pan out. They’ve taken steps this year to shore up the development by hiring the coach that mentored Jokic and Kenny Atkinson as an asset coach. I have faith moving forward, they seem to have realized that they have incoming fresh young talent and it’s the cheapest way of adding good players to a maxed out roster."
"Gonna plug my guy here and point out that Thybulle's per 36 is 3.4 steals/game and 2.4 blocks/game.  Caruso is 3.3 stl/game and 0.4 blocks/game.  PG is 2.6stl/game and 0.5 blocks/game.  Gary Trent is 2.6stl/game and 0.5 blocks/game.  Gary Payton II is 3.8 stl/game and 0.2 blocks/game.  In summary, Matisse Thybulle is a fucking monster on the defensive end."
Steph wanted to keep Avery Bradley instead of Gary Payton II and Bob Myers said no. There’s your answer to proper autonomy for a franchise player.
"""If the team was catered more to his needs""   How do you define that?  So if Steph gets into the playoff w Warriors as the 1st seed he'll be considered a carry? There are no all stars on the team or any all star calibre player. The only person who's close to an all star is Draymond, who many of you are saying is an offensive liability. And he probably wont be an all star. Then you have Klay who's coming back from 2 major injuries. Realistically speaking, he's not going to be the same. The team is filled with people who didnt manage to get a roster spot (Gary Payton II, Juan, Damion Lee) and players who cant get meaningful mins on other teams (Bjelica) and injury prone players like OPJ. In case you talk about last season, Warriors werent catered to Steph needs. Front office was forcing Kerr to play Wiseman. Oubre, Bazemore and Wanamaker doesnt fit out system at all."
"I love Gary Payton II, he was great at Oregon State and I'm happy to see him showing how good he can be in the NBA."
Gary Payton II deserves a shout out too

"https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2016/1/21/10784768/gary-payton-ii-oregon-state-beavers-glove-trash-talk   &gt; The elder Payton noticed none of the competitive fire that made him a Hall of Fame point guard. For a man who had no reservations about talking trash to Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals, watching his son's passive, almost apathetic approach to the game drove him mad. So Payton got up and left the stands.  &gt; Payton sought out Darrel Jordan, Payton II's AAU coach and trainer, and told him he didn't think his son had the attitude to be a good player. Then, back at home, he lit into his kid.  &gt; ""He was soft. He was really soft,"" Payton told SB Nation. ""I told him, I just told my son straight up -- I don't like your game. I don't think you're good enough to play at the next level or any level. I don't have to waste my time coming here.""  &gt; Going through adolescence with the same name as his famous father was difficult enough for Gary Payton II. Playing a game he wasn't sure he loved under the ruthless guidance of a legend only made things harder. The truth is that Payton II has never been wired the same way as his dad: while the senior Payton's brash personality became synonymous with his incredible talent, the younger Gary Payton had a disposition more in line with his mother, Monique.  &gt; GPII was calm and thoughtful, decidedly nice and universally liked by anyone who met him. Only in the cutthroat world of sports can those descriptors become pejoratives. Payton II acknowledges today this was a time in his life when he dreaded the thought of his father coming to his games.  &gt; ""I didn't know how to handle it with him in my ear,"" Payton II said. ""It really got to me. Just playing in high school, he used to be there yelling and screaming. I broke down and really got off my game. I didn't want to play."""
180* reverse dunks?  Zach Levine: 0  Gary Payton II: 1
"I mean, it's not like there are many point guards in the league that are better on defense than Steph to begin with. Ben Simmons is the only ""point guard"" that was clearly better than Steph on defense, and he retired. Now, Gary Payton II is the only clear cut better defensive point guard. No reason to pick on Westbrook here."
Gary Payton II.
tonight's card is Gary Payton II v.s. Alex Caruso.
if you google gary payton and it says he has sons named Gary Payton Jr AND Gary Payton II
"That’s a counter-productive way to incentive player development though. Often players need a new team or system to develop or find themselves, and rewarding teams like that would harm player development because teams would be more likely to hold on to guys that aren’t fitting in the hopes they get some savings.   Gary Payton II is a good example of this. The warriors have found a role for him that other teams couldn’t figure out. Nurkic is a good example of this too, he was basically doing nothing on the nuggets and got traded to the blazers where he’s vastly improved and found a role. I’m sure most blazers fans would think of Nurkic as a talent they developed and is closer to “homegrown” than not. Imagine if Nurkic was still on the nuggets too, Jokic might have never gotten the chance to develop into the star he is.  Player movement should be encouraged above all else because it’s the best way for guys to develop and for teams to find players that they value. This is a little different when it comes to stars though, since they don’t need new roles to develop."
Gary Payton ~~II~~ idolizes the goat.
He's acceptable. You'll make the playoffs with Olshey as your GM. He has a very above average eye for guard talent (though I'm salty about releasing Gary Payton II in 2019). He's atrocious at acquiring forwards which kind of caps the title hopes.
"Gary Payton II looks up Alex ""The GOAT"" Caruso in place of HoFer, DPOY and top 75 all time player Gary ""The Glove"" Payton"

And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.  5 RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives, among the team’s projected rotation players."
Gary Payton II has a higher raptor but he hadn't played enough minutes yet.
"Nah, he's gonna buy a trampoline and see how it feels like to be Gary Payton II."
Gary Payton II
Gary Payton has 2 sons named Gary Payton II so I'm putting both of them on the team.
I’ve been reading his name wrong this whole time - it’s Gary Payton II not Gary Payton III.  Did the glove have something against calling him Jr?
"Honest question, isn't he Gary Payton Jr. until he has a son and also names him Gary Payton? Then him Gary Payton II and his son Gary Payton III."
Yeah wth is going on with Gary Payton II right now??

Avery Bradley these days are about as productive as Gary Payton II you have on your roster tbh
"&gt;this means he was supposed to succeed as an NBA player  is gary payton II ""supposed to succeed as an NBA player"" because he's the son of an NBA legend?  how can you recognize that the NBA is damn near impossible to get in, but then say something as dense as this  curry worked his ass off to get to where he's at, you can absolutely frame him as an underdog depending on how you look at it  it's just not socioeconomically, but that's not the only way you can be an underdog"
Then there's also Gary Payton II tipping that inbound pass casually..
"like Gary Payton’s sons, Gary Payton II and Gary Payton Jr."
"I know the gather rule and I just disagree with it. I don't get what's stopping Gary Payton II from taking one more while he does his 1-2 gather. It's so unfair for offensive players to be able to get 5-6 steps without dribbling while ""gathering the ball"". There's no defense for it. It's stupid &amp; not basketball."
TIL that Gary Payton II and Gary Payton Jr. are two different people
"Gary Payton II broke Reddit, legend."
Is Gary Payton II the best basketball player of all time?
Not sure whether I'd rather have Frank or Gary Payton II as a depth guard. Both are defensive-minded guards without much else.
"PJ Tucker, who you just acknowledged was very useful for a championship team, for 5 years was OUT OF THE LEAGUE. He was in Europe because he couldn't find a job as a defensive specialist, even though he was getting paid less than double the vet minimum. And this guy is pretty much the only proven good defender on Durant. Like I said, if Thybulle was playing on the Pistons right now, he would not have a clear future at all in the NBA. Playing for a big market put him in the spotlight and he's being recognized for it, but defense alone is not a valued skilled in the league even if it is intrinsically valuable. Deny it all you want but there are many examples.    Gary Payton II just won DPOY in the G League but he also won that in college too, he has always had incredible defense. He's even averaging 20 ppg in the G league. He JUST signed for the Warriors and he's 28 years old. I'm telling you that defense is not a hard skill to find..."
"Poole is a combo guard, Gary Payton II is a defensive guard hardly a point guard, Nico Manion"
Lmao there are literally FO out in this league that have been torturing their fans for decades and this dude really getting mad over Gary Payton II
"A few short years ago AKA 8-9 years ago, but I am not going to disagree that Summer League results should be taken that seriously. Some good players will dominate, some bad players will dominate. Hard to take anything away from it just based on stats.  Regarding Gary Payton II, he is about as good as a ball hawk as anyone else. Whether or not getting a lot of steals = good defense is up for debate, but he really has a nose for stealing the ball ([The Athletic wrote a good article about him this year if you have a subscription](https://theathletic.com/2427319/2021/03/05/raptors-905-star-defender-gary-payton-ii-on-the-art-of-the-steal/)). He also has a 6'7"" wingspan and as you said, good athleticism. I am sure in some era a team would see him as having high defensive potential and give him a contract, especially an era that relied less on advanced stats and more on counting stats."
"The warriors can get to $6.5 million in salaries with Paschall + 3 player that the Jazz could immediately waive and pay $0 to (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder, Smailagic).  Not sure if the Moody salary can be used as well, or if there's a moratorium on trading him as soon as he signs?"
"the salaries for #7 is like $4.5M and #14 is $3M, plus smiley is $1.8M, that's $9.3M to ja's $9.6M, maybe that doesn't work...?  but gary payton ii is $2M, so it's like $9.5M, i think that's allowed."
$14.2M in salaries?  wiseman+smiley+mychal mulder+gary payton ii.  if you don't want them just waive them before their next year becomes gauranteed.
"Wish Gary Payton II would get a bigger chance. Seems like every year he comes in on a 10 day, plays well, but gets demoted regardless"
Gary Payton II is knocking...
"Any deal with Oubre would be a one year thing, with the other years being non-guaranteed.  If they include Wiseman and some of their non-guaranteed players, then Oubre wouldn't need a big deal.     Say they target Siakam, they would have to send out around $25m to match salaries.  Wiseman is set to make about $9.1m.  Gary Payton II and Alen Smailagic are around $3.7m combined.  That leaves Oubre making around $12.2m for one year.  The Warriors have two or three other guys on non-guaranteed deals, so they could drop Oubre's needed salary down another $1.8m-5.4m.      Even without Wiseman, it'd be about $21m for one year of Oubre.  That's around what Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield and Garry Harris will make next year.  Yeah, it's not good, but it's not Kevin Love or John Wall bad.  Would be a legendary tax bill though for the Warriors though."
Miami Heat Gary Payton? Father of the legendary defender Gary Payton II?
"their team might actually have gotten a lot worse by losing PJ tucker  he's not a big scoring guy but he's just so impactful in so many other ways on the court  maybe he's more important to winning than anyone thinks, even if he's not as flashy as giannis or khris  they lost their alex caruso or gary payton II style dude who just wants to fight on defense all game and be a ballhawk"
"let me guess, first is gary payton II?"
*Gary Payton II  Gary Payton Jr is his brother lmao
"Nah, Steph saw all the shine Gary Payton II was getting and needed to remind folks he still fucks the sky."
In another post somebody said Gary Payton II was one of their biggest lob threats. And the guy is about Seth Curry's size so I thought I must be reading that wrong. But nope.
Starting centers will be Bruce Brown and Gary Payton II.
"But doesn’t Gary Payton Jr’s son become Gary Payton II, isn’t that how the naming works or am I tripping?"
Do the 2021-22 Warriors have the record for most NBA sons?  * Steph - Dell Curry (1986-2002) * Klay - Mychal Thompson (1978-1991) * Andrew - Mitchell Wiggins (1983-1987; 1989-1992) * Gary II - Gary Payton (1990-2007)

Gary Payton II is four months younger than Gary Payton Jr., and has a different mother."
"I mean...that's usually how this works. Usually the II is called Jr and all subsequent ones are III, IV, and so on. For example Russell Westbrook the NBA player is Russell Westbrook III, because his dad was Russell Westbrook Jr.   Gary Payton fucked up because he named 2 different kids II and Jr....typically they'd be the same person."
Gary Payton II been donating yams to opposing teams in a charitable fashion too.
Gary Payton II being the most explosive dunker in the league
Gary Payton II of the Warriors.
"&gt; GP2   Gary Payton II.  But yes, it's ridiculous that the person gave him an abbreviation.  And even worse, it was in response to a person talking about ""the best defenders"" in the league.  Draymond, Kawhi, Gobert, and of course, GP2."

Is this Gary Payton Jr. or the II?
"Jordan Poole scored 26 points, Stephen Curry had 19 and the Golden State Warriors routed the New Orleans Pelicans 126-85 on Friday night to improve to 7-1.  Gary Payton II added 17 points, and the Warriors broke it open with a 34-point third quarter. They're off to their best start since opening 10-1 in 2018-19.  Jonas Valanciunas scored 20 points for the Pelicans. They dropped to 1-9 as they start the season without injured star forward Zion Williamson."
“Is it time to worry about Gary Payton II?”
Gary Payton II is the protagonist of his own anime
"This is a Gary Payton II Show and I'm totally electrified.  Goddammit, he's boxing out even Valanciunas out there."
Gary Payton II has turned into must see TV?  Draymond looking athletic?  Andre dropping 10 assists?  Warriors are must watch
GARY PAYTON II
"Gary Payton II playing himself into the rotation, you love to see it"
This is a Gary Payton II showtime folks.
I see absolutely no resemblance to Gary Payton Sr in Gary Payton II
"I’m just pissed they are disrespecting the real mvp in this list. We all know the mvp this year is going to be from Golden State. Of course, I’m talking about Gary Payton II"
Didn’t watch the video. Go figure. Went thru all the comments and was wondering when GPii wasn’t playing defense. And how the hell Gary Payton Jr/ii became GTJ lmao
Because he was averaging 17 points and 9 rebounds.   Imagine Gary Payton II efficiency with the same production. Yes jrue wasn’t efficient scoring but he was the primary playmaker for the Bucks.    Good try though
"Gary Payton has two sons named Gary (with two different mothers). The slightly older one is Gary Payton Jr, and the one in the NBA is Gary Payton II."
Jrue holiday isn’t an offensive liability like Gary Payton II.   And there was a lot more important things to the Bucks title run then Jrue Holidays defence. Incredibly valuable?
Yup. Lowe has been saying this about GP2 for more than a year. Pretty sure he said Gary Payton II might be the best defensive guard in the league a couple years ago back when he was on the Wizards.
Gary Payton II
There is. Gary Payton has two sons. He hilariously named one of them Gary Payton II and the other Gary Payton Jr.
"I don't like ""the mitten"" call him Gary ""the other glove"" Payton II"
Oregon State LEGEND Gary Payton II
Gary payton II
Gary mothafuckin’ DPOY Payton II
I can't believe they let Draymond get a prime Gary Payton II.

Gary Payton II²
Gary Payton II II
"Gary Payton II baby. he doesn't the minutes to really be eligible for a title like this per se, but he has all the abilities."
"Gary ""Shouyo Hinata"" Payton II"
"Hello, police? It's Gary Payton II. He wanna strip me."
What kid doesn't have a Gary Payton II poster on their wall?
Gary Payton II is a MENACE
Gary Payton II- Gary Payton has a different son named Gary Payton Jr….
He is an objectively bad player that only hustles when he has a chance to make a flashy play. Gary Payton II quite literally jogged around him several times tonight and Oubre was nowhere close.
Gary Payton II with a defensive clinic from the literal second he subbed in.
"What a game from Gary mf Payton II and Jordan Poole, Gary legitimately won this game for us with his incredible defense and energy, and Poole is the only reason (Damien Lee too) it was even close after the horrendous shooting at the start from Curry and Wiggs. Awesome win."
Gary Payton Jr and Gary Payton II.   It’s up their with Lance Stephenson little brother being named Lantz (their dads name is Lance too)
Gary Payton II was everywhere in this game. What a defensive performance by him.
Gary Payton II
Dude. Gary Payton II is an animal on defense holy shit.
Gary Payton II
damn i was hoping the warriors would lose for obvious reasons  gary payton ii had other ideas i guess
After tonight I am fully in the Gary Payton II bandwagon. The defense all night too…gawddamn
"Gary Payton is Gary Payton II's daddy, and Gary Payton II is my daddy."
### **GARY PAYTON II**
gary “i’m better than avery bradley” payton ii
Finding out Gary Payton II has been in the league for 5 years is wild to me.
"Man, I just realized Payton II is a son of Gary Payton. That’s why he’s a great defender cause his dad was one of the best."
Gary Payton II is a somehow a strong o rebounder.  Reminds me of Mckinnie
Who needs a 7footer for lob when you've got Gary Payton ii
Gary Payton II Jr.
Gary Payton II could never
Gary Payton II Jr
Gary Payton II just turned Oubre into Payton III
"We will give you Gary Payton II and a second rounder for Ben, take it or leave it"
Trent Jr 🤝 Payton II  Gary
Gary Payton II has been very good for the Warriors.
Man Avery Bradley went from losing out on being the Warriors 15th man to Gary Payton II to starting on the Lakers real fast.
Him and Gary Payton II. Steve Kerr better watch his record.
Tbt to /r/nba clowning Zach Lowe for his “Gary payton II” is an all NBA level defender take
I remember about a month ago Zach Lowe put out something saying Gary Payton II or as he called him the mitten of he would get more minutes he would make the all defensive team and this sub completely dismissed him.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pz5elx
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
"If he has another then he can name him Damian Lillard II. Gary Payton did that with his kids, I imagine receiving mail in that house is very confusing."
"Paschall is back, and Jordan Bell + Gary Payton II have been signed."
Gary Payton II
"If Gary Payton II is so good, why is there no Gary Payton II 2?"
&gt;he ain't never had to take up  On this roster. He was given the majority of playmaking/ballhandling responsibilities with South Bay whenever The Mitt (Gary Payton II) wasn't running the offense.
"Only salt in there is at the Warrior front office for how they've hung the players out to dry. They have had two open roster spots since the trade deadline. Only addition they made all season was Gary Payton II on a couple 10 days.  Right now the Warrior season feels like the plot of Major League, an owner trying to tank but the team winning anyway."
"&gt;	3rd in the league in WS/48   That’s not even true? Do you have a source?  Bbalref doesn’t even include him as a qualifier for the stat, presumably because he hasn’t played enough.  They have these qualifiers because it can otherwise cause crazy outliers like Gary Payton II being second in the league in ws/48, and **Khyri Thomas being first**  You’re basically proving my point lol"
I know it’s just a two-way but would’ve rather have seen Gary Payton II in that slot. He was really good in his time with the team
"Gary Payton II showed great promise but they let him go, his jumper is just as good as Bazemore's these days"
Gary Payton II??
"Warriors might as well give gary payton a jersey at this point and just put tape over the ""II"""
"He did get some burn in extended garbage time during our OKC game, but yeah no more player development since Wiseman went down. We actually played Gary Payton II more just to get some defensive stops when needed, and the guy's on his 2nd 10-day."
Mike Scott being the threegional manager will never not be funny to me. I like Gary Payton II being the mitten. And the count of Monte AST/TO is really clever.
"Doesn’t this happen all the time even with stars? The other day in the last seconds of the 2nd in the Wizards game, Kerr tried to sub Curry out for Gary Payton II (I only remember it cause the refs didn’t allow him to)"
Gary Payton II and Desmond Bane
I know it means nothing but it was kinda cool to see Gary Payton II.
nothing to be ashamed about having the ball taken away by future DPOY Gary Payton II
Gary Payton II defending Bol Bol...
A glorified Gary Payton II
"He’s played 888 minutes and is the starting center. It’s skewed for guy like JJJ (19), Gary Payton II (18), and Dwayne Dedmon (55) who’ve played much less but appear higher on these lists. 888 minutes is a large enough sample size."
"Duncan Robinson, Gary Payton II, Dean Wade, Seth Curry, Paul Millsap, George Hill, Mike Miller, Allen Crabbe, Thanasis Antetounkumpo, and...MEYERS LEONARD!"
"And Steph is doing that with bazemore, Damion Lee Gary Payton II and smiley"
bruh i will never be able to get over the fact that Gary Payton really named his two sons **Gary Payton Jr** and **Gary Payton II** lmaooo
"You're thinking of Juan Toscano-Anderson, who is currently on a two-way contract (not a 10-day contract like Gary Payton II)."
"Yeah, you love to see the hustle but I'd rather have JTA closing out a game than Kent Foulmore. Or even Gary Payton II.  People have been saying Baze is better than Oubre ever since Oubre started missing games, but I doubt it. Baze buys into the system more so the ball movement may look better when he's playing, but he makes more boneheaded decision per minute than Oubre does. Oubre isn't at risk of fouling out every game, and he doesn't just give up on defense either. Bazemore also shoots mid-range shots that he never makes, while Oubre can at least make some of them, and he's stronger finishing at the rim. If only he'd buy into the system...."
Why was Bazemore in?!! Gary Payton II should have replaced him.
"At 34? I'd be surprised if he made a g league roster tbh, look how hard it's been for Gary Payton II to crack an NBA roster."
Gary Payton II with the Warriors: 24 steals per 48 minutes.
No. Gary Payton has a son named Gary Payton Jr and Gary Payton II.
"TIL that Gary Payton Jr. and Gary Payton II are different people. Yeah, Gary Payton’s 2 sons are named them [Gary Payton Jr. and Gary Payton II](https://news.amomama.com/211810-meet-gary-paytons-4-beautiful-children-i.html)."
Honestly I would definitely rather take a team assembled of the top 15 NCAA players than a team of:  Greg Whittington  Anžejs Pasečņiks  Will Magnay  Ashton Hagans  Theo Pinson  Ignas Brazdeikis  Keljin Blevins   Grant Riller  Gary Payton II  Jontay Porter  Malik Fitts  Oshae Brissett  Ray Spalding  Devon Dotson  Ty-Shon Alexander  Jalen Lecque  No coach ever plays all 15 players in a game so you only need the top 8 or 9 college players in the country. I guarantee that theres more than 8 college players in the NCAA who could enter the NBA right now and be better than the worst 15 NBA players.
&gt;Gary Payton II.  Now I'm gonna spend the next hour on GP2 highlights.
"Yeah, one is Gary Payton Jr, and the other is Gary Payton II. I think they're half-siblings."
Behind Gary Payton II?!
Gary Payton II is a nice player.
That's why we have Gary Payton II. Literally styling out there with his million leg sleeves and headbands like 2k MyCareer when you have a bunch of VC
