Malik Fitts
**Worst Team:**  G- Ashton Hagans   G- Grant Riller  F- Cameron Reynolds  F- Malik Fitts   C- Will Magnay   I’d say yes based on the fact that the Baylor has a lot more chemistry together after winning a title   The players that I chose are also not old. They’re all extremely young so their bodies aren’t really more developed than the Baylor squad.
Honestly I would definitely rather take a team assembled of the top 15 NCAA players than a team of:  Greg Whittington  Anžejs Pasečņiks  Will Magnay  Ashton Hagans  Theo Pinson  Ignas Brazdeikis  Keljin Blevins   Grant Riller  Gary Payton II  Jontay Porter  Malik Fitts  Oshae Brissett  Ray Spalding  Devon Dotson  Ty-Shon Alexander  Jalen Lecque  No coach ever plays all 15 players in a game so you only need the top 8 or 9 college players in the country. I guarantee that theres more than 8 college players in the NCAA who could enter the NBA right now and be better than the worst 15 NBA players.
