Seth curry is quietly have a steph season with even better the efficiency and half the points
Seth Curry for two.
Seth Curry?
"Two sixers being held back by free throws, and one by ft attempts  Embiid - 28 a game on 54/40/84  Harris - 20 a game on 54/45/82  Seth Curry - 14 a game on 53/50/100 (only 25 fts)"
"Giannis, Seth Curry, Jimmy Butler, Alen Smailagic, Juan Toscano-Anderson"
Agree with Seth Curry
"Embiid, Simmons, Tobi, Seth Curry, Matisse   No specific reason I just like those guys"
"Apparently there was a Twitter post, where the opposing coaches say, ""keep the game close in the 4th, then we make our run with Oubre in the game"". And then Seth Curry responded to the tweet.  Was Oubre that bad, despite being 5-11?"
"Plenty of non-white players on this thread/that fit this criteria on this sub -- SGA, Conley, Jrue Holiday, Seth Curry, Dort, Bazemore...etc  I think this is one thing that is not strongly correlated with race"
Seth Curry
Bro what we already have the next jordan in Seth Curry
"Honestly he's about the same. Started slow from being out of the shape, but the biggest difference is the team. They were ravaged with covid and injuries for one. I dont think people ever actually noticed how good the offense was outside of Luka last year. When you had Luka you had his ball dominant kick out to 3 pointers and run great lob actions roles which was great, but now the 3 point shooters and lob threats have regressed so it doesnt work as well.   However the reason they were all time elite is because they could do that plus run other great actions. Their role players ran great sets and even when Luka sat on the bench they were fine. KP was great by himself. They made a mistake a lot of teams do when they have great players do with the Seth Curry trade. Just because you have an elite do it all offensive guy like Luka doesnt mean you make them do it all."
Did someone say Seth Curry?  Mmmmm....Seeeth ü§§ü§§ü§§
"The loss of Seth Curry doesn't turn the ""best bench in the league"" to the literal worst bench in the league."
GM  also kinda fucked up trading Seth Curry on that steal of a contract for Josh Richardson.
"Yeah I mean [this is really what it comes down to](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612742&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=204001,1629029)  2021:   Luka+ no KP: 115 offensive rating +2.3 net   Luka + KP: 111 offensive rating -3.8 net   KP no Luka: 100 offensive rating -22 net   2020:   Luka no KP: 119 offensive rating +6.5  Luka and KP: 118 offensive rating +4.3  KP no Luka: 118 offensive rating +9.8  Tough scene for what's now Latvian Anthony Tolliver. The entire conception of the team and its path to success is built around KP being an all star level player. There's too much hand wringing about stuff like no Seth Curry when in reality Luka+no Seth last year basically had the same offensive rating as otherwise. Guys are missing spot ups that will probably be hit at a higher level as the season goes along but the biggest thing is unless Porzingis is better none of this really matters this is basically a 37-38 win team this year if KP doesnt get back to form.   The Carlisle Luka rotations are weird but they got lucky last night Monty Williams has also been weird about some of his Chris Paul rotations and how they keep doing this no CP3 no Booker lineups.   &gt;I know Luka gets his teammates involved, but in these clutch scenarios, he‚Äôs some times just too ‚Äúpassive.‚Äù  This happens alot and one thing ive noticed the past 2 yrs is how much fatigue plays into it. He's often just gased at the end of these games and I think that's relevant as to why his clutch situation %s arent so hot."
How‚Äôs Josh Richardson been? The trade for Seth curry was widely considered a win/win trade at the time
Seth curry became the most overrated Player in the past year... Dude is a great shooter and a solid role Player and thats it
The system the Mavs run is extremely heliocentric and relies on Luka drive and kicking and pnr. Last year it worked better because KP was in better form and they had Seth Curry reliably spacing the floor.  I think the onus is more on Carlisle to change the system because it‚Äôs clearly not working anymore.
Soon lol IMO don‚Äôt think that though. They have been fine but I think it‚Äôs the rest of the team hasn‚Äôt been great. They should have never given up Seth curry. Josh Richardson isn‚Äôt that good as he should be. And lots of their games have been close. And I thought people were nuts to believe they were gonna be a top 2 seed knowing that kp was gonna e out a month
"You should be.   1. This is the best you'll ever get out of Embiid but there are still limits to what you can ask from him on both ends of the court, his workload right now is unsustainable in the playoffs  2. All 4 of your 2nd round wins have come from another guard taking on PG responsibilities and having a good night   Player| Statline| TS% | Opponent ---|---|----|---- TJ McConnell | 19/8/5 |76.4 | Boston Jimmy Butler | 30/11/5 |58.8| Toronto Jimmy Butler | 22/9/9 | 67.4 | Toronto   Jimmy Butler | 25/6/8 | 59.3 | Toronto    Your team needs another high functioning guard to take the pressure off the Simmons/Embiid spacing issues   3. Right now you're super reliant on Harris and Curry stepping up in a big way  * Harris has played well but he's never been a good playoff performer  * Seth Curry has returned to earth after his hot start   I just wouldn't trust those two to take you over the top in a playoff  against elite opponents     The regular-season record is nice, but Philly still hasn't answered the big playoff questions that need to be answered. Right now the 76ers are where Milwaukee was last season, there isn't a lot of room for long-term growth for the team, you have to capitalise while you can.   The 76ers can rest on the laurels of the 1st seed, or they can work towards a serious title contender.   Lowry can answer those questions comfortably."
Tony bradley danny green and seth curry and a churched up 2nd round pick for lowry. Masai shoves you off the phone with that offer
Is KP back in his shape? Also is losing Seth Curry that big of a deal in the offense?
Luka? More like LowCa with the empty stats smh winning players like Seth Curry are better
"Significantly, but KP has been ass and he doesn‚Äôt have Seth Curry anymore."
"Gotcha. He's averaging 35 minutes a game. So you think it's not his overall minutes, but the timing thereof is the problem? I've always thought losing Seth Curry has impacted your bench scoring and playmaking more than JRich's defensive impact."
‚Ä™Josh ‚ÄúSeth Curry‚Äù Richardson‚Ä¨
"well Luka is spectacular but it seems like all the guys around him had career years last year and now they've come back down to earth. They also jettisoned Seth Curry who is a firecracker offensive player. PLUS injuries, COVID, etc."
"I disagree, I think anyone that is watching them play right now sees the potential because if how Embiid is playing. Seth Curry is back so we will see how he improves their offense. I think they can definitely make a run for it."
Eddie Curry and Seth Curry
Sixers don‚Äôt have the guards the back up Embiid if he struggles. I don‚Äôt believe in Simmons as a second star in big moments. Seth Curry is a complementary player at best
Nearly all the players are the same. Just swap their shooters from 2018 with Tobias and Seth Curry.
Reddick and Kemba aren't terrible matchups for players like Danny Green and Seth Curry. Jaylen and Jayson on Ben and Tobias; and then whatever center is up next to be tooled on by Embiid. It's a good player archetype to have in the toolbox.  Otherwise he can run in lineups where it's normally Jaylen or Jayson + bench mob. Or lineups where it's Jaylen or Jayson + Smart + bench mob.
Oubre for Seth Curry str8 up
How good would the Sixers be if they hadn't turned Jimmy Butler into Seth Curry?
"For his career I've compared Jokic to Ben Simmons on offense. I know that's gonna cause some alarm but stay with me here. *Before this season* people said he was better at offense than Embiid, but I legitimately couldn't see why. For his career to that point he scored slightly better than Simmons and assisted a little worse than Simmons. So I thought his offensive impact was about that level (which is really fucking high btw, it's just no one seems to care about points generated through assists when discussing Ben for some reason).   *This* season he is scoring *significantly higher* than his previous career high of 20ppg and he's raised his assists numbers up higher too. I think this version of Jokic is as impactful if not more than Joel Embiid and much more impactful than Simmons if he keeps up this torrid pace.   My only thing that I would say is people are acting like he was always this guy and her just was not. He was amazing, but this year he has taken a quantum leap in his scoring ability. Nuggets fans would always talk about his percentages like he could drop 25 a night if he decided too. My counter was that if he could he would. If Seth Curry could take as many threes as Steph Curry and keep his percentages he would. But this year not only is he scoring more he's doing so with greater efficiency and even more offensive responsibility."
"I agree with you honestly, adding JJ would be awesome but I don‚Äôt see a reason to trade the number of assets it‚Äôd require to get him when we‚Äôve been so hot with Seth filling essentially the same role. [see this](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2020/12/21/seth-curry-says-he-has-studied-old-sixers-film-of-jj-redick-joel-embiid/)"
"Seth Curry, a first round pick, and the Liberty Bell is my opening offer.  If pushed I will settle for nothing in return however."
"You mentioned Danny Green and Seth Curry as how you address weaknesses and build a team.  Jrue has been a bigger upgrade over Bledsoe than probably expected.  Difference is Bucks have lost more games since the defense fell off after the pandemic, the bench guard play has been awful, and the Bucks bad shooting games have aligned with good opponent shooting games."
"I mean, are Seth Curry and Danny Green those guys?  Not sure why you are holding 76ers as a model of team building when they haven't addressed their lack of shot creation.  I don't think the Bucks are winning it all, but I think their far superior shot creation to Philly is an advantage come playoff time.  The Bucks offense has actually been better than Philly's this season.  Awful postseason production from the PG position was an issue for the Bucks in the past and Jrue could help address that."
"&gt; What injuries have slowed Simmons down this season?  He is clearly still bothered by his knee, he sat out a couple of games with swelling in that same knee earlier in the season. You don't have to be Einstein to figure out the knee was limiting him on the court but also it is clear by watching him, and many others noted this in the Sixers sub, that he was favouring the leg, not being nearly as explosive nor jumping up for blocks/rebounds in situations he would normally do that kind of thing.            Even if you put his injury aside, the Sixers have been transformed into a new team in terms of the coaching staff and their FO. The way Doc is utilising Ben is not the same as the way Brett Brown did. Doc has openly stated he doesn't care about his scoring that he's using him as a playmaker, likely understanding that to be a number two guy in terms of scoring that you have to be an all court scorer - post ups, mid range, threes. Ben isn't close to this kind of scorer right now but that doesn't concern Doc because he's also got a rejuvenated Tobias (47% from 3), a highly efficient perimeter scorer in Seth Curry (52% from 3) and a dynamic bench scorer in Shake Milton to support the main guy in Joel. Ben is essentially the number five scoring option on that team, he is the quintessential glue guy. Draymond was this player in 2015 and 2016 and was arguably the second most important player for the Warriors in this period. He doesn't have to score, he's the one setting guys up with his gravity on drives, defenses collapse on him and he routinely dishes out to wide open three point shooters. It's why he's one of the league leaders in assists that lead to three point field goals. He is at career lows in field goal attempts so this backs up that theory.                   &gt; Isn't something I've heard.                   Go to the Sixers sub whenever Ben has a bad game, you'll hear it plenty..."
"You‚Äôre telling me CJ McCollum isn‚Äôt starting ahead of KCP, DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, or Reggie Jackson. Only team I‚Äôll give you is the Nets for obvious reasons"
"Haven‚Äôt seen too many Mavs games so I can‚Äôt comment on their attitude but looked up some numbers:  Last year they were  1st on offensive rating: 116.7 18th on defence 111.7  This year they‚Äôre: 19th on offensive rating: 109.8 20th on defence: 111.6  Their other stats looks similar except for they‚Äôre less efficient probably with Curry gone and a slow shooting start. As a team they are shooting 32.9% from 3 which is a 0.038% dropped from last year. Other than that the only thing that stands out is their rebounding has a massive dip.  When I think of people not really trying and caring it usually reflects more on the defensive side, obviously I don‚Äôt know anything but can only assume morale is down because they‚Äôre losing but if the only thing that mainly changed (on paper) is their offense because inefficient shooting then perhaps it‚Äôs not a huge effort issue.  But also maybe losing Seth is actually a huge blow to them as well."
"As a Suns fan who's seen a lot of similar issues around Book in previous years, this is my take.    Team comp-wise the Mavs have no secondary ball handler and the shooting around Luka is worse than last year. The loss of JJ Barea and Seth Curry is huge in terms of playmaking, shooting, spacing, and leadership. Also, Tim Hardaway Jr. is really the only other guy who can make his own offense. They drafted a few guys to make up for the playmaking losses, but they're not ready yet.    This team also has a leadership issue. Last year, Seth was hitting clutch shots when they needed it and Barea weathered the storm off the bench and made sure everyone else was ready when shit went down. Luka played great last year in part because he could share those leadership duties and focus on his own game. Now, it's all on Luka. He's gotta be clutch, be the best player, lead by example, be more vocal on and off the bench, everything. He put himself behind in that aspect when came in out of shape this season. Set the tone and mentality in the locker room and that's reflected in the way guys around him play. They don't give consistent effort and take shortcuts, expecting Luka to make all the plays and bail them out when things get tough. That's hard for a 3rd year player to deal with alone."
"trading away seth curry, one of the best 3pt shooters in the league, and our third option, for richardson was such a bad move, like terrible, his spacing helped luka alot and also gave other shooters less attention"
They could use a player like Seth Curry
"JJ hardly fuckiing played last season, Seth Curry was streaky. What is this revisionist history lmao? Not to mention the JB take.."
"Conditioning. What a difference trading Seth Curry, and not resigning J.J. Barea does. They need a backup point guard and Burke &amp; Brunson are SGs in PG bodies."
Every post mentioning Seth Curry.
Holiday just isn't someone that addresses their issues.      Seth Curry and Danny Green addressed Philly's weakness of shooting for example and that's why they're more successful this year. That's how you build a team.       Milwaukee replaced a borderline allstar with all defence level D that can't shoot...for another borderline allstar with all defence level D that can't shoot.
"I don't get why people were saying this was a ""win win"" trade with the Sixers. Seth Curry is one of the best shooters in the league and on a really good contract. Josh Richardson is an above average shooter and better defender but it ain't making up for what Curry brings on offense."
I still have no clue why Mavs traded seth curry
Mavs really traded Seth Curry for this bum. High way robbery
The problem was trading Seth Curry for an overrated dude.
"Mavs have been missing most of their starting lineup so far. The team is better on defence, but there is no secondary playmaker. Which shows the importance of Seth Curry."
Thanks for Seth curry!
If you‚Äôre going off of counting stats you just don‚Äôt understand. Luka was the 3rd most efficient player in the NBA last season.   What was so great about Luka‚Äôs supporting cast? Was it Porzingis coming back from years of injuries who has gotten worse since he came into the league? Seth Curry &amp; Hardaway? They‚Äôre fine but very mediocre in the West as far as supporting cast.   Even with Luka‚Äôs team being slightly better that shouldn‚Äôt mean Trae should be having the 2nd worst record in the much weaker East if he‚Äôs close to being as good as Luka was last year.
Think Philly would accept Josh Richardson and Tyler Bey for Seth Curry?  That would certainly help.
"He's an alright player, but I never liked the Seth Curry trade because Seth Curry is one of the top 10 shooters in the nba and was slowly getting better at putting the ball on the floor and defense"
76ers won the Seth Curry trade and its not even close. Taking away Lukas assist tally smh
"&gt;  last summer JRich for Seth trade was brought up surprisingly frequently last summer and if anyone would have suggested that the Sixers would have to attach a mid 2nd rounder to get Seth, they would have been down voted into oblivion.  He didnt have a good year in Philly. HIs value has consistently dropped the past 2 years. I remember Zach Lowe even saying months before he got traded to Philly internally Miami was let down by him in 2018-19 somewhat, they were hoping for more offensive development.   He was an All NBA level defender in 2018, he hasnt been as good on that end since then. The hope was after 2018 he could be a 38-39% type 3 point shooter instead he looks more like a 34-35% type guy. He just stagnated out when the hope was he could continue to build off what he was his first 3 yrs even if it didnt mean future all star.   I still like the trade for Dallas and frankly still think 2018/2019 Miami Josh Richardson is a better player than Seth Curry. But his value has definitely fallen."
All I‚Äôm seeing is that Seth Curry is a certified splash brother.
Seth Curry trade back?
What changed from last season?  Was Seth Curry that important?
This would be the 76ers but seth curry playin (there)
They lost Seth curry one of the best shooters in the league and Stephen Silas who's the apparent mastermind behind their historically great offense.  Covid and injuries is definitely a big factor but this is also why they look worse offensively from last year.
...Is Terry Rozier Seth Curry 2.0? Is Terry Rozier a 3 pt sniper? I always thought he was hot and hold.
"If they really want a Seth Curry version 2.0, then Terry Rozier makes perfect sense. We can just get Hardaway Jr. + WCS.   Deal works for both teams - they get their secondary playmaker and scorer to help out Luka, and we finally get a bench wing with size and a Biz replacement. This will push LaMelo to a starting spot too."
"who?  Mike Scott and Seth Curry  that‚Äôs not an issue, especially given their easy schedule"
isn't it basically the same team minus Curry?  So Seth Curry can transform 18th best offense to being the best?
If only they had a player like Seth Curry
Yeah and all your players came back negative except Seth Curry so they missed a few games total. Half our rotation was positive for covid and has been out for 8-9 games.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/28/22252982/heat-mavericks-changing-expectations-covid-protocols
You‚Äôre telling me Seth curry was the difference between ‚Äúthe greatest offense ever‚Äù and this? Love me anything curry but cmon.
"Real question, what happened to the mavs ‚Äúgreatest offensive of all time‚Äù? Was Seth curry that valuable?"
Minus Seth Curry. Feels like he is criminally underrated.
Seth Curry is not why theyre getting pounded on the boards or getting blown out every game
i think he‚Äôll be okay just give him a few months. trading seth curry was baaaddddd
Its the same exact roster as last year save for a seth curry/j rich swap and people were lauding how good and deep the roster was last year.  Their second unit had a top 5 offensive rating in the nba last year.  Its the same team.
They had the best offensive rating of all time because they were playing 5-Out offense with Seth Curry and Porzingis for most of the year.
Seth Curry spacing hurts too.
"Well when you lose your best player in Seth Curry, this is what happens"
"What a difference trading Seth Curry, Delon Wright, and Justin Jackson makes...."
seth curry is starting
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
"I don't think we are a top 3 seed like some suggested, but we were 6-4 before COVID hit and that was without Porzi≈Üƒ£is.   We've also had the 5th hardest schedule thus far. (From here on out we have the 2nd easiest schedule).   No other team in the league has lost 6 of it's best players for half the season. Philly has missed Seth Curry for 7 games and then Mike Scott and Furkan Korkmaz. Hardly the same as missing 4 starters and our 7th man.   Then you have teams like Memphis and Boston who got their games postponed. Meanwhile we had to play games missing half of our rotation guys and starting rookies, 12th men in the league, and G-Leaguers."
Can‚Äôt believe we got Seth Curry for the next 3 years at 8m a year for J Rich. Best trade ever
Seth Curry takes more shots than Simmons
"Is that why the Lakers have a higher ORtg with AD on, LeBron and Dennis off than Embiid does without Seth Curry ?  Embiid needs shooters more than AD needs playmakers.  The offense running through Embiid is bad without Seth on the floor."
"I agree, but I totally disagree that they would start Seth Curry over Murray.  Yes, Curry is a better spot up shooter, but Murray is still top 30 in the league at spot up shooting at 51%.  And so much better at so much else.  Like saying he'd come of the bench is just absurd, that's all I'm saying.  Like I agree with the point that Simmons on the Nuggets is better, I just disagree with how far you were going with the Murray stuff, haha"
"Starting him over Danny Green or Seth Curry would absolutely be the move.  At this point you really aren't giving Murray enough credit, imo.  Murray, Green, Simmons, Harris, Embiid would be an insane starting 5.  There is more than enough defense on that floor, and Murray is capable of being at least average on that end, and the offense is probably the best in the league.  Like come on dude"
"Eh it's kind of crazy. The problem with these takes is that it drastically overrates/glosses over the flaws of *average players* from back in the day.  Sure, the superstars were incredibly, fundamentally skilled. Oscar Robertson prolly had a lot of current players beat on that front, simply because today's game demands way more athleticism and guys can get by on it alone. But you're gonna claim that the Bucky Bockhorns of the world (real guy) were more fundamentally skilled than like, Seth Curry? Imo it's not even a question (and I say this as someone who has probably watched more ""random full games from the old days"" than most).  I just think it's a *really* common blind spot for people when they look back at past eras. The bad is glossed over, and we end up comparing yesterday's ideal to today's average."
Put a body on black Seth Curry!
Never really got the Mavs hype. They were the 7th seed last season and they got noticeably worse (Seth Curry is a better fit than J-Rich).
You call it a team sport and then still say he was the inly reason why we were good lol.   Plenty of reasons why we suck right now. Seth Curry is not the main reason. He wasnt even the main reason that we were good
"Except that's not half court creation. We literally saw this last night. Lakers go on a 14-0 run due to the Sixers inability to generate half court offense. Hell, they had Seth Curry taking contested step back threes like he was Harden to generate offense. That's a massive problem."
I feel like losing Seth Curry was a huge loss for them.  They can't quite spread the defenses like they use to last season.
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
seth ‚Äúgamestop‚Äù curry
What a great person to set a screen for Seth curry. Lebron can‚Äôt switch back because you have a knockdown 3 specialist that your switching off of. Good play by Doc Rivers.
also when they have seth curry and danny green instead of average al and jrich
i still think harden harder to stop tho. give harden tobias harris and seth curry with ben simmons playing small ball 5? how do you stop that
"He's overrated in that people think he's going to become an all-star/good enough to be a second/third option on a championship team.  I just don't see how he gets there.   His efficiency and advanced stats almost all dropped this year. Usually ""great prospects"" don't get worse their second year.  His ceiling is ""more dynamic Seth Curry with worse-shooting."" Or ""better rebounding worse passing Lou Williams."" That's certainly a good player, that's not a ""great prospect"" though."
"People tend to say Dame because he creates his own shot, but I think that ideology is slightly unfair. Not all assisted threes are the same. There's a difference between the assisted threes that Seth Curry usually takes vs. the ones that Klay or Duncan Robinson put up.   Both of them shoot shots coming full speed off of a screen, turning and shooting with hands in their face. That shot is more difficult than getting a screen and ur man going under and hitting a three where you're able to comfortable set yourself. Of course, Dame is also taking insanely difficult off the dribble threes as well, but I just want to highlight its not just about creating yourself versus assisted.   Overall, I think the percentage difference between Dame and Klay is too big to say its Dame, considering Klay is also shooting at an extremely high volume."
PG and ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Seth Curry.
Seth Curry
Did Seth Curry decide not to participle in the 3pt contest or was he straight up not invited? Dude is 45% from 3 so I really hope the NBA at least invited him to do it.
Curry range!!!! We gotta get Seth Curry and Steph Curry to do this lol
"We need a 3 point contest of Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Doug McDermott, Wayne Ellington, and Matt Thomas"
"Many players have said it was the worst thing they‚Äôve ever experienced and had affected them for months (Taytum, Butler, Seth Curry, KAT). Even to NBA players this is more than a simple flu and acting like it is is just dangerous, especially with the known long term affects it can have on the respiratory and cardiovascular system."
"First off, you *just said* they gave it to him in the high post *so the Jazz wouldn‚Äôt double.*  Now all of a sudden you can read the scoreboard and say they were never gonna double anyway.  And then you‚Äôre gonna call me dumb as if you didn‚Äôt just say that shit?  &gt; Going high ISO gives him a great look when he backs up to the three point line.  Or, you could, you know, run a play for Toby or Seth Curry instead of relying on your center to iso into a 3. You could even use your timeout, and draw up a stagger or flare screen concept for Joel with Ben as the inbounder if you really wanted to.   Or sub Korkmaz for him. *Anything* is better than this.   In what fucking world is this ‚Äòa great look‚Äô? Did you even watch the clip?  Step back into lose the dribble into a double pump no rhythm shot with a guy underneath him is a ‚Äògreat look‚Äô?  Joel wasn‚Äôt even planning on shooting this; that‚Äôs why he pump-faked trying to get a foul.   Nice troll."
He's talking about Seth Curry dingus
"Wooooow, that should be an offensive foul, (Steph) Curry does it all the time too. Also, did you see how Seth was upset but didn‚Äôt punch any inanimate objects or pick up a tech?"
"I completely understand the frustration on the Royce O‚ÄôNeale out of bounds play. If roles were reversed I‚Äôd be salty as hell as well, but by the rule book and on the Secaucus review, it was called as it should be.   I also don‚Äôt think that Donovan Mitchell should have received 2 technicals in OT just based off the footage, but who knows what was said on court. Either way, not a fan of technicals unless they‚Äôre ridiculously earned.   The other ‚Äúcontentious‚Äù calls like Mitchell‚Äôs offensive foul. He did arm hook Simmons first, and Simmons did retaliate with a good bit of arm hooking himself. See that one called either way. If the offensive foul wasn‚Äôt called it definitely could‚Äôve been a travel and regardless the shot missed and the Sixers got the rebound right as the whistle was called.   Mitchell sitting there complaining when he did a hip check to the left to Seth Curry to get 3 FTs is pretty hilarious.   Gobert complaining when he was not called for a single illegal screen, despite in OT both pivoting, elbowing and jersey grabbing all in one play to open up a wide open 3? Also pretty hilarious."
"Lol I was with you until Seth Curry. That guy is just a bonafide star, Stotts didn't have to do much.  But agree on every other player, especially Whiteside."
Me and someone on here came up with a Josh Richardson for Seth curry fake trade like 12 hours before it happened on here lol but I didn‚Äôt actually think he would be available either   Would you do either of these   Thybulle mike Scott and whatever other matching salary for Patty Mills  Thybulle and a 2nd round pick or two for Devonte Graham
"Love to use my natural shooting motion of ""jump sideways away from the rim oh Seth Curry is there oh no!"""
Spida bitching about the refs meanwhile he got 3 fta because he jumped and hip checked Seth curry on a close out. Can‚Äôt blame the game on the refs when you get bs like that and got 12/34 from the floor. But the refs suck this year as they have for many years.
"The jazz have a bunch of big wings that force people into Golbert, so he looks good in the regular season.  He‚Äôs 2021 Roy Hibert.  &gt; He is much quicker than most centers and only the very best guards will try to challenge him to the rim.  Dude Seth Curry blew by him tonight. The sixers scored 130 points while shooting like 5% on three pointers. The dude is slow, and a bad defender in space. Anyone who has eyes can see it."
People in our sub still claim we won the Seth Curry trade. It is bordering delusion.
"It helps that CJ and Melo had been close friends for years, and wanted to play together, so not only is there a super clear pecking order and stable organization (third behind Spurs and Heat) but a really familiar rapport from working out during summers for years together with his friend who is the other star.    So you‚Äôve got the clear alpha option with Dame, the secondary star in CJ, and Melo came in knowing how their games would mesh and the vet role he was asked to fill.    Stotts is adept at getting the best from role players, look at guys like Whiteside or Kanter in Portland vs elsewhere, guys like like Shabazz Napier, Seth Curry, Robin Lopez, Moe Harkless, Stotts makes roleplayers shine by playing to their strengths and minimizing their weaknesses."
If youre gonna take 44 threes the only fouls you gonna get is when you jump 2ft to the right into Seth Curry. Weak mindset.
"ignoring that whataboutism, that's really not that horrible, he moved his hip a bit i guess, apart from that seth curry jumped into him."
also when Mitchell leaned into Seth Curry to draw a 3 point foul?
Or when Mitchell hipchecked Seth Curry and got 3 FTs from it
Can you post the one where Donovan jumps out sideways into Seth Curry for a ‚Äú3 shot foul‚Äù at the start of OT as well?
I hope a reporter has the balls to ask for his thoughts on getting three free throws when he hip-checked Seth Curry.
Meanwhile 2 minutes before that jumping horizontally while taking a 3 to make contact with Seth curry for a call
I‚Äôm sure you want to ignore Mitchell hip checking Seth Curry on his way to get 3 free throws though right?
What did you think about Donovan Mitchell getting 3 free throws during the final minutes?   I'm talking about the play where Seth Curry contested off to Mitchell's side and Mitchell hip-checked him.
Maybe but the sixers kept their cool when Donovan twerked on Seth Curry for a three free throws in OT. Composure
The amount of hate I've poured into Seth Curry the last couple weeks
Why is shake milton on instead of seth curry
Seth Curry is statistically a better shooter than JJ but I was 70% more confident in JJ making his crazy 3s than I have in Seth making wide open ones
"What shot would you rather have in a half-court set?    -Shaq mismatch in the low block  -Seth Curry wide open in the corner for 3    I think this is what's eating Shaq, basically.  He has a hard time admitting that these two things are approaching equal value. Shaq is one of the greatest to ever do it. He can't handle that there are hundreds of people in the league these days capable of providing efficient offense if open from 3.  (If Shaq's only making 1 of every 2 FTs I probably take the corner 3 tbh. Unless you can foul the whole team out.)"
Definitely not. Seth Curry has also not looked like his pre-COVID self since coming back.   I had it back in December and I still get hit with a huge wave of fatigue at the end of the day at least once a week now that I just wasn't experiencing before I had COVID. Can't imagine playing 3-5 professional basketball games/week and trying to recover from those on top of post-COVID symptoms.
Covid is legit and players will struggle when they comeback you have to give them time jrue holiday Seth curry and tatum have all look not as good since covid
Those are bigger stars when it comes to 3pt shooting. Seth Curry has the highest 3pt percentage of all time.
"Curry, Ball, Holiday, Morris, and Lopez brothers would make a pretty dope team.  Steph/Jrue/Zo/Marcus/Brook  Melo/Seth/Justin/Markief/Robin  This could be a top 3 seed in the east"
"Right? Can‚Äôt stay healthy? He got COVID ... look at Jayson Tatum, Seth Curry etc ... these guys got fucking hit hard! I expect it to be another week or two before Jrue looks like himself again"
Lonnie Walker  Tim Hardaway Jr  Seth Curry
"That's a nice lineup and I understand why they did it that way, but Seth Curry and Joe Harris deserved a spot."
"I wish he hadnt been so messed up from covid, i would love to have seen Seth Curry tear that comp up."
"Lol Hield, 40 year old dirk, seth curry, danny green and joe harris   &gt;all stars"
"That is clearly way weaker. Average fans don‚Äôt give a shit about Danny green, Seth curry, buddy hield and Joe Harris"
"Um 2019?  Steph, Dame, Kemba, Hield, Middleton, Dirk. And then Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the Champion Joe Harris.   The 3 point contest is consistently star studded nowadays this is absolutely no different from the usual."
seth curry is interesting too  he provides spacing due to the defense you have to play on him but doesnt get the shots from deep that you would think he would because his release is too slow.  He has trouble breaking free and cant do that JJ Redick/Bellineli awkward off balance shot.
"The validity of the plan depends entirely on who the role players are. Last year it was a great plan, our entire roster was questionable from three.  This year those role players are Seth Curry and Danny Green, leaving those guys open is a lot more dangerous."
"We're starting seth curry and the corpse of danny green. As much as I love the team's current composition, team defense is all five players. And neither of those guys can stop players from driving at this point in their careers. Plus fast break defense against quick players has been atrocious with everyone outside of ben simmons and thybulle."
Seth Curry &gt; Josh Richardson may also have helped
I'm looking forward to that game.  I really hope both teams are at full strength.  You got:    Ty Lue vs Doc Rivers:  Ty now coaches the team Doc was just fired from.  Doc pretty much said don't expect any different results from this Clippers team because Ty is just as responsible for the Clippers blown 3-1 lead since he was Doc's lead Assistant Coach at the time.  Plus Ty was supposedly the front runner for the 76ers job until Doc took it from him.    Paul George vs Doc Rivers:  There have been sneak dissing comments from both towards the other as to who is to blame for The Bubble.  Plus PG fucked his daughter then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Tobias Harris vs The Clippers:  Tobias plays his former team who he left because he felt like they low-balled him a contract offer.    Paul George vs Seth Curry:  PG13 fucked his wife then cheated on her with a stripper who he got pregnant and is now engaged to.  Plus they had a lot of chirping goin back and forth during The Bubble when Seth was with Dallas.    Kawhi Leonard vs The 76ers:  Kawhi hits one of the most memorable post-season shots of all time to eliminate the 76ers in a Game 7 to then go on and win a Chip and Finals MVP.
Its playing the same rol with almost similar stats in clasical fashion and better one in metrics like raptor 538.      Dallas has other problems way bigger than those that Seth Curry can solve
Honestly mavs don't have the personel to be a top team. I don't even know what trades they can do without further screwing their team. I loved seth curry on mavs last year and was sad to see him leave.
"I believe people just love narratives man, or maybe the media has trained them to.  If KP could stay healthy longer than 5 minutes, no one would even be talking about this.     The Mavs made the trade because Josh Richardson is a massive defensive upgrade over Seth Curry, it's not even close.  That hasn't changed, they had a perimeter defensive problem last year way more than a scoring problem(i.e. they didn't have a scoring problem), it's been addressed.  The problem is KP isn't giving them any consistent output this year.  If the second best player on the 76ers was playing poorly and I wrote an article saying..oh man they really miss Josh Richardson, how dumb would that sound? Yet that is what's happening here."
I mean thats exactly how you describe Seth Curry also. Like they are fine players and thats it
"Not as good as if they also added Jamal Murray, Seth Curry, and Sabonis...."
"Look, the mavs took a risk because they wanted a wing defender. Curry isn't going to stop anyone ever. They were hoping Richardson could shoot the 3 well enough to offset that because Richardson can defend.   I wish Seth was still in Dallas. I wanted him in Dallas when he first entered the league. I wanted him to never leave after his first run. I wanted him back when his portland run ended. I was pissed when he was traded. I'm still disappointed that he was traded."
"No guarantee that Dallas wins all these games, but missing Porzingis, Finney-Smith, Powell, Kleber, and Richardson didn't exactly help. They were 8-7 when they lost majority of those guys and since they came back, they're like 7-3.   As much as I loved Seth in Dallas(I wanted him to stay after his first run), I think the organization wanted a versatile defender like Richardson. While he doesn't shoot like Curry, but he's a better defender  and still averaging the same amount of points as Seth is in Philly."
I think I would also if Kyle Lowry isn‚Äôt available and no deal is to be had there   Gordon is frankly better than Danny green. The issue is the tax whatever ownership says publicly it‚Äôs always on any owners mind. This is frankly part of why the curry/Richardson deal happened they knew Richardson would cost a good bit more than Seth after 2021. Still if they aren‚Äôt cheap I would do it
"The comments here are ridiculous people are acting like we are talking about Steph curry and not Seth Curry. Dude is a one trick pony and averaging 12 points a game and doesn't do anything else, but shoot 3s which is a great trick, but it's not like he's a game changer."
Er...I think Philly's record has a lot more to do with how well Embiid is playing than a Seth Curry/Josh Richardson swap.  I'd also say the new coach probably has more to do with it as well.
"Yeah this is just a classic r/nba thread.  We lost a road game, 3rd game in 4 nights, no KP, and to a better team and there‚Äôs always some narrative.  We can‚Äôt win playoff series with Seth Curry on the floor for long stretches with Luka defensively so he had to go"
"Duke probably Kyrie, Ingram, Tatum, Zion and idk Bagley? Or just go small with Zion at the 5 and replace Bagley with someone like Seth Curry, Reddish or Barrett."
"The trade never made sense and I was perplexed at the time because Richardson, even if he was just Kawhi defensively, wouldn't bring the value that a healthy Seth Curry could offensively.  Also, the Mavericks didn't account for one important factor: Porzingis' health.  The Mavericks are going to have to put a minutes restriction on Porzingis because based on his size and style of play, he is going to need to be loaded managed.   Richardson never showed even a glimpse of value that compared to what 2019 playoffs Seth Curry did when he almost helped lead the Blazers to two wins over those KD juiced Warriors.   The Mavericks could surely use Seth Curry's shooting and drive and kick ability right now."
"me last season; Awesome, rooting for Dallas, seems they'll do well, can't wait for the next season!     seth curry traded: ...but why? Seemed to be pretty big in their success last year"
"Wait till u start watching the G League. At least in most college ball they'll work around their weaknesses (ie nobody can shoot) with systems, whole G League = the best of those college guys, some of whom can maybe kinda shoot some, maybe, all endlessly chucking bad 3s up bc they want to take the Seth Curry/Chris Boucher dev path"
"Who do you think you are, Seth Curry?"
"Yeah the only difference between them is that we can play man up with j rich, and have him atleast try to gaurd the best shooter. we had to play zone with curry. My personal opinion, Seth was a better fit."
"Rumor is that Seth Curry was traded after a prank he tried to pull on Jalen Brunson went horribly wrong. Seth hid in his locker in order to scare him, but Jalen didn‚Äôt show up to practice that day. Seth accidentally locked himself in the locker and couldn‚Äôt get out for quite some time. Unfortunately he doesn‚Äôt have the iron bladder most Curry men are famous for, and he ended up peeing all over Jalen‚Äôs things."
"Sure, Seth shot 100% from 3 and Richardson shot 0%, but JRich shot 100% from the line and Curry didn‚Äôt make a single one.  Win-win"
I remember reading something about Dell Curry changing Steph‚Äôs jumpshot over a summer because he thought it was too slow for the NBA and I was thinking why didn‚Äôt he do the same for Seth tbh. Seth‚Äôs jumpshot isn‚Äôt that fast so he‚Äôs more careful with his shots.
"i hope our front office sees this and realises how bad this team is, we clearly have some very valuable role players, but damn we fucking suck, watching this actually makes me think how the fuck did we manage to win 15 games this year. WCS and Powell is simply laughable and I love KP but he played 17/31 games this year. And Seth Curry was clearly a valuable asset and we could definitelly get more for him. Luka is getting doubled teamed every game by team's best defenders like against boston and today and he still gets shit done but this is getting old."
Seth Curry with a current team high +17.
I‚Äôd love 1 Seth Curry plsüòî
"Ah yes it's the semi-annual ""I can't believe the Mavericks traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson"" game."
"&gt;steph's defense is neutral at worst and above average for pgs.  Nope  &gt;what i'm saying is that if his defense was shit it would likely affect the team's overall defensive metrics.  And nope, like I mentioned, Sixers were constantly a top 5 defensive team, despite AI played 43 minutes per game. Sixers is 5th in the defensive rating right now, and Seth Curry is playing 30 minutes per game. That makes him an okay defender?  &gt;point guards just don't impact the game defensively as much as centers.  And you just contradicted yourself in some ways.  So yeah, you are either pretending to be dumb, or just dumb."
"Overrated is Matt Thomas. Some of our fans don't understand why he can't just do what guys like Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, JJ Redick or prime Kyle Korver can do. They act like he is the most lethal 3pt threat in the league, he just doesn't get opportunities to play and there's nothing else off about his game.   Underrated is DeAndre Bembry. He's been very good for us as a secondary ball handler, fast break finisher, and defender. He's pretty versatile out there always getting into passing lanes and making it more difficult for guys to get their shots off."
Overrated: Seth Curry. He's a great shooter but he doesn't shoot nearly enough most nights nor contribute on offense as much as he should be.  Underrated: Probably Simmons since I don't think people realize how much our ball movement depends on him even in the half court
I miss Seth curry :(
Why do they keep taking about how Richardson is playing against his former team? Seth Curry was part of that trade and they're not really mentioning that Curry is also playing against his former team
completly unrelated but do you guys consider Seth Curry black or white
"Like wtf is this trade lol. This make us worse. You would have to give up one your top players like Seth Curry, Tobias (idk about him since we can't match his contract) and etc"
"I mean I think you're overall point about it being a negligible difference versus Lebron and his teammates is true, but you're undermining your own point by only comparing Seth's career % to Embiid's season %. Especially when we can easily access both and just paint an objective picture.  **Career:**  Seth Curry - 85%  Joel Embiid - 80%   **This Season:**  Seth Curry - 94%  Joel Embiid - 85%"
I mean coaches have their players take tech free throws to get into their rhythm. Doc let‚Äôs Embiid exclusively take tech free throws even when Seth Curry is in
"DSJ was playing 30 minutes cause the team was tanking and the team was fined for saying it was tanking. He dropped very sharply after the rookie year.    THJ was the asset the mavs targeted, first stated by Sr. and confirmed by Jr., because he was good in Carlisle system based on scouting and analytics. If you go looking you‚Äôll find many players like Jr. and Seth Curry who‚Äôve had a career resurgence at Dallas."
[This](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench) is the biggest reason. Their bench has been the best in the league in terms of net rating. I think how successful a teams bench has been is an indicator of how deep their team is. The reason Mavs were decent last year and not so much this year until recently was because their starters got hurt which depleted their bench once their bench guys got upgraded to starters (and also miss Seth Curry).
"1) Does this account for the COVID games where we basically suited up 7 active players and lost two games by a combined 30 points? Not to mention Seth Curry has been struggling post COVID. He was shooting 50/50/90 prior to getting sick. Obviously the chances of sustaining that are low but the breathing issues have made him very hot/cold.   2) We will see, the Raptors team defense slowed him down. But can other teams replicate their strategy? Very few players/teams are capable of guarding him. It's really on Embiid's conditioning and focus.  3) I'm curious what the difference is when Embiid plays verse when he sits. I am worried about this over the season. We can not rely on Danny Green/Furkan Korkmaz to spread the floor as they are very streaky. Along with the aforementioned Seth Curry issues.   4) Doesn't matter, we're in the Eastern Conference. It's meaningless to say we would be fifth in the west cause we're not.   My main concerns about the Sixers (outside of Joel's health) are the streaky shooting and travel woes. Tobias needs to show up in the playoffs. We're hoping Daryl can add a secondary ball handler/playmaker."
"shake milton, tyrese maxey, and seth curry all take minutes at the 1-2"
"Steph curry, Seth Curry, meth curry, maple curry, yellow curry idgaf what curry you are but you‚Äôre gonna get great looks against us"
The consensus on the KP trade was overwhelmingly in the Mav's favor at the time. I can't remember why they shipped Barnes out. Maybe it was salary concerns? Or wanting Luka to become the team's central piece? The Seth Curry trade was and still is bad.
"The same could be said about Curry then, right? Saying he's a 42% 3pt shooter discredits him quite a lot. His 42% isn't the same as Seth Curry's 45%, Rozier's 45%, Bryn Forbes' 46%. And its not just because of volume."
"&gt; Well link it if you can find a ton of source.  You are the one that said it has been debunked multiple times. Surely you can find one source? That is my entire point you are the one that said it has been debunked multiple times and I am the one questioning you saying this isn't true and you have no sources.  &gt;Look bottom line is if he was that good he would be playing more than 17 minutes a game  He has missed games at two different stretches due to the same right ankle and it has been bothering him for that even more than that considering he tried to get back in and then missed games from it again. My entire point is that he is missing time because of his injury.  &gt;If the lakers was missing Kyle Kuzma that wouldn‚Äôt be considered ‚Äúinjury trouble‚Äù.  Cam Payne has had minute restricted because of his foot injury and listed as questionable for several games. One of the biggest reason the Suns are winning now is because of their bench which ranks number 1 in the league in terms of net rating. Cam Payne is a big reason for that. A big reason the Mavs were decent last year was because of their bench. If Seth Curry was forced to miss a bunch of games and play less minutes than he normally does, it would have hurt them greatly as well."
I‚Äôm surprised the Mavs FO doesn‚Äôt get clowned for some of the trades they made.  They had to give up a FRP to get KP.  Gave away Barnes for nothing.  Traded away a key scorer in Seth Curry.
"&gt;20/28/29 ppg respectively in their first 3 seasons since 18 years old  I think his PPG will be capped around 30. Maybe early 30's like 32. In fact his scoring is the same this year as it was last year at 28.8 but he might make another jump soon. I doubt he will improve much on this end so he has to improve either his efficiency or defense to compete with the greats.  &gt;triple double machine  Guard/front court rebounding is one of the more pointless stats.  It is usually &gt;70% uncontested which is the case for all of them whether it be Westbrook, Luka, or Lebron.  &gt;shoots okay, his shot selection needs work but really he's shooting from the 3 like Beal isn't he?  His best year shooting the three is the almost as good as the worst year of Bradley Beal shooting the three in the sample size of half a shortened year. Even still, he isn't competing with Beal, he is competing with all time greats and most of them either shot much better or defended much better at an early age. He is on his third year now (on very high volume) in a row where he shoots below league average 3% and below league average ft%.   &gt;He also proved he can perform in the playoffs, the problem is can the rest of his team  They lasted one series. Not sure I can confidently say that as much as you with one series sample size. Jamal Murray put up MJ esque stats vs the Utah Jazz in their series.  Porzingis and Seth Curry were both playing out of their mind shooting around 50% from 3 and they still lost. I didn't buy the narrative that the Mavs were a bad team that was carried by Luka and I am not to surprised they are a losing team so far this year when their really good depth players to FA or injury.  Many think that Luka will improve his shooting and defense when he gets a lot of the load taken off of him. Often Lebron is cited for this. For every Lebron there is a handful of plays that switch teams and never improve defense significantly and actually those players don't mesh well because they are the type of player that needs the ball to be effective. I think Luka is the type of person who needs to have a lot of touches to take advantage of his skillset because he isn't very athletic defender or a very good shooter. I know he has high volume 3 point shooting but even when factoring that in, his 3 point shooting sticks out like a sore thumb. His catch and shoot 3% has been &lt;30% two years in a row now which is unusual and what people often use to gauge how a shooter would shoot if they are more open. Luka did have a good stretch of shooting this year so maybe he can continue that stretch for longer. We shall see."
Seth Curry who?
"I don't really feel it makes sense to extrapolate his insanely hot start to the rest of the season. But yes, if he continued being basically the best three point shooter in NBA history, he deserved the spot. Dude was more efficient than Curry was on way higher volume than Steve Kerr or Seth...So not unreasonable to expect a decline.  (As a sports bettor I know how fucking nice CJ was from three)"
"A lot of the guys on your lists weren't nearly the players they are right now.   Seth Curry wasn't as good, Bellinelli had one of his worst shooting years, Mclemore looked like a long term project, WCS had almost zero BBIQ, Casspi was basically a far worse version of Duncan Robinson, Collison was a traffic cone who thought he was better than he was, Rondo wasn't as mature and looked like he just wanted to stat pad his whole season.  What is with this revisionism lmao"
"Flair up then dude, and welcome.  Also, yeah lol, they‚Äôre just called commentators in sports. Usually there‚Äôs a ‚Äúplay-by-play‚Äù guy, who is describing the action, and a ‚Äúcolor commentator‚Äù who is supposed to provide observations and analysis on the fly (more or less).   Eric Collins is the play-by-play guy, and Dell Curry is the color commentator for Charlotte. (Dell is also Steph &amp; Seth Curry‚Äôs dad.. if you weren‚Äôt aware. He‚Äôs also Austin River‚Äôs [Doc River‚Äôs son] Father-in-Law.)"
"prime lebron would have carried those teams to the playoffs. where the fuck were you in 2012 and 2013? lebron would have carried ME to the playoffs. those were actual nba players.   rudy gay, rondo, darren collison, omri casspi, marco bellinelli, seth curry, ben mclemore, willie cauley-stein. those are all functional nba players who can dribble basketballs and tie their shoes. some of them are actually good at basketball. lebron might have gone to the finals with them. you're underrating how absurd he was in his prime. bro he used to jump with his head above the rim and play defense during the regular season and he was just as smart as he is now. it was fucking crazy"
76ers.  I love Seth Curry and think it would funny if Danny Green won his third ring in a row before even receiving the other two.
And Seth curry. And trey Burke.
"I know people didn't care about us that year, but I really did think that team was a few pieces from looking like the current Clippers/Jazz/Nuggets. Doubt we'd have won anything but could have been a tough out.  I think if they could have gotten talent like Danilo or Seth Curry or just someone happy to shoot 3s, it would have made a difference. I also think we needed to give Jerami a bit of a larger role. Oh and I wanted a stretch 5. Steven Adams been terrible for like 3 years at this point lol."
I think the same type of thing is happening with Seth Curry well at least for a handful of years now that he is a real NBA starter going back 3-4 teams they always get better with him.
"Did OKC have more talent? Both teams were built around two stars with decent role players throughout and that's ignoring Nurkic for the Blazers who was hurt. Kanter, Seth Curry, Harkless and Aminu for one side and Schroder, Adams, Grant (way before what he was today) and Terrence Ferguson (?) for the other.  Portland dusted them because Dame and CJ overperformed while Russ and PG underperformed, both teams were pretty even talent wise."
Crazy thing is Seth Curry would have made this list if he found his place in the league sooner. He basically only became a legit recognised role player after 26.
"No, that cap space was used to resign Dwight Powell who was a UFA and the remainder was to resign bird players DFS, Kleber, and Porzingis to operate over the cap. The trade exception created from Barnes was used for Delon Wright and later on Willie Cauley-Stein at the cost of three total 2nd picks.  Out current potential cap space is mostly due to Tim Hardaway expiring and Josh Richardson who was acquired from Seth Curry who we signed while over the cap."
"&gt;  and the guy who brought you luminaries like Alen Smailagic.  Kirk Lacob also signed the following players to the Santa Cruz warriors: Seth Curry, Bazemore, Dewayne Dedmon, Kendrick Nunn, Danuel House  Kirk also pushed the league to adopt two way contracts."
"Austin Rivers remains unsigned, Rivers family reunion with Doc and Seth Curry out there."
"People aren't a fan of this one, but I honestly think that if Seth Curry were put into the same situation at the beginning of his career as Steph, on a bad team and allowed to just go wild, I think he could've been just as good or almost as good as Steph."
"PG was ass and had one of the worst stretches of his career, I‚Äôll give you that  Pat Bev was injured  Luka couldn‚Äôt score consistently on Kawhi. That‚Äôs why he ran so much PnR with Seth Curry and Tim Hardaway screening."
"So is Alex Caruso, Seth Curry, Marcus Morris, etc.... Are all those better too?"
"Ex-Laker shooters. For some reason Lakers shooters are shit, but when they leave and play against us, all of a sudden they are fucking Seth Curry, IE Danny Green"
"the sixers added danny green, seth curry and dwight howard, and tobias harris got good again, and the celtics kinda don't play as a team anymore i guess i dunno, they're weird"
"Nah. It‚Äôs Bledsoe and Adams. Bledsoe is a PG masked as a SG who can‚Äôt shoot so Lonzo has to be the corner shooter which takes away his ability to playmake. Adams is a bad fit for zion because both plays within the paint and both bad shooters. So there‚Äôs no stretch big for zion to drive and kick and it congests the lanes.  If they could get a corner 3 shooter who can guard players like a Seth Curry and a stretch big who can dfend, like a Theis, Pelicans would be Top 5 in the west."
"Tobias has been great this year, but it looks like he and Simmons are worn down and Seth Curry doesn't seem the same since he got COVID. He was on fire earlier in the season."
"Trading Seth Curry is the reason we were losing. It doesn't matter that we were starting Wes Iwundu, Josh Green, and Willie Cauley-Stein."
"They overachieved and hit a wall. I'm not asking you to list what they've done I'm asking you to look at the fucking roster beyond Brown and Tatum and most of these guys are hardly NBA level players currently. Why WOULD you expect them to make a run? Philly added guys like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard. Real experience and depth. Boston lost Hayward and added more rookies, the ghost of Jeff Teague, and a Covid ridden Thompson."
"Sixers have better role players than they used to have with Danny Green and Seth Curry; Harris is playing much better under Doc. Celtics really don‚Äôt have a replacement for Hayward. Their bench lacks scoring (maybe Fournier can help) and then Marcus Smart has been taking WAY too many hero shots as well as making dumb turnovers. I think with Rob Williams and TT healthy they have the talents. But Kemba and Smart have to play significantly better. Brown and Tatum, but mostly Brown have to be more consistent stars and then Fournier and another player need to step up as scorers for them off the bench."
"I forgot you have Fournier now. He's great. But Timelord is a bench big at this point in his career, Pritchard is like okay. Langford stinks. You're making my point listing these guys as good 5-9 guys. Other than Fournier are any of those guys as good as Danny Green, Seth Curry, Shake, Thybulle? Dwights better than Williams or close enough that the fact that shes the backup vs the starter makes it negligible"
"Unlike previous years, we have Danny Green and Seth Curry sitting on the 3pt line as well."
Seth Curry is unnecessary with the revelation of 40% elite 3pt shooter Luka Donƒçiƒá
Seth Curry
What happened to the Seth Curry/Josh Richardson trade going poorly for Dallas? Richardson appears to be one of the best players in the league
Seth curry who??
"No he does not lmao, he draws fouls more but he doesn‚Äôt get to the line from pump fakes. He gets there cause he‚Äôs a big man that nobody can guard. This isn‚Äôt a rule to combat big men like embiid, if it‚Äôs because of any sixer it is Seth curry, he does it more than joel"
Steph Curry literally looks like and plays like a knock off Seth.
Seth Curry literally looks like and plays like a knock off Steph.
Seth Curry isn't cute
76ers shld throw Embiid for Oubre to start their new all cute lineup. That bum embiid aint cute enough.  All cute lineup of Pg: Luka Sg: Seth curry Sf: Oubre Pf&amp;C: Tobi &amp; Bobi  Who says no??
"3-team trade  Simmons and Seth Curry to the Warriors, Beal to the Sixers, Wiseman, Minny pick, Wiggins, and a GS first to Wizards"
"Lets just say JJ Redick and Seth Curry is a wash. Are you saying if right now you have a choice to choose between Jimmy Butler and Danny Green + George Hill, you will rather have the latter on your team because of better spacing in regular season? Playoff is a different animal and Jimmy left. You'd love to have him back of you can let's be honest here."
You replace Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick with Danny Green and Seth Curry and you are better ? Do you really believe this?
"A Philly fan just yelled ""Someone send Seth Curry to the showers"" damn, I missed New England fans in arenas"
"Ya it‚Äôs a shame really, he‚Äôs the same age as Klay and seth curry and I do believe he still got a lot of time to find his bounce"
What if you combined Simmons with....Seth Curry?
Grant‚Äôs squad:  Kyrie  Zion  Tatum Ingram ~~Barrett~~ Trent Jr. Bagley  Seth Curry Reddish Wendell Carter Mason Plumlee Grayson JJ Redick
He has to guard him that way in order to stop Seth Curry from getting open looks off Ben's screens

"No, he's just a complete nothing player. Joe Harris makes zero difference for that team in terms of championship potential.  Is Seth Curry underrated? Is KCP underrated? Is Luke Kennard underrated? Those are the comparisons for someone like Joe Harris."
"Klay blew his acl AND Achilles plus he is 30 something and one of his best qualities is defense, he is going to be closer to guys like demarcus cousins, seth curry, lma, duncan robinson when he comes back"
"Seth Curry.  He can't be a starter in a contending and he always get bullied against big teams on the defense.  On the other end, if he comes of the bench he will be cooking and he can average his pre-covid stats."
"I don't see anyone talking about Seth Curry... but that was BY FAR the biggest takeaway from this game for me.  I've never seen him play like that, even when he was on fire.  His willingness to quick release, and shoot off balance is EXACTLY what this team needs on offense."
"No one can stop Embiid. I‚Äôm more concerned with what we do against everyone else. Stopping Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Seth Curry etc is what‚Äôs important here."
Embiid Tobias Simmons Green George Hill Shake Milton Seth Curry Dwight Thybule
"Yeah but they cant play any full defensive lineups without dying offensively. Every time they need a seth curry or tobias harris who whilst they will give their all, are going to get exposed   Thats the issue, the nets have two of the best offensive players of all time to go along with an all nba point guard, two of the most experienced and accoladed offensive big men in the modern game and a lights out shooter who will shut down the gym if left open.  If you have one weak defender in crunch time they will make you pay, and pay dearly."
He‚Äôs a shit human being too. Seth Curry sonning him and then calling him a ‚Äúbitch ass‚Äù was my fav moment of the bubble.
Of course Marv confuses Danny Green with Seth Curry. Danny only had 3 threes.
Seth Curry and Michael Carter Williams
"Matisse Thybulle and Seth Curry  Or Thybulle and Shake  They aren‚Äôt MVP worthy, but locks for all stars I would imagine"
Seth Curry &amp; Bol Bol
"There were 3 plumlees at one point too, but I guess mason is the only one now   Cody and Caleb Martin  Brook and Robin Lopez   Steph and Seth curry.   The Morris twins  The Hernangomez brothers  Jalen and Jaden McDaniels  The Ball Boys"
Of corse his numbers in December where an outlier. If Luka keep scoring +40% from 3 in his career it is scary for anybody else. Give him back a shooter like Seth Curry and he would lead an offense to All Time great performance.
"Not sure what you're talking about, to me it looks like he treats Seth Curry pretty well"
Seth Curry would really help that team.
"Doc is amazing at handling his stars so Harris doing better is no surprise to me. The most credit for your current season however goes to Morey who bought in Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey. Also, Dwight and of course the GOAT Danny Green.  Also, Embiid was a different beast than any other year, he personally elevated his game a bunch and i dont know how much credit Doc gets there."
"Depends on the player. A guy like Zion would knock em out cold, but a bloke like Seth Curry wouldn't do too much damage"
Warriors defense has not missed a beat without klay. Jaylen is def overrated on that side. Ingram got derozan as a sf comps early in his career and I think that‚Äôs interesting although him shooting the 3 well on high volume pretty much kills that comp. josh Richardson/Seth curry trade was not a good one by Dallas. Serve ibaka also does not fix really any of the clippers problems and ppl def thought he would cause they still think he‚Äôs a good rim protector.
"that seems to be the case. he's a guy who loves to play and they had him barely even getting minutes to work out the shooting slump. I get why he wasn't super jazzed about it, especially knowing he fits so well as a floor spacer. he's not as good as seth curry right now but he's gonna be of use to the Mavs for sure"
"Agreed. Although, I'm not sure the Sixers are better now. Its roughly the same lineup, except instead of JJ Reddick and Butler they have Seth Curry and Danny Green. The former was a better team, imo."
"uh  Seth Curry is 1st career 3P% among active players (that have enough attempts to qualify).   He is 2nd all time in career 3P%, only behind Steve Kerr.  Sound pretty elite to me."
"i wouldn't want to fight him either. gun to my head if you said i had to fight one nba player, i guess realistically it'd probably be someone more like seth curry, but if you only gave me like 5 seconds to say a name, i'd probably say kd."
Seth Curry is what we thought Steph's ceiling would be.
"&gt;For example, replace WB with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Gallinari, are the Wizards better?  No, absolutely not lol"
so seth curry and danny green
"As always, when someone says ""without him"" they don't mean his sudden disappearance from the face of the earth. But, if WB is gone then his cap space is gone too. So if you put in $40 million worth of replacement-level players *instead of* Westbrook, are they better?  For example, replace WB with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Gallinari, are the Wizards better?"
"Basically the same thing, still statistically untrue. THJ doesn't go on stretches where he shoots 28 PPG then goes back down to Earth to shoot 10 PPG regularly.  All players that shoot numerous threes a game go through slumps.  Harden before the Pistons game was shooting 15 percent on his threes for the last 8 games.  Curry has had the same thing.  Players that are only shooters like Robinson, Seth Curry, etc have also gone through the same thing."
"but that's my point, what does it take to prove that? they're 34-11 which is far superior to last year's jazz team. they're leading all other teams now. they're clearly playing better than everyone else by quite a bit.  do they need to make a deep playoff run against these exact same teams to show they can do it? because all these teams are new. the lakers have lost rondo and howard, the sixers have picked up howard, danny green, and seth curry. the nets are playing with an entire new squad.  none of those teams have proven their playoff credentials either because none of those teams existed last year."
the seth curry trade was a really bad one for the mavs
"Quicker release really does matter. If Seth Curry had a quick release like steph, he would be averaging at least 21ppg"
1. Joel Embiid 2. Ben Simmons 3. Tobias Harris 4. Shake Milton 5. Danny Green 6. Mattise Thybulle 7. Seth Curry 8. Dwight Horward 9. Furkan Korkmaz 10. Mike Scott  Haven‚Äôt seen George Hill yet but I‚Äôd imagine he slides in right under Seth
"I think it comes from their size and athleticism. They made teams throughout their lives due to their sharpshooting ability but often times the 3 point specialists are smaller and less athletic. Thinking of people like Seth Curry, JJ, Joe Harris for this one."
Seth Curry is a liability out there defensively. If he's not shooting the ball what's the point of him being on the floor?
Seth Curry
"Except Seth curry, Collins, and Capela are so much better than 2021 Blake and LMA"
"Lol it's not even close to the Nets' level. It'd be more accurate if say, Lakers traded Caruso, Kuzma &amp; Danny green for Damian Lillard. And then picked up Paul Millsap, John Collins, and somehow acquired Seth Curry. And Clint Capela"
Buyout Seth Curry and Ben so the Lakers can win. You sign them in the offseason.
I know this is a joke but Andre Drummond &gt; Seth Curry.
Yea but thybulle lack of offense hurts the 76ers on the other end so I would imagine they would have to play Seth Curry right
I‚Äôd prefer Seth Curry over Andre Drummond personally
"Probably the only way is to have good guard defenders to slow down Harden and Kyrie while having a dominant big to pick apart their defense. I think it wouldn't be crazy for the 76ers to beat them but the problem would be that Seth Curry and Green wouldn't match up well against Harden and Kyrie.  The Bucks could also give them decent trouble as Holiday and Divincenzo are good defenders and they have a ton of guys like Tucker, Craig, Middleton, and Giannis to throw at the big 3 and Giannis should be able to feast against the Nets defense but at the end of the day I still think the big 3 can get it done as the Bucks don't have that second superstar to support Giannis"
"Probably should've lost that game. Bad decisions by Knicks late in the 4th, including trying to iso Ben Simmons on back to back possessions with both Korkmaz and Seth Curry on the floor.   Either way was a very fun game overall though. Knicks played great D"
"Knicks are for real, tough game  Tobias redemption arc is insane  Undershirt-less Seth is the better Curry"
This is the Seth Curry I fantasize.
seth curry is hot af tonight
"Seth Curry with a 30 footer, bang, Sixers took the lead."
It would be a 17pt game if the Knicks would get called for these hacks on layups. Or when they literally just tackled Seth Curry off a PNR and got a dunk
Seth Curry.
"We are also a worse team. Replaced Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick for Danny Green and Seth Curry. Not as bad as losing Kawhi though, obviously"
"Eh I think it‚Äôs about the same. Maybe a lil better. But sixers went all out with Seth Curry, Green, as well as Tobias picking it up a lot and bench players like Furkan and Matisse shooting better"
You must be talking about Seth Curry
"Counterpoint, Seth Curry &amp; Mychel Thompson.  Think about it."
"You could also look at this the other way and say that Steph also allows you to get value out of basically anyone on offense. You don't need to get JJ Reddick/Seth Curry type players to space the floor for your star, because Steph by himself basically provides all the spacing you would need. You also don't need to worry about pairing ball-dominant players, or trying to find more playmaking, since Steph is amazing both on and off the ball.   So yeah, you do give up some defensive scalability vs a wing like LeBron/Kawhi, but you get arguably the most offensively scalable player ever. It's just different tradeoffs. Like for LeBron, you really need to get players who thrive off-ball (AD, shooters), and for Kawhi you need to find enough playmaking to make the sure the offense doesn't bog down (Lowry, Van Vleet)."
"Steven Adams, Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle."
"It takes maturity to crab dribble outta the clickbait ""NUMBER ONE PICK ANTHONY EDWARDS SAYS HE SHOT BETTER THAN SETH CURRY""   Stay humble, young man. You'll be eating steak and shrimp while an all star soon."
"Lmk how things would go if you lose Harris, Embiid, Seth Curry, and Thybulle."
[Wojnarowski] NBA has fined Ben Simmons and Seth Curry $20000 each for praising the referees  /s
"Idk man, Embiid right now is comparable to KD, Steph is Steph and Simmons is better than draymond imo (love draymond tho)   Then you have Tobias and Danny Green and Seth Curry etc.. like that‚Äôs a really great bench too"
Seth Curry is a legend
"I always hate this, like we‚Äôve seen the Jazz and Sixers get pounced in the playoffs with virtually the same team. We‚Äôve also seen them not stay healthy and health is what is crucial to winning championships. I‚Äôve seen this show and know how it ends, Seth Curry and Bojan wouldn‚Äôt alter it by that much"
Yeah I'd take Harden over Seth Curry for the Warriors too
"Because if you actually watch basketball games you'd see how shit he is at everything but scoring.   Did you really say he's improved at defense? He was literally 6'10 Trae Young last night. His defensive IQ is that of a potato. You can't teach 6'10 but you also can't teach stupid, and this kid is literally a stupid anti-vaxxer. He also can't playmake or pass for shit.  His scoring and efficiency amounts to being the third option. You don't compare third option scorers to first option scorers in terms of efficiency. It means literally nothing. That's like comparing Seth Curry's 3 point shooting to Steph Curry and saying that the former is a better shooter because of his percentage.  &amp;#x200B;  Listing those accolades really change nothing, as they're trash compared to what Luka did before coming into the league."
Also Seth Curry and Danny Green that are shooting incredible this season
You can really tell who actually watches the sixers and who reads bbref statlines based off their opinion of Seth Curry.  Danny Green is a far better player than him and his shooting percentages are highly inflated by his refusal to shoot anything but picture perfect looks.  He is the most deceiving 40% 3PT shooter I have ever seen
"This year it would be Tacko Fall, Caruso, Kuzma, Herro in some order plus Curry, just to throw everyone off ... until they realize it's Seth, not Steph."
"Have you seen the rest of the roster? Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz are all pretty terrible defenders  Also what do you mean Jazz defense is better? Sixers have the 2nd highest team d rating per NBA.com this season to the Lakers"
"How come no one talks about Seth Curry in your starting lineup? He's a good catch and shoot guy but other than that he's pretty useless. Every time they pass him the ball he looks at the basket, takes a few dribbles and pass it back not even trying to do something."
"Yeah people were saying the Sixers were screwed long term with the Harris/Horford contracts. People were saying that one of Embiid/Simmons had to be traded and the Sixers needed to rebuild.   But the biggest change they made in that offseason (other than upgrading from one of the worst coaches in the league to a solid one) was that they got veteran level players to put next to Simmons/Embiid. Guys like Danny Green, Dwight Howard, George Hill, Seth Curry, etc.   I think the Celtics have the assets to do that if they choose to, I'm curious to see whether they'll decide to go that route or not. They have their core group of players now they need to trim some of the fat to build around Brown and Tatum. Maybe that involves trading Kemba, maybe that involves trading Smart, but there are moves out there that could change the outlook of the team and we still have the assets to do that."
Do not remember Seth Curry playing for the blazers
"Once you eliminate the outliers like Steph Curry and uh... Seth Curry, it all makes sense"
I cant believe morey turned josh Richardson into Seth curry
"On the benches are Kyle Anderson, Enes Kanter, Seth Curry, Derrick Favors, Patty Mills, and Nerlens Noel."
Obviously Seth Curry. By 0.8%
"He‚Äôs a less efficient Seth Curry and Seth Curry only makes $8 mil a year lmao. Like Seth is definitely underpaid, but he‚Äôs not $20 million a year underpaid. This is such an obvious bluff by Pat Riley it‚Äôs not even funny. More likely he‚Äôs throwing out a stupid number to push away teams from over-bidding on him in free agency so he can come along and sign him to a friendly contract like $12m a year after all the other teams have blown their salary space away."
"It would have been the exact same thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, there isn't a major schematic difference between Brett and Doc.  The only major changes are on defense with Embiid playing less drop coverage.    The main difference between the Sixers from last year to this year are spacing that Danny Green and Seth Curry provide that Al Horford and Josh Richardson do not.    If anything Butlers lack of consistent 3pt shooting would have led to the problems we had last season and the season prior.  Tobias wouldn't have space and opportunity to post up.  Joel would have very little space to manuever and harder double teams to face.  Ben would still stuck in the dunkers spot."
"Skill boost - Ben Simmons, 3pt shooting. Improves spacing and makes Ben Simmons ball handler pick and rolls so much more effective. Since Ben is already a good passer, he'd be pretty dangerous.  Honorable mention - Embiid, playmaking. Embiid is already extremely hard to guard, but if his playmaking was better he'd be laughably unstoppable.   Athleticism boost - Shake Milton. Shake has average athleticism I'd say. He's already able to drive well because of his craftiness and his length. Extra athleticism would probably make him a starting tier player as it would improve his scoring and turn his defense up a notch.   Height boost - Matisse Thybulle. Imagine have two Ben Simmons running around on defense lol. He'd still be shorter than Ben at 6'8"" but still. Honorable mentions - Seth Curry, being taller he'd get his shot off easier. Maxey, would probably immediately take over Shake's role with added height."
To think that the Mavs had Seth Curry and just traded him away
2/3 NBA starting caliber sons is literally more than any dad on the planet can say (I guess except Dell Curry if Seth is a consistent starter)   Especially when Lavar or his wife wasn‚Äôt ever on that level
"Dell Curry seems fine, and one of his boys is shooting 44.2% from 3 this season.   His name is Seth btw"
"Fair enough but i do think guys like Trey Burke and Seth Curry were playing out of their minds in the playoffs, im not sure they could replace that reduction this year in the postseason. Anyways even with Dallas maintaining position, id still say its an equally difficult conference at worst"
Steph or Seth Curry?
"Seth Curry and Shake Milton are both really really bad (especially Shake), Danny Green has been pretty meh this year and George Hill falls under that too now that he is there.  The Lakers have one guy that could be considered really bad, Drummond, and he isn‚Äôt even on Shakes level.   Why is this concept so hard to get man"
"This would hold up if we were talking about 1 or 2 people, you are saying there are 3 individuals better than anyone on the Lakers. Not to mention the Sixers are also rolling out Dwight Howard, Danny Green and Tobias Harris to round out their rotation.   The only negative defenders in their top 8 rotation are Seth Curry and Shake Milton, both guards."
"That was his sophomore year.  Everyone at Charlotte knew steph curry, because we failed to recruit him and then he ended up at Davidson after VT declined to give him a scholarship, but would have let him walk on.  What was wild is, while curry was blowing up, Seth got essentially the same treatment so he ended up at Liberty."
Shoot too much when cold: Marcus smart  Not enough when hot: Seth curry
"I added nuance, you just dont have an answer for the drop coverage leading to the open threes/midrange Embid will give up.  You baselessly said Claxton wont play in the playoffs and said he woulndt see the floor with Aldridge even though he played the very first night Aldridge got there and DAJ had a DNP. You think Joe Harris will only play 10-12 min a game in the playoffs LOL. You think a team with better shooters than Harden's previous Rockets has worse spacing despite the Rockets also having no off ball movement lmao(two of those shooters being KD and Kyrie LOL) because teams wont collapse on Harden which is bullshit LOL.   Despite having only two guys who can guard him(one of which is an offensive liability in Thybulle).Danny Green cant guard Harden and Thybulle will not see the floor because he's terrible offensively(51 TS% this year). Also Philly is going to have fun hiding Seth curry.  You said Harden couldnt beat a team with a great rim protector despite Harden beating Utah twice. The second time  it cost them 2 games trying to implement their strategy to stop Harden. You also tout bullshit narratives about KD and Harden despite them playing together previously and wanting to play together now.  You see this team as the Clippers despite being vastly more talented.   Oh and btw one more thing you were wrong about, Curry's efficiency was never lowered playing with Durant, he had the highest TS% of his career playing with Durant. So that's another thing you were wrong about.  &gt;For the final time, regular season doesn't mean anything. Harden always manufactures regular season wins  2 WCF appearances. One of which took your team to 7 Games and would have beaten you had Chris Paul been there. Check Harden's last three playoffs if you think he doesnt generate wins. And name me another superstar in the Western Conference who's had more success than Harden in the playoffs besides the Rockets while the Warriors were around. You are so full of it bro."
Warriors had Lin and Seth Curry
"&gt;  I mean a great look at the rim over a weak defender.  And....who would that be?  The only weak defender who will get any minutes will be Seth Curry, and you can expect he'll get fewer minutes in this matchup.  You're talking about ""weak"" defenders when the Sixers are running:  Embiid, Simmons, Danny Green, Thybulle, Harris.  Those guys are all somewhere from good to elite on defense, and their backup center is Dwight Howard.  The rim is untouchable and the switchable, long defenders will be contesting 3's."
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
Yeah someone should really tell Seth curry that he‚Äôs wrong about Ben
"Seth Curry has virtually identical stats this year as he has for the last several years that got him the cheap contract and middling trade value, it's not like he broke out and is an all-star.  He's still poor defensively and he still needs too much time/space to shoot high volume and get full impact from his obviously great spot up shooting skill.  The Mavs traded him because he couldn't play with Luka in clutch minutes, the defensive combination was too weak.  They've been much better in those situations this year, and JRich's general profile still fits what they are looking for long term.  But yes it's a trade loss for the Mavs because while he's still the profile they want, he hasn't been good enough at it to commit to long term unless he's really tanked his value.  His defense if fine but it's not consistently disruptive enough, and he is shooting a career worst from 3.  So now when he walks obviously it'd be better to have the longer value contract on Seth and have tried some other starting solution.  Oh well, too bad but it was a role player trade not franchise altering mega deal.  Hopefully he can get hot for a postseason series."
Was that Seth Curry getting the last rebound?  The whole last 5 minutes where like watching my nieces playing 2k vrs the pc on amateur
I‚Äôd say Seth Curry...
"You‚Äôre 100% right, but this is a fundamentally different team than it was with Brett Brown.  BB made no in game adjustments and his offensive strategy was ‚ÄúSimmons bullies his mismatch and we do everything we can to get Embiid the ball...just kind of wherever we can.‚Äù  Doc isn‚Äôt a top 5 coach but he‚Äôs miles better than BB and he has instituted an actual offense.  The off ball movement is so noticeably better it doesn‚Äôt look like the same team.  Harris looks like a completely different player, like the rising star he was before he came to Philly.  With Green, Tobi and (off the bench Seth Curry) Joel‚Äôs 3 point shooting improvement the spacing is unrecognizable to what they did even just last year.  Embiid brings it in the playoffs, and their problems were structural not player-based.  If you stop Embiid you beat the Sixers.  But there isn‚Äôt anyone who can stop Embiid and the Nets are possibly the worst post defense in the NBA."
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  Who do these people expect to start at the 4?  Mike Scott?  35 year old Anthony Tolliver?  PF is literally our thinnest position and these guys are like yeah trade him for a guy who will replace Seth Curry in the starting lineup.  A Seth Curry by the way who's basically done everything asked of him.  Seth Curry + Tobias Harris &gt; Mike Scott + CJ McCollum
"The JRich trade has not been a disaster lmfao. He‚Äôs not shooting as well as we‚Äôd like but he can still make plays and get shots. He‚Äôs also a significantly better defender than the liability that is Seth Curry. Look, I love Seth, but we don‚Äôt need another knockdown three point shooter when we have like 6 guys who can shoot over 40% from three"
"TRAVEL!  The NBA should just remove the travel rule, Seth Curry gets called for a travel when he is pushed over, Cousins takes 3 steps on this dunk.

"You used defensive rating. Seth Curry has the same defensive rating as Jimmy Butler. Seth is an amazing offensive player, put I've seen enough of him to tell you he is nowhere near equal to Jimmy Butler on defense. Defensive rating is not an accurate stat."
"Steph Curry, he's Seth Curry's younger brother. I think he's gonna show up on people's radar once he's not on a terrible team like the Warriors. Seriously, have they ever even made it to the finals?"

"We had Greg Monroe and Boban. Not sure if Amir Johnson was still on the team at the time.   Yeah we didn't get Embiid a decent backup until we moved Al Horford to the Bench last year, and even then the spacing was so dogshit it never really mattered.  Turning last years roster into what we have now is the reason why I love having Morey so much. A good backup 5 in Dwight, which is a major need, but also having Danny Green and Seth Curry next to Embiid has given him so much more space to operate and gives him players who he can pass out to that make their shots at a decent rate."
"Less than two months after his 27th birthday, Joel Embiid looks like one of the most important players in professional basketball. He's more confident than ever for one reason: He has become one of the most complete superstars in the game.  As Embiid enters his prime, he's the centerpiece on both ends of the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers, who have become a legitimate threat to win it all.  No center has won the MVP award since Shaquille O'Neal in 1999-2000 for the Los Angeles Lakers. That drought should end this year, with both Embiid and Nikola Jokic making strong cases and reminding us that big men still matter. Not only does Embiid rank third in the league in scoring this season, but he also anchors one of the best defenses in the league, a key claim that Jokic cannot make.  Entering Thursday, the Sixers have the best record in the East, and Embiid is the biggest reason for that. Consider this:   In the 1,457 minutes he's been on the court this season, Philadelphia has a monstrous net rating of plus-12.0.  In the 1,693 minutes he's been on the bench this season, Philadelphia has a net rating of minus-0.3.  Embiid has had a breakout season, and while his place in the MVP race might dominate podcast conversations, that's just a distraction -- the real story here is Embiid and the new-look 76ers appear to be evolving into one of the most sustainable contenders in the NBA.  The arrivals of Daryl Morey and Doc Rivers signified the beginning of a new era in Philadelphia. Together, they've overhauled the vibes around Embiid and Ben Simmons. Morey quickly traded Al Horford and added good shooters like Seth Curry and Danny Green, while Rivers refreshed the actions and the rotations.  The result has been a more cohesive, more spacey ecosystem, which has cleared out the clutter and enabled Embiid to do what he does best. He's scoring more than ever, and he's doing so at a more efficient clip than we've ever seen from him. He's on pace to set career highs in both 2-point shooting percentage and 3-point shooting percentage. When you look at his shot chart from this season, you can see he's filling it up from all over the place.  Embiid is both more active and more efficient as a jump shooter than ever. He has both attempted and made more jumpers than anyone else on the Sixers. He's taking more than 15 jumpers per 100 possessions, up from 13.6 last season, and he's making more than 40% of them for the first time in his career.  Coming into this season, he'd struggled to achieve average 3-point shooting efficiency despite being gifted wide-open looks by defenses that dared him to shoot. But this season, Embiid has converted 36.8% of his 3.1 3-point tries per game.  That's a massive development because defenses now must honor his long-range game, which opens up other opportunities for him and his teammates elsewhere.  The bigger development has come inside the arc, where Embiid now shows off a feathery touch on midrange shots. He's attempting 11.4 non-paint 2s per 100, the highest such number among the 83 players who have tried at least 100 midrangers this season. Oh, and he's making them, too, converting 43.6% of his non-paint 2s this season. That's not only the highest such mark of his career by far, but it also changes the math on how teams must defend him away from the rim.  While his outside shooting has developed, it's his nightly performances on the low block that provide us all a reminder of the virtues of a style of play mostly left for dead in recent years. For decades, big post-up centers like Embiid dominated the NBA, but post play rapidly declined as the NBA fell in love with 3-point shots, motion offenses and faster-paced action. Post -ups happen more than 50% less frequently than they did just eight years ago.  Since the league added its player tracking system in 2013-14, post-up activity has cratered. That season, NBA teams posted up over 16.35 times per 100 possessions. This season, that figure is 8.17 times per 100.  But that staggering trend does not apply in Philly or in Denver, where the league's top two MVP candidates just happen to be dominating the league via old-school post play.  Get this: Embiid is posting up as an individual more per game than 27 other teams are collectively! Only the Lakers and Nuggets as teams are posting up more than he does.  Jokic isn't far behind, posting up more than 24 teams.  Just like the folks who have made us recently reconsider our stances on mom jeans, Embiid and Jokic are making post play cool again.  Embiid ranks first in the league, posting up 19.3 times per 100 possessions. Jokic ranks fourth, posting up 13.7 times per 100. And out of 19 players who have posted up at least 200 times this season, Jokic ranks first in efficiency, Embiid ranks second.  It's remarkable that the league's top two MVP candidates are both centers who are revising the conventional wisdom of the past 10 years: Centers were supposed to be endangered species; post play was supposed to be dying out.  Embiid is the only player in the league scoring double digits per game on post plays, and his MVP campaign is also a demonstration that the old Mikan-Russell-Chamberlain-Jabbar dance ain't dead just yet.  The pace-and-space era and the 3-point revolution have reformed the ways NBA front offices value the skills of frontcourt talent. The ability to thrive in the post on offense and defense used to be paramount. Now it isn't, and scouting reports for big men now examine their abilities to guard multiple positions, shoot from 25 feet, run the floor, grab rebounds, protect the rim, and serve up dribble-handoffs to the guards and wings they share the floor with.  As a result, the players attempting to stop the post actions of Embiid and Jokic might not be as common or as equipped to defend these actions in years past.  Just as post offense is a lost art, so is post defense. That is great news for Embiid, who is on the right side of his prime, one of the most imposing post players this league has seen in decades and still getting better. Embiid and Jokic would have thrived in any era, but in the context of the modern NBA, in which strength and size are less prioritized, there is a mouse in the house more than ever before.  As a defender himself, Embiid provides the Sixers with quite the opposite. As a 280-pound 7-footer with a 7-foot, 6-inch wingspan, he's among the league's biggest and best defenders.  The Sixers rank second in defensive efficiency in the NBA this season, giving up just 106.8 points per 100. While they decorate the defensive end with an imposing fleet of willing, savvy and sizable defenders, they play their best defense when both Simmons and Embiid are on the floor. Simmons is one of the world's most talented perimeter defenders. The combination of his point guard instincts, his defensive will and his own physical prowess make him a solid Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Meanwhile, Embiid is both an elite rim protector and rebounder.  The numbers are staggering.  Philadelphia is 32-6 in games in which Embiid and Simmons have played, a 69-win pace in a full 82-game season. In the 1,066 minutes in which they've shared the floor, Philadelphia's net rating is an absurd plus-16.2. That's the highest such mark among any two-man combo in the Eastern Conference (minimum 1,000 minutes played), and it has a lot to do with getting stops; with Embiid and Simmons on the floor, Philly's defensive rating is an eye-popping 102.2. If these guys can stay healthy, Philly's crunch-time lineups will be two-way nightmares for anyone.  At 27, it's impossible to watch Embiid and not think of former GM Sam Hinkie, and the early days of Embiid's pro career. It didn't look good. How many players miss two entire seasons of play before eventually turning into franchise players? Not many, but that's exactly how Embiid's arc began in Philly, which makes what he's doing right now even more impressive.  Along with Jokic, Embiid is making centers great again, but along with Simmons, he's also further validating the radical team-building process Hinkie designed eight years ago. No matter what happens from here on out, Embiid's eventual legacy will be tied to that polarizing tanking experiment.  No center has won the NBA MVP since Shaq did so in 1999-2000. That's about to change. Centers are relevant again, but that's not all. Basketball in Philadelphia is relevant, too. And even though Embiid might come up short on the MVP vote this season, it would be foolish to label this regular season anything short of a triumph. As a player, he has yet to reach his ceiling, but he has driven himself into the MVP conversation, and in the process, he has taken the 76ers from a punchline to the top of the Eastern Conference.  That was the plan all along."
"I‚Äôm sorry but if you‚Äôre having Danny Green and Seth Curry run your P&amp;R, it‚Äôs not gonna go great. This is where the argument that Simmons and Jojo are not a great fit come in, they both can‚Äôt roll at the same time."
"Well, it was Seth curry but now he‚Äôs good"
1. Luka 2. Jokic 3. CP3 4. Jamal Murray 5. Seth Curry
"Well, Seth has performed better this season for sure, so you could certainty say the Sixers are winning it as of now. However, defense is still a big problem for the Mavs, and Richardson has been better defensively than Curry was. If he can regain a little of his offensive form, I still think it's w win-win trade for both teams. And, while Curry has been better, I don't know if he would have made a difference in the standings for us."
Would love to hear some updated thoughts on the Seth Curry / Josh Richardson trade.
Any updated thoughts on the Seth Curry / Josh Richardson trade?
"Fuck it let's try this...   PG: Fred VanVleet  SG: Khris Middleton  SF: Bojan Bogdanoviƒá  PF: Christian Wood  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: Seth Curry, Chris Boucher, Gary Trent Jr, Lu Dort, Yam Madar just for the hell of it."
"Its more than that. You can't just go by stats He's not being asked to score. He's a tertiary shooter at best when he's the floor. Sixers have other veteran shooters when he's on the floor. If you were a coach on a playoff caliber team, who are you asking to shoot Shake Milton, George Hill or Thybulle? Seth Curry,Danny Green, Tobias Harris or Thybulle? Come on man... Plays is not running through him right now.. Theres a huge difference when you have plays ran through you instead of playing clean up. He might have to get his shine on a different team but its there. His real weakness is his ball handling. If fixes that he'll have better shots."
"I'll play Devil's Advocate here, although I have a bias as a Sixers fan.  I've seen teams this year, and in the playoffs last year, look for a switch on the perimeter to get Gobert.  I've seen teams this year look to get a switch so they can get anybody else besides Ben.    Ben willingly takes the assignment of someone like Dame, Luka, etc, the opposing team's best perimeter player is usually Ben's assignment especially in crunch time. Those same players who try and get Ben as far away from them as possible simultaneously hunt for Gobert on the switch in crunch time. The Sixers and Blazers played earlier this year and I remember even though Dame was going off early in the game the moment Ben took the assignment he was slowed down and the other players had to make shots in order to win, Dame couldn't get the good quality shots he was getting vs Danny Green/Seth Curry anymore. IMO as a team defender, Rudy is easily top 3 and to many top 1, In terms of overall defensive skill I don't have him in my top 5.  My 5 in no particular order are:  Draymond  Ben  Embiid  Adebayo  Smart  Honorable mention Thybulle but again I'm super fucking biased."
"For sure. Morey is one of the best GMs for a reason. Stealing away Seth Curry, who is finally looking like he‚Äôs over Covid the last week, was a heist right up there with any I‚Äôve seen. Josh Richardson sucks and Seth Curry is on an absolute steal of a contract. Danny Rings is one of the best role players in the league. Just plays winning basketball. There‚Äôs a reason despite his shooting woes he had the highest plus minus for the Lakers in the Finals last season. He just knows his role and plays it perfectly.   But honestly Brett was utterly clueless in how to use Tobias. There‚Äôs a reason Tobias is playing at the level he is now and that‚Äôs all Doc. Brett legit was quoted saying he wanted Tobias to be his new JJ Redick last season. Like completely ridiculous shit lol.   Doc gets the respect out of his players and also knows how to take a guy in a unique and challenging role and fix him."
"So do you and others on this thread think teams should let Simmons score all he wants against 1:1 defense in the paint and just stay home on curry, green and Harris so they don‚Äôt get open looks from 3? Just curious, as I really feel like curry and green could kill teams in the playoffs if they start collapsing on Simmons or embiid too much. The addition of Seth curry amd danny green in the off season were great moves by the sixers and if they can‚Äôt make it happen this year with the addition of those shooters than they have to blow up the core. At this point, IMO embiid and Simmons are never going to get it done together if they can‚Äôt do it this year."
Is Seth the superior S. Curry :o
"So Steph is the long range Curry, Seth is the mid range, who is Slam Curry?"
Seth the better Curry
"Call me crazy, but have you considered Seth Curry?"
And what if Seth Curry shoots normally from 3? IDK why people say stuff like that
I made multiple yrs of fake trades for the Sixers to get Patty Mills to fill that Seth Curry type role smh
"We gave up quite a few assets for KP, but THJ was just a throw in to get his contract off their books because he wasn‚Äôt playing well there. What we‚Äôve gotten from him is found money and absolutely not a positive indictment on our front office.   We gave up essentially nothing for Redick and Seth Curry for Richardson. Those aren‚Äôt the kinds of trades I‚Äôm talking about. I‚Äôm talking about the KP type trade - the Dallas FO traditionally strays away from making big splash moves because they overvalue their current pieces.   As for free agency.. LOL. We‚Äôve been trying that for years and striking out every single time. Unless you count Chandler Parsons and a Wesley Matthews coming off an Achilles injury."
"Duncan ""Steph 'Seth' Curry"" Robinson. I'LL TAKE IT"
"it's not so much that we hate him because he sucks, but the fact the we gave seth curry who had a very high price for a role player for this dude is just embarrassing."
"That's kind of my point.  Despite being as good a shooter as guys like Kyle Korver or Seth Curry, he only played 20 minutes per game for two years at his very peak because he had no other skills.  Shooting alone isn't enough to earn minutes for good teams.  I should have chosen a better example though- Nik Stauskas maybe."
"&gt; Joe Harris, Seth Curry, and Marcus Morris  I was with you till the last name.  Morris is the classic example of a 3 and D guy, not a pure shooter.  I'm pretty sure he'd barely get minutes if he wasn't such a big, versatile defender."
Yup.. this one always gets me. And half the shooters out there have absolutely no d such as Reddick or korver. That's why getting a guy like Danny Green and Seth Curry in the same off-season has given us such massive improvements.
"Agreed. People need to realize that a ‚Äúshooter‚Äù is someone who can shoot the basketball at a very high level, not just league average. Guys like Joe Harris, Seth Curry, and Marcus Morris are guys I think are perfect examples of real ‚Äúshooters.‚Äù In contrast, guys like Danuel House (he had one good year with us when he shot 41% from three IIRC, but since then he‚Äôs been league average) and P.J Tucker (he‚Äôs money from the corners but overall he‚Äôs a decent shooter at best) are guys who some people may think are ‚Äúshooters‚Äù but really aren‚Äôt."
Steph Curry  Seth Curry  Speedy Claxton  Sam Cassell  Steve Curr player coach  Undersized guards only
It's Seth Curry lol he's shooting 42% over the past month from 3. And I like Mikal but 13/4/2 is kinda wild to be rated higher than a guy putting up 23/5/3. Obviously Mikal is doing it on much better efficiency but it's easier to be efficient playing behind CP3 and Book than it is trying to carry what's left of the Pistons.
Seth curry had a very high 3 point rating until a week or so ago. I'm assuming he has been bricking them recently?   They cracked up green and embiid 3s recently.   Simmons is the one which upsets me but he plays like the goat in game.   Bridges has been playing very well and suns 2nd seed
"Top 10 isn't crazy bad but it get bad pretty quickly with 2k lol. Ben Simmons is 36th overall behind Deaaron Fox, Kristaps, and Derozan. CJ's rating seems really low. Mikal Bridges is rated higher than Jerami Grant. Embiid and Seth Curry have the same 3pt rating. 2k has a lot of wack ratings lol"
CP3 - no weightage considering CP3 is just the kind of guy that has the us against the world mentality so it‚Äôs to be expected   Seth Curry - Has he gone on record to say he doesn‚Äôt like PG or are you just assuming because they dated the same girl ?    Also 2 players out of 300+ players doesn‚Äôt really make the numbers for a generalised statement that ‚ÄúPlayers don‚Äôt like PG‚Äù.
I would think Austin Rivers isn't his biggest fan.  Seth Curry neither for that matter.
"Chris Paul, Seth Curry"

"Curry was also an unusual prospect because he wasn't a full time point guard until his last year in college. He had a slight frame and very low amounts of experience running the point full time, let alone against top talent. His handle was considered at least proficient, that is to say I don't remember anyone talking about it, but that is really the X-Factor that made him the star he is today. It allowed his elite quickness and range to drown out his other deficiencies (see Seth for examples of not overcoming them). He also has unreal core strength, which was also developed, which made his FG's around the baskets become deadly. He was a boom or bust player that even though he immediately a boom, it was nearly impossible to predict the rises he made in handle and finishing."
"JJ redick was bad at defense. He got cooked every possession. Tobi played like absolute ass on offense. Who knows why we lost with that much talent. I blame coaching, Tobi, redick.  We changed our coaching, Tobi is playing so efficiently, and we Seth curry is marginally better at defense than JJ.   Who knows we could suck in the playoffs again and blow the team up."
 i don‚Äôt even know how a sign and trade would work for us. Danny Green will be a free agent so if we wanted to sign and trade the raptors would have to agree to a 3+ year contract with him. also pretty sure he can‚Äôt be signed and traded with other players?   George Hill and Seth Curry could be used to get to like ~17 million i guess
"The sixers were in such a great position to make them serious contenders every year for the next decade but they were so poorly managed that they ultimately turned all of those extra assets into tobias harris, thybulle, maxey, and seth curry.  They are one of the biggest ""what if"" teams ever."
"Clippers-Nets.   Maybe Clippers-Sixers for the Doc matchup, featuring son-in-law Seth Curry and guy who cheated on his daughter Paul George."
THJ dogshit KP injured WCS dogshit JJ Redick objective downgrade from Seth Curry   LUKA MISSING WIDE OPEN 3S AND CLUTCH-TIME FREE THROWS YIKES
Facu is 5'10 and Seth is 6'2 which is a pretty big difference. Sixers also have better help defense and Joel anchoring the rim protection. There's a reason why the Sixers have had a top 2 defense all season while Seth Curry has gotten starter minutes.
"The Davis trade was a HUGE gamble that paid off, but it was more luck than anything else. Pelinka gave away the whole team for a player who is incredibly injury-prone, if he got hurt last year everything would've fallen apart. Then they waited too long trying for kawhi and missed better pieces (like Seth curry), instead having to sign past-their-prime veterans, a classic lakers move. Pelinka got incredibly lucky that everything worked out last year with excellent team chemistry and everyone playing their role perfectly (Vogel deserves a lot of credit here).   Tl;Dr pelinka did not construct a good roster, he gambled on Davis and otherwise got lucky. Nothing has really changed in the lakers front office, still less-than-competent decisions covered up by the glamor of the team which naturally draws people."
"what's the problem with Facu ? you guys have seth curry starting, that's also gonna be a big off when teams start match up hunting"
"They had jimmy and jj then who's gonna be jimmy for them this year? Seth curry? Tobias Harris? They still would have lost to the celtics even if they had Ben. Ben is trash in the playoffs, offensively anyway."
Dray is not the lead ball handler on the warriors and played with the two greatest shooters of all time. Simmons is the sixers lead ball handler and in the playoffs that becomes an issue. If you then change his role who handles the ball? They don't have jimmy anymore so who else is there? Seth curry? Tobias Harris? If thats your other options then you have a problem.
"Come playoffs I trust Seth Curry, Danny Green and Shake Milton over the Bucks shooting outside of Kris and Jrue."
Giannis to the 76ers next year so he can play with Seth Curry who says no
WTF IS THIS LOL seth curry and looney? You crazy
Seth Curry + Kevon Looney
seth curry gets 29min per game and he is a huge defensive liability. They can easily cover 1 bad guy on defense.

Why didn‚Äôt Seth curry follow it up with the elbow finisher
"Seth Curry: ""Shut up before I ankle pick you"""
Seth Curry effortlessly lifted a 240 lb man by one leg.
"There were in the bonus  They were against a backcourt of TRAE YOUNG AND LOU WILL  They have 3 all defense player, one is the runner up MVP and the other is the runner up DPOY   Tobias Harris finished the season as a 20ppg guy on 51/39/89 splits  Seth curry put up a career-high 36 pts including going 7 /12 from 3  Up 26 late in the 3rd  How the fuck  It's easily one of the most embarrassing losses ever"
The Mavs and Blazers already had elite perimeter shot creators. The sixers have none. Seth Curry is literally their only ball handler who can create his own shot.   It‚Äôs hilarious that Simmons one saving grace - his defense - is neutralized because his offensive flaws are forcing the sixers to play Seth Curry 38 minutes.
You wouldn't start Seth Curry over CJ or Dame. I'm talking about Seth as a starter.
"And Seth Curry is more effective as a spot-up catch-and-shoot guy, he's doesn't quite have his brother's insanely quick release which makes it harder for him off the dribble"
Eh. I‚Äôve always thought this 76ers team was a bit lacking in talent to be honest. The fit is great but if you take the roster one by one. Simmons can not shoot to save his life. Seth Curry can‚Äôt play defense to save his life. Thybulle is a bad shooter. Tobias is a bad defender. Korkmaz also can‚Äôt defend. Too many specialists. They need a few more balanced guys. At this point the only true 3 and D players they have are Danny Green and Embiid. Granted when Morey got the team it was a mess. He did a great job but from the position he was in you can only do so much. To me they‚Äôre a Mikal Bridges (in place of Korkmaz) away from being a complete team  Granted Doc wasted the clippers last year
I didn't say bench Seth for the whole game. Playoff teams Portland and Mavericks didn't start Seth Curry. They used him off the bench to get big time scoring.  They both lost playoff series though because Seth's defense was so bad and that is why they traded him away.
Yeah the Sixers best off the dribble offensive player right now is...seth curry? That's not a recipe for effectively attacking weak defensive guards.
"They have no fucking closer. If they can‚Äôt beat u in defense, they are screwed. They were looking for Seth curry to do the closer role. Embiid is too banged up"
LiAngelo was supposed to be the Seth Curry of the family but he just cant control  his damn hands.
"You realise basketball is about trade-offs, right? They don‚Äôt have Seth on the court they have little to no shooting and it‚Äôs far easier for the Hawks to double Embiid. Let alone that today Curry was shooting extremely well"
Get Seth Curry sime help please
What an incredible wasted performance from seth curry. Hes really coming into his own.
Seth and Simmons should just morph into one player. They can go with Seth Simmons or Ben Curry.
Here's a telling stat for you:   Joel Embiid and Seth Curry are the only Sixers who made a FG in the 2nd half.  Joel is worn out cuz he has to carry the whole team for 4 quarters (on a torn meniscus). Seth can't even get his shots off without Embiid screening for him or passing out of a double. It's our only source of offense besides transition.
Okay but to be fair their other option is to die without Seth Curry.
"Seth Curry had 36 points, 7 rebounds, and 2 steals. I really disagree with your analysis that Seth Curry was the problem for the Sixers when he did his job and his help (Simmons, Thybulle, Embiid) couldn't rotate well enough to minimize his defensive issues.  Seth created wayyyyy more points than he gave up"
Pretty much. They gonna lose to the Hawks. Die with Seth Curry.
Seth is legit. I told people this when he was at liberty and people said he needed to prove it a higher level and then he did the same thing at Duke and people still said he wasn‚Äôt an NBA player. I tried to tell people but nobody listened. It‚Äôs too bad I didn‚Äôt wager $1000 on him becoming a solid nba regular back then with great odds as I could have been rich.   Anyways good for Curry.
"Don't know if you watched the game or just looked at the box score... Huerter was bricking every shot early, made a bone head clear path foul, and he was missing open layups.    Bogi was in early foul trouble , he ended up with 5 fouls in the 3rd. He never got in rhythm with the foul trouble. It would've been really dumb to keep play either one of them in their closing lineup under those circumstances.   In the last 3 minutes is the sixers failed to capitalize on the offense with Lou Williams and Trae on the floor on 3 straight positions at least. Yet when the hawks had the mismatch with Seth guarding Gallo, he immediately took advantage.   Gallo and Lou Will were playing great and it's what brought them back in the game, why on earth would he put in Bogi and Huerter.  Obviously plus minus isn't the best tracker, but I'm sure that Huerters and Bogi were garbage considering they were being blown out for 3 quarters.   Great hawks win but it's obviously all due to the sixers collapse. Only embiid and curry scored in the 2nd half..."
Can we talk about how good seth curry is.
Hard to make a basket when your game plan is to have seth curry set up a shitty contested jumper for embiid
"This dude has never worked on his game since he got drafted; he still plays the same way for the past 4 seasons.  We got Joel, who's done nothing but work on his game every offseason, who's also not healthy, having to drop damn near 40 as well as Seth Curry, a role player, having to drop damn near 40 as well to keep it close. You only needed to make 4 more fuckin' FTs to win the game but nah.  A player of his talents should be top 5 in the league; dude's easily the most talented player on his own team but doesn't want to improve. Fuckin' clown.   It's an insult to the guys who work their hardest to keep their spot in the pro scene. Make me a 6'10 athlete instead of this dude lmao."
Honestly Simmons should find his spot on the bench and have Iverson suit up. What a joke game. It's embarrassing to have this kind of NBA player who's so limited offensively that you need embiid and Seth curry to work twice as hard to make up for it. At least hit 70% of your free throws....it's free money at the line
meanwhile seth curry is getting paid 7 million LOL
I feel bad for Seth Curry. He really balled out
Nobody scored in the second have besides Joel and Seth Curry.
Seth curry had 36 points. Simmons had 8. Tobias had 4. Add up the contract money. LoL
SETH FUCKING CURRY.  13 / 19 FGA.  7 / 12 3PA.  7 boards.  2 steals.  And 1 turnover.
"Embiid scored 39 points and Seth Curry had 36 and they were the only two Sixers to score a field goal in the second half.  - The Hawks outscored them 40-19 in the fourth on 16 of 22 shooting.  - The Sixers still had a 97.5% chance of winning Game 5 with 4:23 remaining.  - Had 10 of 15 turnovers in the second half.  ''We got too comfortable,'' guard Ben Simmons said. ''We didn't play the way we should be playing.''"
"I'd give him 1% blame, potentially for not getting Lowry, but it sounds like Masai was in La La Land (and not the good one with Emma Stone).  He's not the dumbass that traded Jimmy Butler. He made a very good trade in dumping Josh Richardson for Seth Curry too, who really fits well with Embiid."
32 shots for the half and Seth Curry took 12 of them. 11 total for everyone not named Curry or Embiid. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶not good.
"Probably but I wonder if some people are overrating Draymond's playmaking.   At the very least, overrating how transferable his type of playmaking going from the Warriors system with GOAT level shooters coming off screens and running the 4-on-3 shortroll out of Curry getting trapped VS playmaking out of Embiid doubles.   Also Dray's lack of shooting can be masked on the Warriors (sagging off too much and he can set a screen / DHO for Curry) but idk how that would look with Seth / Shake / Korkmaz and co. (actually might not be that bad...)"
"I know a guy who's a Raptors fan but also a Luka stan, and he hates the Mavs front office and Mark Cuban for the KP trade, the Seth Curry trade, the JJ Reddick trade, etc. He wishes Luka was on the Hawks because he thinks the Hawks are a better run organization, so I guess those people exist lol."
"Old school basketball coaching says go for 2 and foul there, but I really think a 3 is the right call. I wonder if Doc was afraid of getting clowned for going for a Seth Curry 3 to end the game twice in a row."
Seth Curry cannot emerge victorious with these felines
"Sign-and-trade Lonzo for George Hill, Seth Curry, and unprotected double first round swaps in 22, 25 and 27."
He‚Äôs done as much as humanly possible. His big addition of Seth Curry was the main reason why the Sixers were in position to choke this game in the first place.
What I would give to have Seth Curry back and his consistent offense.
joel embiid and seth curry vs the world
"He did pretty good, Seth Curry trade was amazing"
"He did a great job, guy got rid of Horford's terrible contract for a 2025 protected first and some nobodies. Turned Josh Richardson into Seth Curry, and brought Doc Rivers who was a huge upgrade on Brett Brown. The Danny Green signing was also a shrewd one but unfortunately he's hurt right now. The Sixers got the goddamn #1 seed this year, it's not his fault his players and cosch are suddenly atrocious when it counts."
"He doesn‚Äôt deserve blame imo. It‚Äôs Ben Simmons and Doc Rivers(again). He got Seth Curry, Dwight,etc and a coach that made Tobias play to his full potential. Obviously this is one of the worst collapses by a team ever, but there shouldn‚Äôt be any reason why he‚Äôs really blamed other than a few bad moves here and there"
He got them off a pretty bad contract and stole Dallas's lunch money with the Seth Curry trade.
"Tobias Harris didn't show up, but Seth Curry took on responsibilities of being 2nd scorer. I feel like previous regime didn't maximize this roster."
"seth curry scared me way more than embiid this series. you know embiid is gonna get his, but curry can just go nuclear at any moment"
"Okay, because of Ben‚Äôs limited offensive production, I think the Blazers should target Matisse Thybulle instead, he may not be on the table but he would help them a lot and hit his free throws  Thybulle and Seth Curry for CJ?"
He cooked Seth Curry. He would make love to 3 woman on you
"Docs Rivers said Ben Simmons is good at defense, and he found out in game 5 that defense brick 10 FTs out of 14 attempts. He is a good player, and can make an impact to a championship team. This current team does not maximize what Ben Simmons does well and hide his glaring weaknesses. What so great if he can defend, rebound, and pass but if other team can attack his weaknesses leave him to be the scorer and foul him to put him on FT line when he is on the floor. You can put him at the dunker spot and screen, but Joel Embiid operates there to be his best which mess with the spacing with Simmons. Seth Curry is only good shooting threat, and maybe hot Danny Green to provide space. If Simmons is not going to score by seeking it when opportunities present itself, shoot jumpers, and shoot poor FTs he is just a big man who needs to operate in paint who can handle the ball. To me if he is not going to be aggressive in seeking to score he needs to be in situations similar to Draymond Green in 2014-2016 team where he surrounded by 2 great shooters to provide space and player movements carrying offense load from perimeter."
I still think Seth should join the Warriors as a 6th man. Would be lethal to always have a Curry on the floor the whole game.
Joe Ingles?  Yes. Seth curry? yes. Both bogdanovich. Yes and yes.  Capela?  probably. Marcus Morris. Probably.  Reggie Jackson? Maybe???  Is he even top 25 of every guy left in the playoffs?  LMAO
He must be reading u/MITWestbrook threads because they spamiming &amp; abusing that Seth Curry matchup to get back into the game.  You know the strategy Sixers fans clowned   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nvo30p/cmon_hawks_why_are_you_still_starting_hill_you/ https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o092s8/seth_curry_lowlights/
PG - Tobias Harris  SG - Ben Simmons  SF - Joel Embiid  PF - Seth Curry  C - Furkan Korkmaz   Checks out to me.
Seth curry
Seth Curry is a better co-star than Simmons
Another Seth Curry
Well Seth Curry exists but yeah he‚Äôd have helped
Seth Curry is the second superstar
yeah Seth curry has really come into his own hasn't he?
"You guys looked dominant, I never really believed in it due to the fact that no one on your team can create a shot on their own  Down the stretch, in clutch time, that‚Äôs exactly how scoring happens. Defense is too tight and guys are too tired to be running around and doing plays. The shot creator steps up and makes something happen, and Philly can‚Äôt do that   Just rely on Embiid in the high post or a Seth Curry jumper"
Atleast they stole Seth Curry
Seth curry is literally their second best player rn lmao
you also got rid of Seth Curry for... I still have no idea why that happened
"Seth Curry was doing exactly that for them. For most of the fourth this was around a ten point game. It wasn't until the final two minutes or so that Philly's butthole got tighter than a seashell hole. Trae smelled blood and then claimed his victim when it mattered most, man deserves credit"
"Seth and Shake are not good enough to create their own point consistently. Curry was cooking tonight but mostly from 3 and he had to have tired legs by the end of the 4th. Tobias was just playing like shit, but JC was playing great help defense on him to assist with that."
Wasted a Seth Curry godmode game
seth curry has really been what‚Äôs gotten them some of these huge leads. i swear whenever they go on a run it‚Äôs him firing off like 3 3‚Äôs in a row to cap off a 20-3 run
"Look at how Williams and Young targeted Seth Curry, even though he's probably a better defender than they are, vs how Philly couldn't dictate their matchups because Atlanta could always double off Simmons (or Thybulle)."
their seth curry hate has somehow been vindicated lmao
Seth Curry apparently
I‚Äôm sure seth curry will be super tired playing for two teams
Makes 4x what seth curry does. That‚Äôs just not fair
Seth played like Steph and lost. It shows that this team can literally have Steph Curry on the roster and still lose.
Seth Curry just had 36 more points in this game alone then Steph has all playoffs. Who‚Äôs the better brother?
Trade Simmons and Curry keep Embiid &amp; Seth
fuck lonzo   seth curry my new best friend
3 All Defense players. Seth Curry as your 2nd best scoring option with Harris and Simmons on the team. Doc still not knowing how to finish games. What an embarrassment lol.
His name is Seth Curry
&gt;They got outscored 15-2 to end the game.   Essentially the game ended on a 15-0 run. Seth Curry had the last bucket with .2 seconds left.
"They mismatched Seth Curry with him for his first like 11 points, what a fucking joke man"
Some solace from the annoyance of watching the 76ers and realizing some dude getting paid millions traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson.
"Seth Curry was their second best player tonight, he scored 36 points. Lack of shooting is not why they lost."
They're still getting torched by Seth Curry which is not a good thing lol  It's just that Simmons is so bad on offense that Philly can't take advantage of the matchup like most other teams can
"Time to move on from Ben Simmons, absolutely invisible on offense last quarter. His only role was to dribble the ball up and give it to Seth Curry"
Seth Curry needs help
You have 1 game where Seth Curry goes ballistic and you LOST AT HOME??!?
"Time to move on from Ben Simmons, absolutely invisible on offense last quarter. His only role was to dribble the ball up and give it to Seth Curry"
Never a good thing when Seth curry is your second best player
Get Seth curry some help. Can‚Äôt win with these cats.
Seth Curry can't win with these cats
Seth Curry with 34 and a late meltdown from the sixers is exactly what we all expected tonight
I appreciate Seth Curry not being afraid of taking that shot unlike someone *cough cough Joel*
Correction. Seth Curry can‚Äôt win with these cats
76ers need to realize they don‚Äôt have STEPH curry they have SETH
Who in the fuck decided to put seth Curry on Gallo
Did they choke or did Seth curry boost them up with unsustainable shooting and now they're coming back down to earth while still waiting for Simmons and Harris to wake up?
Seth Curry should‚Äôve stopped passing to anyone like 5 minutes into the 4th. He‚Äôs the only one not point shaving apparently
Just let Seth Curry iso this one out
You really cant be blowing a game where Seth Curry has 34 points. Not so good IMO
Why anyone but Seth Curry has touched the ball in the last 4 mins is beyond me
Seth Curry can't win with these cats!
"He may have not performed great but Docs offense was doing him no favors.   He was often tasked with late shot clock ISOs and hot potatoes, because he‚Äôs the only go-to scorer besides Embiidn (except Seth Curry, kind of)"
"Something I thought was interesting, is Ray Allen saying that he was never the best 3pt shooter on his team. There would end of bench players that can shoot 3s better than him. There's so much nuances to the game. Seth Curry is one of the best knock down shooters in the league, but he's not able to find spacing and looks in volume."
Ben Simmons + Seth Curry
Jimmer   Seth curry   Sindarius Thornwell  Lopez   Thad  Jake layman   Satoransky
Seth Curry
Seth Curry.
Seth Curry now would be a much better defender than a 40 year old Steph I'd imagine
That would basically be Seth Curry so...probably? Although the Hawks hunted him all the time so lol
"I think they‚Äôd make it work, but it‚Äôs still bad for spacing. Embiid needs to be near the basket to be effective, and Tobias Harris is already more of a midrange shooter than a 3 point shooter. Adding DeMar just means that their 3 best players will still be at their best inside of the 3pt line. He can space more than Simmons and can actually drive to the basket and hit free throws so it‚Äôd be a big improvement, but he‚Äôs still not a great fit.   Also they already have Seth Curry who‚Äôs a liability on defense. Swapping Ben for DeMar on defense would be a big step down on that end"
 Curry+Draymond is verrry nice.   Bertans+Westbrook is a lowkey very good one.    Simmons+Seth curry.   Gobert+ingles   Basically a player who can‚Äôt shoot but is good at other things+a player that can shoot
"Mike james isiah cannon tyson chandler trevor ariza josh jackson elfrid payton eric bledsoe brandon knight dragen bender marqueese chris   If you think those guys are comparable to Porzingas, Seth Curry, Tim Hardway Jr then idk what to tell you.  When booker got a real team around him they became instantly better and probably make the playoffs is ayton doesnt get suspended"
"&gt;That‚Äôs not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK üôÑ  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
"Now he‚Äôs third best Curry. Here are the new rankings:  1. Seth Curry 2. Curry Goat 3. Steph Curry  Sorry, dems the rules"
Lol you made this post to talk about replacing CP to create a dynasty and your answer is SETH CURRY?!
Seth Curry/Booker/Bridges/Simmons/Ayton
i mean no one leave seth curry open either and he‚Äôs on 10M
Not to mention Joel Embiid and Seth Curry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Because he‚Äôs the best player that is likely also moving. Because on the right team, surrounded by shooters, Ben Simmons can be terrifying. Because they wouldn‚Äôt have a big drop off to get a legit star talent at $10M less per year. $10M can turn into another decent shooter next to McCollum. They could go super small and have Ben defend bigs. I just think Simmons still has growth potential. He‚Äôs 24. He‚Äôs cheaper. He‚Äôs more versatile. Throw in a Seth Curry and they could go into free agency and attract a versatile big who can shoot and not be on the block, clogging up the lane for Ben."
"Dame for Simmons, Seth Curry and Maxey plus whatever else the Blazers want"
"Wiggins *was* a bad max.  He has been great for the Warriors.  CJ isn't a bad max.  20+ a game while providing some of the league's best spacing for their offense and punishing teams that double Dame?  Look what Seth Curry did in the playoffs with Embiid pulling defenders into the key.  Now imagine CJ, who is a better all around player, on that squad.  Ben Simmons is a bad max because he lost it mentally and because they don't have the roster to support a PG who can't shoot.  Most rosters can't support that, tbh.  Simmons never should have been maxed.  He's an elite defender, a great passer, and they have some pieces like Seth Curry and Danny Green to cover for his lack of shooting, but it's not enough, especially when he won't even go up and dunk.  We thought CP3 was a bad max but he's been great."
"Love to see Ball on the mavs or knicks, Thibs will love him and he‚Äôll shine with other compote t defenders surrounding him. As for the mavs he can give them the best impression of Seth curry out there with above average defense. A secondary playmaker that can give Luka a break, and who can hit wide open threes that are created for him at a high clip plus he also fits both teams timelines, and has shown significant work ethic and improvement every single year. Worst case scenario he‚Äôs a 3-D playmaker that you can trade if it doesn‚Äôt work out and someone will want him."
"From charlotte , saw quite a few guys play. When i was younger, Seth Curry would come to the Y in his high school days and just shoot around.  Saw Muggsy play a few times after retirement , he was a hs basketball coach for awhile. Jeff Mcinnis is a big time coach here too , saw him play a few times.  Few of the bobcats players would play in the offseason at the popular gym here and would occasionally get dogged by the high school /overseas guys.  Played against Randy moss too since he lived here for awhile."
I don't think we'll want or need to give up Seth on that contract so guy = Curry most likely. Dude would be an open question mark.
"Their  team would still be loaded. Not to mention come playoff time, it's usually just a 7 man rotation.  Lillard  Seth curry   Danny green  Harris  Embiid  --  Korkmaz, howard, George Hill.   That's a contender my guy!"
i honestly think it would be a win win blazers would finally have some defense and sixers would have someone other than seth curry
"They have to be able to move CJ and bring back a high level wing. I think that's why Ben Simmons name has been floated in regards to the Blazers. But the Sixers have Seth Curry and CJ's not really a play maker. I'm not sure what other assets the Blazers have but it may need to be a three team deal, and it always gets tricky to find deals where every team gets something they need out of it.   But they need a 2 guard who can play both sides of the floor and they need a second ball handler in the starting lineup to help Dame out when he gets blitzed and swarmed."
"I could see the team moving on from Brook Lopez to improve the roster. Giannis and Middleton are too potent to give up on as both players are still in the front end of their prime.   Purely hypothetical, but a line-up of Giannis, Middleton, Jrue, Seth Curry, and Myles Turner, with Divincenzo, Portis, Tucker and Jalen Brunson off the bench. Or even swapping Jrue with someone like Brogdon would help (though I think Jrue's defense is a huge part of the Bucks' overall chances).  Point is, with Giannis, you've always got a chance, and with Middleton, you've got a legitimate 2nd option that can create his own shot. This team can contend for a very long time no matter who fills out roster."
"That's a lot of cap space... even a contender that needs shooting, still need to match that salary it's not as a simple task as picking up a Seth Curry on the MLE..."
"Trade Dame for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, andbring back CJ/RoCo/Nurk and that‚Äôs a better team than Lillard playing hero ball next year.  I‚Äôm over Lillard. Couldn‚Äôt even make an NCAA tournament at Weber State yet he‚Äôs all about winning. Whatever, goodbye."
"Seems like giving up too much to not even guarantee a finals position.  It seems lateral at best if you're giving up that many rotation players.      I don't see how Lillard/Seth Curry/Harris/Embiid is magically better than where they are now.  They're clearly more spaced, but they have no size outside of Embiid.  I don't think they'd be stacked offensively enough to justify the lack of size."
"Embiid has been the most offensively dominant center since Shaq and has had the worst spacing I can think of. If he had dame and Seth curry shooting, oh boy. And Embiid could make up for some defensive backcourt shortcomings"
"This the perfect storm for Team USA to give all of us some 2004 vibes in this Olympics.  Anyway I'm just sad the Blazers never wanted to invest in a nice coach rather than stick with Stotts for so long. Also shitty management of trades, free agent and draft picks. Remember just a couple of years ago they had Seth Curry, now he is a 20 points guy in the POs and they lost him for nothing."
"My friend saying we should've drafted Dante Exam over Joel Embiid on draft night  My roommates dad saying three months ago we should keep Ben Simmons and trade Embiid  ESPN ranking Bam Adebayo over Joel Embiid less than a year ago  Paul Pierce saying he was a better perimeter shooter than Klay Thompson is  On r/sixers last off-season I was downvoted for saying Devin Booker is better than Ben Simmons. Their reasoning for why Ben is better was literally just that he plays defense  My GFs brother, a Mavericks fan, saying at the time of trade that they got the better player in the Josh Richardson/Seth Curry trade  My friend draft night saying that Luka Doncic was gonna bust"
"Yes, but they had Ben Simmons who can defend but can't score, and Seth Curry who can score but not defend.  So saying he was the second best all around player is just not that great of a compliment when he's one of the highest paid players in the league."
Seth Curry
Replacing Ben Simmons and Seth Curry with DeRozen and Thybulle starting isn‚Äôt exactly an upgrade shooting wise
Seth Curry still on the team?
His name was Seth Curry.
It‚Äôs funny cause in 2020 the narrative was ‚Äúif Luka had a healthy Porzingis Dallas would‚Äôve beaten LAC‚Äù  I put 2021 on Rick Carlisle and the FO for making a worse roster than last year. That Seth Curry trade was pretty bad
he‚Äôs definitely better than Seth Curry
I don't see how CJ is any better than someone like Seth Curry. Like Curry is probably better tbh.
"I was thinking in my scenario the 6ers would end up with Heild and CJ, two shooters(scorers). I think both are an upgrade over Curry and I like Seth, but they're still both better.  Edit: I don't know if the money adds up in this scenario, but I thought a backcourt of Heild and CJ would be nice."
Seth Curry has a villainous face
"*Except*, Max is right. How do they get better? Some FA? Is Daryl not one of the best GMs in the league. He got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. And you think he can't trade future pieces like what Max mentioned for a frustrated star? I'd love to see r/NBA collectively be GM for a team and I'd be shocked if it their team wasn't 30th in the league in virtually every significant category"
Seth Curry marrying Doc Rivers' daughter and calling PG a bitch ass in the playoffs
"Not a needle mover, but I want Seth Curry back."
Seth Curry
"Yeah completely agree which is why it would be crazy to give up 3 firsts for Ben Simmons. I think if they are willing to trade 3 firsts they should explore the market for those picks.   What the 76ers have that the Kings don't are other pieces like Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, and Danny Green that could be packaged with those picks. So if 3 picks isn't enough, they might be able to make a package that is"
There was a stretch there where we let Seth Curry and IT go for literally nothing and then fired Mike Malone and I thought my brain was going to melt.
Is having Hield remarkably different from having Seth Curry?
Seth Curry in the top 10 pretty impressive
"3 firsts is a lot so I see where your coming from but it might simultaneously be a lot and NOT improve the 76ers.  As in, are you going to win a title with Embiid, Hield, Harris, Bagley and Seth Curry? No, you will not win a title with that team and there's a good chance you won't be the one seed in the east or even a top 4 seed in the east with that roster. Then you'd be lucky if one of those first round picks is a starter caliber player within 3 years and by then Embiid is out the door."
"Have they really though? Overpaying Horford was a bad move, but they were able to dump him after one year.  They got Jimmy Butler for peanuts and that very nearly led to them winning the title. It was worth the gamble.  The Tobias Harris trade worked well, and while his contract initially was an overpay, it's looking to be a fair deal and he pairs well next to Embiid.  They also have Seth Curry on a great contract, Thybulle and Maxey were great picks, Dwight on a minimum made sense, and unfortunately Danny Green got hurt, but he made sense for this team.  It's not the GM's fault Simmons cratered so hard in the playoffs.   What specific assets have been ""squandered"" and what other options were available since Hinkie's departure? Maybe Paul George, but what else? Hinkie didn't necessarily leave them with that great of assets besides the core of Simmons/Embiid, as most other picks were bad to average players."
Hield and Lowry in the backcourt with Tobias and Embiid up front would be nasty. Then you bring Seth Curry off the bench-which feels bad because he had a breakout playoff performance--and Green if he gets resigned
"Rudy Gay, Rajon Rondo, Boogie Cousins, Seth Curry was the year"
Like a Seth Curry type of player?
The only way I even consider this trade is if there is an agreed upon plan in place on where to route those 3 Firsts for a high tier ball handler.   Hield would be a nice player to have but this does absolutely nothing to solve our issue of not having a perimeter playmaker. You can‚Äôt start a backcourt of Seth Curry and Buddy Hield. That‚Äôs just flat out not going to work.
"Actually dont think Hield, Bagley and 3 firsts is a bad haul for Simmons...but I dont see the fit for Philly if Fox isnt involved. Seth Curry, Hield, Danny Green, Tobais and Embid starting? Absolutely no playmaking and way worse on D. Makes alot of sense if they can get Lowry to sign in free agency though"
Is steph curry related to seth curry?
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre‚Ä¶. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also‚Ä¶. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc‚Ä¶."
"Don‚Äôt let the low trade value fool you, Seth curry is not in the same conversation as CJ. With dame not on the floor, CJ averages 25+ on good efficiency. He can create his own shot with the best of em."
"You think Doc, Seth Curry, PG and Doc‚Äôs daughter are gonna coexist without drama?"
CJ isn't $25 mil/year better than Seth Curry is the problem. They play the same position and we have Seth on a super cheap deal (like $8 mil/year). Seth was actually a bright spot in the playoffs and kept them in the Hawks series longer than they deserved to be based on everyone else's play.
I doubt Philly would want to give up Seth Curry. Shooting is such a premium in the league.
Lol no way we send Ben for CJ y'all dreaming. Imagine a backcourt of CJ and Seth Curry..
"idk it's pretty common for players to develop later. he's the current exception but there's one on every team. Pat Bev, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Khris Middleton, Marcus was considered worse than Markieff for a good while, Seth Curry, Spencer Dinwiddie, most teams have a guy who developed late and became a productive member of a playoff team. There's lots of routes in the nba and late bloomers for sure exist."
"well, we are neither sending our best (save for Durant and Dame on that team) neither are we sending our most complementary players. i mean, i think i'd rather have had Lonzo over Taytum, zion over lavine.  heck seth curry could have been a nice addition.  i mean we have by far the best talent in the olympics, but this is the question of ""would you rather have 5 Embiids, or the starting lineup of the kings"""
"How bout Tobias and Seth Curry for Dejounte instead? Tobias loves the mid range, Spurs love the mid range. It's a win win"
He would be a great offensively. The problem is you cannot have a backcourt of CJ and Seth Curry from a defensive standpoint.
"You would have Seth and CJ which would be atrocious defensively.   Contrary to popular opinion the sixers weren‚Äôt bad because of Simmons.   They were bad because they aren‚Äôt built to play against teams that rely on 2-3 big elite scoring wings.  The Celtics with Tatum and brown always cook them, the hawks with huerter reddish and bogie do the same thing. Same with the clippers if they ever faced them.   In any given run, you probably need to go through 2 of  bucks, Celtics, hawks and that‚Äôs not going to be pretty with CJ and Curry."
"Lol wasnt meant as a dig against seth curry more so that there are several decent  role players i would have taken over kevin love for team USA, let alone all stars"
wtf did seth curry do to you lmao
Seth curry is absolutely more deserving of a spot right now
Lowry alone is nowhere close to enough for Simmons. I wonder if Philly would do it for a package around Fred. His spacing and defense would do wonders for Embiid. Imagine Seth Curry on crack.
"The fact hes even on the team after the display hes put on in cleveland the last 3 years is disgraceful, shit even seth curry is probably more deserving of a spot at this point"
"I'm glad to hear that -- I suppose I've just been seeing too many headlines with Dame being mentioned. How come you think CJ makes sense to the Sixers tho? Curious because it seems like that would leave a huge hole at PG. Seth Curry played like CJ light this year (and perhaps performed as good as CJ in the playoffs). So wouldn't bringing CJ in be a marginal upgrade from Curry, while losing their point guard?"
"Don‚Äôt know,But I trust  the man that flipped josh Richardson for Seth Curry and flipped horfords Contract"
"You're right. They can they say no, but most teams would try to get something done. These are not terrible pieces, they can find a third team to take them. Seth Curry alone gets you a pick. Rebuilding teams will take Maxey for nothing. George Hill is an expiring $10 million deal who can give decent minutes and be moved at the deadline. Someone will take them, and the Raptors can nab a pick and a trade exception by playing ball. **That is better than nothing,** which is what they'll get if they don't cooperate."
"Unironically this team could use more role players like Danny Green, Reddick, Seth Curry, or even Duncan Robinson because off ball movement is nearly non-existent because everyone on the team is so used to being the star on their team that they forgot how to do the little stuff.   I mean look at how different Olympic Melo was from NBA Melo, he was pretty much the off-ball/catch and shoot threat on past Team USA squads because he realized that he doesn‚Äôt need to be the iso player in the international stage.  None of the players, except for Beal on some occasions, seems to realize that they need to stop playing like stars and actually play basketball like a team game. Before they realize this, this squad won‚Äôt go too far in the Olympics."
Jaylen Brown isn't quite the shooter Seth Curry is but yeah thats a decent comparison. If Jaylen had Seth Curry level shooting though I think he'd be a superstar that's at least on Tatum's level.
Eh I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs even average. EPM doesn‚Äôt always live up to the eye test. Seth Curry is above avg defender while Tatum is not. Jaylen brown is same defense as Luka. Drummond has like a 2.0 epm. Demar is one of the worst defenders in the league. PJ Tuckers defense is quite a bit worse than Trae Young. All these statements are according to epm
"He will prolly have to be included in the trade if there gonna play together on same team again next year, doubt Seth curry would be the deal in that trade"
Wouldn‚Äôt go that far. Jaylen Brown is 6‚Äô6 with a 7‚Äô wingspan who shoots 40% from deep and has WAY more well-rounded offensive skills than Seth Curry. And his perimeter D is very good.   Yet he‚Äôs certainly not an MVP.   A 45% shooting 3&amp;D guy would be absurdly valuable but not an MVP. And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd get crossing Curry and Thybulle.
"I wanna respond for fun  1. Simmons wouldn't have been as much of a disaster with Lowry. Lowry would've taken playmaking duty, stretched the floor to open up lanes for Embiid and Simmons, and reduced the need to play defensive liability Seth Curry or offensive liability Matisse Thybulle. What I'm saying is that the tanking of Simmons' trade value you just saw this playoffs is greater than anything you would've paid for Lowry.  2. What are the better long term options? The value in Lowry is that you don't have to give up Simmons. Lowry for picks and bench prospects is more net value than something like Beal for Simmons."
I think context matters here. Philly has such poor guard play it seems obvious to me it was a mistake not to overpay a little for Lowry. They were seriously trying to win a title with Geroge Hill and Seth Curry as their best perimeter creators?
"...I think you're asking us to compare Seth Curry to Wardell Stephen ""Dell"" Curry Sr? Because I think the answer is Dell, but Seth's been building himself an argument the last few seasons."
Next best thing? Thats like saying I couldn‚Äôt sign steph curry but here is seth‚Ä¶
"76ers shafted themselves, the loss of Seth Curry, their only consistent shooter far hurts more than the gain of Kyle Lowry"
"How valuable is klay rn? He‚Äôs 31, not exactly young, he‚Äôs torn his Achilles and ACL and missed the last two seasons. We don‚Äôt know how good he‚Äôll be when he comes back. He could be a Seth Curry for all know."
Seth Curry doesn't even know me.

"We could sub Ben off at the last minute and run an Embiid, Seth Curry, Tobias, Maxey, and Shake lineup that wouldn't be easy to beat"
"I say the Clippers. The spacing, the chemistry, the defense, the depth would be enough to beat the 76ers. The 76ers with a frontcourt of Dwight and Embiid would be scary. Also having Simmons, prime Danny Green, Tobias, prime George Hill, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, and Warriors Anthony Tolliver would be nice, but I think the Clippers would beat them in 7."
Still Seth Curry apparently
OP should have put all three as notable players. OP also should have added George Hill and Seth Curry as notable players.
"Isiah Thomas, Mugsey Bogues, Seth Curry"
Richardson was ass but I don't even think Seth Curry could abate the Porzingis effect
Not nearly as bad as another former pro dad coming to his Alma mater (where his jersey hangs in the rafters) to tell the head coach to take a look at his kid cause he can play. Coach couldn't find a spot for Steph Curry though and couldn't make the tourney while Steph took Davidson on a deep tourney run. And that's why Seth Greenberg is an analyst now.
Papa Curry and Seth are still two of the best shooters all time.
"what you just said, having rich parents which gives you the safety net and comfort to stick something out or do what you want is applicable to any life path.... literally seth curry is a beneficiary of that.  i'm not a fan of rachel, i think the situation is funny she perpetuates this shit and then is wait don't let it happen to me, let someone else get fukt over. i also think maria taylor ain't worth it and is lucking out but who is gonna fault her for that.  also my problem is the the dude above just buzzword drops dianne sawyer cuz he's seen it posted here and can't even respond. maybe she has helped but i doubt it's a situation like kate capshaws daughter just striking it with spielberg. from her wiki rachel nichols started at NW in 1991, so she's started her journalism career literally 30 years ago, maria taylor is only 32 years old lol. and obviously married != met but she married her husband in 01, i have a feeling she at least did some stuff on her own before the great big bob iger errrrr dianne sawyer came along."
"My guy, what was Jrue's role in that series? He put up 28/4/6.5/1.3 on 57/35/70.6 shooting.  Dame put up 18.5/4.5/4.8/1.3 on 35/30/88 shooting.   Jrue's role was to shut down Dame and he did while putting up great scoring numbers because neither Dame nor CJ can guard him.   Every time Dame has gone up a contender his defensive flaws are exposed heavily. It isn't just the team around him, he would be better off being the second best player on a team but again his defense issues would be exposed heavily. I don't think it's that easy to hide defensive liabilities in the playoffs. Seth Curry had a great defensive cast around him, yet he was still picked apart by the hawks and they couldn't bench Seth because he was their second best offensive option too."
The Kings got some good ones  Demarcus cousins DeAaron Fox John Salmons Louis King Corey Brewer Caron Butler Seth Curry Ron Artest (it‚Äôs a stretch lol)  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs way more.
"Man I can‚Äôt even have this debate. What do you think a guy like Noel does in practice? Just stand next to the rim and work on dunks? All players work on all facets of their game in NBA practice because that‚Äôs their fucking job. Does it show up in games? Not always because there‚Äôs 9 other guys on the floor who are doing the same thing. If I have to pick between Noel and Seth curry to take a three I‚Äôm gonna pick Curry every time. If I have to pick between Noel and a guy who played in college but is now an accountant? I‚Äôm gonna pick Noel every time and it‚Äôs not a debate.   If Shaq is just cramming on people in pick up it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs how he‚Äôs used to playing, not because he couldn‚Äôt face up and hit shots on them. Rec league defence is basically no defence. AAU ball is full of dudes who will never take a three in an NBA game who are splashing them over highschool kids."
"That is a reflection of their current team with the knowledge that the entire team and the entire city is waiting until Simmons is traded and it will affect the vibe in the locker room.   Until they trade him, it'd be silly to rank them any higher because their team only has 1 true great shot creator in Embiid, who is amazing, but one has to question his mindset going into the season with the uncertainty of Simmons' future. Tobi and Seth Curry are decent, but their shortcomings were exposed in the playoffs.   If they trade Simmons for say, Dame Lillard or Brad Beal, then obviously they shoot wayyyy up the rankings into that Brooklyn/Milwaukee tier."
"Duncan robinson,seth curry, joe harris, etc are better shooter than bird. Cmon its not so hard to see that. Bird was great on his era but he is nothing compared to current great shooters."
"&gt;Your question is idiotic and your comparison of Seth Curry to Middleton is even dumber when Middleton takes around the same amount of shots as Giannis.  No you're extremely dumb for misunderstanding that very clear text. You could not make the distinction of star shooter and you could not comprehend the hypothetical scenario about Seth that I wrote out to try to make you understand what the difference between best shooter and best star shooter would be.  &gt;Curry never took the same amount of shots as Doncic outside of a few games  That is exactly what I was saying.  No one agrees with your stupid imaginary definition of first option, and I was politely discussing it with you until you started being hostile and rude because of things you misunderstood because you're bad at reading. I'm done with your idiocy."
"Yes, they were second options some seasons or series.  I‚Äôm not  ignoring your question.  Your question is idiotic and your comparison of Seth Curry to Middleton is even dumber when Middleton takes around the same amount of shots as Giannis.  Curry never took the same amount of shots as Doncic outside of a few games.  Middleton is getting 20 shots a game, you realize that, right?     Wait‚Ä¶ what option do you think Simmons is on the 76ers?"
"Nope, I haven't ignored that. That's why I wrote STAR shooter. Seth Curry was a better shooter than Donƒçiƒá in Dallas and better than both Simmons and Embiid in Philly but he didn't get as many shots because he's not a star. Would he have the stamina, consistency and skillset to take 20 shot per game efficiently, he would be a star. You, however, are ignoring my argument. Whould you consider the Hall of Famers I listed to be second options on their teams the seasons they didn't take the most shots overall or in late game situations?"
Seth Curry probably
Seth Curry was ridiculously good that series
Seth Curry didn't deserve this dude was carrying their ass the 2nd half
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
"Yeah I guess the big question, if they had Ingram over Simmons, would they have won it all? No I don‚Äôt think so, maybe they do better, you don‚Äôt bring in both Danny green and Seth curry if you have shooting from Ingram instead of Simmons"
Om3g! The Seth curry story.
"NY, but Philly was the biggest winner for trading JRich for Seth Curry"
Yea cuz not like Morey got us out from under that albatross of a Horford contract and turned J Rich into Seth Curry within his first few weeks here.
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ou46ae/how_badly_did_daryl_morey_mess_up_by_refusing_to/  Why are you so insistent on shitting on Daryl? Lol  George Hill was probably an overpay, but it shouldn‚Äôt be in the same conversation as the Harden trade.  To be fair to Daryl, he has made some good moves in his short time in Philly as well such as acquiring Seth Curry and Danny Green."
"Not really. He was not so much a defensive liability that the team lost games because of him. I'd say team defense was lackluster in a lot of their games. Also, Atlanta are a better offensive team than philly. Shocker right?. The whole team can shoot. Even that one game that trae couldn't score for shit, they still won because others can score. Philly on the other hand are terrible on offense. Tobias is so streaky! Embid is good, but the was shit on efficiency in the last two games. We all know the situation with simmons so no need to go there. In many ways seth curry was their best offensive player, which shouldn't be the case."
"I was discussing spacing with him and he mentioned that two of their biggest threats were out, how does Seth Curry factor into that? Are you just trolling at this point?"
"Keeping a discussion on track isn't your strongest skill, is it? The point was ""Korkmaz and Green were not easily their biggest threats"".   If you think I want to get into that conversation, reply that on the other comment, because the one above had nothing to do with my point that the dude completely forgot Seth Curry"
Seth Curry? Dude was shooting better than anyone on the Bucks roster
"So was Prince and his defense.  Melo has to take someone's spot on that squad if he wasn't coming off the bench, and with his ego I find that hard to believe, and if they play Melo in place of Prince suddenly there is a massive weakness in their defense. Having 4 great defenders but one turnstile can fuck up even a great defense(look at Seth Curry with the Sixers against the Hawks this year)."
It‚Äôs 2021 now my dude.  Ben making obvious passes to Seth Curry while teams triple team Embiid isn‚Äôt a feather in Ben‚Äôs cap.
Seth Curry - Best non line shortened 3pt pct.
Oh yea but they were decent on him  Mainly Seth Curry was their downfall on that end
&amp;#x200B;  The problem with your example is that the Sixers defense wasn't even good. They just kept on going at Seth Curry and he couldn't be benched cause he was the 2nd best player on the court for them
"The Hawks won also because they attacked the hell out of Seth Curry and even with all those elite defenders the Sixers have they couldn't hide him. More credit to defense than you think.  Ben couldn't exploit the Sixers' weaknesses, Doc couldn't make any adjustments to try to target the Trae &amp; Lou Will backcourt but also couldn't do anything to stop Seth from being attacked  It's most important not to have liabilities on both sides, but you commonly see defensive liabilities get picked on in the playoffs than offensive ones. Ben is just so much of a detrimental offensive liability he was singled out in this series"
"He has statistically been the best in the regular season and was fine before the bucks  And klay is coming off double serious injuries? I mean I get your joe point, but you could‚Äôve said anyone else, Seth curry, Marcus Morris or ingles all have cases rn"
Tobias was giving you 20+ on near 50/40/90 shooting and Ben was the DPOY runner up  They also had great shooters in Danny Green and Seth Curry as well as a good bench unit
* ben simmons * seth curry * tobias harris * danny green * andre drummond  They would beat the Sacramento Kings when they'd play them in Philly.
Out of all the top players not many have a bigger underdog story than Curry basketball wise. He had zero hype til his junior year and that crazy run in March. Now it looks like a slam dunk but back then people didn‚Äôt respect his game or potential. Think about it Steph went to Davidson before it was known as a basketball school and Seth went to Liberty before they took off. Sure they had privileges as people but not basketball players
"I'm just saying that everyone will romanticize their perspective in some way shape or form. I'm sure that everyone believes that they came from nothing in some way. Harden's dad spent most of his time in jail, and Harden had to grow up in Compton. LeBron came from nothing. Haliburton's mom was killed. Curry struggled with injuries and inadequacy early in his career. Seth Curry has to keep up with Steph. Patrick Beverley had to fight for a bench spot. If you look hard enough, you could probably find a reason for anyone. LaMelo has to compete with his brother and has been scrutinized his entire career since highschool. Lonzo was part of the young core that had a chance to play with LeBron but got traded right off the bat. Everyone has a chip on their shoulder, and some are obviously bigger than others, but everyone has a chip nonetheless."
"Trae's 49.5% from 5-9 feet was 13 of 63 when sorted for starting guards with at least 40 attempts in that range.    https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shooting/?sort=5-9%20ft.%20FG%20PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=5-9%20ft.%20FGA*G*40&amp;StarterBench=Starters  Which is honestly pretty good, it isn't the hyper efficient ""free throws, layups, and 3s"" range of efficiency, but when defenders are keying on taking away those shots, 13th best among starting guards is pretty good.    I was surprised to see LaMello lead that list at 59% on 44 shots, I think his height and low shot total helps his percentage.  I could get more exclusive and increase the shots cutoff, but 40 attempts left in Seth Curry, who was going against Trae with those kinds of shots in the playoffs.    Paul, Irving, and Curry as the rest of the top 4 is as expected."
Seth Curry is on the 6ers though.
What do you think?  Seth Curry has only attempted 185 CAS threes in his whole career?
"Good, underrated pick. If I had to choose for the Lakers it would be Seth Curry, because the only massive weakness on the team IMO is spacing. Obviously, there are other flaws, but that‚Äôs the big one for me."
"I wonder how long teams aren't going to be able to exploit Trae on defense before the whole ""Switch on him on offense"" argument gets nipped in the bud. Trae had to face Rose, Ben, Curry, and Jrue in the playoffs and only Seth have abused him on screens."
Giannis is a better scorer than Seth Curry.  I'm sure you understand the distinction.
A few interesting names pop up if you change the minimum attempts to 140:      Seth Curry    144     48.6     (ninth best) -----------------------------     John Wall     145     31.7     (worst overall)     Giannis       143     35.7     (fourth worst)     DLo           141     39.0     (twelfth worst)
"For real. Even a best Curry question goes 60% Steph, 15% goat, 10% Sonya, 10% Seth, and 5% katsu."
Curry is a solid sixth man. Seth curry is a solid player
"None of those players make us better at all imo. A backcourt of Seth Curry and any of those three gets attacked every possession in the playoffs. None of them are really that good at playmaking or passing, which we desperately need when Simmons goes."
"A top 5 creator. Like what? The top 5 lead ballanhders in the NBA in some order are Curry, Luka, Harden, and Dame. The Sixers are throwing the year away if they go into the playoffs with Seth Curry as their best ball handler. Morey blew it last year when he didn;t nab Lowry and he's going to blow it again waiting for a Dame trade."
"Morey got us out of the Horford contract to get us Danny Green who we now have for 2 more years, traded Josh Richardson for 2 more years of Seth Curry, drafted Tyrese Maxey and drafted Paul Reed, not to mention that was his first year as a GM (even though technically Elton Brand is our ‚ÄúGM‚Äù). The only trade so far that was bad was trading Tony Bradley for George Hill, which was an understandable move at the time as we needed veteran depth in the PG position.   I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done a damn good job so far for his first year here. Far better than Elton Brand for sure"
THEY TOOK SETH CURRY FOR FREE
"As a Heat fan, I‚Äôd love for y‚Äôall to put Isaiah Thomas and Seth Curry on the court at the same time."
"&gt;stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  Just because the Mavs FO is dumb doesn't mean Morey is a genius.   &gt;got Dwight, Embiid‚Äôs best backup so far, on a vet min   Because the Lakers fucked it up. But where is he now?  &gt;re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  No other team was going to give Danny 10 million a year. Furkan is just a 3 point shooter."
"In his one year in Philly, Morey has :  **Pros**  * got the Sixers to the 1 seed in the East  * unloaded the horrific Horford contract while acquiring Danny Green, a very useful role player  * stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  * got Dwight, Embiid‚Äôs best backup so far, on a vet min  * re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  * drafted some promising young players, such as Maxey    **Cons**   * not acquiring Harden because of a personal vendetta from Tillman  * the George Hill trade was kind of weird in retrospect   I‚Äôm feeling pretty good with Morey at the helm."
"First of all whether these are actually opinions whether you like them or not. But anyway.   1.Atlanta Hawks will have the shooters and defense necessary to easily beat the Nets especially if Reddish and Hunter avoid injury and take a leap this year.  2. Hawks won because they were resilient and knew how to close games, not just because of Simmons. Multiple 76ers players like Embiid and Harris fucked up bad. Only consistently good player was probably Seth Curry. Hawks players are gonna take the big leap this year and shock people  3.I‚Äôm pretty confident in saying this because Trae was having another great night and Hawks were leading before he got injured.  4.If you think LONZO BALL and Demar DeRozen (consistent playoff underperformer) makes the Bulls a super team I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. You should use the term superteam for an actual superteam like the Nets  5.They won‚Äôt be the best team in the NBA, they‚Äôll lose in the first round   7. When you constantly lose in the first round you are overrated. That‚Äôs just a fact. It is what it is"
Isaiah Thomas and Seth Curry in the same backcourt ? Not a good idea
Nope not doing Seth curry part two. I already saw enough of the zero defense bull crap
Steph curry dell curry seth curry austin rivers damion lee   coach doc rivers
Seth curry was basically on a one year rehab deal and we effectively lost hood and Collins immediately after due to injuries
one guy i hated losing was seth curry but not enough to move the needle
Harris played god awful and seth curry wasnt there yet
"Yup, that‚Äôs also why I rank Seth Curry ahead of Shaq on my all time list."
Seth Curry &gt; Steph Curry
Seth Curry most likely.
Seth Curry is a poor man's Steph Curry
"He does score though. People post the few meme clips where he passes up open shots and he very clearly has issues with his FT shooting but he was playing almost all of his playoff minutes alongside Embiid, Harris, and Seth Curry who were combining for 80%+ usage in the playoffs."
"Nah bro, don't think Seth Curry is there quite yet"
"&gt; They pretty much went iso in their 2018 WCF series.   They went iso because of KD wanting to take every shot. He went psycho after the ""you know who I am interview"". A month prior to that he was passive af taking only 12 shots and the team was wondering why he was taking such few shots, then he doubled it to 24 FGA after the interview. This is why Kerr said KD had ""stylistic"" tension with the team and why he'd always get into fights with Draymond in transition. To paraphrase Seth Curry, Warriors moved the ball a lot more when KD wasn't there."
"Again, I'm saying they're special in different ways, you're the one who said Zion had only 50% of the offensive ability that KAT does. What Zion can do is just as rare. Realistically I think they're about even but I would put Zion ahead because he's younger (Seth Partnow just put them both as tier 3 players, although Zion is in a better subtier).  &gt;that would make Zion better than Curry and Lebron too  Those are two guys who play very different roles than Zion/KAT do. At least Zion and KAT are comparable, I'd have to weight things differently if comparing to those two, they're both primary ball handlers for their respective teams. For example, LeBron's AST% is more than double Zion's, would that make up for slightly lower TS%? Probably. Zion and KAT are both bigs so it's a cleaner comp although I'll admit not ideal because they play the role very differently.  &gt;With AST% usually comes a higher TOV%  I'm well aware, they're pretty close in both AST% and TOV% but Zion has the better A/TO Ratio  &gt;with 16/17 fga being inside the paint, usually you have a higher free throw rate  Again, well aware, still very important to get to the line. Zion made more free throws this year than KAT even attempted.  &gt; with that high of a 2p% you‚Äôre ts% will also be up there  If you mean that I'm double dipping by including both, maybe. However, Curry for example has a better TS% than Zion, it is possible to be an outside shooter and have a great TS%.   &amp;#x200B;  Not trying to be too dismissive of KAT who's a great player and when healthy is all-star caliber, you just seem very dismissive of Zion who at age 20 averaged 27 PPG on 61% shooting. Making 61% of your shots when you lead the league in attempts with defenders [tight](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=2-4%20Feet%20-%20Tight) or [very tight](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) (by a large margin) is not easy."
Herro is a classic example of waiting a few years to find out. I think he‚Äôll always have a place in the league as long as he can shoot and play off ball. But he might flame out due to his extra curriculars and I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if he goes nearly broke with his current lifestyle. I think worst case he could just be a bench guy that people move on from every year or two like Austin rivers. Best case he‚Äôs like a more athletic Seth Curry this last year.
"Most underrated guy must be a guy on a good team, guy who is not considered a top performer for a team yet he is a crucial piece but at the same time thought of as expendable or replaceable. Also he can't be very young as it is too easy to underrate a young, developing player.  It can't be a second all star on a contending team or an all star but one that isn't praised as the second coming or the best player on a bad team.  So using these criteria I can safely say that Seth Curry is for sure one of the most underrated players. Mavs thought they can trade him for Richardson and we saw what happened. In Philly he played fourth fiddle to Embiid, Simmons and Harris meanwhile in many games was the person who stood between win or total collapse.   Other picks: Brook Lopez"
"you're saying it's idiotic to ask if thanasis got his contract because of giannis? maybe it is, but it's not because friends and family signings don't happen in the nba. maybe he is a legit nba player, that's why I asked... maybe you can explain why it's idiotic instead of being a fake cordial prick.  the warriors did it at least 5 times in the last few years. only seth curry panned out at the nba level"
"Has to be De'Aaron Fox, yes I'm a homer but they just ranked him alongside RoCo and Seth Curry"
"From a Sixer fan perspective ‚Äî¬†Seth struggles to get his shot off sometimes because of his size limitations. In the playoffs, against a Trae/Huerter backcourt, he actually had the chance to get up some more shots and was the Sixers second-best scorer that series. I don't think it's a coincidence that most of the high-volume shooters are either, like, 6'5""+ or named Steph Curry. It's really hard to get shots off in the NBA."
It‚Äôs been Seth Curry for a few years now to me. Even his contract is ridiculously cheap. For a guy that shoots that good it makes no sense.   It‚Äôs way too many players that make more than him that aren‚Äôt better than him
"you need superelite hand-eye coordination to make the kinds of shot curry has from anywhere half-court. that‚Äôs very genetic and very unteachable. to shoot from 30+ feet accurate to the inch off-the-dribble is simply not the type of skill that comes from (just) practice, even looking at other players renowned as shooters.   just look at the difference between steph, klay, and seth, who have all had every resource needed to become good shooters. yet there‚Äôs are world of difference between those three.  or look at the fact that free throws have been emphasized for a long time, yet curry clearly stands out as the best ft shooter in history. we may see another curry but there‚Äôs just as much reason to believe we were lucky to even see one."
"Scrolled way too far to see this. Idc if you think SGA, Ja, Jaylen etc are better than him (they're not), putting him in a different tier entirely is utter disrespect. This mf put Fox in the same tier as Seth Curry, Fred Vanvleet, and Robert Covington"

Then we traded Seth Curry and made a few moves and became dog shit.
The same stat that says Patty Mills is better than Joel Embiid and Seth Curry is better than Kawhi and Draymond
"Sure, if that is your main qualifier then PG is better than Butler... but Seth Curry would be better than both of them."

"Because it doesn't make sense in his comment nor does it make sense in yours either. Head to head, Steph is busting him for 29 ppg to Seths 8 ppg. Curry is playing well and getting it on offense while Seth isn't and doesn't seem to stop Steph or elevate his game to stop Steph from scoring. Where is Seth's elevation play at when playing Steph?   Whether he meant it or not, his comment came off like a shot and wasn't even an apt point, but I'm not saying he meant to do it. He made it seem like Seth is average at defense, but got his contract because he can guard Steph because of familiarity. But yet, when they play each other, Steph is still eating, getting what he wants.   Also, of the 145 games Seth's team has played over the last 2 seasons, they have only played the warriors 5 times and Seth went against Steph in only 1 of those games, the one he busted out for 49 points.   Do you understand now? All I asked was why talk about Steph in this analogy because it didn't seem to fit. Then you started acting like a snarky bitch for no reason when I didn't even come at you sideways."
Have anyone capable of running a pick and role or creating from the permitter would dramatically change the Sixers fortunes in my opinion. It‚Äôs ridiculous that the best guards the Sixers have picked up since Buttler left is a combination of George Hill and Seth Curry.   It‚Äôs entirely possible this blows up and Philly‚Äôs face and they go into the playoffs without a capable permitter player again.
"I mean what‚Äôs the point of talking about steph at all?  They are only going to play against each other maybe 3-4 times in a season. Is he saying that Seth is bad, but he‚Äôs worth a decent contract because he could guard curry in 3/72 games?  That doesn‚Äôt seem like a cool thing to say"
I think being LaMelos brother and just having that chemistry your whole life would propel him over another random bench piece.    Kinda like how Seth Curry is an average to below average defender.. but he‚Äôs not a complete liability guarding Steph bc of a lifetime of familiarity
wife of a sixers fan here - apparently my assertion that seth curry is better looking than steph curry is VERY unpopular
"They don't have to be on the court simultaneously. Besides, most 7 footers tend to miss 10-20 games every season due to minor injuries.   It's not like Mavs get lots of options anyway. Just take a look at the players we have signed in the past 5 years. If  he is indeed that bad except for his shooting, Lauri could be our Seth Curry replacement."
"If Ben could make free throws, Kevin Huerter still would have destroyed seth curry, Harris still would have missed open layups, Embiid still would have had massive turnovers, Dwight howard still would have been unable to play without fouling someone"
We had a net rating of -32 when he was off the floor but ok. And if you think it was just him then you‚Äôre clueless. Tobias bricked every layup. Joel had like 9 turnovers. Doc had terrible rotations. Seth Curry got burned by Huerter while Ben kept Trae to 5-23 in game 7. The bench sucked
And. those units were mostly dumpster fires. Philly's 2nd most played unit in 2019 was a Simmons bench unit which put up a 101 offensive rating in 156 minutes. Other variations of that lineup were mostly hot garbage.    How can a guy who can't run a pick and roll or create any offence in the half-court carry a bench unit? It's not exactly a mystery why Philly's bench units are garbage. The best perimeter player on the team is Seth Curry. Doc just prayed one of Maxey or Shake got hot because he had no options.
"That's Seth ""Skyfellator"" Curry to you."
"maybe ben should play like the 2nd best player then, instead of getting outplayed by seth fucking curry"
You're basically describing Seth Curry more or less and he's considered a very good role player.
From what I pictured together he was right about not trading Seth Curry so Cuban still sees value in his judgment
"&gt;Flipping Horford and Jason Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry improved the roster hugely despite the imperative to save a ton of money  100% completely agreed. I know Green gets a good amount of hate from the fanbase, but he was solid at the very least (you can never have too many 3 and D guys) - I also love Curry AND Curry's contract."
"Flipping Horford and Jason Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry improved the roster hugely despite the imperative to save a ton of money.  Morey is fantastic, while there‚Äôs a ton of luck and we pretty much emptied the tank with the Fultz, Harris and Butler trades before he got there he‚Äôs still a fantastic GM."
"Right. I agree with you there, and now it's becoming a 'what did OP mean"" type of thing lol we all know what 3&amp;D guys are, but the question (in addition to the title itself) was who maximizes value on D while being a 'big' threat from 3?  KD is the answer if you're answering 3&amp;D *capability* rather than limiting it to 'only' 3&amp;D.  KD's 45% from 3 is only topped by Bobby Portis, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Bryn Forbes and Joe Harris. Neither of those guys are better defensively than KD, and those better defenders out there aren't shooting nearly what KD shoots from 3pt range.  Btw, I specifically gave a two part answer (KD/Mikal Bridges) to OP to cover all ground to because I figured the KD answer would turn into this when I saw it lol   Bridges was my answer of choice if we're talking specifically 3&amp;D role guys.  Who did you end you picking as the answer OPs question?"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
Curry was on like a 4 year 40 something million contract before he got into his big pay day. That really enabled Golden State to take off if I remember correctly.   I'm pretty sure Seth is on a super friendly contract as well.
"but the whole defensive structure for defending simmons is to clog the paint, so teams do adjust for him just in diferent ways. You can do that when you're only legit shooter is seth curry who takes 2 and a half minutes to wind up a shot...not so easy when its klay and steph slipping screens and geting shots of as soon as it hits their hands"
They definitely beat the hawks if Danny plays. Seth curry was getting victimized play after play in game 7.  Green stabilized their unit to a tremendous degree.   Simmons played bad but if they go to game 6 or so in ecf it would have improved Ben's standing.    Korkmaz was getting real minutes dude.
Seth Curry and Ben Simmons
Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle
"It would've been Simmons, Seth Curry and like 4 firsts for the Nets to even consider it"
"Ben Simmons going from 14ppg to 10ppg is not why the 6ers lost the series. Seth Curry having one of the most insane shooting series ever more than made up for Ben's scoring downtick.   Dumping on Simmons is just people avoiding the fact that Doc's lineup management was ass and that Embiid was ass in the 2nd half of most games and turned the ball over a ton.   Simmons didn't get exposed by himself, the 6ers were exposed as a team. People just want the easiest narrative and it wouldn't do to have the blame shared."
"Lol rotations don‚Äôt work that way bro. It‚Äôs not like if Simmons is gone, Maxey will get +35 extra mins because he‚Äôs the back up PG. It‚Äôs going to be divided depending on situation. +15 for Maxey/+10 for Thybulle/+5 for Curry/+5 for Reed. When they need to replace Simmons defense in certain game situations, Thybulle will get his mins and they‚Äôll just play Seth at PG."
"I 100% agree with everything you said, ***except*** the ‚Äútiny bit‚Äù part.  Doc, Embiid, Thybulle(as he points out here), and basically anyone on the team not named Seth Curry have not gotten the criticism they deserve for this, and, in the case if Doc and the front office, they haven‚Äôt even gotten close to the criticism they deserve. Ben Simmons has certainly been thrown under the bus. Almost no one talks about anyone but Ben.  And, no, the occasional upvoted comment on n this sub does not count as an equalizing level of criticism."
And Seth Curry was providing enough on the offensive end that it shouldn‚Äôt have been a problem.  The biggest reason by far that they lost was because their max contract point guard scored under 10 points a game this series and was so scared of getting fouled and bricking FTs that he basically hid from the ball
"3 way trade between lonzo, ben simmons, and terry rozier to get the ball brothers all in charlotte. Ben in chicago and rozier in philly. Liangelo ball becomes the next seth curry being the ignition off the bench. Ben and zach lavine have amazing chemistry"
"Dude he's on a team with Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias (who doesn't shoot volume but still good percentage), Korkmaz, shake and Embiid plays outside of the paint a lot. How much shooting is enough shooting for Ben? Does he need Warriors level shooting to be effective?"
"Coaching was horrible on all accounts when it came to defensive schemes, offensive game plan, game management, and players‚Äô understanding of their offensive roles. The constant discombobulation of sixers players all playoffs long on where guys should be standing, spacing, when and where to not cut etc. was embarrassing all playoffs long. It took Seth Curry playing like Steph for them to stay alive offensively, multiple 76ers rotational guys were practically no where to be found while on the contrary they got burned by the hawks role players all season long. I‚Äôm not saying Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt play like shit because he absolutely did, but he‚Äôs not the only reason they lost like the way everyone and their mother is painting it to be."
"No one else failed in the same way.  Who else would you like held accountable? Seth Curry? Tobias Harris? Doc Rivers?  Tobias gets crucified by the fans all the time, but even he isn't SO BAD at any part of the game that he gets played off the court.  Seth Curry's offense was the only thing that was consistent outside of Embiid. His defensive burden was an issue but considering he was our second most important offensive player he can have a pass.  Doc Rivers? Literally, everyone holds him accountable and shits on him relentlessly.   Ben Simmons is the common denominator of issues for 3 consecutive years. Ben Simmons is great on one side of the court, and was such a burden on the other end and to the team as a whole that he had to be benched because he can't even manage to shoot 50% from the FT line. Ben Simmons passed up a wide open dunk out of fear that Trae ""Rudy Gobert"" Young would block him. Ben Simmons deserved to be held accountable."
&gt;Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  19 ppg for the series right on line with his season averages. Nobody‚Äôs saying a player can‚Äôt have a bad game.   &gt;Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Joel Embiid averaged 30 ppg over 7 games.   &gt;Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Curry - 21 ppg on **78.8 TS%**  Huerter - 13.1 ppg on 57.9 TS%  Just factually wrong. Curry‚Äôs offensive production heavily outweighed his defensive shortcomings.
"Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Losing a series is a team effort. And yeah Ben was awful, and Embiid was a monster playing through a real injury, but Ben was crucified"
This pod cast lowkey one of the most wild one he ever done he implied kyrie is anti vax. But support golden state to win the west after the lakers. While their second best defensive player in wiggins is publicly saying fuck vaccines and probably cant play home games in sf for their health regulations in that county. Then pg for ben Simmons lol. Pg reunited with doc seth curry and his wife( pg ex he cheated on)
"Seth Curry is married to his coach‚Äôs (Doc Rivers) daughter, the same daughter that Paul George cheated on with a stripper."
&gt;ball that much it‚Äôs hard for teammates to get a rhythm  Who are you describing here? Guys like THJ and Seth Curry put up their career best scoring seasons next to Luka because of the space and looks he creates for them through his vision and playmaking. KP also just had his most efficient offensive season ever despite all the criticism he's gotten. Luka generates wide open looks for all the guys around him.   We do need a secondary playmaker to take some of the burden off Luka but him dominating the ball is by necessity. Brunson is the closest thing we have to a second guy who can generate his own offense.
"Wait, did I miss major news and the Curry brothers got traded or something? Since fucking when did Seth get switched with Steph?"
"For some reason I feel Doc can work magic with Bagley. I‚Äôm a kings fan, I‚Äôd include Mitchell in a deal if Bagley was in it as well, or would do Hield AND Barnes and take back Seth Curry, along with a pick. Of all the the packages that include strong starters and NO stars, I think the Kings beat out the Wolves or Pacers. Beasley and Beverly and picks, would be next, Pacers are sleepers"
"Sorry which advanced metrics? If you‚Äôre talking about raptor, last year‚Äôs top 5 offensive players were  * Full season: Curry, Jokic, Dame, Harden, Luka * Regular season only: Jokic, Steph, Dame, Harden, Luka * Playoffs only: Dame, Donovan Mitchell, Harden, Lebron, tie between Seth Curry and Luka"
Just give Seth Curry the ball
Kenny would get Seth Curry stats in today's league
"While I agree that Doc is no longer an elite coach, it's not that he won't ever bring the Sixers to the finals. It's that he *can't.* And that's Morey's fault, in my opinion.   To wit: Morey refuses to ""lose"" trades and has a reputation of trying to fleece everyone. He was given a golden opportunity to pair Embiid with a disgruntled Top 5 player in James Harden. Now obviously the Rockets aren't going to deal with Morey for the same cost as other teams, but if he had swallowed his pride and overpaid for Harden, he could have gotten rid of Simmons and acquired the perfect running mate for Embiid. Reporting at the time suggested he was unwilling to give up Maxey/Thybulle. IF losing a young prospect or even role/starter in order to get Harden would've been all that it took (on top of the other assets Brooklyn ended up giving), the Sixers organization had plenty of information to know that Simmons wasn't the answer and that they could do much better with Harden/Harris/Embiid than with Simmons.   To make matters worse, it was well known that Harden's other primary suitors were Miami and Brooklyn. Either case would create a juggernaut in Philly's own conference. And sure enough, after plenty of time to bring a package together, Morey fails to make the overpay since he refuses to ""lose"" and ends up holding the bag on Simmons while Brooklyn becomes a superteam that will last through Embiid's prime.   So yeah, Doc sucks, but no coach is going to get Philly past Brooklyn (let alone Milwaukee) at this point. And that's Morey's doing. But let's pat him on the back because he got Seth Curry or some shit."
"We'll see. We have yet to get to the conclusion of all this nonsense.   In the meantime, he's already built up a lot of slack because of how he was able to get rid of Horford relatively painlessly (and get Danny Green in return) and trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry.   As bad as our situation is now, it would be 100x worse if our old front office was still running things."
Bro no one is buying out a positive asset like Seth curry. Any rebuilding team could very easily flip him for a 1st or at worst multiple seconds
"I think offensively it could be close, that‚Äôs a good point. Defense becomes the problem though in my opinion. Embiid and Giannis are both DPOY level, but Middleton and Jrue are each a step above Harris and Brogdon. The Sixers also have Seth Curry who‚Äôs a pretty big defensive liability. It‚Äôs possible to cover for him when he‚Äôs next to a DPOY-level perimeter defender in Simmons, but from what I‚Äôve seen from Brogdon he‚Äôs just a good defender, not an elite defender that is enough to cover for others.   Also Bucks fans won‚Äôt like this, but last year was a perfect storm of injuries for them to win the title. Embiid, Harris, and Brogdon may be close to the Bucks top 3, but they can‚Äôt compete with Kyrie, KD, and Harden or LeBron and AD or Jokic, Murray, and MPJ"
"Ben Simmons was 2nd in DPOY voting, finished 1st team all defensive and has made multiple all star games. Tobias Harris was considered a snub for the all star game this past year. Matisse Thybulle was 2nd team all defensive last season. Danny Green and Seth Curry are above average role players/starters. To say that Embiid was surrounded by ""a gang of useless scrubs"" is absurd."
"We have 3 or 4 guards on our roster that could start for y‚Äôall, depending upon the package, y‚Äôall would get 1 or 2 of them. Beasley is a solid fit at the 2 and even Bev has a case to start, as neither of them have the 6th-man like shot creation ability of Seth Curry yet are good to elite at catch and shoot. DLo if on the table obviously is another starting level option."
That's not true at all. CJ is pretty much an upgraded Seth Curry clone
"Philly would get a lead guard who can shoot, and plays nice with Seth Curry."
"He's not on Draymond's level as far as decision making goes. He doesn't have the ""chemistry"" Draymond brings to a team. He doesn't have the experience Draymond brings. He's just not on that level, especially as far as the ""hard to quantify and/or explain"" (often called ""intangibles"") Draymond brings.  One of those ""hard to explain / quantify"" things is the difference in ""threat to shoot"" or ""threat to beat us"" between Ben and Draymond. Ben is zero threat to even shoot and if he throws one up once from outside once in a while he's been so bad for so long you make him ""prove it"", because the chances of him ""beating you"" just aren't very good.  I mean you can seriously say ""let's key on everyone else, collapse hard on Embiid and make him work for everything all game long and if Ben can beat us, good for Ben"". You drop off him. You can ""hide"" a weak(er) defender on him. You can dare him to beat you ... If you try that shit on Draymond you'll get wrecked, because he will find a way to exploit you even if that requires him to shoot the f'ing ball.  Reality is Ben was given home court advantage with Joel Embiid (nigh unstoppable on the block) and Seth Curry (always in the race for highest 3 percentage in the league) and couldn't figure out how to beat the ""We're basically all 3 or 4 years out of college"" Atlanta Hawks in a 7 game series ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ... That's not an ""omfg we need him on our team"" resume piece."
"It‚Äôs hard to punish a backcourt when your main ball handler is afraid to go to the basket against someone 9 inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than him.   Also, Seth Curry I‚Äôm pretty sure had the most efficient 20ppg playoff series in NBA history.  They took advantage as much as they possibly could with the limitations Simmons gives them.   It‚Äôs also not Docs fault that Embiid was completely worthless in the fourth quarter of games because of injury."
You do now Seth curry is married to his daughter right
Paul George did it.  Seth Curry married that same girl with Doc's face!
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
"ben had 13 assists in game 7. hardaway jr is another player to fit the seth curry role for us. sure, tim can actually shoot, but we aren't even getting to game 7 if you're taking away ben's playmaking and defence and not replacing it with at least equivalent value"
SS: Curry and LeBron  AS: Tatum and Klay  Role  Draymond (starting center) Steven Adams Seth Curry TJ McConnell Oubre Buddy Hield Wiggins Porzingis
"KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Javalle McGee  Andre Iguodala, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris, Thybulle"
"Starting 5: Jokic, Jerami Grant Middleton, Smart, Steph. Bench: Ingles, Patty Mills, Seth Curry, Caruso, Marcus Morris, Naz Reid, PJ Tucker, Jaden McDaniels"

Jrue was the toughest pick as I wasn‚Äôt sure if CP3, Trae, Booker among others were Superstars so I decided between Jrue and Lowry. Jrue I think fits better with a team like this personally."
"PG: LeBron James (SS) SG: Brad Beal (AS) SF: Kevin Durant (SS) PF: Jayson Tatum (AS) C: Rob Williams  6-12 FVV, Seth Curry, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis, Tacko Fall"

Are you seriously using defensive ratings for players? Its mostly used for teams as a whole and it‚Äôs skewed towards players on good defensive teams  With that logic Kuzma is a better defender than Simmons and Seth Curry is a better defender than Paul George
Ss KD Giannis  AS Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker  The rest:  Christian Wood  Jalen Suggs  Joe Harris  Mikal Bridges  Joe Ingles  Seth Curry  Tyrese Haliburton   Jon Isaac
"Jrue Holiday, Bradley Beal, KD, Lebron, Clint Capela‚Ä¶.    7 man Bench would be TJ Mcconel, KCP, Jae Crowder, Thaddeus Young, Nerlens Noel, Javale Mcgee and Seth Curry"
He would never get the chance because they'd lose in 6 with a Wall / Seth Curry backcourt defending Trae
"It‚Äôs just a really easy comparison - he isn‚Äôt near draymonds IQ level or confidence level. He‚Äôs the closest thing philly has. Embiid guards the paint so that is similar to dray but I‚Äôm referring more to his entire game. Ben is way more draymondy than Danny Green, toby, Seth curry or Embiid is."
"To the rockets for ben simmons back + christian wood lmao. Rockets are now left without a point guard and go back to kevin porter jr whos their 1st pg right now, its gonna be a long season for houston.   Maybe seth curry can play their point"
"Anything related to anyone acting like they can predict a players peak as soon as they are drafted. There‚Äôs literally no way to know what a guys ‚Äúceiling‚Äù is until it‚Äôs been hit and he‚Äôs on the way down and probably even out of the league or retired. Players have slow starts to their careers all the time. Look at Steph Curry. Hell, look at Seth Curry! Dude has been a spot up shooter fir the most part through his career, but he‚Äôs served as a combo guard the past few years, showing that he had way more to offer than just spot up shooting, and he was probably the second best player on the Sixers during the playoffs, at times being the only player keeping them in the game.  It‚Äôs a dumb, Skip Bayless-type statement, and it usually just shows someone has no clue what they‚Äôre talking about when they say it."
"No shit.  You don't want Shake Milton, Seth Curry, or Tyrese Maxey as your primary playmaker."
Even if he's the next *Seth* Curry but taller the Raps managed a steal.
&gt; Seth Curry  Out here catching strays when my guy was barely getting run in Sacramento lol
the biggest choke is either Seth Curry in the 2016 finals to LeBron or by the Yankees up 3-1 to the 2004 BoSox.
"Idk man, Seth curry can shoot the ball reaaallly well. His brother's okay, too"
"Seth Curry is being paid half the price and the Sixers didn‚Äôt need to trade an all star to acquire him.  And any defensive advantage is minimal.  Both are bad defenders.  Beasley is a Hield level player that does one thing and not much else, he‚Äôs a 4th or 5th starter on a good team.  Plus he was just in jail.  He‚Äôs just not that appealing."
seth curry is one of the best shooters in the league and all time leading 3pt% lol.
this year it was Seth Curry üò≠üò≠
Curry but Seth
Seth Curry &gt; Trae Young
"Seth Curry, I think they will have him take more shots this season. I could see him being an 18-19 PPG scorer on good efficiency."
lol. Why doesnt the Sixers simply make Seth Curry into Steph Curry and Tobias Harris into Klay Thompson?
Seth Curry is better than him
"yo Dlo on the 6ers could be great. Goes all in on shooting/scoring around Embiid. Joel by himself is a passable defense + Green and Harris is solid enough and they have some specialists if needed (Thybulle) so I doubt defense will be a huge problem (except when Embiid sits...) and that starting 5 would be INSANE on offense. Dlo/Seth Curry/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid. You have 3 guys who can create, all 5 are respectable to great from 3, and you can spread the floor like crazy when Embiid wants to take over + if Dlo also can take over sometimes if Embiid can't for some reason.  Honestly that sounds like a load of fun please Morey do it!"
"so you trade away your best defender and playmaker to get more outside scoring, who takes his spot? maxey? seth curry?"
"First round exit in 4. This isn't the 1990s, you need 4 shooters on a team 90% of the time. This has 0.5 shooters. Replace Thybulle with Seth Curry and Gobert with like Kelly Olynyk and it's a better hypothetical imo."
"2nd round exit if Butler/Giannis can sometimes hit the 3 when their defender goes under the screen. (Although tbh where does that screen action even take place, lol)  There‚Äôs minimum contract guys you can replace Thybulle with and suddenly that‚Äôs a finals bound team. Seth Curry earns $8mil annually, which is like half of a good starter, and he‚Äôd completely unclog that offense."
The talent is there  Just get Joe Harris and Seth Curry off the bench
And we actually call Seth here as the Better Curry. Meth Curry was exclusively Tyler Johnson
"Surprised that Iguodala(5) has more than KD(3), Steph(0), and Klay(0) combined. Also that Dell Curry(1) has more than both Steph and Seth."
no cos seth curry is actually good
"CJ for Simmons is fair. Dame is worth at least Simmons, Thybulle, and Seth Curry"
No chance. Eric Gordon is a more expensive version of Seth curry at this point. He's injury prone. And so is wall.
You‚Äôre only looking at what CJ adds and not what he doesn‚Äôt.  4.7 assists is absolutely terrible.  The back court duo of him and Lillard routinely got into shootouts because of how bad they were on the defensive end. Pairing him with Seth Curry is just a terrible idea.   The Sixers aren‚Äôt sending Ben out for CJ when Brogdon is a better fit and comes with additional assets. This sub has an obsession over both the Sixers trading Ben and the Blazers trading CJ and desperately try to make a 30 year old CJ McCollum sound appealing.
"Are we sure that‚Äôs even true? The only picture of Paul George with ‚ÄúCallie Rivers‚Äù on the internet is clearly not the same woman as the one that married Seth Curry, and I‚Äôve never been able find anyone involved actually confirm that PG ever even dated Doc‚Äôs daughter, let alone cheated on her"
"From a fan perspective, I gained a lot of respect for Doc telling the truth rather than giving a canned BS answer. But I do understand your point about professional integrity. Simmons also showed a lack of professional integrity when he actively tried to *not* score points in a series where a few buckets each game likely advances us to the conference finals. Embiid was scoring 30 a night on one knee. Even Seth Curry dropped 30+ in a game to keep us in it. Meanwhile, Ben wouldn‚Äôt even look at the rim.   He may well just be in it for the money and doesn‚Äôt like basketball that much, and that‚Äôs fine. But he deserves every bit of criticism he‚Äôs getting in-house and otherwise."
"Would Seth just be another Steph then? That is to say, Steph Curry has league average defense."
"As much as I hate on the mavs, they have plenty of time. Its way too soon to call them a failure. I think they have at least 3 more seasons before they should start to feel embarrassed.    The KP gamble cost them a shit ton (lack of picks to trade, and half their cap goes to KP and THJ). But soon KPs contract will be easy to move, and they get another first to trade every year. Shiiiit, he might even have a healthy season next year for all we know.    These next three seasons are pivotal, and I think the most important thing to watch for next season is how the role players respond to kidds coaching. With what they were being paid, Lukas teammates were vastly overperforming. Was that the influence of a hall of fame head coach? Idk. Will the new gm actually commit to a vision (that Seth curry/j rich trade made no sense to me)? Idk.    But the mavs are actually trying to change things up so if I was one of their fans I would still have a shit ton of hope. I hope they crash and burn, and I think they will be a worse team next year (although possibly a better record, covid hit them hard), but they still have plenty of reasons for optimism."
He‚Äôll jam it over Seth Curry ferociously
"&gt;As someone who's kept a close tab on potential Simmons trades, I imagine that the 76ers would kick and scream to get RoCo back.  Agreed.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Ben's a flawed player, but two things he provides are wing defense and playmaking. The fact that he's a single player that can do both of those things are special. So naturally if the 76ers are looking to compete they'd probably look for a package in which they can get 2 players who do those things.     Exactly! You'd want to fill that hole if you cause it to open up.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The thing is, if the Blazers looking to retool around Dame they're probably looking to compete as well. The Blazers paid TWO first round picks for Covington already and I think there'd be a huge hesitancy to give him up.     So, my line of logic here is that   1) Dame explicitly WANTS Simmons  2) He knows their backcourt needs change  3) He knows they need another ballhandler  4) He knows they desperately need some defensive life breathed into them to pair with Billups new schemes.  This is a scenario where the FO just have to please Dame at all costs. Similar to the Bulls going all in for Lavine. There simply isn't another player on the market who addresses the Blazers weaknesses like Simmons does. If it means giving RoCo and picks along with CJ up, they do it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Granted, this is a bit easier to swallow now that they also got Larry Nance Jr, but he's not a great floor-spacer either. He's shot around 35% on 3 attempts a game the past two seasons while also dealing with injury concerns. A frontcourt of him, Ben Simmons and Nurkic would be clogged.     If the Blazers run Dame off ball more, and emulate GSW, I think that could work. It'd force defenders to step up to the level of the screen instead of sagging way back. A player movement heavy offense as shown by GSW can make clogged frontcourts work.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;As far as Seth Curry goes, I agree with your idea that if they're able to swing him you go for it but I just don't see the fit that well. But I guess he could help contend in the now or they could flip him for another first to help replenish the draft capital.     The fit here would be to make up for the lost offense. Seth is a flamethrower and had his best career year. Out of everyone on the Sixers, he can give some life to their offense best."
I'm not really interested in going team by team through the league throwing out trade examples for you to judge. I'm pretty comfortable with their being so many bad owners and front offices in the league that someone will offer something better than two downgrades for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry.  I'm done with this thread now.

"&gt;You said Embiid will have to play defense for 2 DPOYs if Ben sits. That is the same scenario with CJ.  Except there isn't 36 million just sitting there doing nothing.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And Seth Curry on that contract is NOT worth 3 second rounders wtf. Like holy shit wtf. To put your valuation of players in perspective, Steph would be worth 4 FRPs.     I've got a big surprise for you if you think the difference between Seth and Steph is just that Steph is 2.5x better....  Yeah I know you're saying I THINK that, but if we start with 3 SRP as a base, then 4 FRPs is what, twice the value for being first rounders and some more since its 4, not 3? This logic is awful.  &amp;#x200B;  It gets even worse when you realize that it's RoCo for Seth and not picks for Seth, and there's also 2 FRPs added in. 5 picks total."

Rubio - Seth Curry - Brown - Tatum - AD  That's a ring and I don't think would have been impossible to get for the Celtics.
Seth Curry with average defense.  Zion with average defense.  Thybulle league average 3 point percent.
"Dude they put Danny Green and Seth Curry on the team. Plus added Tobias Harris. Forkmas can shoot. They have plenty of shooting. Stop making excuses for Simmons. He‚Äôs a point guard. Period. He shouldn‚Äôt be playing short corner dunker lol. That should be embarrassing for him. He should be ashamed of the fact that defenders play him 3-4 steps inside of the 3pt line. That he can‚Äôt shoot free throws.   Until he learns to shoot and can put appropriate pressure on a defense, he‚Äôs going to hamper the offense. Period. Come playoff time teams will play his accordingly and will highlight his inabilities.   He comes off like a prima-Donna who‚Äôs insecure about his game. God forbid Rivers and some of his teammates demand more of him and try to hold him accountable. The reports out there seem to indicate he really doesn‚Äôt give a shit too. He‚Äôs more concerned about living somewhere he can go out at night then becoming the best player he can be.   If that‚Äôs his prerogative - fine. Different things are more important to different people. But let‚Äôs not give this guy a pass and make excuses for him. It is what it is - dude is a liability in big, important games."
"Game 7 of the NBA Finals, 4 minutes to go 4th quarter. Who do you want on the floor? Ben Simmons or Seth Curry."
"Part of the issue with players of Bens caliber is that he is way tooooo valuable of an asset to let walk over a few million, but as you said, he needs the right players to thrive. So building around him AFTER he has received his extension is hard af. Ben (35M) Tobi (35M) jojo (31M) Danny Green (10M) is already your entire cap space (112M last season).    Stretch bigs are already hard enough to find. The bjelicas, Bobby portis', ilyasovas, they cost more than that. The best stretch big youre going to find for what Philly can spend is luke kornet. I love my guy luke but you would rather have Dwight.    You gave morey some credit but not nearly enough. He turned al horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth curry. I try not to syck morey off as much as the rest of this sub, but truthfully I am not sure if many gms can pull that off."
Steph Curry Seth Curry Cade Cunningham Ed Davis Anthony Davis
I don't believe we are actually in the Simmons Sweepstakes rn. I just think the Cavs are getting used as a smokescreen though maybe they end up facilitating the deal with the Kevin Love contract. Ben just doesn't make sense unless we move all of SexLand with Kevin and get Simmons + Seth Curry + a 3 and D wing
"&gt;Not sure why you keep bringing up seth curry. We traded a player who has actual nba level skills for him. (Hence why he just got another contract) You guys traded a bust prospect who will be out of the league when his contract ends.  I'm bringing it up because no trades are equal and I'm trying to show you that but you are too arrogant to admit it.   &gt;You can paint ben as whatever you like, we both know hes 10x the player malik fukn beasley is lmao.  Malik Beasley can shoot the basketball so you know."
"Not sure why you keep bringing up seth curry. We traded a player who has actual nba level skills for him.

"&gt;If pat bev was worth anything you wouldnt have been able to acquire him with bust prospects and nothing more.  And you traded JRich for Seth Curry. So is Seth Curry equal to JRich?  &gt;Most if you wolves fans have mcdaniels on your will not trade list as well.  Because the POBO has said that he wants to keep him lol.  &gt;Beasley is a roleplayer who just got outa jail. Excuse me if i dont want him as the centrepiece to our all star guard.  He averaged 20/4/2 on 40% from deep on 9 attempts. But yeah ""roleplayer"". I can also paint Ben Simmons as a roleplayer if you downplay all of his strengths and just highlight his weaknesses like you are doing."
"&gt;So 2 picks that will be bad with ben, a guy who just got out of jail, a player whos so worthless you acquired him by trading bust prospects and MAYBE a guy who averaged 7ppg  So? He doesn't have any more time to serve and is a free man, yeah his personal life is a question mark but that has no impact on his on court production. He also averaged 20 ppg on 40% from deep on 9 attempts so you know at least mention that.  ""Worthless""? he was the 6th man on a WCF team but sure worthless. And if you are basing that on who he was traded for guess Seth Curry is worthless considering he got traded for JRich.  Do you know anything about Jaden besides his 7ppg you looked up on bbref? And again you are the ones trying to trade Simmons for Dame so who is the delusional one here?"
"Bench vs bench lineups with trey burke and seth curry going off doesnt mean much, plus it was the bubble.     The hawks are 5-4 without Trae this year, and  the mavs are 2-4 without Luka, the hawks also won a playoff game without Trae, ATL is a much better team than the Mavs."
Seth Curry is not a young player
Seth Curry seems super nice.
"kevin huerter gave seth curry 27pts in game 7, despite seth trying his darndest.  lol.  kevin huerter!"
"Giannis, AD, Embiid. Any of those 3.   Starting 5 of Luka, Giannis, Seth Curry, Hardaway Jr. and Klay Thompson would reck shit. If you think Klay may not return to form just replace him with a DECENT 3 and D, Lonzo etc. These are just some of my favorite players from around the league that I feel would complement each other well"
Yupe and Seth Curry is still among the 90% Top percentile of NBA players in term of ability and value probably .
"You don't think Ben playing like dogshit hurt the team more? Watch the clip where he passes up that open dunk. See how Seth Curry reacts lmao. Embiid is trying to figure out what the hell happened too.  Idk why y'all act like Ben is exempt from criticism here. His own shitty performance and attitude tanked his value just as bad, if not worse, than Doc's words. Doc just confirmed what everyone else was thinking. Ben set his own ass up to get roasted and traded."
I thought at first it was Seth Curry that stood up to congratulate Steph. Also the Knicks always get the 8th pick.
"It's sad how Seths career has always been overshadowed ""Seth, aka the brother of Stephen Curry"", love the video though it's really sick as a Pc gamer"
Seth Curry
"Santa Cruz legend Seth Curry.  Most veterans from the dynasty are retired. Only ex-Warriors of note are KD and Barnes, maybe JaVale."
That's why they got fired. Seth Curry with Barnes and Hardaway Jr.
Might be able to get Seth Curry in a trade pkg
Imagine your team with Seth Curry and Harrison Barnes added to it
"The Mavs Trading away Seth Curry to the Sixers for Josh Richardson and the No. 36 pick which turned out to be Tyler Bey, Seth became his brother (Steph) in the 2021 Playoffs against Atlanta (Even tho they loss the series, Seth is still Valuable for the team) will Richardson only played for 1 season for the Mavs, he just disappeared against the Clippers in 2021 Playoffs  &amp;#x200B;  Overall The Sixers won the trade and the Mavs got robbed"
"you're a casual just like op. Austin Rivers was a blue chip recruit and one of the most hyped prospects in high school and did well enough at duke to be selected #10 overall, nepotism had only a little bit if anything to do with him being in the nba. Seriously if y'all want to argue nepotism austin rivera and seth curry are terrible examples."
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson+pick
He still coaches like he has Luka and 3 point snipers like Hardaway and Seth curry lol
In my experience people shit on Seth Curry because they haven‚Äôt actually paid attention to him I‚Äôm four years and still are referencing that-era Seth. TBH to me it‚Äôs a big tell they don‚Äôt actually watch basketball.
Mavs traded Seth Curry away for Richardson.
"I pulled everyone off the NBA website all time stats page. Seems like it doesn't have everyone who played in the NBA, only players who rank on at least one of the all-timer leaders list for individual stats. It's only 674 players, but it's a good place to start. I don't know where to get the data for everyone who ever played in an easily exportable format, so this will have to do.  The player from the dataset with the highest ratio of ft missed vs. fg made is Dwight Howard at 0.585.  4046 missed free throws, 6921 fgm. Shaq (0.469) and Wilt (0.457) are both in the top 10.  At the bottom of the list, Dell Curry (0.0454) and Steph Curry (0.0472) are #2 and #3. Kyle Korver was #1 and Steve Nash was #4. Seth Curry isn't listed in the data (he doesn't rank high enough on the all time lists for any individual stats), but calculating his manually, at 0.0484 he would fall between between Steph and Steve Nash. Them Curries sure know how to shoot the ball!"
"Imagine saying no to CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons.  Like I get Morey wants to win every trade but is Simmons for CJ not a slight win for the 76ers?  And to the people saying CJ and Seth can‚Äôt play together, you realize a team can make more than 1 trade a season?  The 76ers have Seth Curry, Isiah Joe, Maxey, and a 1st that they could move to improve the roster and they still have nice depth even if they traded all 3 players for 1 player."
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
Seth Curry for Jrich lmao
"Why isn't Canon Curry in the league then? If Seth got in because of nepotism, and Austin Rivers got in because of nepotism, what about Canon?"
"Terrible example. Seth is a really good player. I can't think of a team that wouldn't add him in a heartbeat for at *least* a very prominent six-man role, and he would start on many teams. He was the sixers' second best player in the playoffs last year.  Not to mention he had to battle and grind for his spot in the league. It wasn't handed to him because he was a Curry. He was on two-way contracts and then traded around for years until he got enough minutes to prove himself."
"If something is decided by humans based on subjective qualities, its almost certainly not going to achieve close to 100% meritocratic. That being said, there are 30 teams in the league all looking for players that'll give them an edge, so if you get missed by 30 teams, you probably have talent but haven't done anything that'll differentiate yourself. People will think it unfair (and ""NEPOTISM"" they kept saying) that Warriors chose Seth, and Dlee to add to their roster, but you can also think of it as Curry, your own highly trusted player, vouch for them. And in this league you can't hide being bad like you can at work. You have to earn your stay like they have."
Seth Curry has the 2nd highest career 3P% of *all time*  This is disrespectful
yeah seems like the obvious choice would be giannis' brothers.  seth curry is actually really good
"Seth Curry doesn't make the NBA if he doesn't earn it.  Period.  But, Seth Curry has had an absurd advantage in life by being the son of a former NBA player.  Genetically, financially, and just having a Dad who can coach him up to that level.  Like Dell Curry was an amazing shooter - it's not exactly random that both his kids ended up being amazing as well.  Basically, being the son of a NBA player gives you an abnormally high chance of being a decent basketball player.  But you still need to be really good to crack the NBA.  Plenty of kids of players don't make it this far."
"Of all the people you could be shitting on, why did you choose poor Seth Curry? He's good."
"Seth curry is one of the best shooters in the nba, you think that there‚Äôs a gang of those guys just not getting a chance who aren‚Äôt even in the g-league? Get real lol"
"My unpopular opinion is that Philly may have been better off long term trading Embiid. But they would've had to act insanely fast, and that wasn't really realistic. Simmons value is so low right now that whatever you'd get for him plus Embiid most likely isn't winning you anything especially with Brk &amp; Milwaukee at peak right now. So... maybe you could trade Embiid, Toby &amp; Curry. Get a boatload of assets. Ben is still young enough that with the assets you get... he'd never have to shoot the fucking ball and could become basically Draymond.   Realize one of them has to be traded. Embiid may not age that great. You're probably not getting anything worthwhile in a Simmons trade. So kick the can down the road a few years. Trade everyone, let Ben sit out this season for some ""injury"" and hopefully Philly fans kind of cool off on hating him in that time, get an huge amount of assets for Embiid (plus a few more for Toby and Seth) and end up with a really nice pick of your own after blowing it up. In 3 years that team could be like 10 deep with legitimate players, Ben allowed to become Draymond.   It very well could have been a better long term move. If this Embiid team never wins a championship and he gets even 1 lower body injury in the next few seasons... keeping Ben probably actually does turn out to be a way better move. Great young deep team that has a longer window in 3 or 4 seasons and maybe KD is no longer on Brk and Mil isn't as good. But that was never even really on the table for Philly. They would've immediately had to side with Ben and trade Embiid... which just wasn't happening, ever.   And remember... this is an *unpopular* opinion, I'm fully aware of how it sounds. Huge, huge gamble that could've paid off. Instead of trading the least valuable asset, trade the most valuable asset and shift the contention window while also avoiding the current Brk &amp; Mil teams which they probably aren't beating with Embiid and whatever a Simmons trade nets them anyways. It *could've* worked out very nicely. Not at all realistic though"
Seth Curry replacement lite. no more sad reminders after getting rid of Josh Richardson
If Seth Curry was drafted into the same circumstance as Steph Curry he would‚Äôve been the superior player.
Defensive scheme? Yes. I watch the games though. Thybulle is their best defender with Simmons out. Thybulle doesn't start. They aren't covering for Seth Curry.
"No I‚Äôm talking about the Philadelphia #31 SG, Seth Curry, he will not miss a shot should he enter this seasons 3pt contest. Steph has a quicker release which while is useful for deeper and more contested pull up shots, doesn‚Äôt help to attaining a perfect ‚Äúno-miss‚Äù round, that‚Äôs where Seth‚Äôs consistency will be key here"
Seth Curry?
Probably the warriors  It was fun to watch them when they were incredible and I‚Äôve never disliked them but the last year or two they‚Äôve just been a non factor in my brain. I get my Curry fix from Seth these days
"Do you think it‚Äôs untrue? On the offensive end he‚Äôs literally never improved from his rookie performance. In terms of shooting, fucking Dwight Howard attempted more 3s than him last season, and he shot 34% from the free throw line in the playoffs.    He had several flaws on the offensive end coming into the league, and he‚Äôs somehow regressed even more In those areas as his career has progressed. He‚Äôs a great defender, and he‚Äôs improved in that regard, but if you‚Äôre going to be the starting point guard on a championship contender with a max contract you have to have more value on offense in the playoffs than Andre Roberson. Literally all of his weaknesses are things that he SHOULD have at least shown a tiny bit of improvement on at this point but he hasn‚Äôt. Meanwhile Embiid has completely changed his entire game to better fit with Ben and guys like Seth Curry have made massive improvements to benefit the team."
"Some of Kirk/Kent's past projects have been Seth Curry, Dedmon, Bazemore, Boucher, Nunn.  So you'd think Warrior fans would cut him a break."
This thread about is Seth Curry though?
"Even those lesser guys that get lines like that is crazy. Like it‚Äôs impressive and it doesn‚Äôt happen every day but they almost shouldn‚Äôt happen at all to what I for instance am used to seeing  Like Seth Curry scored 30+ points in a playoff game for Philly last year. If a guy like that dropped 30 in 2005 in a playoff game, I would have lost my shit"
Seth Curry is a level above all of those
Dell curry and Seth Curry?
"my guy really bout to Nick Anderson himself. If Seth Curry, Herro, Bridges, Porter Jr, Trent Jr got these type of looks they would be FEASTING"
"Giannis very easily, he‚Äôs easily my second favorite player in the league.   Apart from that I really like Jamal Murray - he gives me Baby Steph vibes, Jokic, Seth Curry, Jaylen Brown, KD and Lavine."
That's almost one Seth curry quarter
Yeah. As much as I like Seth curry. Mikal would be a crazy upgrade. Curry got abused on D in the hawks series. Every time he was on the court they screened to get a one on one against him. Gallo and huerter feasted on him. Basically when trae wasn't in the game that's all we did.
"They let Seth go twice as I recollect, should have locked him up long term and held onto him as a core piece like Barea. Sometimes you just need good players and to stop being too clever, Curry might have pushed them past Clips last year."
"No, that‚Äôs not it at all.   He‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs over. Seth Curry MVP for sure."
"This Mavs team needs a change. Maybe the change comes through play as the season goes on, but I‚Äôm skeptical of this roster, especially with how little it‚Äôs changed since last year. Still can‚Äôt believe they traded Seth Curry away."
"Embiid‚Äôs been killing it in the high post for the past few years, I meant that he isn‚Äôt gonna rack up 6-7 assists every game. Mainly because we lack smart players around him there aren‚Äôt a lot of cutters being hit off his post ups, nobody besides Seth Curry is committed to running without the ball. I think it‚Äôs sustainable if Ben doesn‚Äôt come back but if he does we‚Äôre back to whatever lol. Embiid‚Äôs connection with shooters like JJ, Seth, and to a lesser extent Korkmaz and Tobias has shown us he can have playmaking chemistry with the right guys around him. I don‚Äôt see a reason to ever put a non shooter on the floor with him again after what we‚Äôve seen from him so far."
So what I'm gathering at here is that Seth Curry should be in the MVP convo.
Seth is the Thai Curry of the NBA!
Seth Curry confirmed best Curry.   Also. Imagine trading him for Josh Richardson lmaooo
"No, but I would‚Äôve traded Danny Green and that pick to Dallas for Seth instead of to OKC for Seth. Amazing how Morey got Seth Curry."
"Warriors at 3-0 have Steph Curry and Damion Lee, so that's 6 wins between the 2 bros and Seth Curry on the Sixers are 2-1. So technically you're wrong because the Curry's have a combined 8 wins."
Seth Curry turning into prime Steph has aided him in the endeavour.
Seth Curry if he keeps putting up 25-28 points.

Seth curry
"I came in here expecting to comment good job Seth, but now I'm like WTF kinda defense was that. First 2-3 sure.... Make the shooter hit the shot.   But the guys last name doesn't need to be curry for you to go hey let's not leave the guy currently going off wide the fuck open."
I think Tobias could get his first all star if the sixers are good enough to warrant a second all star selection beside Joel. Also Seth Curry looks like Jesus out there
Seth Curry
"I love this guy. I know he's a successful NBA player, but it can't be easy to follow a multi-MVP and initially struggle to crack the rotation. Seth Curry is a certified baller who would make any team better, and he was a killer for the 6ers in the playoffs last year."
It‚Äôs so annoying how good Seth Curry is.
Seth Curry Q1: 23 points.   Seth Curry Q2-Q4: 5 points
I have been annoyed for *years* at how underrated and underpaid Seth Curry is.  Man is a *baller*.
"I'm not sure I'd count ""noticing that Seth Curry is undervalued and underused"" as genius level"
Seth curry is proof Ben Simmons can still develop a shot!
Doc loves Seth Curry more than Austin (even more so now that Curry has married Docs daughter lol)
‚ÄúSeth Curry can only run and dunk.‚Äù  Glad he‚Äôs ending these rumors
"OKC gets to face Steph ""Seth Curry"" Curry in 2 days."
Ratio + Seth is the better Curry brother
"As of 2 days ago when i looked it up, the trio of Seth, Steph and Dell Curry are a combined 42.5% 3 point shooting family on 10,933 attempts.   That is absolutely wild"
Mom can we have Seth Curry?   No we have Seth Curry at home.   Seth Curry at home:   Steph Curry
Seth 'Steph Curry' Curry
I‚Äôm a big Seth Curry fan but this is a pretty terrible take. CJ would be an all-star in the East over Simmons.
A better Seth Curry could be an All Star.
All-star capable player is just a nice way of saying he's not an all star.  CJ is just a slightly better seth curry.
I agree CJ fits really well with Embiid but I think they might need more changes at SG and SF with CJ. CJ and Seth Curry don't fit at all and Danny Green is washed.
Even if years go by (which it won‚Äôt) he‚Äôs definitely not getting fired. He‚Äôs by far the Best GM the Sixers had in a very long time. In his first year here he got rid of Al Horford and flipped Josh Richardson into Seth Curry.
Moreys one asset can‚Äôt shoot and won‚Äôt dunk. Maxey is fine for a late first round pick. Got out of horford and Richardson for Seth curry
Don't forget trading Seth curry for Josh Richardson lol. Even though I love j rich
"Jesus Christ‚Ä¶.are you a real human? You‚Äôre literally defending Seth curry and Duncan Robison being voted as better shooters than steph. Wow.   The fact that Ducan Robison received even a single vote tells you all you need to know.   While GM‚Äôs can obviously rate players skills to a degree, you‚Äôre not convincing me that they know ‚Äúwho moves fastest with the ball‚Äù to an elite level."
"CJ+4 unprotected first round picks, 4 seconds, 4 swaps, Simons, Little, and Covington, for Simmons and Seth Curry, tho idk if Morey's getting enough back on this, might have to swap CJ for Dame."
"Seth Curry shot .485 from 3, a few votes don't seem like they're outside of the realm of reality. If you're telling people to ""seek help"" because they understand that people more informed than them would have more substantial opinions, then touch grass."
"Seth Curry got a vote for best shooter - that‚Äôs literally all you need to know. The entire list is a meme and if you don‚Äôt know that, seek mental help"
"It was a question of wether he could play point guard, or would have to switch positions.   The sixers lost the hawks series, because the only player could run a pick and roll with Embiid was Seth curry.   You need a better player then curry in that role, and Ben hasn‚Äôt shown enough ability to to be able to."
i dislike seth curry for literally no reason other then that he's annoyingly good and that one curry in the league is already enough
This copium act was funny when you obsessed about Seth Curry for no reason but it's going to be a long season
 AD for Ben Simmons &amp; Seth curry confirmed /s
what about seth curry? isn't he pretty good in those spots?
a grade 2 hamstring is like a 2 month injury tops. So no he wasn't rehabbing all offseason that's a massive exaggeration. The extra pounds are clearly affecting his explosiveness and his dribble. He looks slow and sloppy. Seth Curry was taking a shit on him today
"The Nets called time-out with 5:32 remaining, trailing 98-108.      From there the 76ers were outscored 16-1, a span where they shot 0/9 from the field and turned it over 3 times. This stretch had 90% free throw shooter Seth Curry missing a free throw and 40% three point shooter Danny Green airbailing back to back threes."
I feel like literally everything went wrong for Philly in the clutch.  - Danny Green 3 air balls.  - Turnovers.  - Seth Curry missing.  - The calls.
seth curry&gt;joe harris
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Seth Curry. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting 3's on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Daddy Seth. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
harden getting locked up by seth curry?
Does Seth Curry ever fucking miss
Patty Mills is incredible.  Seth Curry is also incredible.

Seth Curry All-Defense campaign begins tonight
Lockdown defender Seth Curry is here
Seth Curry is still so underrated. He was so frustrating to play against in the playoffs
Seth Curry
Seth Curry is fucking insane
"Man speaking of Mannion, when I saw Seth have some success I thought the league would trend towards shooting being a premium (even if it‚Äôs not a guy of great stature) and that guys recently drafted such as Tyrell Terry, Mannion, and Kyle Guy would have productive NBA careers (albeit maybe not right away).  Looking back on that now is funny, Terry a FA, I think Nico is overseas, and Guy is in the G League. Looks like they all gonna have to get it out the mud Seth Curry style if they wanna make it."

"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
They didn‚Äôt trade Seth curry
#SETH CURRY
Seth Curry and GTJ
I'm forever sad that the Blazers traded Seth Curry
"**PG:** Ja Morant, Lamelo Ball, Seth Curry   **SG:** Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Lauri Markkanen   **PF:** John Collins, Evan Mobley   **C:** Deandre Ayton, Myles Turner, Clint Capela    Championship contender, idc what you say."
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"

"I think their worst move was Trading Seth Curry, other than KP..."
You're right on. Portland let Pat go the summer they extended GTR and signed Seth Curry. The Blazers didn't have any minutes available for Connaughton unfortunately
Go back in time.  DONT TRADE SETH CURRY.  Also sign an actual Center.
"knicks fan, seth curry"
Seth Curry has an extremely slow release so he mainly shoots it when he's wide open. He tends to turn down shots that are slightly contested.
We want Seth curry back! üò≠
Seth ‚ÄúSteph‚Äù Curry
"I was just looking at the $9 mil and how the Knicks could use a good spot up shooter or impact player instead of Kemba. $9 million on the open market can get you an Alex Caruso, Montrez, Seth Curry, Dario Saric--all around $9 mil a year."
"uh, what? we definitely used him as a shooter too, he just wasn't as good as he is now and we had better bench guards coming in (can't remember how the years line up, but it'd either have been seth curry or when we drafted ant simons/gary trent jr and both are/were worth keeping over pat)  i will always love patty c though, my first and only flair"
And with Seth Curry on the opposing team with more points than Steph?
Some of them are named Seth Curry.
"Seth Curry and another comparable shooter. Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, Buddy Hield, Bertans, etc."
"Schr√∂der, Seth Curry and Fred Van vleet, 3 guys who have mostly the same impact and are all paid differently IMO."
"Would he be athletic enough to thrive though? Based on what I saw of him, he would have gotten torched playing perimeter D, and didn't have the handles to do anything other than be on off guard trying to get open for 3s. A poor man's Seth Curry."
Would Stephen Curry fit on the Sixers in place of Seth Curry?
TBF Seth Curry sounds like a guy that was probably smoking weed up in the box seats all morning and probably would have whiffed it hard
Embiid: This play sucks  Wide open Seth Curry: [visible confusion]
Blame doc? Lol. all embiid had to do is pass the ball to a wide open Seth curry
"How‚Äòs it Doc‚Äòs fault? He drew up a play that got seth Curry a wide open 3, there isn‚Äòt many people you‚Äòd rather take a 3 in the NBA. The players didnt execute the play properly"
"Oh totally, it‚Äôs why NBA GMs/executives do what they do and we just talk about it.  It‚Äôs one thing to point out a hole in a team / thought / ideology / mechanism / whatever. It‚Äôs a whole other beast to recognize that flaw, then have the ability to remedy that weak point without creating more gaps or issues for the whole.  I can sit here and say the Suns need a player like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green as a PF (or even Bembry). Or say they need a Bogdanovic, Seth Curry, Danny Green as a SG. Or a Harrison Barnes, OG Anounoby, Norman Powell at SF. But how can they do that without giving up the things that make them good / or creating more holes?  That I don‚Äôt know."
HEY THAT‚ÄôS SETH CURRY OVER TH‚Ä¶.ok.
Which team is a better question. When teams play box and one against you no single defender can stop you. As far as individual defenders go Dillon Brooks does a good job and Chris Paul always turns it up against Curry. Seth Curry and Avery Bradley also do pretty well. Jrue is typically a good defender but Steph always lights him up.
"Just one. Posted up near near the basket where no one exists due to poor spacing on this doc rivers play. Whichever block embiid likes best, but left block is probably the way because they‚Äôre inbounding on that side of the floor. Harris at the top of the key and gets the Seth curry screen. Harris moves to the left wing after the screen and gets the ball from niang. Just like how embiid got the ball. Really, embiid should set a pick on the far side of the court, right wing, to free up a shooter, and then roll to the basket to post up as curry sets the screen for Harris. That way the defender on embiid doesn‚Äôt just stand in the passing lane and prevent Harris from getting the ball to embiid."
"This was probably one of the worst last possessions i've seen in a while. You have a 300 pound 7 footer who has 42 points, including going 16-21 in the FT line and Seth Curry, but the best shot you get is a contested three-pointer falling backwards by Embiid?  This is so laughably bad and probably the reason why Philadelphia won't do shit in the playoffs with or without Ben Simmons. Doc Rivers is just the worst, Joel Embiid thinks he is a guard in late game situations and they don't have a PG. Unreal how much talent they are wasting."
"I‚Äôm not an Embiid fan but he played incredible in his first game back, I do like Harris &amp; Seth Curry when they aren‚Äôt playing us. I‚Äôm just glad to see our teams play a game where we weren‚Äôt blown out by halftime."
You guys could sure use someone like Seth Curry
Your 7 foot all star can't be stopped center caught the ball down 1 at the 3 point line and proceeded to take a double teamed 3 pointer while Seth Curry stood next to him wide open.  Bad offense.
Seth curry still waiting for that ball to this day I heard
How much booty scooching went into that Seth curry screen

"His overall TS% is very average for someone who takes 15 shots a game and whose only NBA skill is being a shooting threat. Joe Harris is at 0.624, Seth Curry at 0.638, while Buddy sits at 0.569"
had open seth curry but nope lets just spin again lmao
how open was seth curry?
"Man, I want to like the Sixers because a huge Seth Curry fan but this is intolerable"
Seth Curry confirmed GOAT
"His dad probably taught them great mechanics but after that it was up to them. Steph in particular, no one in the history of the nba shoots like him. Lot of other players shot similarly to Seth and Dell.   Look at Curry shooting in 2009 his rookie year and compare it now, his form has slowly been tinkered and evolving. Give him his due credit"
Seth and Dell are elite shooters but Curry is on a different planet from even Ray Allen much less those two
"it‚Äôs cuz curry and the warriors beat the sixers practice squad (where seth curry and tyrese maxey are the best players for them)everyone was blowing up about how curry is the mvp and the narrative is ‚Äúwow look at curry for leading his team to victory after down by 19pts‚Äù. yet when the suns beat a team like the timborwolves or cavs without blowing them out, the narrative is ‚Äúwow the suns struggled against a g-league teamü§°ü§°‚Äù. the suns go on a 15 win streak which is almost gonna be a historical winstreak and ppl make every excuse they can to discredit it. i love curry and i was lokey a warriors bandwagon in 2016 but the amount of praise they get rn is annoying."
"Agreed 100%. The idea he came off acting holier than thou because he said he liked Seth curry, when he constantly admitted the job is hard and everyone makes mistakes is so funny to me"
&gt;He also loved Seth Curry and wasn‚Äôt talked to about the trade apparently.  He actually did say he was ok with that trade because he liked what Richardson theoretically brought to the Mavs. It just didn't work out and they could've gotten a different/better return.
"He also loved Seth Curry and wasn‚Äôt talked to about the trade apparently. I‚Äôll take it all with a grain of salt since he‚Äôs the type of guy who will only talk about his hits and not his misses, but I do think he knows basketball.  Just not worth the headache."
They did a release time comparison between the 3 Curry family members and apparently Dell had a faster release than both Steph and Seth
"Lol OK sure. Try Ben simmons (!) tobias Harris, Danny Green all missing major time. Seth curry has missed games as well. We essentially played without any of last seasons starters a few nights ago (and actually won). Also missed thybulle and Joe for 2 weeks. I guess operating with only 7/8 players for half the games this season is a better situation? You must only have abojt 3 players left then"
"Ingram and Zion played the same amount of games (61) last season. Zion was better (in just his sophomore season, or redshirt freshman season if you‚Äôre a philly fan). Ben Simmons is your best player until Embiid can‚Ä¶ oh wait Tobias Harris is your best er‚Ä¶ Seth Curry is your best player his jumper is always healthy!"
I saw a Seth Curry Kings jersey once in Hong Kong
"&gt; Seth Curry  Bro, Seth was a 2nd team All-American and a Duke starter.  LiAngelo played one game before getting arrested."
I love Seth Curry and have been a fan ever since he started balling on the Mavs. But he did not look at all like an NBA player at Duke or his first few years in the league and g league
"Seth Curry was able to transfer to Duke on his own accord and played 3 years there. Sure, Steph and the Warriors helped him stick in the league his first year, but literally every year after that he was on an NBA roster due to his own skill and persistence. LiAngelo didn‚Äôt play at UCLA and needs a lot more development"
"Seth Curry improved at an incredible rate in the gleague, Liangelo has to be a 40%+ shooter to even be considered"
I used to think that too. People used to say the same things about Seth Curry  I‚Äôm not sure he can make it but his summer league was way better than I would‚Äôve thought and his g league stats are much better than I would‚Äôve thought
"i think dell curry should be the SG and oubre 6th man....  i didn't watch dell curry play, I'm saying this based on that one thread debating seth vs dell, and how oubre is coming off the bench for the hornets."
Watch seth curry lmao what is this man doing
"You're insane if you think Morey is getting fired. In his first year he got rid of the Al Horford Contract, Got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson, Then got Dwight and then Drummond. That man will never see a Pink Slip from the Sixers."
"1) Fox isnt that promising, he is a chucker and poor shooter and is not playing well 2) Phillies guard rotation is beyond solid between seth curry and Maxey 3) Simmons natural position, PF, is the weakest link in the 76ers roster  Conclusion:  The 76ers would not take this deal without haliburton as well, and the 76ers would prefer a figure like KP or KAT (with a lot of oicks sent to MN) over a score first guard, which are historically overrated players"
"Maxey was an incredible pick, he traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry, dumped Horford for cheap, signed Niang and Drummond for cheap who have been huge for us. Re-signed Furk and Danny Green for cheap. Signed Embiid to a Max extension. Literally every move he has made so far has been excellent. Only question mark is Simmons"
"&gt;""I didn't \[know he was outscoring me\],"" Steph Curry admitted after the Warriors defeated the 76ers. ""He reminded me right after the game. I didn't know the stakes were so high on that shot. The game was over, and I was wide open.""  Man, I know he's also a millionaire in his own right and has it pretty sweet, but can you imagine being Seth - keeping track of every point, managing to stay ahead the whole game, getting close to the end of the game ahead...  And then not only getting beaten by one point, but Steph ***not even realising you were competing?!***"
KP is much better for us than Ben Simmons. KP shoots much better and is more willing to play based on team needs even when it doesn't suit him personally.   Seth Curry couldn't defend but he kept scoring while Josh Richardson neither learned to shoot nor remembered how to defend.
"I‚Äôm the only Sixers fan that would do it, but I‚Äôd take Hield and Barnes. I think Maxey is that dude, so getting a good wing and another heat check scorer is good enough for me. Wing is the biggest upgrade we could make to the roster, bumping Danny to the bench where he should be. And whoever starts, having Hield and Seth Curry means we‚Äôll have gravity in the perimeter at all times. Also makes end of game lineups fun. 14 seconds left and advancing it to half court? Put in Maxey-Curry-Hield-Kork-Embiid and watch them try and defend against 3 different guys who can launch from 30‚Äô no problem while also making sure JoJo doesn‚Äôt get an easy bucket and Maxey doesn‚Äôt get an And-1."
"I really think the Sixers should strongly consider a deal centered around Harrison Barnes and Buddy Hield for Danny Green and Simmons. Both great shooters and Barnes seems to be solid defensively (correct me if I'm wrong). Imagine a being able to roll out a lineup of Seth Curry, Hield, Niang, and Barnes with Embiid at center. Absolutely insane spacing.  In fact, the Kings should be the ones to reject this trade with how low Simmon's trade value is getting. But if the offer is on the table, Sixers have to take it imo. I think with the emergence of Maxey they would be fine not getting Fox."
"This is legitimately a good question. I would say this year Seth Curry is playing better than peak Dell. But for the past few years where he was still a really good role player for Dallas and Philly, was about the same level as Dell."
lmao 2015 seth curry was not going to save boogies career
As a Cousins and Seth Curry fan I'm going to continue to resent them for it
Can you imagine Seth Curry on this mavericks team? Would be insane
I really believe Bron needs to recruit Seth and make him THE Curry that gives oppositions nightmares.
"Damn, guess that means he's a worse player than Seth Curry and Buddy Hield since they can shoot threes"
"&gt; Had Seth Curry finished the game with more points than his brother, it would've marked the first time he outscored the former MVP in his career.  Lmao let him have it once Steph"
Secondary ball handler. Someone like Seth Curry comes to mind
"You said you care about their percentages of shots that come from the 3 point line.   Miller - 42% of his shots came from 3 while 57% came from inside the arc.   Allen - 39% of his shots came from 3 while 60% came from inside the arc.   Thompson - 43% of his shots come from 3 while 56% of his shots come from inside the arc.  Seth Curry - 50% of his shots come from 3 while 49% of his shots come from inside the arc. I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm surprised by this because he takes so little 3‚Äôs a game for someone who can shoot it so well  Redd - 29% of his shots came from 3 while 70% of his shots came from inside the arc  Houston - 25% of his shots came from inside the arc while 75% of his shots came from inside the arc.   Vince Carter - 28% of his shots came from 3 while 71% came inside the arc    So you were wrong again, everyone besides Curry took the majority of their shots from inside the arc. Allen, one of the greatest shooters ever only took 39% of his shots from deep. According to your logic he shouldn‚Äôt be considered a shooter.   I‚Äôm giving you examples of his shooting when he shot the same amount of 3‚Äôs and you‚Äôre saying that I‚Äôm nit picking? Lmao bruh come on man. You‚Äôre the one that only wants to look at one of his seasons compared to his career. Why don‚Äôt you want to speak about his previous season before last? It‚Äôs a full seasons worth of data? Anyone worth their damn knows you can‚Äôt just rely on the previous years data. If you could then the Nets wouldn‚Äôt have benched Griffin do to his horrible shooting this year because according to your logic last years satay is the only one that counts"
Seth Curry: ‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù

The conversation about Seth Curry was interesting. I can easily see the Sixers loosing a playoff series because Seth Curry is getting cooked but Doc keeps playing him his normal minutes
"We were fucked soon as Poole hit that half court triple, honestly. Shame we fell apart but like, this roster is seemingly being held together by the Duct Tape Duo in Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey.  Excited to see JoJo back."
Why doesn‚Äôt Seth Curry join his brother team. Seth on the second unit would be unfair.
Seth Curry too!
"Stephen couldn't let his brother outscore him, lmao. Stephen is definitely gonna trash talk during their thanksgiving meal.    Stephen Curry: 25 points   Seth Curry: 24 points"
curry nailing that 3 to keep the streak of always scoring more than seth was the icing on the cake. 16 games now
Pretty sure curry just wanted to lil bro Seth for the joke 25-24
Seth Curry drawing a foul. Home cooking.
"It's actually quite nice of the NBA's scheduling to put Seth Curry in San Francisco the day before Thanksgiving.  The Currys, the Riverses, and the Lees can all get together at Steph's place"
I really wish Seth curry was the type of guy that wanted to play with his family members rather than against them
"That‚Äôs a really dumb way to rate if someone is a shooter. According to your logic Miller, Allen, Thompson, Seth Curry, Redd, Houston and pretty much any other prolific 3 point shooter is not a shooter. They all took/take significantly less 3‚Äôs than their overall field goals attempts.   Lmao I gave you his stats if you removed his first 2 years because he played a total of 62 games and in that span he shot a total of 93 3‚Äôs. But I even gave you the stats of his most efficient year 48% on 50 attempts to this current year stats, 28% on 49 attempts because it‚Äôs the same amount of shots but a huge discrepancy in accuracy.  Caruso apparently went 3/5 from 3 today so he has shot 54 total attempts for 31%"
are seth and steph the best brother duo in nba history? and is the curry family the best nba family ever?
I know this looks like a trap game with so many outs for the Sixers and Seth Curry does well against Steph but holy shit
He really said watch me turn into Seth Curry
Seth Curry - 59.5% on 5.3 attempts.
"of course, but then you have someone like Seth Curry defending 1 of Kyrie/Harden/KD because you can't have Simmons on all 3 at the same time."
Clearly Seth is the better Curry brother
"That's why OP was asking their chances after acquiring Lowry. A Lowry, Simmons, Green, Tobias, Embiid Lineup ain't no joke along with Seth Curry, Thybulle, and Milton on the bench. AD didn't have a roster comparable to that   vs GSW. I'd still favor the nets, but its super close and probably goes to 7."
Having just Deandre isn't ideal but he's a serviceable center that can rebound and defend the paint. He isn't the worst guy to have on Embiid who will get doubled on the block anyways. They're just gonna abuse whoever they have Seth Curry on. They can put Simmons on one of their big 3 but who's gonna guard the other 2? Danny Green? Then who else? Do they start Mattise?
Trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson will do that to you
Yea but when he plays the Sixers he'll be able to stop Seth Curry and Danny Green from dominating in the post where they make their living /s
He's got shooters around him this year. Leaving Seth Curry open isn't a good idea
Seth Curry for CJ Elleby? Score!
"Maybe Ben would be looked at as a better player if he had shooters around him. Besides Seth Curry, the best spot up shooter on his team is Tobias Harris."
"Right, and that's why I said he can be Draymond on steroids because he has a better offensive skillset. In my mind, a more aggressive Ben can be Dray with more dynamic playmaking, better driving and layup package, with comparable defense.   Like many others I think Ben's skills would look better next to a real shooting threat. Like a guy who scores on higher volume than Seth Curry. Those Bradley Beal rumors, however unrealistic, had me excited to see Ben's maximized potential."
Seth Curry and Tobias Harris will unironically outscore Ben Simmons
Don't do Seth Curry dirty like that
"League average shooters but they take much higher volumes of shots than normal. And league average doesn't account for all the players that don't shoot 3pters.  Alsonignoring the original question which was how many legitimate 40% 3pt shooters there are in the league. My guess would be 15. 5 of which are stars (Middleton, Curry, Klay, PG13, then for one of the all-star pgs they seem to hover around 38-40% each year, and Kat), then you have guys like redick, Bjelica and Seth Currywho are great shooters but their defensive deficiencies may not be worth it on a team without great individual defenders. Then there are guys Buddy Hield not as bad defensively but not fantastic and are being payed like stars. So both Bogdanovics and ingles. Then you have players that some years do but some years don't like Danny Green.  My point is those guys you were talking about don't exist."
CJ Elleby for Seth Curry
TOO LATE! SETH CURRY IS BACK IN PORTLAND
Yea he‚Äôd be Seth Curry lmao
"Idk dude, I feel much better about the sixers with Seth curry and Danny green, as well as the bench shaping up. Their championship window is also still open for a long time as long as embiid doesn‚Äôt get frustrated and want Simmons traded. Harden would make this season championship or bust, and I think their defense would keep them from the chip"
didn't specify which curry- you got seth.
Seth Curry
Seth Curry
Trae can do way more offensively than Jimmer ever could. If Trae could only shoot (like Jimmer) he'd have become more of a JJ or Seth Curry type guy. But because he can also playmake and create his own shot he's earned a chance to be a primary offensive option with high volume  Jimmers ceiling was probably more like Duncan Robinson and that would have required a lot to go right for him IMO
Seth Curry wears that
"Dude it's not just 3PT shooting. We are talking about other scoring options for Embiid if he is double teamed. JJ was far better than Seth Curry in the playoffs, Butler was a far better scorer than anyone currently and yet Raps shut them down. Because Embiid doesn't pass well out of doubles and can't seem to get by Marc Gasol.  The exact same thing will happen this year against Lakers if they meet, especially since AD is far better on D than anyone Raptors had. 76ers would be lucky to get one game. Lakers in 5 at worst."
Butler in the 2019 playoffs shot 26% from 3 lol.   Seth Curry is a better shooter than JJ. He's literally 2nd all time in 3p%
I remember thinking at the time when they traded Josh Richardson for Seth Curry that must mean they really arent gonna make a move on Harden because of all this lol.   The problem is this new play in format reduces the number of teams who are gonna be looking to tank post deadline.   This will never happen but hypothetically lets say they keep Maxey would you be willing to do Maxey and Seth Curry for Aaron Gordon. I think I would.
Trevor Ariza lol. That might be the best bet. Maybe Kyle Anderson.   If there is a worthwhile wing though was just thinking Seth Curry is a good enough asset you could probably flip him and something else for it.
"This trade is about the next 2 yrs, if you do this trade it's realistically to gun for a title in 2021 and 2022. It's why PJ's age doesnt worry me as much. Finding a wing like Rondae Hollis Jefferson who can play solid defense is easy, finding a wing who can play 30 min a night after the first round of the playoffs isnt easy.   Youre higher on Maxey than me so given what you said earlier I get where your coming from.   One thing I hadnt considered before posting that comment is its possible you could flip Seth Curry and his contract plus something to get a playable wing. If that's the case then yeah I might retract what I said earlier."
Throw in Seth curry.
"I think if PJ Tucker is involved in this I would side with you on this. If he isnt.........man that's hard.   The perimeter/wing defense becomes an issue with this trade(of course you still do it but doesnt mean this isnt true). Lakers had to put AD on Jimmy Butler last year because Danny Green couldnt do it. Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Tobias Harris, James Harden, Danny Green, those are your realistic perimeter defensive options  It's close. If the cost of PJ Tucker is it requires me to give up Maxey instead of Thybulle I would do that though."
Philly with Seth curry Harris embiid harden and Danny green is the best team in the east
just wait until our lord and savior ~~Steph~~ Seth Curry comes back.
"Insert standard homer take here  But really, I think the Sixers would be more well rounded and would probably be able to retain a lot more of their depth in the trade than Brooklyn.  Seth Curry - Harden - Danny Green - Tobias - Embiid  That's not an entirely flawless lineup but damn if it doesn't have many flaws. I think the Nets would seriously lack the front court dominance that the Sixers would have"
Embiid &amp; Seth Curry
76ers don‚Äôt need him they got seth curry
"&gt; At the end of the day, a team can‚Äôt win a championship with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer and Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz as the secondary ball handlers.  Why not?   Our team this year actually built around Simmons strengths and Embiid's influence on the defense.   If Seth Curry and Danny Green get hot at the right time we are one of the best teams in the league.  Great defense and 3 pt shot making/creating with a dominant interior presence.  Meme all you want but Simmons is arguably the best player at getting his teammates good looks from 3.  The problem has always been we werent able to spread the floor enough for him to do it especially in the playoffs because him and Embiid arent a great fit.     Outside of shooting a tad bit better, Simmons is similar to Giannis.  The difference being one team has a top 3 center and the other doesnt so they were able to build a more functional team around what Giannis does."
"Dunno if you've been watching recently but yes that strategy has been working so far.   Seth Curry has been playing really well so far, and the young guys (which includes Simmons) are looking improved as well. All of that, and Embiid has been better this season with more spacing.   Rockets can take anyone on the sixers' roster, as long as it isn't Embiid or Simmons."
"I dont think you **can** add him to a team with other stars...plural.  Stars are exactly who the Rockets are gonna want in return for him. Rockets arent looking for Ben Simmons and scraps. It'll be like Simmons, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and multiple future draft picks..leaving them with Embiid/Harden and a pile of present and future shit..."
Pretty sure Michael Porter Jr. and Seth Curry are actually sick.
"The NBA is really falling short on common sense areas right now.   1. Space out the games more. You get these mass breakouts because teams are playing 3-4 times per week. One infection can spread to several teams very quickly. The NBA should know this because of the first Rudy Gobert outbreak.    When games are packed too tightly together, the virus spreads quicker.  2. Have the tests in earlier. A huge chunk of the current covid cases / potential covid cases come from Seth Curry (not that it's his fault). Seth was playing sick and they pulled him midway through the game because they got a positive test result.    The question the NBA needs to ask is, why was Seth playing if his results hadn't come back yet?  3. Be more honest and realistic about who is at risk. Bradley Beal had to isolate because he spoke to Tatum at the end of the game and Tatum ended up being positive. If Beal speaking to Tatum is enough to put Beal at risk then everyone on the Celtics should be considered at risk too, because they've all spoken to Tatum and shared a huddle with him during the game.    Right now the NBA is trying to isolate as few as possible and it's clearly not working.   None of this is rocket science. The world has had a year to learn about and understand this virus. This is simple shit."
"&gt; The Sixers do.   Who are the multiple good young players, in addition to Simmons, and what does that leave in Philly?  Harden, Embiid, and what?  Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Mike Scott?  And three (plus) team trades aren't magic.  That just means you're giving up even more, but different, assets."
"Yeah sure however you have to also realize the Sixers were without some of their key players like Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, and Matisse Thuybulle."
Seth Curry can take any player out of the court
"Regardless of seeding, I am fairly confident what will happen in the Playoffs assuming everyone's healthy. One of Brooklyn, Miami, Boston or Milwaukee are not going guard Simmons even more than they do regularly, Harris and Green are probably going to have prolonged stretches of shooting like shit because that's what they do in the Playoffs,  and Seth Curry will be targeted by KD, Butler, Tatum or Giannis and it doesn't matter how solid he is defensively, they will eat him alive. So he'll be under massive pressure to keep up his hot shooting. Embiid will average 30/10 but it's hard as shit to win as a big without at least one elite shot creator on the wing.   Look at Jokic or Davis. They've been great in the Playoffs p much their entire careers. They still needed someone else to be a consistent elite threat off the dribble to get to the conference Finals."
"I'd argue that Covid Seth Curry should be at least number 2, think about how many 76ers players he shut down by himself!"
1. Seth Curry (76ers) 2. Seth Curry (Mavs) 3. Seth Curry (Covid)
"I still don't think you guys have enough shooters around Embiid. Danny Green had a career high 9 3 pointers made (w/ 21 attempts), but I'm not sure he's going to keep that up. Seth Curry is probably going to be your most consistent 3 point shooter, likely followed by Shake.   I think Embiid is the really the future of the Sixers, not Simmons."
"&gt;Should they sit on their hands for the year and run back this same roster we've seen several times but with Seth Curry and Danny Green instead?  Yes  Seth curry and danny green were huge additions, not because of how good they are but because of how much better they fit  Last year Embiids PPG went down by 4.5 mostly just because of how badly constructed our roster was. We already look way better again this year.  I dont think theres a trade on the table for us anymore. The 6ers and Simmons are playing too well to give up a ton for Harden. I wouldnt even do Simmons for Harden straight up and the rockets obviously wouldnt do that either"
"Right I wouldnt either, but most people look up to celebrities more. They are setting a bad example, and influencing the rest of the population.      It feels like the rich and powerful have a different set of rules but they want regular people to follow the rules.      I hope the players stay safe but we can all agree that the current protocols are a joke. How can all the players be safe when Seth curry was around them the whole day? Didnt make sense at all."
"Should they sit on their hands for the year and run back this same roster we've seen several times but with Seth Curry and Danny Green instead?  What happens if they sit on their hands, Harden gets traded to idk Miami or something and then the sixers lose in the playoffs with this group anyway? Idk how many times Embiid is going to fail with this group before he asks out himself."
Hot take : Seth Curry. I want to see it
"The games they lost with Embiid are  1) against a hawks team yesterday where they don‚Äôt have Tobias, curry, Thybulle, Milton and more  2) second night of a back to back on the road with no Seth curry (leading the league with a 60% 3p%) against an undermanned Brooklyn team that I‚Äôm guessing they thought they could just sleepwalk thru  Brooklyn loss was bad but simultaneously understandable. Hawks loss is strictly covid related"
Yes he is. And thats great...you go ahead and rely on seth curry and shake milton to be the next best scorers. Ill take one of the greatest of all time in harden.
"Kyle Lowry, Matt Thomas, McCaw for Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Tyrese Maxey"
"Seth Curry has had some very good games for the Sixers, but he hasn‚Äôt scored that much yet nor have they played Portland or LAC"
I mean I get that you guys got screwed over the last two games but losing Seth Curry and Tobias Harris isn't the same as losing your best 3 players
Danny coming back to earth and we have nothing left. Seth Curry is the league MVP
Friendship ended with Seth Curry.   Now Danny Green is my best friend.
"it turns out Seth Curry is the most important player on the 76ers, his shooting really covers Ben's weakness."
"No Seth Curry, no party. Didn't expect he would be so important on Philly. He's a great player but I didn't expect him to be even more impactful than in Dallas."
"They didn't cancel Wizards games after Seth Curry tested positive immediately after playing them either.   The NBA's protocols are a joke and the older coaches, referees and staff members are VERY MUCH at risk."
And why did the Wizards play after Seth Curry tested positive immediately after playing them?   Because the NBA's protocols are a joke and they just want that TV money.
That‚Äôs not really relevant. He went back to Philly the night Seth Curry got the positive result. That was 5 days ago.
"Yeah I‚Äôve seen now that one of those 8 has at least been added now. Hadn‚Äôt seen that widely reported before but like, the contact tracing they‚Äôre doing seems very random. Embiid was visibly right by Seth curry multiple times for us and he somehow wasn‚Äôt a close contact. I‚Äôd rather they pause all the covid teams for a week and figure out those 3-4 games than have us do 3 in 4 nights with 8 players and 3 centers and a guy coming off a knee injury who can‚Äôt play a lot of mins so soon"
"That‚Äôs actually not the case, and is actually exactly why PER kind of sucks.  It calls itself an efficiency metric but really it‚Äôs just another volume scoring metric.  If you continue to score at above 33% shooting, your PER will go up.  Seth curry, a guy you described, low volume high efficiency bench scorer, always has a TS% of over .600 which is very efficient.  However, his highest PER is 15.5 because he doesn‚Äôt have the volume.   In Westbrook‚Äôs MVP year, he had a .554 TS%, which was roughly league average.  However he led the league in PER at over 30 because of the sheer volume, despite being far from the most efficient scorer.  The reason PER sucks is because it pretends to be something it‚Äôs not: an efficiency metric."
"But, you see, they can prevent every player from catching it.  The bubble worked.  They CHOOSE not to, because they wanted to make more money.  That's a choice.  Covid19 is pretty simple to understand if you already understand how other airborn transmissable diseases work.  If Seth was limiting the number of people he hung out with, wearing a mask whenever possible that he wasn't alone or playing, and making sure to practice social distancing outside of basketball related activities, he probably wouldn't have been the first person to test positive for Covid19 on the team.  These aren't complicated things to do, so I'm not sure why you think it's not as simple as that.  They can figure out where Seth got Covid19 from by doing this magical thing called CONTACT TRACING.  It's something the US should have been doing extensively as soon as the first case was detected here.  It's not magic, it's been around for awhile.  More complicated, sure, but you don't have to be the Lebron James of epidemeology to do effective contact tracing.  I'm not even sure throwing your hands in the air like you just got murdered when someone's hand touched your wrist would get you very far in the science world, to be honest.  The NBA makes billions of dollars.  The players by and large make millions.  Seth Curry certainly has the resources.  Why are you talking about the league like it's some ramshackle indie league run out of a pig pen in Argentina?  The players, AND the teams, can all be doing more to prevent the spread of Covid19, just like the country as a whole.  Assholes who throw their hands up in the air at the slightest inconvenience and shrug and say ""It can't be done"" afterwards are the reason so many people are dying in the US from Covid19.  Seth Curry isn't some mindless animal controlled by instinct.  He's an intelligent human being who is capable of making intelligent decisions and being responsible for those decisions.  Stop treating him like he's less than that.  And maybe you're right, maybe it wasn't Seth first.  So why don't you want to find out who it is so your TEAM doesn't end up having to play with a reduced roster and lose games.  These are solveable problems and NBA teams have the resources to throw at these problems."
"&gt;Irving not taking COVID seriously is going to eventually shut down the NBA again.  Highly doubt that, Seth Curry tested positive while on the bench and nothing outside the protocols happend so I doubt that Kyrie being an idiot is gonna do something."
"Just for kicks, Kyle Kuzma shot 54% on corner threes last year.  Curry hasn't been near that in six years, and only exceeded 40% once in the past four -- so I'm pretty sure whoever it is, it isn't Curry.  Thompson has only broken 50% from the corner once, years ago.  Right now, it might actually be Seth Curry, who's at 83% so far this season."
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
"Probably cause they were quarantined in New York and behind on their normal schedule.   Also the biggest issue isn‚Äôt the injuries IMO it‚Äôs that they were sitting on the bench right next to Seth Curry but were not ‚Äúclose contacts‚Äù because it was a game environment.   Just seems stupid and I think the Celtics game should be postponed, as should all games where half the team has or has been exposed. I‚Äôd hate to be the team playing against the COVID riddled team too"
Kemba  Seth Curry  TJ Warren  Millsap  Gobert
Embiid was sitting directly next to Seth Curry without a mask 5 minutes before he found out about the positive test.   If that doesn‚Äôt qualify for ‚Äúcontact tracing‚Äù idk what does
"Like OP said, the inconsistencies of contact tracing is a huge part. Seth Curry is next to Embiid when he discovers he has COVID, but Embiid isn‚Äôt placed under the protocols? And that‚Äôs just one example. So inconsistent in everything, this is bad"
"we are arguing we should have also been down our whole team.  Seth curry played the game the previous night with all these guys, embiid literally dapped him up and then touched his face twice and hes not in close contact?  Then hes on the bench for the first quarter the next day talking to embiid and everyone else.  They then finished that game once he tested positive and then made us play 36 hours later with 7 people.  It is a complete joke"
"Kevin Durant: in contact tracing for 5 days because he was with an unknown person who is positive  Bradley Beal: in contact tracing because he chatted with Tatum after the game  Joel Embiid: rubbed his hands on face after dapping up Seth Curry, sat next to him on the bench, shared a locker room with him, not in contact tracing   &gt;just going by the standards they set up bro"
"this is true, but it's also bs that joel got cleared for the game in the first place. there's a video of him dapping up seth curry (covid-positive player) and then wiping his face after  i'm not an expert on contact tracing nor do i really understand the league protocol on it, but it seems weird as hell that he was one of the players cleared for the game"
Game the System is exactly what the NBA did clearing Embiid and Simmons to play so we could have just the amount of players available so that they didnt have to reschedule when Embiid was sitting right next to Seth Curry at the exact moment his positive test came out and both him and Simmons were seen handshaking him. Both being cleared for the day after juust so the Sixers could field a team is straight up bullshit
bro [this happened a day before Seth Curry tested positive](https://twitter.com/KyleNeubeck/status/1347959081554878470) and yet Embiid was cleared to play against Denver because he tested negative the next day.
"This seasons done already imo. Not enough defense or shooting. They need a JJ Redick, Seth Curry type"
I'd add Jordan Clarkson and Thomas Bryant to your list of unexpected gems drafted by the Lakers. Even Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk may continue to develop into something special as a sharpshooter a la Seth Curry in this league.
"The list of the most accurate 3 point shooters goes as follows  -Steve Kerr -Seth Curry -Hubert Davis -Drazen Petrovic -Duncan Robinson  Though it is still early in your career, how does it feel to be apart of such an elite group, and how do you manage to shoot at such a accurate rate?"
&gt; D'lo can't really shoot  Lol. He's one of the best iso scorers in the NBA while Seth Curry a catch and shoot guy who is worthless if he has no one to create for him.
Lmfaoooo I'd rather have seth curry.  Dlo can't really shoot and definitely can't defend a parked car.
\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle
"Zach is a better shooter in a vacuum but a lot of people are. I think he‚Äôs talking abt tatums incredibly high release point plus his footwork, he‚Äôs a threat to score at literally any time. Kinda like KD, I mean Seth curry is def a better shooter than KD, but if I need to get a shot off..."
"Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Danny Green are all starters along with Embiid and Simmons."
"We've gotten rid of a *lot* of G League / 2-way talent that went on to have great careers. Boucher is just the most recent in that line. Morrow, Tolliver, Dedmon, Watson spring to mind. Hell, Seth Curry was a G League call-up with us originally. Also, Damion Lee was called up from our G League affiliate, but by the Hawks. Same with Kendrick Nunn to the Heat."
Seth Curry is now the best Curry
Flynn's best comp is Curry. hopefully somewhere between Steph and Seth
Seth Curry
I think this award should be for players like Elfrid Payton and Seth Curry. Not 2nd or 3rd year players who just got more playing time.
Absolutely Terribly. Today‚Äôs decision to postpone the Heat/Celtics was the first RIGHT move.   The fact that Seth Curry found out he tested positive during the nets game and nothing was said until WAY later at night and the game wasn‚Äôt stopped on the spot is a mess.   These guys are just spreading it among themselves both traveling and on the court. Fucking disaster
"This is a post about how great the Mavs defense has been so far, partly due to swapping defensive liability Seth Curry for a great wing defender in Josh Richardson. It was absolutely the right move for the Mavs (and for the Sixers too)"
"&gt; The CDC's primary -- or hell, secondary, tertiary, or almost any-ary -- responsibility right now should not be babysitting any professional athletes. &gt;  &gt; Yes, I seriously think that the CDC is not micromanaging the NBA's virus control right now. They have much more important work to be doing.  Who the fuck is talking about babysitting or micromanaging? I'm simply saying they are in constant correspondence. Anything else would be ridiculous. You insinuating otherwise makes you look like such a fool. I'm not saying they have a CDC employee for every player in the league working with them. Just that they are in contact with some from the CDC and local health departments about current changes in guidelines. For example when fans are allowed in arenas and such. This obviously also includes reporting of test results and contact tracing endeavors. This is honestly not that difficult of a concept to grasp?!  &gt;""Everyday testing"" that clearly isn't fast enough, as we saw with Seth Curry. Making it completely irrelevant.  how does it make it completely irrelevant? Literally my first comment to you hinges on the fact that teams abide by social distancing rules when not engaged in activities on the court. And **obviously** everything going well hinges on the fact that these cases are found quickly.   This doesn't mean the protocols don't work. Do we know Seth infected anybody? Unless we do you are just talking out of your ass.   If they had not been tested this wouldn't have been found and it could have spread like wildfire. Isn't that proof that the protocols work as intended?   &gt;And all requirements are not being met,   For like the 50th time. The requirements put on the NBA by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being followed otherwise they wouldn't be allowed to play any games. They are literally the highest authority right now and would ban the NBA from continuing the season if they weren't being followed.   &gt;and outbreaks are becoming a daily occurrence.  individual players testing positive isn't ""outbreaks"". At this point there is zero evidence that there is a spread happening between teams. Several players going into health and safety protocols due to positive tests and contact tracing was expected due to the current situation in the US.   &gt;You've been wrong about nearly everything you've written  Well no."
"&gt;Well then you have an issue with the CDC and not the NBA lol And they 100% have correspondence with the NBA all the time. It's honestly ridiculous that you would believe otherwise. Like you seriously think they just let the NBA do their thing?  The CDC's primary -- or hell, secondary, tertiary, or almost any-ary -- responsibility right now should not be babysitting any professional athletes.  Yes, I seriously think that the CDC is not micromanaging the NBA's virus control right now.  They have much more important work to be doing.  &gt;It explicitly contains the CDC procedure for the general public that doesn't have access to everyday testing.  ""Everyday testing"" that clearly isn't fast enough, as we saw with Seth Curry.  Making it completely irrelevant.  &gt;The NBA along with sports leagues across the world have worked with local health departments and have come to the conclusion there would not be an increased risk of mass spreading the virus while playing their sport if all requirements were met.  And all requirements are not being met, and outbreaks are becoming a daily occurrence.  &gt;I evidently need more bold to get all of this into your thick skull.  You've been wrong about nearly everything you've written, so that'd be a better place to start than with your typeface."
"Embiid got cleared to play despite video evidence of him high fiving Seth Curry and rubbing his hands on his face immediately after.   &gt;inb4 ""but he tested negative""   so did Kevin Durant and he still wasn't cleared for 5 days"
Dude. They have players who were around Seth Curry all day playing two days into the incubation period.   It's a farce.
Lmfao.   Seth Curry was with our team the ENTIRE day. Traveling with them. In the hotel with them. Lol.
"I think the rapid spread for team to team that we are seeing is proof that their contact tracing is poor at best, and straight up negligent at worst.   Additionally, Seth Curry traveled and was with the team positive with Covid literally all day.   The entire team was exposed. The NBA is making irresponsible decisions based on who is *more* exposed than others.   For a league that is supposedly so woke and cares about its players, I find it beyond hypocritical and also not surprising.   Silver is and always has been a virtue signaling fraud."
&gt;	Sixers. He was the only reason why they didn't suck last year.  Didnt realize Seth curry was our franchise player and not luka doncic
*Danny green is subbed in for Seth curry.* Every other team in NBA: PACK THE PAINT
idk if his athleticism would be great today. i could totally see him being a seth curry type player though.
Tack Fall and Seth Curry
How did Seth Curry only have 2 points with 30 minutes of playing time?
Unless your name is Seth Curry
This was far from the sixers best game of the season. Seth Curry didn‚Äôt do anything and the bench barely scored.
"Coming into the season I would have said a little more talent, but configured better with defense for clutch minutes, playoff intensity, etc. which is the ultimate goal thus I was happy with it.   And admittedly just the party line.  For extra unrequested thoughts on the Mavs so far I just ended up writing out at 1 AM in a post game thread  no one will read...  \- We did get an extended look at some of the depth signing, rookies, etc. with this outbreak.. and unfortunately it was pretty ugly.  Not looking great for any big surprise rotation contributions this season even if they do fine back in their limited minutes.  \- Beyond losing Seth Curry, having so much of the existing roster coming off career 3P% years I was worried the regression would swing the shooting too far down.  The hope was Luka/KP could have minor gains to offset any regression there on larger volume, and the early returns are.. not good.  As young as he is, on the sheer sample size at this point I'm just accepting Luka is who is from three for the immediate future and hoping something clicks at some point in his career.  \- I'm also concerned at how KP is moving right now.  He's a step slow going after offensive rebounds, rotating to help, etc. and it's hurting.  He's 2 weeks back from a knee surgery so it's not actually damning yet, but with his health record every concern is elevated.  \- For a positive, I really do think Luka has shown some areas of improvement that are good to see.  There was a nice stretch in early January where he was looked out right good defensively.  I think his effort as far as scrambling, staying in front of quicker guards, etc. is down lately, probably just tired being asked to do so much - but he's still playing smarter on that end.  Better positioning to cut off drives in advance, hands in the passing lane, picking his spots for a block here and there, etc...  finding ways to at least contribute on that end without expending much energy.  He's focusing a lot more on mid-range shots lately, and while I kind of suspect his percentage there will fall and I won't want him doing it too much.... it's still a good option to have while he's struggling with his 3, for clutch situations, games like tonight where he can't get into the paint as easily, etc.  All that aside, the season so far has just been in too much disarray to actually judge the core rotation and how they will mesh when healthy and rolling.  I still have a pretty positive outlook on that, if it actually happens."
"You‚Äôre overlooking the 2020-1 Sixers: 3x DPOY Dwight, 3x NBA Champion Danny Green, with 2x MVP (2021,2023) 3x DPOY (2021, 2023-2024) Embiid, DPOY (2022) Ben Simmons, 2025/2027 MVP and scoring leader Shake Milton, 2026/2028 MVP and 2032 MIP Tyrese Maxey, all time 3pt leader at retirement (2033) Seth Curry, and 6x Emmy-nominated James Michael Scott, OBE."
"They traded Seth Curry to the Sixers. He was the only reason why they didn't suck last year. Now, they are back to sucking."
WTF? Seth Curry was given the assist for that play. Tobias hesitated a moment then took three dribbles of on his drive. The nba assist stats really are inflated.
"LeBron realised that he fucked up at the moment when he's sagged off, let Tobias Harris getting Caruso (4 inch taller and 50 lbs heavier, it's too much for him) and iso 1vs1 on Caruso. He left Seth Curry wide open and tried to double Tobias Harris but it's too late. To be honest, 76ers drawing up a play is pretty good and it's much better than Brett Brown"
"Sixers winning this game wasn‚Äôt a surprise. An absolute elite team and anybody who disagrees haven‚Äôt been watching much Sixers basketball this season. Embiid is top two for the MVP (so far) this season and he‚Äôs not two. Ben is playing elite defense and getting his teammates involved in all aspects of the game, even without shooting jumpers (as a Sixers fan it makes me mad he hasn‚Äôt expanded his game, so slander can be made here) but if slander is made, at least acknowledge how valuable he is in other areas of the game as well. Tobias is playing arguably his best career basketball. Seth Curry is lights out and shooting career highs. Shake Milton is a 6MOTY candidate, if not front runner. Dwight Howard is adding a much needed spark in the absence of Joel when he is on the bench.   And last but not least, our commander Doc Rivers is the much needed coaching expertise our young core needed. Sixers by an absolute million and I‚Äôll see you guys in the finals.  Edit; Sixers are an elite team barring any major injuries to Ben Simmons or worse, Joel Embiid, since he is the heart and soul of this squad."
Free Seth Curry he‚Äôs trapped in philly.
Seth Curry had 2 points ü§∑
Seth curry scored 2 points? Is he usually this wack?
Bruh I fuckin love Seth Curry.
"Hm if they don‚Äôt switch it, Seth Curry gets a pretty open 3. Tough decision to make"
No because seth curry is on his team and they cancel each other out
Does ~~Seth Curry~~ Tobias Harris have the best contract in the league?
Lol Seth Curry?
Doc so dumb not running Warriors like set to free up Seth Curry!
Seth Curry make my peepee hard
The rare Seth Curry jump ball lol
Seth curry is a bucket
"It was relevant because you made it with your bad information about no one being in protocol until 1/12 on the Wizards.  I was aware that's not true, so I said something.  As for what the other implication, it's proof that the day before your team played a team that had players with covid on it.  Jason Taytum absolutely tested positive.  Seth Curry also got covid after playing your team. You're a fan of contact tracing, you do the math.  Neither Avery Bradley or Seth Curry are known for going out and partying.  No one is blaming the Wizards, but you can't prove they didn't give it to the Heat."
"Better finisher =/= raw percentage at the rim.  If he's taking tougher shots, then it's reasonable for him to make less of them. It's like saying that Seth Curry is a better shooter than Steph because Seth has a higher percentage.  On the other hand, I'm really skeptical that Zion is a better finisher than Giannis."
It‚Äôs literally 15 games into the season. Do you think Seth Curry will continue shooting almost 60% from three too?
Like Curry is a solid player but he's not as good as his brother Seth
"Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, and Steve Kerr also need to be talked about in here as well."
Bet you wouldnt say this the game after seth curry tested positive for covid.   Beal and tatum dapped up after a game and tatum tested positive for covid a day after that.  There is logic in taking extra precautions and its done for a reason.
"The average FT% last season was 77.3%. So .773^3 is 46.1%, which is a higher mark than Seth Curry (or Steph Curry for that matter) has ever had in any season."
"NBA FT% is ,~76%. Using that as the average, chance of hitting 3 in a roll is .76^3 which is 44%. Seth Curry had shot 45% from the 3 for 3 seasons now.  That said if you defending guys that shot in the upper 70s in FT, I think you foul because the probability of them not awarding 3 FT weights the math in favor of fouling."
Tyrese Maxey and Seth curry
Wasn't Seth Curry sitting on the sideline with his team while he was positive for COVID like... a week or two ago?  I wouldn't say the masks are entirely for show.
"Lakers: Caruso, we'll give you a bonus if you shoot better than Curry this year.  Caruso: Steph? No problem  Lakers: Seth  Caruso: Fuck"
seth curry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time.
seth curry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time.
this high camera angle makes seth curry look like an actual dwarf
when did Dort and Seth Curry end up on the same team?
"Exactly.  I also didn't include guys like Jeremy Lin, Seth Curry, Bazemore and Justin Holiday as they really didn't get much playing time with us.  We would also have to look at guys who didn't pan out such as James Michael McAdoo, Jordan Bell and Festus Ezili.  I really think Javale is the best example.  Player who wasn't doing well, came here and got some big contracts after he left.  I love Javale, btw!"
Seth Curry effect too
"When did I say lebrons was better? You were putting the mavericks on a pedestal. I'm merely pointing out they are a mediocre team.   Hardaway Jr was a salary dump by the knicks in the KP trade. Seth curry bounces around to a new team every season, trey burke was picked up off waivers. Klieber is a back up center. These are average level players who are no better than 80% of the rest of the nba teams. Carlise is a good coach sure, but stop acting like this is some dream team supporting cast. Its no better than what zion has in NOLA"
"Signing several 3 point threats (Seth Curry, Danny Green) and replacing a coach that was only there to tank has unlocked this team. Who would've thought?"
"I‚Äôll double-down on my point.  He‚Äôs 28 and having a really really bad year and worse thing is he‚Äôs getting paid 24m.  He‚Äôs too old to be rebuilding with a young core to meet their timely e and contenders can‚Äôt afford 24m for his limited skill set.  Sure he can help teams within 8-12 seed like the Knicks or Magic, but why would they give up young core or future 1st round picks, how does it help their future to win the championship?  Buddy might be an elite shooter but lacks consistency in finishing at the rim 43% last year and 37% this year He also lacks ability to get to the line averaging &lt;2 FTA per game, this shows in his true shooting % which is extremely low for a guy who is an elite shooter.  His defence has been arguably his weakest points, having one of the worst defensive BPM and defensive rating amongst the Kings roster in the last two years.  RAPTOR impact metrics put his season currently at 224th out of 250 players who played over 200 minutes or bottom ~10% of the league this year. It‚Äôs scary and contenders aren‚Äôt going to risk it.  If you‚Äôre getting paid that much on a team trying to contend you should be either 2nd option like CJ, Kemba/Brown or 3rd option with elite defence or other skill sets  like Jrue Holiday and Ben Simmons.   To put it in an example, 76ers could use shooting but they‚Äôll have to give up something like Danny Green + Seth Curry (having a career year) + young asset in either picks or Maxey, Shake or Thybulle? Hard to make an argument for any package for Buddy   Money‚Äôs tight when going for the chip."
Boban with Seth Curry shooting plz
Not just Embiid. It was wildly apparent from the  tip that Curry opens Simmons up to be another level of player. Ben has been ugly at time over the last two weeks‚Äî all while Seth was out with covid.
Doesn‚Äôt even matter dumbass coach bud gonna have Giannis guard Seth curry or some bullshit
He‚Äôs been more aggressive and the paint is much more open with Shake improving year after year plus the addition of Seth Curry. Also Tobias actually playing well.
Yeah a deadeye shooter with defensive questions is exactly the guy you want to pair with two all-defense level talents in Simmons and Embiid.  Throw Seth Curry out there and make them earn their contracts on the defensive end
"I mean he‚Äôs not entirely wrong, but it‚Äôs definitely a combination of both. Horford absolutely wrecked our spacing and we basically swapped him and Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and Danny Green in the starting lineup"
"Our offense wont be the same lmao, are you even watching us? Embiid looks way better and he was already a top 10 player. Then we replaced Al Horford and J Rich with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Dwight. We're  a way better team."
"And this is probably our biggest improvement over last season.   Brown used to need other guys on the floor to at least create some space. Tatum was our only guy who could carry the bench. Otherwise, he'd get trapped and turn the ball over.  Now he's scoring +25 a night while sharing the court with Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and two centers on the floor.  I didn't really agree with Boston focusing purely on shooters in the draft, but watching what the Jays are doing without any spacing makes it clear.   These two with a Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Buddy Hield, JJ Redick, etc would be absolutely unreal."
Danny Green and Seth Curry change things.  Shake Milton will have his nights.  Furkan can get hot.  We just have more shooting now.
Seth Curry
"just wait until seth ""the better curry brother"" curry is back in shape"
Good to see Seth Curry back
"Replacing Horford with DG and Seth Curry makes Sixers legit contenders in the East. If opens up Embiid‚Äôs game soooo much. He‚Äôs showing how much he was getting held back by Horford.   Having Tatum back will give us a much better chance, but IMO Sixers are legit. Better than the Bucks."
seth curry is better than jrich
Seth curry changes the entire identity of this team. I don‚Äôt think people realize how valuable he is to the Sixers. And he‚Äôs making 8 mil a year for the next 3 years. Truly a win win trade
"Replacing Horford with DG and Seth Curry makes Sixers legit contenders in the East. Having Tatum back will give us a much better chance, but IMO Sixers are legit. Better than the Bucks."
Alongside Seth Curry
Danny Green and Seth Curry aren‚Äôt in his way like Horford and Josh Richardson were last year too.
Doubling off Seth Curry is always a smart strategy
Seth curry is the best player to ever touch a basketball
It‚Äôs crazy to see these high numbers thrown around when the Mavs signed Seth Curry to a 32 mil/4 contract just a year and a half ago. Pure shooters are getting paid more and more now
" Wardell Stephen ""Dell"" Curry  Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II  Seth Adham Curry  One of these is not like the other"
"If Seth Curry is on the court, he just increases the offense for both teams, he helps the Sixers offense and he'll help the opponents offense.   If he is on the court in closing 5, James Harden/Jayson Tatum/Jimmy Butler etc. will force a switch and get him onto them and he will bleed points.   I've seen this happen to my own damn team, Kemba got hunted by Jimmy a bunch last year."
Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre being slept on but I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that the national sports pundits don‚Äôt watch them. Yesterday on First Take they kept talking about Seth Curry but failed to mention he hasn‚Äôt played in 2 weeks lol
"I feel like the Sixers should lean on Seth Curry more as the PG, Ben in the ""Draymond Green"" role &amp; of course, Embiid being Embiid... may not win as much but I think Curry being the primary ball handler will translate better in the Playoffs which we all know is more halfcourt centric"
We had the best offense in the league last season. I don't think the difference between Seth Curry and Josh Richardson would take us out of the top 10.
I think you guys will look way better once Seth Curry comes back consistently.
"Seems like Lavine would be the most likely scenario with Dallas being his likely destination. A package of THJ, Dorian, possibly one more role guy and some picks thrown in there. Can‚Äôt see them moving Josh Richardson yet. Seems like they figured tyrel terry would be their new Seth curry but hasn‚Äôt gone exactly to plan. Lavine seems like a potential solution.  Dark horse; oladipo at discount price due to his expiring"
"You could say below average efficiency for his rookie season, and probably year 2, but he‚Äôs increased his percentages every year, and i at this point I think your view of Mitchell is misinformed. Context matters, otherwise you could cherry pick players like Seth curry and say they‚Äôre the best in the league I mean his ts% is almost 80 right!  Mitchell at this point is slightly above average efficiency on volume with. 31.6% usage rate. He‚Äôs the primary option on offense and his team has never missed the playoffs.   Crazy there‚Äôs still room for growth for a 24 year old in his 4th seasons"
And the Nets game was away game on a back to back with Seth Curry literally testing covid positive mid game.

"Austin Rivers has NBA parents.  He isn‚Äôt Steph.  Seth Curry has Steph‚Äôs same parents.  He isn‚Äôt like Steph. Bol Bol‚Äôs dad played in the NBA, he isn‚Äôt like Steph.  Saying that Steph is who he is because his dad played in the NBA is attempting to diminish the work that Steph has done himself. He earned what he has.  The greatest ever, Michael Jordan, had 2 sons who played basketball and weren‚Äôt NBA players.  Steph had to put in the work himself."
"This isn‚Äôt about all athletes in the world, just NBA players.  So why would I compare to ppl like you who are slow and out of shape when this conversation is specifically about NBA players?  Having NBA parents didn‚Äôt make Steph what he is because Austin rivers, Seth Curry, Bol Bol, etc all have parents who played in the NBA but they aren‚Äôt what Steph is."
Should I be concerned about Seth Curry being kept in a box during the day?
"I should, first step probably wouldn't have been putting Seth Curry back on the bench with an inconclusive test."
"Wonder how many attempts Seth Curry has, he‚Äôs shooting like 60% from 3"
Yeah but who's to say Seth wasn't a lil hellion. He might've been breakin' curfew every night and prom was the straw that broke the camel's back. He probably a lil chump and miss curry had to teach him some respect because he already knew how to play basketball.   &amp;#x200B;  I know there's a 0% chance of this being true but it was nice to think about.
"Embiid looks awesome, I don't trust anyone else in that roster besides Seth Curry, including Doc Rivers, that can beat any some of those contenders because of the Embiid match up problem, it's also easy to front him/double him with a total non shooter on the court in crunch time."
Seth Curry
Mavs got worst in my opinion losing Seth Curry will keep them as .500 team
"Tatum is a perennial all star with mvp potential.  You understand its *Seth* Curry on your team, not Steph, right?"
Tatum wipes his ass with seth curry
You forgot we were missing the best shooter in the league in Seth curry or???
"Duncan Robinson, PJ Tucker, Ben McLemore, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, JJ Redick, and basically any 3 and D player. It‚Äôs a literal role lmao.  As for stars, Harden in 2019 and 2020 literally shot more 3s than 2s. Another example is Steph, Dame, etc.  Not only that, but the league as a whole is trending towards more 3s and fewer 2s every single season.  There is no good argument for the usage of FG%. Not only is it terrible at measuring actual scoring efficiency, it‚Äôs also really redundant.  If you love the FG stat so much, you can just add up 2P and 3P attempts. It requires kindergarten math."
"I've been having a good time watching the Celtics lately.   Also like the Heat, &amp; enjoy watching Sixers more now that they've added Blazers Legend Seth Curry."
You mean seth curry? Austin rivers hasn't tested positive for anything
Does Seth Curry not qualify?  I wasn't able to find his TS (probably cause of volume with him missing a ton of games)
Seth Curry cash from 3
Same. Amazing how replacing Horford with Danny Green and Seth Curry (i know he didnt play but still) has opened up so much of Embiid‚Äôs game.
"we‚Äôre missing curry, who‚Äôs shooting 60 percent from 3 and having a career year. tatum is obviously waaaay better in a vacuum but curry has had a crazy impact on our team this year. i sure wouldnt call it healthy. tatum back doesnt stop embiid though.   hopefully tatum and seth are healthy friday so we can see a real match up"
One is a future HOF and the other is the older brother of Seth curry
"Seth Curry is averaging 17 a game on .796 TS% this season. If he continues to keep that up (he won‚Äôt), the gap between him and Tatum isn‚Äôt as big as you think."
"Wdym our best player, Seth Curry was out /s"
"Like, you‚Äôre right, and I‚Äôm not as salty as I was 10 minutes ago lol, but to be fair missing Tatum is magnitudes different than missing Seth Curry."
"Devin Booker, Bradley Beal &amp; Seth Curry"
"I think you mean the superior Curry brother, *Seth*"
We had 30m that same year and brought in Seth Curry and Delon Wright
"Feel like this could refer to Luka, KP, or Seth Curry."
"Yeah, FVV is good, but he's only $5 million/year cheaper than Jaylen Brown, and FVV's contract has a player option in the last year.   Dudes ring chasing on 1 year vet mins should probably be excluded from ""best contract"" discussions though (as well as rookie/max contracts that are artificially limited). Frankly, I don't think any 1 year deal can be in contention for ""best contract"", but especially for guys like Batum, it's not really a fair representation of his actual free agency value.   Dort, Brown, and Seth Curry are my 3 ""best contracts"". I love the Grizzlies books overall, but no single contract sticks out to me as being especially good."
"Klay for me, but yea PG13 has an underrated shot, KD too IMO when he is shooting off screens, Seth curry, Ray, FREDDY V"
"On the opposite end I remember when people said Seth Curry was only in the league cause of nepotism, now it‚Äôs not even a question that he‚Äôs definitely NBA caliber."
Seth Curry pump faking us into a loss
Seth Curry does not need a hook shot in his shot selection lol
What an incredible drive by Seth Curry
"Seth Curry missed 2 FTs today, so I guess I really shouldn't be too surprised that Texas froze over."
Did you know Seth Curry is the only player named Seth to ever play in the NBA?
Shooting even 35% from 3 on the degree of difficulty of Lebron‚Äôs shots DOES make him a great shooter. He‚Äôs just not an elite one like Seth Curry or something.
‚ÄúSeth Curry 4 MVP‚Äù
"To be honest, Sixers won't want Harrell and won't give away Seth Curry."
"I don't disagree but we got 0 positive benefit from the trade and sold for pennies on the dollar.  At least with the Jimmy trade, we got to see one of the best and funnest Sixers teams ever. Joel learned a lot from Jimmy, and we got J-Rich to Seth Curry out of it."
"I really don‚Äôt have a doubt he‚Äôs gonna feast, but the Nets scoring just scares the shit out of me. Seth Curry gonna get destroyed on D in the playoffs, and some nights Danny Green can‚Äôt guard a fucking traffic cone"
"Having watched good amount of sixers games this season I would have to disagree. Yes he could have improved more , and there's alot of room for improvement, saying that he hasn't gotten better at all is a bit extreme. On post up's alone this season, he has taken a massive step forward. I believer this season he's in the 78th percentile for post up's (Ill try to link the source if I can find it, but I believe that stat was from a YouTube video) . He also has pretty good right hook that he goes to often (but given his total  attempts per game doesn't seem as much if you casually watch his games). Also he's his touch near the rim has seen constant improvment this season alone. He's also a hell of alot better finishing with both hands, in seasons prior he would almost exclusively finish with his right now. Yeah he hasn't take a  massive leap offensively but he has seen steady improvement. But with embiid, Tobias Harris, and seth curry in the lineup, it would be foolish to have ben be a focal point in terms of scoring when he can better put his energy everything else he does on court. If you look at the games he's out, you can tell that  alot  of the things that Ben brings to the table, Philly lasts elsewhere on the squad. People want him to be lebron, but he's filling the mold of a super draymond with hints of magic."
"With the way Seth shoots too, even though there's clearly natural ability involved, Dell Curry should be richer than Steph... from setting up training camps and courses on shooting the ball lmao. I think there was a summer when Steph was a teenager that Dell [helped him change the mechanics of his jumpshot](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/2/12/18221183/steph-curry-warriors-2019-all-star-game-charlotte)"
He's obviously talking about Seth Curry.  Embiid is lucky he doesn't have to face him or it would be clamps every night.
"AD has only missed 7 games. You also shouldn‚Äôt ignore that earlier in the season the Sixers lost half of their  lineup due to COVID tracing to the point where it was Embiid and the 9th-15th man available. Seth Curry and Shake Milton have also been out for extended periods of times as well. Those guys obviously arent as valuable as Davis, but we lose the only players we have to run PNR"
"Not sure, because Clarkson and Curry shot basically the same amount of FT (Seth shot like 44, Clarkson like 48)"
Seth Curry is at 98%
"AD is also out. Bron sitting and a Bron-AD less Lakers will be pretty inferior to most teams most of the time  It's not an argument FOR Bron as much as it just shows how much the supporting cast is underperforming  Same goes for the Sixers tbh, a 1st seed with Ben, Tobias and Seth Curry shouldn't be 1-5 and overreliant on Joel. Yeah that's a good case for him but not that good for championship aspirations"
"4.4 per game on 41% is what I view as the best year for Dirk. Last year KAT shot 8 per game on a slightly higher efficiency. So despite having not even half of Dirk's years, the most impressive shooting year has to go to KAT.  And KAT isn't in a Seth Curry role, where he gets quality catch and shoot looks. He shoots step backs, he runs the offense, he creates for himself. I don't buy that Dirk's 3s were harder than KAT's."
"Lol, c‚Äômon dude - you brought up curry as the best shooter and i agree. But seth has a better % from deep than steph &amp; nobody imagines seth as the better shooter. Id lay the same claim about kat and dirk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Jamal Murray.   There's a 2% chance you get Jordan/Kobe. 8% chance you get Mike Conley. 90% chance you get Seth Curry.
Seth Curry was the starting PG and he had 0 assists.
The Seth Curry Experience sure is wild.
Imagine if seth curry had the confidence of Herro. He would be even better.
Does Justin Jackson look like off-brand Seth Curry to anyone else?
Dame  Bam  Roco Gary Trent Karl Anthony Towns   Bench: Kanter Ant Simons DJJ Harry Giles  Seth Curry
Sixers would have probably the worst perimeter defense of all time.  It‚Äôs already bad with Seth Curry and cement shoes Danny Green with Simmons holding the ship together with duck tape and glue.  Swap him for Trae and even guys like Elfried Payton and Markelle Fultz would put up 40 on this team on a nightly basis
"You'd have to adjust other parts to make it work. You'd have to figure out who was going to be the focal point of the offense, since Embiid and Trae can't both have their normal touches together. Defensively, you can't have Trae and Seth Curry out there together, you would need a better defensive guard to pick up Trae's slack. I could see it being a boon to Tobias as a 3rd option.  Danny Green would play the same role either way.   Ben does just about everything better than Trae but shoot, so you have to account for what is more valuable right now. The Sixers are definitely behind the curve of the new style of just bombing 3s to outscore opponents while not playing great defense."
and it's not even like the second option needs to be a superstar. Just a high quality scorer that lets Simmons shine at what he's amazing at.   Someone like Collin Sexton / SGA who can spread the defense and hit 3s. What would worry me most is their 3 best scorers all operate close to the basket which fails to maximize each players skillsets. Simmons would be so much more comfortable on offense if there was a guard that could regularly create their own shots at a high rate. It would also make Seth Curry more valuable since any defensive shift becomes a dangerous situation.  If they could find a way to add a player like that the Sixers would be unstoppable.
The Sixers let Joel shoot the technical free throw even when Seth Curry is on the court.
Why didn't more teams try and get Seth Curry?   The Lakers started hot shooting 3s but KCP and Caruso seen to have cooled down.
Duhh he meant Seth Curry
Joe Harris is ultra instinct Seth Curry
Seth curry was playing really well until he got covid so idk what you're saying
Joe Harris is who Seth Curry thinks he is
The main difference is he can take more pull up trigger threes and he's more decisive with the ball in his hands. Also he now plays the 4 and with seth curry and Danny Green instead of al Horford and josh Richardson. I think that's bigger for tobi.
I feel like sixers might get better. Jokic is a more natural fit around Ben cause he‚Äôs a better passer and shooter than Embiid. Defense would for sure be worse but having Jokic with simmons might unlock simmons potential  Seth Curry would probably get even more open looks too
Data can‚Äôt properly account for Josh Richardson being a mental midget and Seth Curry slinging big cock
Tf has Seth curry done all season? Lmao you guys are acting like he‚Äôs been doing this on the regular but uhhh
"Seth is not looking like the better curry this season, though."
"Probably not, but it would be amazing. Seth would have to come here cause Curry is never leaving"
"""Seth Curry, da Beth Curry"" - Mike Tyson (hypothetically)"
Seth Curry didnt take that last shot because he didnt want to fuck up his 3 point percentage
"Seth Curry is a great shooter, Steph is not just a ‚Äúshooter.‚Äù He‚Äôs a great passer, a terrific finisher, and is an all-time great ball handler.  You‚Äôre talking nonsense"
"Makes sense. Obviously I also wanna see Steph there, but I'd love to see guys like Seth Curry, Fred VanVleet, Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, etc."
I want to see Seth Curry vs. Steph Curry.
Seth Curry is shooting 97.1% from the line
"No I won't lmao there are plently teams where he wouldn't be the best shooter..I'll go through the teams off of the top of my head lmao  Warriors - steph and klay obviously loool Portland - Lillard and cj Utah - Joe Ingles and Bodanvic(sp?) Nuggets - Kat would be the best here. Porter is close Suns - booker  Clippers - kwahi and pg  Lakers - Kat would be the best  Mavs - Hardaway  Rockets - Kat would be the best, Gordon possibly  Spurs - don't watch enough of them but Kat probably  Kings - budy hield  Wolves - Kat New Orleans - jj  Memphis - Kat Okc - Kat   Heat - Robinson herro  Pacers - Malcom  Hawks - trea and bogdonvic(sp?) Wizards - beal Nets - harden kyrie kd and Joe Harris lol 76sers - Seth curry and Harris  Raptors - van fleet  Knicks- kat Celtics - brown possibly Tatum Magic - Kat but possibly vucevic or Ross Charlotte - Kat  Cavs - sexton  Bucks - middleton  Bulls - lavine  Pistons - Wayne Ellington   These are litterally without thinking too hard or looking at rosters lol. This is shooting in general that I would take over Kat. Some are arguable but idk Kat isn't the best shooter on most teams in my opinion"
"What I'd give for a Seth Curry, KCP, Duncan Robinson."
"He's not high variance at all. He's consistently good at drafting and amazing at trades. Free agency is where he lacks, and thats largely because no one wants to come to Portland, and even then, he's been good at re-signing the people we get through trades, and had solid vet min signings in Seth Curry and Kanter two years ago. He wasnt the only GM to hand out bad contracts in 2016. And his draft record is great, obviously there's Dame and CJ, but the rest of his picks have all been late firsts or 2nds, and almost every player becomes at least a rotation player, which is a great value for how late he gets them.   Zach Collins, while worse than all those guys, still had/has a lot of potential, he's just been injured. Those guys were all mid-late firsts, which means they weren't sure fire hits, you can't fault him for that, that's hindsight bias. Olshey is a top 10 GM imo"
"If we give Morey &amp; Doc another year or two together they can &amp; will be right up there in the mix.  So far they're using pieces from previous regimes, though I did like the Seth Curry trade and the moves Daryl made to start reshaping the roster.  Also I think Doc has clearly been an upgrade for Philly so far (feint praise, I was never much of a Brett Brown guy but I'm guessing you weren't either)"
What's the qualifier for this? Since Redick and Seth Curry are both at 97.1%
Wasn't Seth Curry perfect from the line until this week?
I hope when he comes back he's doing better than Seth Curry. COVID has had a pretty major effect on his game.
"Stotts is a coach who specifically is good at getting the best out of his role players, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Seth Curry, Shabazz Napier, Allen Crabbe, Maurice Harkless, he‚Äôs extremely good at putting players into positions to shine with their particular skillsets and it‚Äôs why we‚Äôve had so many reclamation projects or seen so many journeymen get paid after stops in Portland.  Hell, look at how good he managed to make Hassan Whiteside look after he wasn‚Äôt even seeing the court anymore."
Are we sure he's as efficient as Seth Curry?
"to be fair clarkson was being guarded by seth curry (no fucking idea why doc chose that), while ben was driving on gobert."
"I've been harping on this for about three days now (and it will continue), but we are not well-equipped, personnel-wise, to deal with strong, quick, and tall dudes with passing skill. We do fairly well against Giannis, but LeBron, Simmons, Sabonis, and others consistently do well against us. Simmons backing down Bojan was BBQ chicken, despite Bojan's best efforts. Putting Gobert on them is okay, but then we get beat by their other big. Lineups with Faves and no O'Neale meant that Simmons/Howard got anything they wanted inside. Royce was easily the best defender on Simmons, sans Gobert, but Simmons was still successful fairly frequently.  Luckily, the 76er defense was sufficiently exploitable. I noticed we were going at Seth Curry and Korkmaz when we could."
Joe showing Seth who the real 2nd best curry is
"Ingles got hacked on a 3, no call, led to fastbreak basket for Philly.  He also got bodied by a Simmons moving screen that led to a Seth Curry open 3.  The refs just suck."
We need to take more threes. We have fucking seth curry and danny green and we have god damn furkan korkmaz shooting mid ranges off the dribble
Seth Curry imo
Seth Curry doesnt miss !
Sixers are gonna need Seth Curry and Danny Green to get smoking hot to stand a chance in this one.
I wasn't a fan of the JRich/Seth Curry trade and it's not looking great for the Mavs right now. The idea to sacrifice a little offense for better defense really hasn't worked so far IMO.
Becuase Jordan did literally everything better than Kobe except for 3s. This is like saying steph and Seth curry are the same because they have similar strengths
Zion ‚ÄúSeth ‚ÄúSteph ‚ÄúDell Curry‚Äù Curry‚Äù Curry‚Äù Williamson
Seth Curry has looked better in the last week
"&gt; That‚Äôs with only Ben and Joel. Seth curry and their rookie contracts  So Ben, Joel, Shake, Curry, Maxey, Reed, and Joe? All those guys except Reed are already capable rotation guys who are getting minutes.   &gt;Lowry would need to be signed again, obviously not to 30m a year but he‚Äôs not taking some 10m deal either. So let‚Äôs say you have 20m in cap space, which looks like the absolute best case. That‚Äôs nothing  20m in cap space is far from nothing, and you're forgetting to mention that they could resign Lowry to a fat 1 year deal, fill out the roster, and still maintain a ton of flexibility for the next offseason.   &gt;Danny, TFerg, Scott and the Horford TE will work salary wise  You know you can't combine a TE with players in a trade, right?"
"Nope.  Without Tobias or Lowry they‚Äôll have just over 80m on the books for next year. Cap is 109m. So they have 30m and the MLE to fill out the entire roster   That‚Äôs with only Ben and Joel. Seth curry and their rookie contracts  Lowry would need to be signed again, obviously not to 30m a year but he‚Äôs not taking some 10m deal either. So let‚Äôs say you have 20m in cap space, which looks like the absolute best case. That‚Äôs nothing   So no you‚Äôre wrong.   The 6ers best case is to trade for Lowry using Danny green as their main salary piece. Include picks and young guys as needed   Danny, TFerg, Scott and the Horford TE will work salary wise. Obviously there are pretty much no assets in this trade yet. So it‚Äôs gonna take Maxey/Thybulle/picks to get the Raptors to agree   The 6ers will be in the salary hell. But that‚Äôs the absolute best their team can be."
Yeah don‚Äôt see them getting that far. KP is kind of an ideal center for Lebron though (when he ain‚Äôt hurt). LeGM would have to work some magic with the roster and get guys like Seth Curry back
"&gt; That's what always bugged me with Moreys system. He never got a real shooter. Imagine if he'd have grabbed Seth Curry or JJ Redick to pair with Harden. Would've been so sick.  Because those players suck on defense.   He'd rather get mediocre to below average shooters that are good on defense and tell them to launch a million 3s. But yes, he should have got at least one player of that type."
That's what always bugged me with Moreys system. He never got a real shooter. Ryan Anderson was about the best pure shooter he ever picked up.   Imagine if he'd have grabbed Seth Curry or JJ Redick to pair with Harden. Would've been so sick.
"Well yeah, when you compare Olajuwon to fucking Seth Curry.  I‚Äôll make that same argument. I‚Äôd much rather watch Steph Curry light up teams with ridiculous 3s than watch watch Shawn Bradley post up."
outside of efficiency i would rather watch olajuwon post up than seth curry drain catch and shoot 3s for a whole game
losing seth curry was a travesty
"The 2019 offseason we opened up about 40M of cap room for Kemba and/or Danny Green. We got nobody so we resigned all of our UFA (Dwight Powell) and RFAs (KP, Kleber, DFS) to go over the cap and used the trade exception from the Harrison Barnes deal to ship two 2nd round picks for a sign and trade Delon Wright. Seth Curry signed via MLE, Boban BAE. Later on in the season we used more of that TPE to trade another 2nd pick for Cauley-Stein who didn't play in the bubble and was later resigned. We let the remaining exception which was still around 10M expire.  Then we traded Delon Wright and Justin Jackson and one or two more 2nd picks for James Johnson lol.  Our draft picks this year aren't looking too great so now idk what the front office is gonna do. This is the last offseason coming up before Luka signs his big ass extension."
"I don‚Äôt see an easy way to match salaries for the Sixers. He‚Äôs making 30+ mil? We would have to give up Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and someone else to make it even close to working financially."
"That‚Äôs because of Ray Allen‚Äôs past and reputation. He was a past all star.   That‚Äôs like me bringing up Seth Curry for Embiids case. We have never done that for anybody, why start now lmao."
SETH CURRY
"That's 100% a valid complaint though, of course a tough sickness that has known long term effects is probably going to affect his game. I know Seth Curry has been inconsistent for us since he's come back and has said he's had intermittent bouts of fatigue"
Wouldn't the Mavs be better if they just kept Delon Wright and Seth Curry
or go back in time and use those first round picks to trade for role players like seth curry. convington etc instead of drafting busts and projects
"Sixers are way better constructed this year than it was last year, and this is part of what has enabled Embiid to be playing out of his mind, and Harris to actually be playing really well. Replacing Horford and Richardson with Seth Curry and Danny Green is just a much, much better fit for Harris, Embiid, and Simmons to be playing their respective games."
Seth Curry is way better at everything than Jimmer and Shamet kinda sucks
ricky rubio and seth curry would do more for the celtics than kemba
Wasn't Seth curry shooting 100% from the line?
"On 5.5 attempts per game vs. Lillard's 7.8. Not to mention the difficulty of these shots. 3P% is not the only factor in judging who is the better shooter. If I'm not mistaken Seth Curry has a higher 3P% than his brother, yet nobody seriously would claim he is the better shooter."
\+  JJ Redick 30/30  Jordan Clarkson 40/41  Seth Curry 33/34  Towns 26/27
Sarcastically lol.   ‚ÄúThe better Curry brother !‚Äù whenever Seth does something
"JJ Redick and Seth Curry and Landry Shamet aren't Steph either, but they all work hard enough off the ball to be actual NBA players. They don't demand to run the team's whole offense like Jimmer does."
Seth Curry  JET Terry  Jon Isaac   Dirk  Boban
Del and Steph and Seth curry
"It's been said Tilman was so pissed off at Morey that he wanted like every player and asset we have lol. It would be like Embiid, Harden, Seth Curry Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe out there lmao"
Man Seth Curry fell off HARD
When we signed Seth Curry for the first time I went to see his highlights and he did a move [pretty much identical](https://youtu.be/yBa4p0PJAjM?t=56) to this and I was sold.
It‚Äôs like saying Seth Curry is a better shooter than Steph. It‚Äôs only true if you ignore all the context behind the stats
if he‚Äôs comparing james harden to best 3 point shooter in history seth curry then it‚Äôs curry
I don't know the answer to this question but how many games did he miss due to COVID protocols? He's had 2 different stints on the COVID list end I don't think that should be held against players. It's not his fault Seth Curry and his barber tested positive and he never got it from them.
"There are a bunch of players still on rookie contracts that are better contracts. And if you don't want to count rookie contracts then you have guys like Zach Lavine, Seth Curry, Clarkson and several more"
"He is worse than Seth Curry. Curry is a great three point shooter and the sixers went from a 6 seed finish last year to a 1 seed, maybe will drop to 2 or 3 seed at worst by adding him and removing a defender. Defense is not important in the NBA, players are so talented offensively that they‚Äôll still score no matter how good you are."
"Don't think OP is saying the announcer said that. I think op is saying that if you take like a consensus, Simmons would be regarded as a top 25 guy, and Harris top 40, which is fairly accurate give or take a few spots. And so saying a top 25 guy is worse than a top 40 guy isn't that controversial, or at least not enough so to get up in arms over. It's not like he said Seth Curry&gt;Simmons"
Went from Butler to Josh Richardson to Seth Curry real quick.
"He's entitled to his own opinion if he thinks Tobi Harris is a more useful player than Simmons I don't see why some of yall are overreacting to that. He's wrong, but it's not like he said that Simmons was a worse player than Seth Curry or some hilariously bad take, he said that a top 25 player was overrated and not better than a top 40 player"
Matthews really hasn't been the shooter he was before his Achilles injury imo. The problem is that all their shooters are streaky. Add Seth Curry and it's game over.
He‚Äôs played 6 games with KD and 0 with Blake (who isnt good by the way). Joe Harris is a good player but should never be a needle mover in an MVP race.  Meanwhile the Sixers also have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris (and Seth Curry since apparently those guys matter too) who people conveniently leave out in these conversations

It‚Äôs not sarcasm them bois are not scrubsü§£ü§£. Hell I‚Äôd put seth curry on any team he‚Äôd be great jus look at 76ers.
"Steph to the Hornets. Trade for Seth. Dell on the color commentary. Bring Damien along too, why not. A Curry family affair."
He's just a glorified Seth Curry brah  /s
Who do you have now besides JoJo? Nobody is scared of Tobias or Seth Curry.
Jaylen Brown has gotten a lot better. Bucks have been worse this year and Philly made only marginal improvements like Seth Curry. Boston swept them last year
I think it was foolish to expect Terry to come in as a 19 year old and immediately replace seth curry. He's a guard that needs to rely on skill and BBIQ and that needs to be developed.
"Doncic also did a fine job on George. it was Kawhi that killed the Mavs, mainly because for a solid 20-25% of possessions he was getting the switch on to Seth Curry. Mavs starting 5 is way more defensively solid now with JRich"
"Carlisle is the small guard whisperer. J.J. Barea, Yogi Farrell, Seth Curry, Monta"
"I hate it half the time lol. One time I commented something celebratory after a win and this guy came back all ‚Äúwe lost our lead etc etc etc‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúbro we fucking won chill out this is a good night!‚Äù  And god forbid 4 of your best players get covid and your star big is coming back from injury yeah you‚Äôre going to lose 6 straight. Josh Richardson is not literally a trash can, KP doesn‚Äôt have cinder blocks for feet, Seth curry isn‚Äôt Steph curry, and Rick Carlisle shouldn‚Äôt be shot into the sun lol."
"I would be looking Bjelica and maybe Buddy. Buddy and Seth Curry on defense would be a mess, though. I would love to get Harrison Barnes, but there's too much overlap with Tobias.    OK, so just Bjelica."
50% on open threes is a ridiculous thing to ask for. Seth curry set a record for best career percentage on open threes at around 52 percent
"Sometimes I wonder if it's actually worth teams mimic-ing Draymond's skills set and playstyle but not limiting them.  I was thinking someone like Simmons or Lonzo, I have a feeling Seth Curry and Simmons pick and roll could be elite-level offense, since Seth's an elite shooter and if his defender chooses to go over the screen then Simmons and just burst to the rim."
Seth Curry is the only current Sixer who has tested positive IIRC.
"Let‚Äôs say the Sixers lose in the ECF this season, and the Wolves pick conveys to the Warriors at #4. If the Warriors offer Wiggins, Poole, 2021 #4, 2022 1st, 2024 1st, 2026 1st for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, do the Sixers pick up the phone or hang up?"
"What?  The lack of understanding about the point I was making is astounding, haha.  You seemed to miss my point -- I'm not saying it's bad, just that expectations for the Nuggets should be a top 8-10 net rating for their best trio.  2/3 of this lineup is a top 2 MVP candidate and Jamal, who is having a *fantastic* year and an absurdly good month last month.  This rating is very impressive, but the Nuggets are to the point where they should be expected to have a trio with a top 10 net rating.  Look at all the #3 options in this table -- Seth Curry, Donte Divencenzo, Gary Trent, Royce o' Neal, etc.  The duos are what carries this ranking.  Don't act like this ranking is because MPJ has been amazing, it's because Jokic and Murray have been amazing and MPJ has been real solid.  My point isn't that it's worse than it should be or a bad net rating.  My point is that, for a team that was in the ""final 4"" last year and has had a top 3 seed in the west several years in a row, at a certain point it should just be expected that their top 3 is in the top 8 for net rating.  Just like it's not surprising the Clippers or Bucks or Philly has a high rating.  They have really good duos along with a good 3rd player and were expected to be really good this year.  That's my point.  Not that it's bad, but that it's not something to brag about because top 8 is pretty much what we should be expecting based on recent history and performance.  You act like MPJ is the primary reason for this rating when really it's Jokic and Murray and it's awesome that MPJ has been good enough to keep it so high."
"Eh, Sixers are a middling offense, you‚Äôre replacing Green with Lowry which is more or less a 1 for 1 trade off, but then you‚Äôre replacing Seth Curry, 45% 3 point shooter with Thybulle, who is a sub 30%, and Harris (40%) with Tucker (31%). Sure you pickup some with Lowry being a playmaker but in the current starting lineup ben‚Äôs the only playmaker and this shooters can spot up around him whereas when Lowry is a playmaker, you‚Äôre essentially making Ben a screener/post player and using Joel as a spot up shooter because you‚Äôre just begging Joel to be double teamed in the post with how horrid the spacing of that lineup would be. If we get tucker it would be more to stagger him with Joel so he‚Äôd soak up the backup 5 minutes and you‚Äôd presumably want him at the 4 with Joel when Ben is resting to get optimal spacing around Joel."
i guess seth curry? idk there's not really anyone else I can think of.  an actual player that I really like on a team that I don't is Kemba tho
"don't have to look at it like that. seth got multiple shots bc he's a curry and could also afford to not take a euro contract. he belongs in the NBA, but on a different timeline and w/ a different brother, maybe he never makes it"
I like Seth Curry
"There's a difference between adding shooters and trading shooters.   Bucks just got Jrue and lost Korver and Hill who were your most reliable shooters last year and Bledsoe who was admittedly not as reliable but still an efficient scorer.   76ers still have Korkmaz and Shake but they also added Danny Green and Seth Curry. They lost Richardson and horford which were terrible fits for that team.   The bucks stayed the same, the 76ers got better."
How would a team stop a player on a team with Tobias Harris and Seth Curry as starters? Quite easily I imagine.
"Give me Seth Curry over Steph on the Nets any day, because they don't need another ball dominant guard /s"
"Seth Curry tried to surprise Giannis with an Ankle Lock, but Giannis escaped. Kurt Angle would‚Äôve done it right."
Seth Curry
Big thanks to Seth Curry for attempting an ankle lock and getting the entire team fired up.
"Seth ""THE UNDERTAKER"" Curry"
"If it was WWE, someone else must've been distracting the refs and Seth Curry would have aimed for his nuts."
Fuck you Seth Curry.
Seth Curry was just trying to STOP THE STEAL!
"Tried that, they traded Seth Curry. A lot of this team was apparently designed to be built round Luka, see Porzingis trade."
Seth Curry turned into Seth Rollins
double agent seth curry
imagine he tore his acl because of seth curry
Embiid played against the bucks on Thursday dummy and so did Tobias and Seth curry! It‚Äôs still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the Sixers play way better with Simmons on the floor
Donte Divencenzo and Seth Curry
WAIT THATS STEPH! STEPH CURRY JUST SLID A CHAIR TO HIS BROTHER SETH AND THE REF NEVER SAW IT!
Seth Curry tried to go for the Ankle Lock but Giannis managed to get to the rope.
No one is saying the Sixers are contenders purely because of Seth Curry.
"this genuinely turned the game for us, bucks destroyed them for the rest of the game after this moment. thank you seth curry"
Romeo Langford and Seth Curry
OH AND WHATS THIS! ITS SETH CURRY WITH A STEEL CHAIR
Is Josh Okogie and Seth Curry allowed? Because that
Fuck Seth Curry
All it took was Seth Curry playing WWE on Giannis
Seth Curry shouldn't even be starting for us. Korkmaz is better.
"Don't let the lack of Embiid and Simmons distract you from the fact that Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard are all playing in this game."
"I had to step out, does anyone have a clip of whatever Seth Curry did?"
How the hell are the Sixers stuck in a zone with Seth Curry in the lineup lmao
"They‚Äôre in 5th place in the league right now. When you‚Äôre trying to win a championship, it‚Äôs not about the difference between being a good team and shitty team, it‚Äôs about going from a good-great team to the best team.  Turning Butler (4th in WS/48 this season) into Josh Richardson, and then Seth Curry is some major negative value loss, even though Curry is a good role player.  I‚Äôm sure Daryl Morey would have rather walked into a situation with Butler on the team than one without."
Seth Curry is just the evil doppelg√§nger of Steph
You think Austin Rivers is better than Seth Curry?
Steph and Austin Rivers aren't siblings. SETH Curry and Austin Rivers are in-laws.
"Also Seth and Dell Curry are/were both great shooters, definitely not a coincidence. Something in the Curry genes"
"Once Seth wins finals mvp, he will have one more finals mvp than Steph Overrated Curry.   Seth&gt;Steph in my book"
"No, it'll be Jokic. He's top 4 or 5 though since if Dallas get to the play offs it'll be because of Luka. He can't have been happy with the Seth Curry trade though, he liked playing with him."
Clippers vs 76ers: 76ers in 7     Seth Curry is Finals MVP
What? You mean Seth Curry and Danny Green are upgrades than 35 year-old Al Horford?!
Morey deserves a lot of credit for coming in and instantly making the pieces make sense. I‚Äôm still befuddled as to how he turned Horford and Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry.
"They kind of did last night. Seth Curry and someone else, standing right next to the ref, counted off.  The announcers even called it out. It was really funny"
"Siakam has copped a TONNE of heat this year but expectations for the Raps are lower considering it's accepted that they shot their shot when they had the chance and are now about to enter a period of retooling, whereas the Mavs were expected to be entering their window as title contenders.   While I agree that KP's offence is absolutely fine and people overblow it to manufacture drama, the move to playing the 5 in Dallas has seen his defensive efficiency drop off which is immensely disappointing for a 7ft+ behemoth whose rim-protecting ability when playing the 4 was formerly one of his biggest strengths. Guys like Richardson also deserve heat for not providing anywhere near the value that Seth Curry did, but the Mavs haven't committed to him the same way they did to Porzingis where KP is officially the second the in command to Luka for the foreseeable future, and that's why people are constantly singling out Porzingis"
"He is very good defensively, it will be Seth Curry who will get targeted."
"You discounted the Sixers for them being unhealthy but they put Thybulle on Curry plenty? Plus Seth always plays like it‚Äôs a playoff game against him.  And you‚Äôre really talking about Kemba like he was Curry‚Äôs primary defender lol, try Marcus Smart?  He‚Äôs absolutely the most valuable player this year. The problem is simply his teams record makes him unlikely to win the actual award."
"Honestly this whole season has been rough, but I think losing Seth curry was a big blow to their historically good spacing."
"Still pisses me off that we lost that game vs Golden State because Doc trusted Matisse at the start to guard Curry then after Curry made 2 3‚Äôs he didn‚Äôt guard him again all night. Seth, Danny Green, freshly-returned Hill and Tyrese Maxey all did worse. Not to mention Curry gets so many 3s off just out of your fingers with his quick release, Matisse would have been much better."
"Steph Curry could go 400/400 on 3 pointers and then retire and still be behind his brother Seth Curry, a nba journeyman, for career 3 point %.  Literal facts"
"Steph Curry could go 400/400 on 3 pointers and then retire and still be behind his brother Seth Curry, an 8 year nba vet journeyman, for career 3 point %."
"Nope he‚Äôs making a BOLD STATEMENT  Seth Curry over Westbrook, how brave"
Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons  Paul George and Doc Rivers (or PG and Seth Curry)  Lance Stephenson and Lebron
He's leading the Suns to the #2 seed and Steven Adams is making 25...I 100% think a team would do that.....John Stockton was very good in his old age and I think Cp3 is better then him. Id clean out the lockers of Danny Green and Seth Curry to sign him for 4 years 25 mill
"Steph Curry and Seth Curry. Just one letter! Hella confusing, yeah."
"Curry, Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Embiid and then Seth Curry, Danny Green, Wiggins, Harris, Howard off the bench would be the proper lineup ü•µü•µ"
More like the west coast version of Seth Curry.
"Curry, Simmons, Draymond, Tobias, Embiid - yeah holy shit that is a disgusting lineup. Unstoppable offense and total lockdown defense. Get Seth and Wiggins off the bench as scorers and shot creators too."
"Seth also had covid and he as well as others involved with the 76ers have talked about how it‚Äôs continued to affect him. If this question is only talking about performance this year, that‚Äôs one thing. But generally, I‚Äôd say Seth Curry."
Above Rudy Gobert but lower than Seth Curry
"Let me gets this straight, you think Embiid was better 3 years ago, that Tobias Harris now is worse than Dario Saric back then, that JJ Redick is a better ball handler than Seth Curry, and that Amir Johnson is better than Dwight Howard? I have more questions, but those stood out the most"
"Calling me delusional but thinks a team who's second best player can't hit a jumpshot will beat Kyrie and Kd surrounded by some of the best shooters in the league. The fact that Kyrie was able to drop 37 points while fasting on the sixers ""elite defense"" just made me lose any sort of concern that the sixers were threats to the Nets. The sixers are relying on Seth Curry and Danny Green as the 3rd and 4th scoring options üòÇ. The sixers are the defintion of a regular season team."
"This is a lot to unpack. You're really passionate about this I can tell. First, win shares is a metric that leads to a suggested stat. Rose and the bulls won more games than the Lebron led heat. That's a fact. And that's a huge measurement in MVP and always has been. Secondly, Rose was a clutch scorer, an elite rim finisher and an improving jump shooter on top of being an elite playmaker being the only player in the league to be in the top 10 in scoring and assists. Thirdly, your seth curry/steph curry argument is nonsense. Stfu. Lastly, Lebron was third in MVP votes. He was never going to win that year."
"Correct, but we're talking about individual value, and you're talking about team record. Rose alone didn't increase the wins by 20, the team overall improved by 20 wins. W/L is very limited in what it can tell us about individual players. Take this season, is Seth Curry better than Steph because he has more wins? By the W/L standard you're parroting the answer would be yes because winning is the most valuable thing. You're right that winning is what counts, but W/L doesn't signify the individual impact of two separate players alone. If that's all that matters why don't you just use win shares? The whole point of that is to isolate the wins contributed by players. Lebron led the league in win shares in 2011, not Rose."
"&gt; Bringing up the series1 game KD didn't play when he got hurt is really dishonest.  I'm not talking just about the playoffs, I am talking about the regular season. I am too lazy to look it up but Warriors were something like 5-0 while KD was injured while Rockets had CP3 healthy.   &gt; He averaged 36 points that series when every game was decided by 6 or fewer.   We know KD can score, we also know his isolation scheme was pissing Kerr off with Kerr telling him to 'trust his teammates'. Every opponent notes the Warriors without KD move much more off the ball and Seth Curry even says they were more dangerous in some ways.   &gt; that team was good enough to keep the game tied when Curry had a 0 pt half even with CP3 and Harden going off.  I don't over analyze a single game sample size, I look at multiple games. The reality is Harden basically choked that game 6 away and on average, has yet to beat Curry non-KD core since 2017 until 2020.   &gt; In the 2019 GSW series?   No I mean if you look at net ratings of Houston 2018-2019, CP3 literally had superior advanced metrics. In fact he was top 5 in the league and even above Curry in one of those. The Rockets were flat out better with CP3 regardless of what he was scoring the same way Curry doesn't have to score to make a big impact.  &gt; but ignore that CP3 had 11 pts and shot 0% from 3 that game.  Bad games are within variance, Curry was injured in both series and had some of the worst playoff stats in both series. In 2019 he only shot 54% TS which is far below his average. Literally the Rockets were given a silver platter to take down the Warriors and still couldn't do it. Iguodala was injured in 2018 but no one brings that up along with the cp3 injury."
seth curry
Doc trying to fanfic a Seth vs Steph cleganebowl. Curry bowl
"We know what we've gotta do. I hear Ray Allen is trying to assemble a team in Seattle consisting of 2016 Kevin Love, Patrick Beverley, Prime Tony Allen, Seth Curry and St Jude herself. That should do the trick"
Probably because his brother Seth Curry plays for he 76ers... but no doubt Steph is much more likable.
"Seth curry had an advantage because he played with steph a million times since childhood, he knows his mannerism, habits"
"Imagine being Seth Curry, this has probably happening to him his whole life"
"[They updated like once a week with games missed.](https://twitter.com/ManGamesLostNBA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  Doesn't have breakdown by player just total missed to injury.  Yeah KP is a big loss but the roster is much the same as last year minus Seth Curry and a lot of people projected them to finish 5 or even 4 in the West.  I always thought they would finish 7/8 area because guys like DFS shot way over their career norms last year.  I agree that they are shallower but I think when healthy most teams are compared to the Hawks.  Nate is great and what the team needed.  Honestly the team has been as much or more injured than when Pierce was the coach.  During Nate's time Collins missed 9 games and missed none under Pierce, Trae has missed several games under Nate, Hunter and Cam have both been out the entire time basically, and Gallo has missed a bunch of games as well.  So honestly Pierce can't use injuries as an excuse.  National media just sees Bogi healthy and going off and think we are healthy.  Pierce was a cancer in the locker room with his attitude and from a lot of accounts seem to really dislike Trae and Collins.  He also had no fucking clue when to call a timeout or how to rotate guys.  He was great for developing our guys early on but that's about it.  I was fine giving him a chance to start the season because of that and riding with us during the tank, but he proved even with a good roster he can't win."

"Duncan Robinson, Gary Payton II, Dean Wade, Seth Curry, Paul Millsap, George Hill, Mike Miller, Allen Crabbe, Thanasis Antetounkumpo, and...MEYERS LEONARD!"
Technically wouldn‚Äôt that make Dell Curry the most impactful player ever? Dell did make Steph and Seth which makes him more impactful
"I see that Seth ""Steph Curry Stopper"" Curry also played this game."
"Why wouldn‚Äôt they? He‚Äôs the best player in the NBA, leagues above LeMickey, Fraudis Antfraudokounmpo, or Steph ‚ÄúInferior Seth‚Äù Curry"
Maybe they thought they were cheering for Seth Curry?
"Might be Seth.  Curry seems to step it up when his little brother's involved, either playing against him or dropping 50+ on a team if *they* fucked with Seth  (I will never be convinced he didn't dance on the Wizards' souls that time specifically because of Morris pulling Seth's shorts down in the previous game. No-one messes with Seth but Steph.)"
"Seth Curry please turn into Steph. You literally have the same genetics, do better."
"When we went up 12-0 I said Seth better Curry, this one's on me"
"Remove the second to last letter, then swap the second letter with the third:  Steph -&gt; Steh -&gt; Seth  Seth -&gt; Seh -&gt; She  She Curry next son confirmed"
Curry has 20 points and 4 3's...  Is this supposed to be a Seth/Steph joke?
"But Seth is [questionable](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-tobias-harris-seth-curry-dwight-howard-questionable-warriors).  C'mon basketball, Gods. Give us the sibling rivalry matchup we need."
"Define ‚Äúgood.‚Äù You said he‚Äôs ‚Äúpure ass.‚Äù Going by BPM (worse than Kuz), here are some players this year that are crystal-grade ass:  Schr√∂der  RJ Barrett  PJ Washington  KCP  Seth Curry  Darius Garland  Tyler Herro  Gary Trent JR  Lou Williams  Ricky Rubio  Lu Dort  Ant Edwards  Dillon Brooks"
"Sixers missed Tobias Harris, Dwight, Seth Curry and George Hill in these games. Embiid willed the team to win"
"Simmons, Steph, Tobias all questionable. Seth Curry, Dwight and George Hill are too. gonna be ugly if they all sit"
ah the seth curry effect. quick trigger shooters or willingness to hoist nonperfect 3's &gt; high shooting percentages
"It's not improved though. They're worse on 3s and offensive efficiency than they ever were.   Season| 3PM| Offensive Rating ---|---|---- 20-21| 26th| 14th 19-20| 19th| 13th 18-19 |19th | 8th 17-18| 12th| 12th  People forget the 76ers have actually had pretty good shooters over the years.  Seth Curry and Danny Green aren't a new development. The 76ers had JJ Redick and Robert Covington, who were better versions of Seth and Danny.  What's changed for them this year is their defence, but their offence and spacing is worse than it's ever been."
"Short replies or long replies welcome, why are the Mavs losing so many games? I know they traded away Seth Curry and Nerlens, can't think of who else but didn't they get Illysova from the Bucks and JJ Reddick? Like those are even comparable haha.  Anyways, I checked and they're two games behind Portland for the 6th spot, and a game of ahead of the 8th seed, 2 ahead of 9th seed, and 3 ahead of 10th seed. Super tight race going on there. I want to see Mavs make the jump to 6th, but it seems unlikely. (Would LIKE to see the Spurs do it, but that's not the most likely scenario here haha)"
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
"J Rich is overrated as a defender and shooter. Seths shooting is well understood but he is a better defender than I expected, although still well below J Rich.  Curry is also on a fantastic contract, while Josh has a player option for next year.   For the sixers there is no doubt who is more valuable, mainly as Seth opens up the floor for Jo. In a vacuum, I still think Seth is more valuable"
Mavs could easily be a 4 or 5 seed rn if KP wasn't hurt or didn't get affected by covid early on in the season. Josh Richardson didn't make them worse as they're roughly the same with Seth curry last year.
Seth Curry is a really fucking good player lol. If his name wasn‚Äôt Curry he‚Äôd have more respect
"&gt; I don't think this version of their team is as good as the 2019 playoff version.   Bruh this team has way better shooter and defenders. Its all about fit and J Richardson and Al Horford didn't fit compared to Seth Curry and Danny Green, who are pretty good shooter. There is a reason they have been amazing to watch this season."
"I mean people are acting like Seth Curry has been godly on the sixers, but it really hasn‚Äôt been that one sided of a trade. Curry hasn‚Äôt really been that good or anything"
lol no maybe they can get a Seth Curry
Mavs sorely miss Seth curry this year
Seth Curry - 1 travel per game
"&gt; on court, and they play like the league's worst team when Shai is not on court.   If you place so much value in on/off stats. Look up the on off of players like Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Giannis, Embiid, Nash during Suns run, Jokic, Chris Paul most years then look up on the On/off of Luka. It is comparable to a good role player which is crazy because as such a ball dominant player, he should have a huge statistical impact. I don't care how little someone values on/off, you have to be surprised that someone who has the reputation of carrying their team has pretty mediocre on/off by superstar standards even this year which is his best year.  &gt;It's not like Dallas suddenly has any offense when Donciƒá is out  People made a big deal that Dallas was the best offense of all time last year. This wasn't fair because for a while now every year, offenses have been getting better and better and that number 1 offense last year wouldn't even be a top 5 offense this year. What was also ignored is that even without Luka on the court the Mavs still had a top 10 offense in the league (and a better defense). Check out how bad the Trailblazers offense was without Lillard or Hawks offense without Trae Young. This year the mavs have the best scoring duo on the bench but losing Seth Curry, and with the injuries they haven't been quite as good as last year (but still overall a net positive).   &gt;if we assume Westbrook can score.  Don't have to assume, he is a scorer.   &gt;When the player in question is shooting 10 percentage points lower than most other high-usage players and 6 percentage points lower than league's average than this ""impact"" is another story in my opinion  I compared the impact of SGA and Jamal Murray to Luka, not playstyle. I compared Russell Westbrook for playstyle. Barring injuries, if you replaced Jamal Murray with Luka this year, I think they will lose less games then the amount you add by replacing Luka with Lebron James."
"Totally ignoring that Philadelphia went out and got shooters (Seth Curry, Danny Green, George Hill).  Thompson is a fine Kanter replacement comparison but Robert Williams and Daniel Theis are 2 totally different players where the offense is run differently and have different defensive styles.  We also don‚Äôt have Hayward and we have yet to see what Fournier (and Jabari Parker if you want to include him) can bring to the team at full strength.  This is also ignoring the context that Simmons was injured and didn‚Äôt play in the series last year, and Embiid is dominating way more this season than he has in the past. Plus Jaylen Brown has emerged more as a ball handler (with Hayward‚Äôs departure).  Both teams are totally different."
"Ben Simmons was an all star and is a DPOY candidate and currently a better overall player then Murray.   Tobias Harris was a fringe all star, very good defender and one on one player, and currently a better player than mpj.  Danny green and seth curry are both better players than will Barton.   AG has been in Denver for 11 games and they are 9-2 in that stretch."
Against the Nets Thybulle will see 20 minutes.   Seth Curry will see less starter‚Äôs minutes than normal.
does Seth Curry have argument for the best kid of Dell Curry?
"The Nets. Which isn't to say Simmons has a bad team around him at all, Embiid is a MVP candidate and Seth Curry, Thybulle and everyone else on the roster are very good complimentary pieces."
"There is no embiid stopper. Dealing with Philly comes down to what we do against Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny green, Ben Simmons etc. Joel can do whatever he wants as long as we do well against everyone else, they are not beating us"
"Great game from the Clippers. Obviously the best player missing from this game was Kawhi Leonard, that's undisputable. But the Sixers were missing Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, and playing Mike Scott, which really hurts our shooting.   Smart job by Lue to double Embiid the entire game and basically force the Sixers to shoot wide open threes from Mike Scott. Kork and DG obviously still have us great shooting but they were helping off of Scott all game. When you see that he went two for infinity from downtown, remember that these were off of absolutely wide ass open threes, usually from the corner.   Anyway. Good job by everyone on both teams, obviously especially PG and Embiid."
"&gt;its because kawhi is not a leader and cant elevate his teammates.  Quote me where I said this, or you're a fraud.  &gt;Percentages go down for mavs? They lose by 30.  To less than half their season average lol. Of course they lose.  &gt;Luka's team shoots 60% over 3 games when their normal shooting percentage on open shots is 40%, its because Luka is a god  It was 50%. And every shot quality metric shows that Luka's teammates are getting significantly better shots playing with him than without him. This happened to Seth Curry, and it's also happened to THJ and to Kleber/DFS.  It's not a double standard. It's the simple fact that Kawhi plays ISO ball and also is a good playmaker, whereas Luka plays very little ISO and is an elite playmaker.  Look at our rosters and tell me with a straight face that Luka's supporting cast is as good as Kawhi's. Or don't, and admit that you don't have an argument other than ""hur dur luka stans are annoying""."
This is one of those times when Dallas miss Seth Curry
why did the Mavs trade Seth Curry
Seth Curry could have come handy here
Josh Richardson for Seth Curry is one of the biggest fleeces in recent history. Salute to Daryl Morey
"What about Simmons, Milton, Maxey and Seth Curry? Possibly even Tobias Harris."
"I can‚Äôt believe we didn‚Äôt get Seth fuvking curry or fix our biggest glaring weakness in past years title run, our awful three point shooting. When Lebron is your best shooter you messed up with building around him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
Dickhead we won't have an answer for Embiid and Seth Curry will light us up when they bring the double.
"Seth Curry has been shutting him down and torching him on the other side for 2.5 games, so I'd say yea"
"To me, isolation PPP defense tells me how good a guy can stop dribble penetration.  Guys like Seth Curry are terrible. You'll see the best defending guards with low PPP.  Other stats can be defensive FG% vs average. But I like isolation PPP the most."
"I was gonna make a thread on this. Milwaukee has the best chance to beat the Nets out of any team. Including the Lakers, Philly, anyone ‚Ä¶  1- Nets biggest weakness is size. I trust Giannis the most to completely dominate and use his size. Far more then I trust Anthony Davis to. I trust Embiid , but‚Ä¶  2- Bucks have the combo of scorers/star power  and defenders. Philly has the defenders, but with Simmons being a non factor offensively there is no way Philly matches BK‚Äôs scoring with a big 3 of embiid, Harris, and ‚Ä¶..Seth Curry? Not enough.  3- Jrue holiday. In this day n age it‚Äôs practically impossible to ‚Äúshut down ‚Äú a high level offensive  player. One of the few cases of it being done is Jrue vs Dame a few years ago. And then he swarmed Kyrie earlier this year. I‚Äôm a believer in him at least neutralizing Kyrie/harden. From there it levels the playing field somewhat and Giannis can cause enough headaches for BK that the bucks shooters go apeshit  So imo the bucks will either win this series or it will be the Nets hardest series remaining. My heart wants to say the lakers can beat BK, but I have no faith whatsover in AD‚Äôs frail, fall on every other play, soft, jumpshooting, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna play the 5‚Äô shenanigans. Lebron will be Lebron but at age 36 he‚Äôll just equal KD‚Äôs output at best. Cant expect him to outplay all those  dudes. AD would need to be the difference maker and I don‚Äôt trust him‚Ä¶but I trust Giannis to at least fully exploit the mismatch"
"So yeah, Curry stripped him but two things:  1. The way he cowers in fear and the way his legs just stop are hilarious. Maybe that reaction is because of the strip but it still looks like he's reacting to Embiid. But the bigger issue....  2. The fact that we have been able to guard him with Seth Curry *by design* and not only get away with it but basic shut him down is way worse than him making a business decision on offense."
"Steph is more than a good percentage, that's Seth  Steph is percentage yes, but also location, difficulty, _and_ volume. If you can emulate him getting hot for even 1 game in your entire career you're not an average shooter.  Bryn Forbes is great shooter btw, not that 5/5 Bryn shots is Curry-hot anyway"
Luckily Seth curry is making the argument for those players
Give him a break. Not many people can handle the smothering defense of Seth Curry.
"Seth Curry, Danny Green aren‚Äôt playing the Ray role?"
seth Curry out there guarding Bertans and I‚Äôm all for it
"Its Seth "" Stephen ""Seth Curry's brother"" Curry's brother"" Curry"
"Seth ""Stephen Curry's brother"" Curry"
I went to Michigan state so I‚Äôm biased to Forbes!  Forbes is a nice player will secure close to a Seth Curry type role and money.  A lot of teams will jump to pay him 5-6m per year...especially a lot of contenders.        Someone will likely throw crazy money at Duncan. If he‚Äôs a starter on your team...your team probably ain‚Äôt winning a championship.
Are we doubling Seth Curry? Is that a thing now?
Imagine this sixers starting lineup:  Ben Simmons  Seth Curry  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  Would be unbeatable
His daughter is married to Seth Curry
X-factors for this series are MPJ and Seth Curry but I think Sixers win this one because the Nuggets perimeter defense (although improved with the addition of Gordon) is not enough
Porzingis is a tall Seth Curry with worse shooting.
"looks like Brunson filled the role left by the Seth Curry trade, dude doesn't miss from 3."
Lol what is your beef with Seth Curry
"Seth Curry tries on defense, same cant be said about Westbrook who straight up quits on the defensive end.  Give me Curry over Russ any day on defense."
"Wizards tried to run zone but the Sixers got wide open 3s again and again. They eventually stopped to run zone. Wizards don't have the personnel to defend the Sixers full stop. Wizards is a perfect matchup for Sixers no matter how you look at it.   Sixers have all-NBA defenders, they can hide him easily compared to Dallas Mavs. If you give a ball to Ish Smith and Neto that defend by Seth Curry. Sixers will be 100% happy about this because Beal doesn't have a ball to scoring."
Please stop spamming this sub with your weird Seth Curry hate
"It only saw continued success against us last season because we had Simmons, Embiid, Harris, J-Rich, and Horford as our starting five. Our spacing was atrocious and none of them could reliably knock down threes to take out zones (Embiid and Harris shoot from the 3 better when they aren't just camping out at the line).   Now with Danny Green, Seth Curry, and George Hill off the bench, the zone is far less effective. Yes it will still work sometimes but only at times since any of those three can break the zone."
Jesus what is it with you and Seth Curry? Did he sleep with your mom or something? Lol
No it means less Westbrook on Simmons. More Neto on Seth Curry.
It wouldn't be dropping back off of those guys.  Plus Miami shot 20 threes in a game and still lost.  Bucks will make the sixers shooters beat them not Embiid and Simmons.  Plus if they need to they have a switching scheme.  Also I hate when people say haven't seen them play.  Wtf I'm watching the playoffs I know what they are doing.  I've seen them all year.  If you lose a series because Danny Green and Seth Curry goes nuts then so be it. The fact is Philly plays 2 in and 3 out which Milwaukee is exploiting against Miami who granted aren't as talented as Philly but it's not like the Heat suck.
"I mean I guess if instead of putting Joel Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Tobias Harris (all great shooters) we just put five Ben Simmons' out there."
"Sorry, but no amount of scheme will bridge the massive talent gap between these two teams.  Beal is the only Wizard the Sixers are remotely afraid of on offense, and there is not a single defender in Washington that could even be labeled as above average.  And ‚Äúattack Seth Curry‚Äù is not a scheme.  Attack him in PnR?  ISO? The Post?  Let‚Äôs be real if the Wizards changed their game plan to go through Neto or Ish Smith against Seth Curry the Sixers would be perfectly happy with that.  Taking the ball out of Beal‚Äôs hands and running the offense through two replacement level point guards is not going to fly in the playoffs, sorry."
"You are making this waay to complicated for OP  OP just expects Raul Neto to score 60 if he listens to OP and ""aTtaCkS sEtH cUrRy"""
"Compared to Ben and Matisse I would rather attack Curry too. I think that's what OP is saying. I don't think they realize how impractical it is to do this literally all game this early into the series, but they have a valid point about Seth being the weakest of the bunch."
"It‚Äôs hard to simply target a single weak defender (Seth) when your offence just doesn‚Äôt have enough spacing or offensive talent in general. Luka is having success against the Clippers when he targets Zubac or one of the little guards because he is constantly surrounded by 4 shooters, or 3 shooters &amp; a lob threat in WCS or Powell. There also isn‚Äôt a playmaker on this Wizards team that is on the level of Luka.  By ‚Äúattack Seth Curry‚Äù do you mean attack him in PnR or in isolation? Because if it‚Äôs in isolation, then I don‚Äôt think a large volume of Raul Neto or Ish Smith iso‚Äôs are going to pull off an upset on this Philly team. Even if they do beat him off the dribble, again the Wizards don‚Äôt have enough spacing to take consistent advantage against this. Philly has elite help defenders in Joel, Ben, Green, Thybulle, etc. as well.  And in the PnR it‚Äôs much of the same, even if Curry is a liability on D, Philly has elite help defenders and Wizards don‚Äôt have enough legitimate offensive threats to consistently take advantage of it. They are honestly just too outmatched this series."
Scott Brooks plays a playmaking PG Raul Neto as the starter. He's the one who has torched Seth Curry but not given enough plays. Seth has given up 70-100% FG% for all shots.
Westbrook has been trying to attack Simmons and Embiid which is the problem.   My point is that Raul Neto needs to take Seth Curry and force Embiid to help and it opens up easy lane for the 3 centers.  They don't do this right now. Westbrook is struggling mightily as he should against 2 all NBA defenders.
"I watched that game. 76ers play drop coverage or hedge against Wizards. Seth Curry is an average defender at best, he's good enough to defend Neto/Bertan/Smith. You don't have enough good shooter to force switches. Beal is the only good shooter so they play drop coverage or hedge Beal and let Simmons/Thybulle recover. The 76ers roster was looking at Beal and don't give any fuck about others. One of the play, five 76ers player was in the paint because Beal was dribbling toward the rim. They don't care about anyone but defend Beal. The 76ers offense system was just an attacking mismatch. Wizards ran 3 guard lineup against one of the tallest lineups in NBA and the 76ers punished that easily"
"Ok, which matchup would you be ok doing it for?  You showed me two very specific instances where Seth isn't great, two instances that can mostly be schemed away. We're not likely to have Seth defending many shots at the rim by himself when he probably plays all of his minutes with either Embiid or Howard.  Here is an example of [advanced](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/2) stats showing Curry as a plus defender. There are also others that show him as worse, I won't pretend they don't exist, but he's not that bad."
Except Seth Curry. He's a scrub.
"Yea I rather see Brooks play his athletes to try to just play any defense.  But he sticks with a point guard in Raul Neto. So if you play Raul, you have to use him to attack Seth Curry.  It just sucks that he won't make an adjustment to put a real swing forward like Chandler, Gill or Bonga to just play defense on Simmons or Harris."
Depends on the matchup. I just showed you advanced stats how bad Seth Curry is.  You can't be looking at defensive rating because he's lucky he has 2-3 all NBA defenders.  Raul Neto offense &gt; Westbrook trying to attack Simmons.
"The whole point of Scott Brooks playing PG Raul Neto is to make plays. So if you play him, you use him to attack Seth Curry.  In normal situations, that PG would be a SF like Chandler or Gill.  but Scott Brooks is playing a playmaker in Raul Neto. So you better be attacking one of the worst defenders in the league.  Embiid camping hasn't worked at all this series when Embiid helps it leads to easy layup for the Center."
You‚Äôd think westbrook should be able to score on Seth fucking curry lmao
That's the whole point. I did a play-by-play noting that Westbrook shouldn't be shooting. All of those plays should be going to Neto to attack Seth Curry.  Seth Curry is unplayable as a starter. He will get roasted in the Nets series for sure if he is guarding Kyrie or Harden or KD or Joe. Even against the Knicks or Hawks he will get destroyed in isolation.
Yes it's the best play. Way better than any Westbrook drive on Ben Simmons. You can switch it up with Beal playmaking.  But the point is you want Seth Curry out of the game.
Wizards are shooting 70-100% on Seth Curry in the playoffs.  https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203552/defense-dash/
Even in isolation Seth Curry sucks. You can get off any shot you want.  He is 5.7 percentile in isolation defense allowing 1.27 in isolation. Clearly he is one of the worst isolation defenders where Raul Neto should be attacking him.
Raul Neto should be playmaking on Seth Curry. That's why Brooks starts him.
"In what world is Seth Curry a terrible defender? He's not great, possibly not even average, but he's serviceable. At least good enough to not be targeted on literally every play, which seems to be what you're suggesting for the Wizards."
"Seth Curry is hiding on defense and is one of the worst defenders in the league.  [https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203552/defense-dash/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203552/defense-dash/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)  It's all positive differential where players shoot 72% on him in the circle! He is the worst defender by far from Tobias, Green, Simmons and Embiid."
Seth Curry isnt actually that bad a defender on guards which happens to be the Wizards best players
Does Seth Curry always have something going on with him?
Seth Curry got injured.  üò•
Dear Scott Brooks: Garrison Mathews is just as talented as Seth Curry. Why does he not see the floor?
"I mean, if anyone was criticizing Ben for only scoring 6 points in this game, they shouldn't have. He had 15 rebounds, 15 assists, 1 block, 1 steal and was a +18. That's a damn good stat line. The Sixers had all the scoring they needed this game between Tobias and Embiid, not to mention Danny Green and Seth Curry.  Ben shouldn't be getting criticism for not scoring when his team doesn't need him to, the question is going to be whether he can score when the Sixers do need him to."
"I felt the same way, fourth quarters have been a week spot for this Mavs team when compared to Q1-3. Clutch shooting and playmaking have definitely sealed the deal, so they weren't *bad*, but like you said, exploitable if you have defensive talent and playmaking. Lakers/Nets could have very well won both these games in the fourth quarter (Bucks, too likely). I think the difference, though, will be Carlisle's adjustments. People underestimate how smart he is as a coach. These close fourth quarters are giving him an idea of how to close out, what lineups to run, what plays to go with, etc.   Also, I disagree about Seth. I miss him, but Timmy has more than filled the Seth Curry role. Believe it or not Seth actually wasn't as consistent of a scorer as people thought last year for the Mavs. Granted he had some great games and knocked down 3s at a crazy rate, but he very easily disappeared and offered little to nothing on defense. THJ can knock down shots and slash about the same, has a little more size for guarding wings, and JRich provides that free throw shooting and contributes the extra wing defense we were missing. I have way more confidence in this team without Seth."
George Hill and Seth Curry are getting smoked by Luka too
i think bucks sixers are nicely matched:  giannis/embiid ben/jrue middleton/tobias  i think it could come down to how seth curry and danny green play on a given night.
"Seth curry/Duncan Robinson. In terms of roles on offense, fair comparison"
What do you mean exactly?   There‚Äôs like Seth Curry too.
"We‚Äôve seen Embiid on Giannis before, man. Plus Simmons. Plus Danny Green. Plus Matisse.   Made threes is one thing. Our percentage with our guys that start is another.   Seth Curry and Danny Green shooting threes with elite defense is exactly how to beat you guys.  We have defenders that are not only capable, but are elite at defending your studs. And then Embiid is back in the paint."
"Hawks get worse. Simmons absolutely has to play in a 5 out offense to maximize his effectiveness. This year, we don't play any 5 out because it's blasphemous to ever keep Embiid on the perimeter and Dwight is an excellent rebounder and the worst floor spacer in the league. Capela also has to be in the paint. The Rockets funnily enough had a perfect pairing with Christian Wood. Vucevic, Horford and KAT also work. Most centers won't work. He averaged like 19/7/7 playing with Horford.   For the Sixers, can you imagine Kyrie/Harden on Seth Curry/Trae? If we did get Trae, we'd probably have to start Thybulle, and we're back to a similar offensive problem."
Yea we all know Seth Curry is the best.
Hawks- Dwight Howard  Hornets- Dwight Howard  Rockets- Juwan Howard  Bulls- Jalen Rose  Mavs- Juwan Howard  Blazers- Juwan Howard  Lakers- Dwight Howard  Nuggets- Jalen Rose  Jazz- Jeff Malone  Celtics- Nate Robinson  Pacers- Jalen Rose  Knicks- Jalen Rose  Nets- Jeremy Lin  Cavs- Seth Curry  Heat- Juwan Howard  Magic- Juwan Howard  Warriors- Chris Webber  Clippers- Chauncey Billups  Thunder- Carmelo Anthony  Bucks- Ish Smith  Wolves- Chauncey Billups  Raptors- Jalen Rose  Wizards- Chris Webber  Sixers- Chris Webber  Spurs- Tracy McGrady  Grizzlies- Ish Smith  Pelicans- Ish Smith  Suns- Jalen Rose  Kings-¬† Chris Webber  Pistons- Chris Webber
The Seth Curry for JRich has gotta be a top 5 move this year as well.
"You lost to Houston because Jason Terry, Corey Brewer, and Josh Smith all collectively decided to be elite 3-point shooters at the same time     I would have kept Seth Curry over Josh Richardson"
Can't we just have him be a sniper AND be a defensive stalwart. *cries in seth curry*
"You're right that he can't play against Brooklyn, but don't see why he can't against Philly, he can guard Seth Curry."
"I was against bringing Bledsoe on when they traded for him when he played for Phoenix. He couldn't shoot. I have always wanted the Bucks to sign Seth Curry when he was bouncing around the league, always thought he would fit on the Bucks."
I feel bad for Lillard he should request a trade this off season. George Hill and Seth Curry for Lillard
Who do you guys think is a better player between Forbes and Seth Curry?
"the bucks got Khris, donte, and jrue to backup giannis, who gets walls formed around him all the time. the Sixers tore through the league while dealing with injuries at the same time, they got danny green, seth curry, and tobias to complement joel."
"I mean true we cant assume he'd be worse or better than draymond  But I think its fair to assume hes probably worse than Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid right?  Becauze those are the guys whos shots he'd be taking"
"Morey got rid of the Horford contract and picked up a valuable vet in the trade. He also added Seth Curry who‚Äôs been great for us, brought in Doc, drafted Maxey and signed George Hill at the deadline. He‚Äôs turned the team/organization around a ton in less than a year"
"Bro when you google Seth Curry the first suggestion is Why is Seth Curry not as good as Steph, oucchhhh."
lol yea that is my point. Seth Curry and Danny Green move around too much.
"This team has no Intelligence due to lack of fundamental team defense. It‚Äôs all coaching, we left Seth curry and Harris open all game long Bc the coaches thought it was smart because they are bad at coaching"
"Hell, if Simmons could shoot like Seth Curry, little slower release but still a really good percentage, Simmons would likely be the best player in the league."
Can't believe we got the best contract in the league *and* Seth Curry
Lakers should've tried to get someone like Seth Curry or JJ Redick.
Please never compare anything about Seth curry to Allen iverson
On First Take: who is the better Curry? Steph or Seth. WELL SHANNON ... one curry is in the playoff and the other is home
Seth Curry the new Eddie House? Dude is on a new team every year.
"Seth Curry with the shot, boy"
Saw that Seth Curry three coming from Oklahoma City
We have danny green and seth curry this year instead of Al Horford and Jrich
If Seth Curry misses time and this is what Simmons does on offense then the road for the Sixers to the ECF might be a lot harder than everyone thought.
Did they show what happened to Seth Curry on the TNT feed ?
"Off topic, but I just heard say Marv say ‚ÄúSteph curry‚Äù when he meant ‚ÄúSeth curry‚Äù. Iconic NBA voice, but he‚Äôs well past his expiration date"
Seth curry is basically how Steph will be when he turns 40.
"Dallas invested a lot in perimeter defense this season, trading away Seth Curry to gain Josh Richardson etc,,, this should be regarded as proof of that paying off"
I think it's Seth Curry
Seth Curry
If you want Steph to only shoot and not do Steph things then just put Seth Curry on the team.
Hardaway kicked our ass in that bubble series as well. him and seth curry
Why don‚Äôt they give the ball to the world‚Äôs hottest man Seth curry? Literally dribbling down and wasting a whole possession
"Seth Curry could finish with 38 pts and a +10, but Simmons might finish with a +18. Lul."
I just don't see it with the Sixers.  Seth Curry is probably having the best game he'll have of the entire playoffs and they are barely beating the Hawks right now.
I‚Äôm a neutral fan but if Philly can get Mavericks legend Seth curry a ring I‚Äôd be happy
Ben Simmons is so content to be Seth Curry and Embiid‚Äôs ballboy right now.
The Dallas Mavericks with a doubt lost the Seth Curry/Josh Richardson trade.  No way JR is giving you a 30+piece
So when did Seth Curry become Steph??
Seth Curry inspired by Durant?
Imagine if the 76ers had other players on offense besides Seth Curry and Joel Embiid
seth curry is the glue of this team
Im here for Lou Williams v Seth Curry

Josh Richardson for Seth Curry is the steal of the decade.
The only person who can stop Seth Curry is Doc Rivers

Seth Curry is the best thing named Curry to ever exist.
I love seth curry  Edit: thought I was replying in the main thread
Seth Curry is like perfect for this team. What a signing he was.
"Seth Curry is the truth, the light, and the way."
Seth curry is the secret hero of this series for us the sixers
Who‚Äôs better: Gary Trent or Seth Curry
Seth Curry is my personal Jesus.
"If he has a black hole gravitational force demanding double teams, and can keep himself open he ends up looking that good. He gets really hesitant on his shot if he is contested though. A real #2 needs to be able to take over or at least stall when the #1 is sitting or not feeling it or any other reason, Seth Curry will never be that."
Y‚Äôall swear up and down that Jrue Holiday/Milddleton aren‚Äôt good enough to be second options and think Seth Curry is 2nd option good?
Seth Curry is outplaying Trae. Bogdanovich is hot garbage
Seriously Gallo?? Is the best shot you can get on Seth midget curry??
Trae Young going to have to take over for us to have any shot. And we gotta start doubling a Embiid instead of Seth Curry.
"I fucking love Seth Curry. Guy's like 4'8"" and he runs under the basket like he's going to rebound a long FG. Guy plays with heart and is in every single play."
"Seth Curry, Chris Paul, Tatum, Durant because people forget, Mitchell, Trae Young, Derrick Rose"
Seth Curry looks like a mix of Steph and some Ancient Macedonian king
Mavs coulda desperately used a Seth Curry guy in their series against the Clippers This year
This just in: Seth Curry is a better 3PT shooter than JRich. What‚Äôs wild is how much better he is at pretty much everything else. Except defense but honestly JRich kind of skated on a good defensive reputation
"*Bogdanovic bricks every shot*  Seth Curry after the game, ""I was the difference maker there was nothing else."""
Don‚Äôt let that Seth Curry hater guy see this
I remember when seth curry was a joke esp cuz of steph but goddamn this guy has became an elite role player
I still ask myself how we got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson constantly
Seth Curry is best Curry don't @ me
Seth curry got ahold of Steph‚Äôs SSN
"Y‚Äôall disrespecting SETH Curry who has the better career 3 point percentage. And you all are forgetting the GOAT 3 point shooter, statistically, Steve Kerr.   I‚Äôd also like to give a little shout out to Craig Hodges who made 21/25 shots in a 3 point shoutout at an all star weekend."
No but I think Seth curry will get it
"First, I want to thank God for getting rid of Brooks. I want to thank my mom and dad for paying for cable tv. And lastly, I want to thank Seth Curry for destroying the Wiz playoff chances and not letting Brooks re-sign."
Haralabob is Simmons' buddy and is on their podcast. The suspected burner was also active on that sub. KOC has also been the  only one to praise Seth Curry trade to sixers.
Somehow you'll still find a way to shit on Seth Curry lol
"Ironic.  &gt; Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team‚Äôs games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team‚Äôs roster grew substantially that offseason. **It was Voulgaris who initiated the team‚Äôs acquisitions of Seth Curry** and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. ‚ÄúHe was the only person that believed that,‚Äù one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team‚Äôs first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason. He was traded that offseason.  &gt; Because Voulgaris‚Äô influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office ‚Äî and executives around the league who interacted with them ‚Äî were often confused about who actually held power. ‚ÄúWe had two general managers,‚Äù a team source says. **Nelson remained the team‚Äôs president of basketball operations, a role he has held since 2005, and other executives and agents continued largely communicating with him or Cuban regarding personnel matters. Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J. Redick in 2021**. But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions ‚Äî or explicitly approved them."
Seth Curry sends his regards.
The Seth Curry for Jason Richardson looks pretty bad in hindsight. Drafting was pretty meh but he was literally overridden by Cuban sometimes (Donnie wanted to draft Giannis for example). Most of the draft capital during the Dirk era was spent on acquiring veterans.  The big thing is whether it‚Äôs his fault or not that they couldn‚Äôt sign notable free agents and I wouldn‚Äôt say it is.
hey at least bob wouldnt have traded seth curry for richardson
"He was absolutely ok at his job from 2004-2011 but was absolutely dog shit from 2012 to now.   We can give him a pass for not landing FA it‚Äôs hard to do if not on a coast. But some of his trades were beyond bad like Seth curry for Josh Richardson without scooping up something good in return.     Josh johnson who was actually really solid for us and protected Luka on the court for JJ reddick who was legit injured and didn‚Äôt even wanna come to Dallas and Niko can‚Äôt see the floor bello  in 2021 alone were stupid as hell.   Extending Powell was fine, but the amount of cash they used to do it when he wouldn‚Äôt of gotten that much on the open market was stupid.   Signing Harrison Barnes to the max after signing Wes Mathews to a near max was stupid as hell and we should‚Äôve started the tank a year earlier.    Drafting DSJ was whatever we all liked him but we could‚Äôve very easily traded that pick and tanked and gotten Luka and not had to burn an extra first to the hawks.   The only good moves he‚Äôs made since 2011 was bringing in Vince Carter, Securing THJ in the Kp trade and. drafting Luka but I think that was a team effort on Luka."
Seth Curry had it and it took him a long time to get his conditioning back. Definitely impacted his performance for a while in addition to his minutes after he returned from clearing protocols.
Seth Curry still isn‚Äôt the same and he got it pretty early in the season.
"Brown is a SG/SF and Simmons is a forward who runs point. If you disagree, which of Seth Curry and Danny Green is the other forward alongside Harris?"
"I think the implosion was in large part situational, as in I think both pressure on Ben Simmons from the Philly side and the Hawks being an unusually bad match-up for Simmons made him look worse than he is. The Sixers were a shot away from winning game 1, an injury (albeit to Embiid) away from winning game 5, and a few free throws away (albeit from Ben Simmons) from winning game 3 (I think I got the number right), and if we imagine them coming up against the Bucks, but particularly the Nets, who despite injuries to Kyrie Irving and James Harden were an inch of KD's toes away from winning game 7, Simmons would have been absolutely indispensable to the Sixers' chances in the Conference Finals. His value would be very clear in a series against either KD or Giannis.  Also, in Philly, he was often the second scoring option, basically unless Seth Curry was hot. Minnesota has what he lacks (KAT for shooting from a big, DLo for a playmaker who has the threat of just pulling up) and he has what Minnesota lacks, a good secondary ball-handler, good defense to cover for KAT or DLo depending on opposition, and good passing out of the interior. If you could get him for Ricky Rubio and some young guards/wings that already sit behind Anthony Edwards and Dlo and would sit behind Simmons too if they stayed, doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world.  But I'm a Knicks fan. I'm the kind of person who thought it was realistic that KD, Kawhi, and Demarcus Cousins were coming in 2019. So what do I know lol."
Yikes. Go back to your oddly obsessive Seth curry highlights
A really silly one for Steph Curry would be like... *Seth*
‚Ä¶ do you think Seth Curry is a point guard?
Nobody you named is better than the 76ers players. LOL  Nor have the experience as them.  So how will they make a difference?     Who's shooting better than Danny Green?  What about Tobias?  Orrrr how about Seth Curry? George Hill?
"Seth Curry making 8 million a year played soooo much better than Simmons in that series and people are like oh hell no he‚Äôs worth a shitload more than dlo  Dlo can shoot and was also an all star recently, some philly fans still in denial of how much his value tanked"
"I saw someone suggest a package around Rubio lol.  Simmons makes Rubio look like Seth Curry, so I guess it'd be an upgrade on the offensive side."
"I was being facetious, we‚Äôre definitely giving Gary a nice contract this summer   And no comment on the curry-j rich trade, I can‚Äôt imagine how painful it must have been for y‚Äôall to watch seth during these playoffs"
"CJ isn't $25 mil/year better than Seth Curry, therefore he's a bit redundant honestly given we're already cash strapped. Neither of them defend well and they both average 3-4 assists/game. I don't think an extra 8-10ppg is worth another $25 mil personally, there are other positions we could use upgrades on more."
"what????? let GTJ walk then, mavs could use him after basically giving away seth curry for the carcass of Josh Richardson"
"&gt;If he was on the Wolves he would not need to carry ANY offensive load   That's true only if the Sixers don't get anything of value from the Wolves back, which isn't a realistic trade to begin with. You gotta remember this dude was the 4th option on Philly... behind Tobias Harris and Seth Curry lol."
Lowry is a free agent.  Turning simmons to beasley and rubio will make sixers worse.  They have seth curry who is a better shooter and danny green might take a paycut there.
Surely Seth Curry is a given here
"Want Dame, not CJ. CJ is not $25 mil/year better than Seth Curry in my opinion."
"Me desperately hoping Morey can work his magic to somehow replace Simmons with Dame. I mean he managed to turn Horford and Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry so maybe it just might be possible smh  Everyone who's not a Suns, Bucks, or Hawks fan is in shambles rn basketball sucks (jk I'm looking forward to a Suns - Bucks (most likely) final but the fallout of these playoffs has been rough for most teams it seems.)"
"NBD, multi team trade and Seth Curry to Portland."
"At least the rockets had Morey as a GM, he brought in CP3 and they woulda made the finals if he didn‚Äôt get hurt against the warriors. All the blazers have done in Dame‚Äôs prime is lose LaMarcus Aldridge and bring in guys like Kanter, RoCo (one year), Seth Curry (one year), and Melo. Not even a comparison."
Could also go Dame/Curry/Thybulle/Harris/Embiid if Seth turns the recent heat he found in the playoffs into a regular thing.
If Seth Curry is a deal breaker for Morrey then he shouldn‚Äôt be a GM.
"Dame and Embiid alone would be scary enough. The sixers would have a decent supporting cast on top of that with players like Tobias Harris and Seth Curry. I don't know that it would be quite enough for guaranteed contender status, considering how stacked some of the other teams are if they manage to avoid injuries, but that would be a sixers team I'd love to watch."
"Seth Curry, Ben Simmons, maxey, shake, thybulle, all our pick swaps, and maybe even Harris for good measure"
"Seth curry, pascal siakam, josh childress, darth vader,  simone biles"
I just want the Lakers to get Seth Curry. That‚Äôd be perfect to me.
I could definitely see the Mavs pulling the upset. Losing Seth Curry was a huge blow for y‚Äôall.
"Have you heard about PnR?  Beverly was on another player too but Luka went for him every possesion until he was put on the bench for the rest of the series. Same thing with Lebron and Lou Williams in the regular season last year. Same thing how Kawhi went on Seth Curry in the playoffs last year.  Luka would call DFS for a PnR and then attack Trae. Luka would feast on a team like Hawks who have Trae,Huerter and Lou."
"You dont think his team mates want him to be a positive asset to the team and actually contribut to winning? Im not suggesting he take 40 shots for a whole season. The entire team knows they stand no chance without Ben being their 2nd best player. If coach thinks it will work, you trust the coach. If Ben was my team mate i would be begging him to make a massive change. You can do it in pre season, you can do it in summer ball. You can do it in practice. However you need to manage it you figure it out. But you are not going ANYWHERE without him completely changing his approach. Plus a guy like seth curry would love to see ben be hyper aggressive, when he turns the corner, Seth is going to get so many open looks he will average 7 made 3s a night"
seth curry got covid and the sixers played the wizards 2 nights before we did. its on the sixers!
To Philly for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry.
"By working out the rest you mean change coach, change GM, trade for a terrible ""stretch 5"" and trade Seth Curry for a Josh Richardson?"
Seth Curry
Is that any different from Seth curry?   Isn‚Äôt it still a luxury to have guys that can make over 200 threes a season   That type of spacing next to stars is huge.
pretty sure seth thinks he‚Äôs as good as steph curry
Mr and Mrs. Curry reenact First Take talking about Seth and Steph‚Äôs respective basketball careers and rating them as players
"This is such a stupid question. You really think the Curry family has the personality of ESPN talking heads and reddit clowns on r/nba ?  They are probably very proud of Seth, I mean he's a fucking professional NBA player who is doing very well in life"
CJ might actually be worthwhile. You guys need a better shot creating guard than Seth Curry. And you have enough defenders around him like Embiid and Matisse to cover for his lack of defense
"If im the 76ers, I do NOT trade Ben Simmons for McCollum.   First of all, Seth Curry can ALMOST do what McCollum does.  McCollum is def the more reliable, and better player, but it makes no sense to lose Ben Simmons for McCollum when you already have Seth Curry.   Second of all, Simmons isn't missing much to become better. If I'm not mistaken , he shot 65% from ft range in the regular season? If he just does that, and attacks the basket, the 76ers would be in the ECF right now, and would have a fighting chance vs the bucks to make it to the finals.  If im the 76ers, I am NOT gonna panic much.   Help embiid get healthy, help Simmons shoot fts and be more confident attacking, and you're already in a good place.  If the 76ers give up Simmons for McCollum, their defense would take a huge hit, and you couldn't even play McCollum and Seth Curry at the same time. Cause teams would just switch and attack you."
I'm not sure I've ever seen Seth Curry or Jalen Brunson dunk
"Wiggins, 7, 14, 2023 protected First for Simmons and Seth curry does that work?? I'm not sure about cap rules"
"Ben Simmons: ‚ÄúFor instance, people say, 'Ben you should shoot!' But if I can get Seth Curry the ball for a f---ing shot, why would I shoot?‚Äù"
"Thing is though, Bucks don't have a weak defensive player like Seth Curry on the starting line up for role players to exploit"
sorry K'Von...Middleton ain't Seth Curry
"Thought we were over this ""opposition is incapable of missing a 3"" bullshit when we got past Seth Curry but I guess not lol"
"I mean, this year they are good without Luka because of their defense. Starting lineup just couldn't defend anyone, sure Luka ain't helping, but he isn't the reason they sucked.  On offense they couldn't do anything without him. And thats really weird considering how last season they were crushing teams on offense. Even without Luka.  I've tried to ask Mavs fans who are just screaming about how Luka has no help and no one can create any offense. How they had 113 offensive rating without him on the floor last season, with pretty much the same personal, but I never got any answers..  I guess Seth Curry helped. But, I mean, it can't really be a 12ppg guy with basically zero playmaking who can just transform an offense like that."
Seth Curry would be a much more beneficial trade
"Luka was guarded by paul george, kawhi leonard, pat bev, batum, and morris sr. Are you actually that deluded to say the clips have worse defense than seth fucking curry"
"They have several good shooters in a 5-out offense and let Luka do his thing for 15 seconds per possession. It‚Äôs not perfect, but no roster is perfectly constructed. If they had Seth curry this year, nobody would be complaining as much"
Oubre for Seth Curry
"only Curry that might like Mavs ir Seth, who got traded to a better situation."
"Thats a good value for Ben right now, Beasley is like Seth Curry. Dlo is another great shooter that will fit well with Embiid and wont be clogging the paint and isnt afraid to score."
McCollum is just a better Seth Curry for a lot more money. Barely moves the needle
Just as long as Seth Curry isn‚Äôt on the team
"Thank you, I don't understand why this is being thrown around like it makes sense. He's like 130% of Seth Curry for like 300% the salary  I think a Mike Conley+1st for Ben Simmons trade makes much more sense. Someone much more distinct in his skill sets and able to control an offense, not just create off a pick and roll a bit."
Put Seth Curry at SF
"Curry is good looking, he got his mama genes unlike Seth  Curry is like what you would create a marketable guy, he's like a taller Michael Ealy which girls love, lightskin with blue/green eyes and 6'3"
"Do you think Luka has something to do with the Mayhem in Dallas. Like behind the scenes he is kind of making demands about what it will take for him to re-sign as a MAV?  I've heard he and Porzingas don't like each other. I doubt Luka liked the Seth Curry for Richardson swap. Maybe he also had some issues with Carlisle?   Kidd doesn't have a great track record as a coach, and is considered a ""player's coach"" maybe Kidd=Luka was a swipe against whatever their behind the scenes mentalities are.  Before this season I couldn't imagine Dallas having this kind of organizational upheaval. The only person with that kind of leverage to me would seem to be Luka."
"CJ is like a better version of Seth Curry. knock down 3pt guy, but doesn't really create his own shot super well, and doesn't make plays for others a ton. I think that's fine if you can pair him with another primary ball handler, but again, CJ is like a 30-40% Seth upgrade, a player you already have"
seth curry was hitting some tough shots last series. He really impressed me.
Yep - we played them games 6 and 7 of the season. I thought he struggled to get by Seth Curry on the dribble and the jump passes where he left his feet with no plan reminded me a lot of MCW.  But once he got into the starting lineup and that team started to gel it was pretty clear he was a level or two above MCW's rookie year. And his passing vision is light years ahead of anything MCW has shown.
I saw one that said Ben Simmons would develop shooting like jj reddick/Seth curry since he‚Äôs been playing with some of the greatest off-ball shooters his whole career.
"no u clown, he shoots tough shots that lower his 3 pt percentage. if he was shooting the threes seth curry shot, his percentage would be above 40%"
"Tobi was the third option in the hawks series, after embiid and seth curry  and he shit the bed  Yeah you want more offensively from simmons but there was a lot of failure to go around in that series, danny green being injured was really bad for them too"
"they have multiple shot creators around embiid, the only one who showed up last series was seth curry  where was tobi, 35 million dollar vanishing act"
"It‚Äôs a little better than PTS and Assists separately, sure, but it gives a lot of weight to assisting, which isn‚Äôt always accurate.   Case in point, Ben Simmons would have quite a few PRF, but only because he just hands the ball off the Seth Curry for a 3. He didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything, and yet he‚Äôs rewarded the same as Seth, who made the 3."
Ok fine. Take Seth Curry
"&gt;CJ works on our team, but don't see it for Ben.  I actually think he's pretty redundant with a continually evolving Seth Curry who we already have, on a far cheaper contract. Neither of them are true PGs. Neither of them are great defenders. Both of them can score in bunches and space the floor out."
"Wonderful, he‚Äôs still a max contract getting benched at the end of games because his offense is so abysmal that Seth Curry running point is more effective."
Maybe he‚Äôs just not actually that bad on defense. Kevin Huerter was able to play Seth Curry off the floor just last series.
That's literally one of their calling cards. Seth Curry didn't get torched by accident. The Hawks will actively find Gallo so he can post up and shoot (fadeaway) jumpers all day over much shorter guys. Same for John Collins.
Seth Curry is suppose to be the Sixth Man
I mean he did end up being right about abusing Seth Curry.
"&gt; PHI receives: CJ McCollum, Robert Covington POR receives: Ben Simmons, Seth Curry  I pitched this trade like a week and a half ago and Sixers fans destroyed me for suggesting it."
"I dunno, the goal posts get moved every series. Suddenly Ben Simmons is absolute trash, Tobias Harris is a volume shooter scrub, Thybulle and Maxey are young and inexperienced, and Seth Curry is back to being a role player. And the Hawks team of 0 all-stars or all-nba players is suddenly a superteam."
Ima keep it hot the best chance at the hawks losing was prolly the philly series cause the hawks had no answer for embiid and Seth curry could explode easily‚Ä¶the bucks are a team u can beat if u force jumpers and keep them out the paint‚Ä¶capela can sit on giannis as long as he wants
He‚Äôs talking about Seth Curry
It's better though. Not only did he cheat on Doc Rivers daughter with a stripper who is now his fiance. He only stayed with her after she turned down the abortion money. And now Seth Curry is married to Doc Rivers' daughter. Doc Rivers coached this man on the Clippers  last year too lmao.
Are you looking at playoff true shooting üòÇ because that‚Äôs not what bogi is doing with the bum knee also bogi averaged 8 less ppg and get a lot of wide open catch and shoot threes y‚Äôall mad weird you also think Seth curry is better then cj?   Bc   Seth curry TS% 64  Cj 57%   ü§°
"&gt; By the time Steph, Dame, and Curry lose it  Wow you have Seth as a top 3 point guard?"
And Seth Curry in training camp too!
It's a nice change not seeing Seth Curry wide open every other possession.
"He has a high probability to score that again if he‚Äôs facing someone like of Seth Curry‚Äôs defensive prowess.   I never said they shouldve subbed Curry outright, they barely helped him on pnrs. One problem with Curry handling the ball was that he isnt a good playmaker, just a good shot maker. Their offense became stagnant with Curry trying to create offense. If he gets stopped, theyve lost a lot of time and the only outlet is to a mispositioned Embiid who needs to make something happen out of nothing. Tobias wasnt a problem except for game 5 onwards as he couldnt get in rhythm. Im not gonna be a headcoach here and think of ways for Rivers. But his records show. When he should be winning, he wasnt. He gets leads that always get blown up.   He fell in love with curry handling the ball and their offense got stagnant. Barely played young guys like  usual.   Not sure where you saw me contradicting myself prior, or you‚Äôre fighting against your own strawmen."
"I mean the loss was not entirely on Simmons‚Ä¶Doc, Embid, and Tobias each deserve a slice of blame.   Doc once again did nothing from a coaching perspective, Embid was awful in the 2nd half of these games, and Tobias gets paid to be a 2nd option but too often looks like a role player. Seth Curry had a better series IMO."
"If you are willing to trade some of your young bench, ya that's a solid team. Seth Curry/CJ with Kanter has proven to be western conference finalist quality starters, and that's your bench. You would just need to grab a solid defensive/play making point huard like Caruso and you guys are golden."
imagine if seth curry was on those clippers too and Austin Rivers
"If we take Simmons, we will finish bottom of South West.  We gave Seth Curry to Philly, he did his job. Philly gave us a guy who was supposed to be a good defender with decent 3 pt shooting. He just didn't perform.   We will try our luck outscoring opponents. Yes, it is important for us to fix our porous defence but doing it by signing offensively challenged max contract players would be stupid."
you can take half of steph and half of seth!  steth curry
That's like saying the Sixers are shit because Seth Curry was arguably their 2nd best performer in our series.   THJ was shooting 40% from 3 on 8 attempts per game lmao.
"Because they don't have an offensive blackhole in Simmons? Giannis is obv a great player while Middleton has come up consistently in these playoffs and can drop 30+ himself as well, Khris is averaging 23, Jrue ain't doing that badly either, where he's failing in offense he's doing MUCH better on the defensive end and overall outside of Seth Curry I'd say the Sixers role play worse than the Bucks role players."
"The black ball part was when nobody would offer him another contract in the NBA, just like what happened to Kaepernik when his contract expired.   It's be like if Seth Curry decided to kneel today, and then could years from now nobody would sign him even though he is a top 3 point shooter."
"Ah yes those 12mpg where it was bench vs bench with minimal starters on and flamethrowers like Seth curry get a green light  Also defensively isn‚Äôt even close. Luka might not be good but he‚Äôs tall and isn‚Äôt hunted like trae, who was literally the worst defender in the league last year"
"I would honestly say Marcus Morris. Like fuck that guy, he stepped out of bounds on a game winner vs us and then another time held onto Seth curry from the bench during a clutch situation"
Honestly trading some of those picks to teams without any picks for young players whose contracts are running to the end or good role players would be a good move. Kinda like how the sixers went and got seth curry.
"Had NBA size too. Could've been a Seth Curry type player at least, he was always the best shooter on their high school teams. How you gonna steal from a store in China of all places when you're potentially on the way to the NBA tho? Smfh"
"I'm not too excited about this draft class, so I honestly wouldn't mind trading for Simmons. We love players who play tough D, so I think it might be a good fit. Especially if, just to spite his old fans, he actually works on his shooting. lol  Send him and Seth Curry or something, I'd take it."
"Tobias Harris was balling this season, Danny Green and Seth Curry are top level role players. They have a great team besides Ben and Doc."

"It was all about abusing Seth Curry in the end.  The sixers have a lot of good individual defenders, except Curry (he puts effort no doubt about it but he‚Äôs limited). And of course you attack the weak link. PLAYOFF BASKETBALL, BABY"
This.   Steve played into modern NBA media by saying he wouldn't make an NBA roster today. Which is silly.  He'd have a Seth curry like role/Eddie house like role on any team.
Seth Curry.
"He is the perfect complement to the sixers. Seeing what Seth Curry did ( a lesser CJ) proved that.   I wasn‚Äôt suggesting 3-10 ft was midrange (something CJ isn‚Äôt the greatest at tbh) but 10-16 ft is definitely mid range.  The key is 16 feet wide. 8 feet on either side of The basket. Therefore any shot at 10 feet plus is well outside the paint. The free throw line to the middle of the hoop is just under 14 feet. You‚Äôre conflating long 2s as midrange when in reality it‚Äôs not. And even taking that into account CJ the last 3 years has been 50% at 10 feet to the 3p line   10-16 50%   16-3p 50%  It wasn‚Äôt until KD went to gsw and Brooklyn where he is above 45% at 16ft -3p line. He‚Äôs been 48 or 55 since.  Given CJ has been getting better every year. Best year statistically yet. Why can‚Äôt he also become even more efficient? Especially when his game isn‚Äôt predicated on athleticism.  KD was terribly inefficient in OKC- why? He played with inarguably high usage pgs who dominated the ball and expected him to bail them out late in the shot clock. CJ is accustomed to similar things happen. And it‚Äôs okay because you entrust dame with that role. But it‚Äôs no coincidence that when KD moved to a team that emphasizes ball movement (and him having strong teammates who never get him doubled) that his efficiency went up and his assist totals.    Ok now add the usage of Nurkic and Lillard vs 2 players. You‚Äôre twisting the stats. You can‚Äôt add up the possessions 2 players have the ball vs 1. Nurkic passes out of the post too.  You realize Levert actually had a lower assist total at Indiana right? 4.9 v 6 at Brooklyn. He also had a higher usage. He also had a higher usage than CJ (surprisingly)  He also had higher turnover rate. 2.2 a game.  He also had a pg in Brogdon who is combo guard more suited to someone else initiating the offense and him shooting (very well) from catch and shoots. Effectively Levert took on a more ball handling role.   Higher usage, elevated ball handling role equals more assists.   Now if you can do 4.7 assists on 1.4 turnovers. That‚Äôs 3.35 assists per turnover which is elite ballhandling.   KD is the best player in the world. What‚Äôs your point. I used him as a reference to say the best player in the world is hardly for his career more effective at the mid range than CJ, something you trashed CJ for saying he takes dumb early midrange shots. (Still waiting for those stats)   Ppl sag more off Ben.   Here‚Äôs a compilation of cp3 midrange mostly in the 11-17 foot [range](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tkzDMw02r2I)"
"yeah i suggested that trade to my friends a few days ago and they said it was decent. I like it for Philly, considerable spacing improvement and with beasley maybe you can flip Seth Curry for a 3 and D wing. If the sixers trade simmons it wont be the only move they make"
Dell curry wins cause he shot out Steph and Seth
"Curry genes are for real , these guys are designed for excellence. When they telling you that shooting is a matter of work alone just point to the Curry family.   No way 3 so closely related people are top shooters (prolly ever) merely due to equal amounts of hard work between them. Seth was doing Steph things at times in his latest playoff run, full with receiving the ball badly / fuddling and making it anyway. Those dudes shot mechanics come natural to them, like second nature, damn..."
Sonya Curry &gt; Dell+Steph+Seth
Seth Curry for JRich and I can‚Äôt be convinced otherwise.
"Fuck man, we must not meet the same people. 2 hours ago i saw a guy who fucking look like Steph Curry, you would swear he is his brother and not Seth.  Mf never heard of Curry lol"
Yeah but I also dont see you guys bringing that team back as is. So you trading tobi and seth curry for someone?
"Lmao what in the hell, have you watched basketball this year?  KD tied for 6th in the league on 3pt% this season  No not for players over 6‚Äô10 that is for the entire league he shot 45% last year, tied with Seth Curry who is much shorter and is also not really creating his own offense as he‚Äôs the 4th option  Like that‚Äôs so wrong, KD has been very elite this year at shooting and it‚Äôs fucking stupid to go under the screen and let Lopez fall back"
Yeah butler was fantastic this season and without Seth curry our spacing would have looked great
He became seth curry in the 3rd quarter
"Seth Curry. He's undersized, negative wingspan, not that athletic, basically ticks non of the boxes except 3pt shooting. Went undrafted and slowly worked his way up from bouncing around the league on 10 day contracts to a solid bench player in sacramento, then a fringe starter in dallas, then arguably the 2nd/3rd best player in his playoff run with Philly this year."
"I mean I thought the Sixers were shit a year ago, and Morey somehow managed to finesse Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and trade Danny Green for that Al Horford contract. Those two players were just what they needed. The team didn‚Äôt win this year, but those were impressive moves nonetheless.   I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if ownership was the main factor in a Harden for Ben Simpson‚Äôs deal not getting done."
"Listed heights and weights are meaningless in the NBA. KD is listed as 6'10"" but he is actually about half an inch shorter than Brook Lopez. When they stand next to each other Giannis has at least 2 inches on Simmons and is so much more jacked.  My point is not that Seth Curry is as good as Steph or that Khris is as good as KD. That would be as stupid as saying Ben Simmons is as good as Giannis. Each pair of players I mentioned have similar playstyles, just one the two are FAR better than the other.  Giannis is the most dominant interior scorer since Shaq and has averaged about double the points and rebounds of Simmons over the last 3 years on about 2.5 fewer assists.  Like I keep saying, you're not getting paid for your hot takes so you just look fucking stupid."
"The biggest downgrade of the Dallas roster to me, particularly in the playoffs was missing Seth Curry. That guy coulda really put the nail in the coffin of a lot of our games against each other. He *killed* us in 2020.   From what you‚Äôre describing, maybe Mike Conley would be a better target?"
Seth Curry
"You give me the other top TS%, and then let's examine the context for it. I could mention that both Rudy Gobert (.736 in 376 minutes) and Seth Curry (.727 in 381 minutes) have better TS%, but that proves nothing without context.  Gobert has never shot better than expected in a season, based on shot distance and frequency. (His best season was -0.1% last year.) Meanwhile, Curry is a top-tier shooter who will never get his brother's shine because he doesn't create his own shots the way Steph does. But he still had one heck of a postseason.  The glaring point people want to skirt around is that shot creation generally facing much tougher defense than people receiving the ball while already open. It's a frickin given that people suddenly chose to ignore for the sake of defending the superficiality of present-day analytics.  Like at least give me a USG% of 20 or greater or something before I take this thing to the bank when comparing it to what CP3 and Book are doing."
I did rebut it. You can't just say someone with a similar style but absurdly better the same and think you've got a real argument.   Saying Ben Simmons and Giannid are the same is damn near as stupid as saying Steph and Seth Curry are the same. Giannis is FAR more dominating than Simmons and to pretend otherwise makes Stephen A look smart.
How tf would they not mention Ayton? What about Seth Curry?
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It‚Äôs the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don‚Äôt have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he‚Äôs 66th. He‚Äôs tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
i understand curry being top 5 but why would you add seth and leave out his brother
"The thing with Lavine and Beal is they can essentially chose their next teams given they are expiring contracts, if Beal wants to play with long time friend Tatum in Boston and Lavine wants to go win/make mad marketing dollars with Luka in Dallas and their new Nike exec GM then there is no point trading Simmons+Maxey for either.  Lillard is an option but that‚Äôs not happening this season, next year it needs to be a 3 teams deal because the rebuilding Blazers don‚Äôt want 3 years of Simmons when they will be tanking for at least 2 of those years anyway.  So really it depends what‚Äôs the most another team will give up for Simmons that would interest the Blazers because even after this season Lillard has 2 years under contract he can‚Äôt force his way to one destination.  Yes McCollum is absolutely without question an upgrade over Simmons, Simmons against solid defenses is a non factor in the playoffs.  I wouldn‚Äôt do McCollum for Simmons straight up but if it‚Äôs McCollum+Covington or McCollum+picks you have to strongly consider it, it also opens the door to trade Seth Curry which would be welcomed because he is horrendous on defense and shouldn‚Äôt be playing crunch time unless the team needs points in a hurry."
"So Steph Curry didn't work his way up either, because his dad is a former NBA player ? Same for Klay, Seth, Etc"
"Bron, KD, Curry, Harden, Kyrie, Embiid, Giannis, Trae, Luka, AD, Jokic, Wiggins, Beal, Kawhi, PG, LaVine, Draymond, Murray, Lowry, FVV, Serge, SETH  ... top 20 LOL lucky to be top 50"
There's probably a middle ground where a connection can get your foot in the door but to get to the top requires actual sweat equity. Seth Curry definitely got more chances because his brother was Steph but he made the most of them. I'm not gonna invalidate Seth's career because the Warriors gave him his first chance as an UDFA/D-league player months after he went undrafted.
The question was disrespectful. Klay is on a completely different level than Harris and Robinson.  It would be like if Trae missed time and someone asked how he's different from Seth Curry.
They are the Hazards of NBA.  Is there another Curry brother other than Steph and Seth?
"Seth Curry was on our squad because he was Steph's brother for a while, now he's a serious player.  Damian Lee was on our squad because he's Steph's brother in law.  Now he's carved out a good role for himself and has played well for us at times.  Who knows, maybe Thanassis becomes a better player."
Seth Curry and Dejounte Murray obviously
"I disagree. I think part of the problem with Lloyd Pierce is he was brought in as a coach because of his focus on player development. Then this year he was asked to flip the switch, and he either couldn't get the team to buy into a new message, or he's just not a winning coach.   Nate McMillan not only created a winning culture with a winning message, but he out-coached the hell out of Thibs and Doc, and at times Bud. Some of his adjustments late into games were brilliant and were the difference. The comeback Game 5 vs Philly started when  they put Gallo and Lou Will in, and began exploiting matchups against Seth Curry on defense, and then they ran an unusual small lineup with Lou Will, Trae, and Gallo that feasted on the matchups Trae provided. Game 7 with Heurter dropping 27 was similar, they abused Seth Curry's size with Heurter (who's about half a foot taller). Stuff like that is rare, his flexibility has been the stuff fans dream of."
Seth Curry?
His are close to empty assists  Alot of them are in transition just passing it to an open Joel Embiid or Seth Curry
Seth Curry üî•
"If Markus Howard could figure out the NBA game, he could put up points in bunches. He was electric in college. I loved watching him at Marquette. Prob never get to steph curry level, but maybe Seth Curry level."
A Seth Curry leap might happen which is more impressive
"I like:  - Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounpo because they sound like Greek Gods   - Also Lonzo Ball because that's just a perfect name for an NBA player (LaMelo is such a stupid first name that it cancels out the Ball last name)   - Steph and Seth Curry also got some nice names  - Danilo Galinari and Rajon Rondo are also great, as you mentioned  - I also like Rudy Gobert when spoken in a heavy French accent  - J.R. Smith is dope too even if it's kinda basic"
Luka is gonna be gone after the RFA extension. That is guaranteed with how badly Cuban is fucking up the Mavericks.   &gt;Hiring Jason Kidd  Literally the dumbest decision by a franchise in the last 20+ years (even worse than trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson LMAO).   Hell Luka may just take the QO to get away from that disastrous situation.
Seth curry.
~~Ben Simmons~~ Seth Curry beat Russ in round 1 without Embiid. He‚Äôs the better player rn even after the Hawks series
"Huerter truly was on fire that series. He does make the right reads and such was a horrid defender his second and first half of 3rd season. He was decent as a rookie. He has a high IQ and we expect him to make the right play, he used to be a point guard. The cause-effect of him torching you guys was him drawing a tougher defender the whole Milwaukee series. Seth Curry is a lot easier to score on them Jrue Holiday, Tucker, or Middleton.  Thybulle just needs to be a can‚Äôt leave open kind of shooter and master off ball cutting. You want him to focus on locking down his opponent. I‚Äôve noticed that when players expand their game too much they forget what got them there. Collins used to be an absolute animal on both sides of the glass, but as his offensive game progressed, we saw him rarely hit the glass, especially on the offensive side. You might look at this stats in his 2nd and 3rd season and say how? He was 20/10, right? With the right positioning and discipline, he could actually lead the league in rebounding during the regular season. Half way through his second season I feel he forgot his greatest skill. He had stints in the playoffs where his offensive rebounding really shined but it was not consistent and hasn‚Äôt been for a long time despite the numbers. He grabs the number of rebounds he does now due to his incredible leaping ability."
"Even if he doesn't improve, consider what you get with Ben:  Half court set: stands in the dunker's spot. That's okay, you've got Horford back who would stretch the floor. TT is shipped off. Only issue is synergy with Timelord, who I do believe will take a leap in development next year.  Fast break: The Lebron setup, with a scary freight train with perfect passing vision running down the court and shooters spread out.  Defense: Defense.  Marcus Smart is the only valuable piece in that theoretical trade. Tristain Thompson has some value, but the rest of the package is negligible at best, and Seth Curry is better than Payton Pritchard by all measurable accounts."
"Zach LaVine, Julius Randle, Marcus Smart, Christian Wood, Royce ONeale, Seth Curry"
"Cam Payne, then Seth Curry.  TJ Warren would be up there if he wasn't always hurt"
Seth Curry is dirt cheap for how he plays.
You brought up Seth curry as an example like the dude wasn‚Äôt shooting as good as any player in the league. Every time Philly tries to fix a young players form it gets worse.
Stacked with Seth Curry in the starting 5 is questionable
"&gt;I would really dispute that. Those Kings teams were dire.  2016 squad had Gay, Rondo, Collison and some solid roleplayers like Seth Curry, Bellenelli, Koufus. Not world beaters by any stretch but Jokic just had MPJ/Gordon/Rivers + d-leaguers and still beat nuclear mode Damian Lillard.   At the very least it's the same ballpark and that Cousins team had no business being as bad as it was (\~30 wins) if he was anywhere remotely close to the All-NBA level player people are saying he was.   &gt;It's much easier to be efficient on better teams.  And it's easier to volume score on bad teams. Cousins simply wouldn't have been a 25ppg scorer on a contender, and if he's not leading the team in scoring then his other flaws (defense etc) are just highlighted even more."
"Embiid was forced to do **so much** though. I don't think that's a fair point to take a lot of the onus off on the guy who refuses to shoot the ball or be aggressive and put it on the only guy on the team that's aggressive and plays at an MVP-level.   Other than Seth Curry, Furkan Korkmaz, Shake Milton, and Tyrese Maxey, of course, but none of those guys are All-NBA caliber players."
"You‚Äôre correct that Ingram mostly shoots 3s above the break both this year and last.  But Ingram took 1.5 more catch and shoot 3s per game than pull up 3s and shot 43.2% on them. And while he attempted less than he had the previous year, he was still making only .4 per game fewer than last year.   He averages more made catch and shoot 3s than Huerter, Gallinari, Ingles, Reggie Jackson and Seth Curry and the same as Gary Trent Jr, Mikal Bridges, and Norman Powell."
"I just remember George Karl for shitting on Seth Curry, And Cousins taking up for Seth."
Ben and Seth Curry for Kuzma
"rodney hood was amazing for us until his leg blew up, basically lost a 6th man/starting caliber player (at a position of need) for nothing  same with collins, he's extremely useful and basically lost 2 seasons of injuries after being healthy his whole life  seth curry was amazing but we knew he'd only be around for that year, basically signed with us to rehab lol"
"he's great at:  -drafting guards (dame, cj, etc)  -drafting in the 2nd round (crabbe, trent jr, didn't he draft deandre jordan?)  he's good at:   -making small improvement trades (the nurk trade which ended up being a steal, rodney hood)  -min/MLE FA signings (i think? not invested enough to look at past history lol but seth curry/kanter/melo were all great pickups)   he's awful at big FA signings, big trades, and apparently fucking PR, and he's way too loyal to 'his guys' e.g. billups, older players he's drafted (like bringing in old players he's drafted or paying too much to retain players), etc  should have been fired for sure though"
"Finally, Seth Curry can take 25 shots a game"
seth curry
"Jazz new FO decides offense doesn't matter and they aren't keeping Conley and can't see Mitchell staying anyway. Says fuck it and trades Mitchell with Bogdanovic to Philly, Philly send back Thybulle and Simmons, and that being in Memphis to get Melton to the Jazz, and Shake Milton and Seth Curry to the Grizzlies. Sixers add wing shooting and a guy who is a star and better in the playoffs, Utah has an image defensive lineup with bad spacing but more salary flexibility without the large chunk contracts, and Memphis turns Melton into Curry and Milton who complement Morant's offensive game perfectly."
A Seth Curry and CJ McCollum back court would get absolutely torched on the defensive end and neither of those guys are true point guards.
"Brogdon isn't as good as CJ, especially on offense, BUT he is a larger combo guard who can matchup with SGs and wings that Seth Curry can't guard.  The fit is there though if enough compensation was in the rest of the trade."
Things Doc Rivers has done well.  Utilise Seth Curry in a more effective way than other teams.  Run Tobias Harris at his ideal position  Make adjustments with Tyrese Maxey/Shake Milton to help swing games.  The issue with the sixers is that they don't have a real pg who can properly run a half court offense (unless you count an old George Hill who didn't cut it as a starting PG in 2018 let alone now).  Doc Rivers isn't the best coach ever but just two seasons ago he lead one of the most star-starved teams to the West playoffs in a decade+. He's not the greatest coach but overall he has more positives than negatives.  Also Scott Brooks made the playoffs lol
Perimeter scoring option other than Seth Curry?  SIGN HIM UP
Well they are married now and his ex-gf found a better partnership in Seth Curry so it works out for both parties.  Don't get why random people are holding on to this and being bitter about it like it was their own relationship but okay ....
Who the fuck is he gonna run the PnR with? Seth Curry?
"Bruh, they were on a break, and he‚Äôs since had another kid with the girl and by all accounts has been an incredible father.  Like I don‚Äôt get it, it was years ago. Is this really a valid reason to hate somebody? Especially when his Ex seems more than happy with Seth curry. I feel like everyone involved has moved on while the court of public opinion hasn‚Äôt."
Maybe you pull off a sign-and-trade with the Mavs. They clearly are missing a Seth Curry sized hole on offense and Robinson is  probably the best option available
"And, Seth Curry averaged 21 points on 79% TS. Stop embarrassing yourself and leave me alone."
"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."
"Well tbf I thought he was good about benching Simmons against the Hawks. The problem is he then had to depend on Seth Curry to facilitate and score. Part of it is on the players (with Simmons, Harris especially underperforming imo), Embiid injured, and also on Doc"
"I mean, Steph *technically* played with Seth Curry, but that was literally just the preseason man, shouldn't be a knock on Steph."
It's actually not the best option for the Sixers.... Dame trade probably wouldn't be for Simmons straight up though. The Sixers would also likely have to give up one of their scoring guards like Maxey or Seth Curry.
"He was dumb enough to sign him in the first place. What kind of idiot signs a 30% career 3 pt shooter (non big) to an important role with LBJ on the team? A team who‚Äôs biggest weakness on the title run was horrid shooting. I hated this signing from the start and was right , bunch of clowns in media saying his ONE YEAR of ok shooting was who he was ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It depresses me thinking we could‚Äôve had Seth curry. I‚Äôm worried they resign this scrub who can‚Äôt shoot/space for shit and had been a liability all year."
"The sixers. Down the stretch, the sixers didn't have a real point guard other than George Hill who's too old and Seth Curry who is more of a combo guard."
"He's engaged to her now, after his former girlfriend, Callie Rivers (the daughter of Doc) broke up with him for cheating on her with the same stripper. Callie Rivers is now married to Seth Curry.  George and Daniela Rajic have two daughters.  This is practically British levels of tabloid WAG-following."
Seth Curry totally sucked for several weeks after COVID... are there any other players to compare?
He had a lil more longevity than that lol. I‚Äôd say seth curry with more success.
"Like Seth curry in the Philadelphia series got a chance to show off when others wouldn't step up, or Blake Griffin when kyrie and harden went down. Tons of role players or players we thought were done stepped up when it mattered. Unfortunately both examples here weren't enough to win but none the less they stepped up."
IS CAM REDDISH THE NEXT SETH CURRY?
Nah Bucks are worse. Their team is way more talented than the Philadelphia Embild and Seth Curry show.
Forbes thinks he‚Äôs Seth Curry
"Ya Heurter looked like an all-star when he was on Curry.  That was the Key IMO.  Seth was shooting 60% from 3, and every time he shot a 3, Heurter came back and got 2."
"150 fga really isn‚Äôt that high of a mark at all. From 1960 to 1973, Wilt only had 3 postseason runs with less than 150 fga. In 1961 he lost in the first round and put up 96 shot attempts, in 1966 he lost in the first round and put up 110 shot attempts, and in his last playoff run he put up 118 shot attempts in 3 rounds.   150 shot attempts is an extremely low bar for stars that make the conference finals, and most get there by the second round. Paul George has almost 150 3 point attempts. Even a guy like Seth Curry, lost in the second round and not a star, put up 149 shots.  For reference, Iverson shot 661 shots in the 01 playoff run."
Yes covid affects you look at Tatum and Seth Curry earlier this season
"If he has covid symptoms still, it‚Äôs different though. Injuries are accepted as part of the game, but covids a whole different thing. And we‚Äôve seen it really impact some players‚Äô games when they get back like Tatum and Seth Curry. I‚Äôve been seeing people say CP3 had a fever which would mean he at least wasn‚Äôt totally asymptomatic."
"Oh, I totally agree that they are much better set to now.  Even the Bledsoe and Adams contracts are not that bad, they can easily be salary filler in a trade for players that actually help, and with the plethora of picks, you can make moves and still have assets in the bank.  Just, don't pull a colangelo in Philly, where you turn all those assets into just Harris and Seth Curry.  Both are good, but Philly had a ton of draft picks and good young players that became just two solid vets."
"I thought that was a strange trade as well when it happened (I certainly can‚Äôt talk with the Seth Curry trade, but still).   Powell is still better than Trent Jr. right now, so I imagine the logic was that they thought they could contend once they had everyone healthy and went with the win now player instead since Trent Jr. isn‚Äôt really on Dame‚Äôs timeline.  I don‚Äôt agree with the trade, but I guess I see why they did it."
Seth Curry
Seth Curry has an insane contract for the value
"that president fucked it all up.    nixed a trade of Okafor for the future Jaylen Brown pick.  Then placed his son in charge who immediately traded Jerami Grant for Ersan among other wasted assets.  Then, after burnergate brought in Philly Vlade who then turned in so many assets into Max Tobi and Seth Curry"
"76ers-Jrue Holiday, Seth Curry, Andre Iguodala, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid,"
"I‚Äôve always thought his shoulder injuries is what‚Äôs made him a jumpshooter in LA rather than a dynamic driver like he used to.  Up until these past few games, hes looked so averse to driving into and absorbing contact since 2019. Even if he got the calls at the rim he looked frightened to absorb contact with those shoulders.   Especially last year in the playoffs he looked like he would be scared of driving into smaller guys; Seth Curry and Tim Hardaway scared him away from the rim.  That‚Äôs why he shoots inconsistently in the playoffs sometimes; because he plays too closely to 3&amp;D role players sometimes. He plays like a streakier 6‚Äô9‚Äù Klay Thompson. The 3 ball is an inherently more volatile scoring option, so that‚Äôs why things like the midrange are more valuable come playoff time.  Now he‚Äôs attacking more, playing in a drive &amp; kick system, is not afraid of contact, and is looking like PG again."
"Who makes your ""i can't believe they gave them up?"" team from last season. Jae Crowder, Seth Curry"
"I've always rated Seth Curry, even since his first stint with the Mavs, always thought he was underrated and I'm glad to see he's getting the recognition and role he deserves"
Seth Curry. Dorian Finney Smith.
Seth Curry is on an amazing deal
Seth Curry
"Man this must truly hurt ‚Ä¶. For Seth Curry, seeing that he is only one notch above nobody."
I still can‚Äôt believe we traded Seth Curry for Richardson. I sometimes hate this team
"I think he'll be fine in Boston. Just didn't pan out. I think trading him for Seth Curry is def a net loss, but a lot of people (me included) were happy with him as a 3&amp;D guy. Just think he didn't mesh well with Rick as coach and just the general style. I think he'll be just fine with y'all."
So basically the Mavs lost Seth Curry for cap space. Cuban isn‚Äôt that smart.
Seth was playing like he was the main curry. Only guy that showed up with embiid.
He is not bad. People are just pissed Seth Curry was traded for him.
Seriously people underrate Curry so much because his brother is better. Seth is a legit player
And at what cost?   Seth Curry.   That was a bad one. But we go
Mavs have a horrendous front office. Can't believe they traded Seth Curry on his incredible contract for Josh Richardson.
Seth Curry  lol j/k  There's no way any team would straight up trade away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
"Booker was doubled pretty much throughout the entire playoffs and still hit threes. There‚Äôs a reason booker doesn‚Äôt get left alone at the three point line like Westbrook does. There‚Äôs more to it than just splits. Kobe, Luka, Booker, and guys like them get heat for shooting low 30% throughout their career but they have the full attention from the defense constantly, while guys like Korver, Seth Curry, and Joe Harris just get wide open spot up threes."
They got the goat big porzingus and the dude they traded seth curry for
"There were a lot of issues with this roster this time last year. Morey pulled some magic and turned Horford and Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry. I agree his plan was probably to move Ben as well, but either he didn‚Äôt like the options on the table (waiting for someone like Harden) or felt like it was too much turnover in one offseason and wanted to see them actually play together to see if it fixed Ben‚Äôs issues."
"Eh, I would say Bron and AD are average shooters, personally, but they can ball out when it matters... example, AD hitting the last second 3 against Denver in the 2020 playoffs, and Bron got streaky too.  But you don't get Bron and AD becaude of shooting, you get them because of their athleticism and everything else.  I think you maximize AD and Bron by having *other* shooters because shooting isn't why they're superstars.  (Bron also sucked at FTs when he came into the league, and still kind of sucks at FTs sometimes.)   Good shooters to me are Seth Curry, Booker, Middleton, Joe ingles, Kyrie, Mccullom, PG, Doncic."
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
"He's inconsistent and scores about 10 ppg.  The guy fans been mocking for 4 years for being inconsistent and only on lakers because of Klutch. Now he's leaving, they're acting like he's Seth Curry with defense."
Trae young in the playoffs was significantly better than cp3. Even if Seth curry would‚Äôve been cooked it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a bum himself and not shooting lights out in the playoffs. Embiid would‚Äôve just bodied Ayton.
if Lakers are smart they trade AD for Seth Curry &amp; Simmons and then set Simmons on fire.
Trade Seth Curry for Steph.
Should got Seth Curry to go along with Danny to make it seem like the full Warriors package lol
Thanks I do know that meme but what‚Äôs the context of Curry back home here? Was the OP talking about Seth Curry?
"Deal, but we want Seth Curry and they take Josh Richardson"
Tobias Harris and Seth Curry improved a lot this year and Embiid put up monster numbers so of course his stats are down.  Simmons' defense was at its best this year.
I think the joke is that the Sixers literally have a knock-off curry in Seth.
Seth Curry gonna dominate as the #1 option like he‚Äôs Patty Mills üò§ üò§ üò§
"I think /r/nba is probably in for a bigger shock when they find out not everyone in the NBA thinks of Ben as trash lol. Morey moved Horford for Danny Green and only had to attach a first. He moved Josh Richardson, for Seth Curry who is on an extremely team friendly deal. But yes, it is the MG of 15 years who is in for a ""big shock"". I know it's an easy excuse when he's your GM but these comments are v funny"
Not every team is dumb like the Mavs giving then Seth Curry
"This is pretty accurate, but hot take: replace Simmons with Seth Curry"
Seth curry sends his regards
"Seth curry with 36, Terrance Mann with 39, Jeff Green with 27 on 7/8 from 3 were some I forgot about damn. Ja with 47 too"
seth curry trade
Seth Curry trade was a win
Seth Curry‚Ä¶now that‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time.
"Love Jaylen, but that has to be Dort. Dude is one one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and is on such a small contract that I wouldn't be surprised if some NBA players made more on performance based bonuses than he did on his salary. OG, Seth Curry are also on great contracts. Among all star players, Jokic probably takes the cake. Jokic is only going to make 6 more million than Jaylen next year. But he is definitely top 5 and should not be traded"
"I don't think the roster is brutal. I just don't think the roster is good for trades in the sense you can't trade. DFS, Kleber, Brunson aren't bad pieces, but they're not pieces you can use to improve your roster with but rather more lateral moves.  Seth Curry was their best trade chip and they fucked that up."
"Ok and I acknowledged that the Seth Curry trade was a good move. I still don't understand why that puts him above any of the names I listed. He's 8-12, not a top 5 GM until one of his teams makes the finals minimum."
[I was with you but then I read this article. Then this past year he executed the Seth Curry deal which looks incredible now in hindsight too](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/daryl-morey-made-a-lot-of-trades-how-much-did-they-help-the-rockets/)
Dallas should've kept Seth Curry  Been looking for a similar guy ever since
"Isaiah Thomas is the big one. And cousins was looking great in NOLA pre-injury.  But also we had Whiteside become an actual NBA player once he left (after some time in China or whatever), Bogdan who‚Äôs looked much better on the Hawks, Seth Curry before he became Steph v2, Gary Trent Jr...  There‚Äôs also guys that just seemed to sandbag a bit for us.. Rudy Gay, who wasn‚Äôt bad but not what we had expected, we had the worst version of Rondo, bad seasons from DeWayne Dedmon, Arron Afflalo, Ariza, and pretty much every 37 year old vet we‚Äôve brought on (although it was pretty cool to have Vince Carter for a season)  It‚Äôs hard to say how much of it is the organization and how much is the players/bad luck. But after 15 years, it seems pretty clear to me that we are in fact Basketball Hell as Rudy Gay so accurately put it.  Luckily we seem to have turned a new leaf with Monte McNair, it‚Äôs only been a season and some change but it‚Äôs looked a looooot better.  So yeah in terms of who‚Äôve we drafted, nobody‚Äôs gone on to have an all-star type season besides IT. But I wouldn‚Äôt at all be surprised to see Bagley make a huge (double) jump once he leaves Sac. Or Buddy for that matter"
Seth Curry is straight up better than Buddy!
"I guess not...   Seth Curry, Rudy Gobert, and Christian Woods definitely didn't play in that league right? /s"
The Curry GOAT: Seth Curry
I thought Seth curry got taller
"I could see this. It will be tough for the Heat to build a contender around Jimmy in the short term, Ben makes more sense with Adebayo and Herro‚Äôs timeline, and Jimmy likes playing with Embiid and Morey likes Jimmy, and the clown Brett Brown isn‚Äôt there any more.   It would be a weird trade given that they could have just kept Jimmy by giving him the max‚Ä¶but if you can pull it off, Jimmy fits pretty well with some of their more recent roster changes like bringing in Seth Curry and Danny Green."
"&gt; However even though Matisse is a good defender he doesn't start and plays like 20 minutes a game  It's unfortunate because the guards he's playing behind are Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, but the fact that a 20 minute/game player off the bench got a spot really bugs me. If only because it means he's spending his time defending either starters who've been worn down, or other bench players."
"Look, that Toronto offer of FVV, OG and a future first isn't sexy but I think it's one of the best that the 76ers will get.  For all of Ben's faults offensively, he does two massively important things for the team: playmaking and guarding the opponent's best player.   The issue with trading Ben is that his value isn't enough to get a single star (or stars) that can do both of those effectively. Especially if they were able to get the hail-mary of Damian Lillard, they're still going to have a giant hole at small forward that can't be replaced easily.  Neither FVV or OG are stars, but they're definitely above-average starters who together provide the playmaking and defense that Ben provides. Hopefully together they provide more of an offensive punch than Ben does currently. I think Seth Curry would be traded since a backcourt with him and FVV is a little suspect.  But, a lineup of FVV/Thybulle/OG/Tobias/Embiid is nasty and would allow you to maximize Embiid. There's obviously a concern of not having a true second star next to Joel but I think we're all past the point of expecting that Simmons will get you another one in return.   I'm a little confused on why Toronto would try for this trade but if they're able to draft Suggs to replace FVV at the point then you're good to go."
Isn't Seth curry 80% the player at 1/3 the price?
The sixers got shooting with Seth Curry and Danny Green and seeing as how they declined Brogdon and picks for Ben I doubt that Ben is getting traded for anything less than Fox
Looks like a weird mix between Seth Curry and Lonzo when he shaved his head.
Book looks like Seth Curry with the headband
"Cool, so who does the ball handling then?  Embiid?  Thybulle?  Danny Green?  Seth Curry?  All worse choices than Ben."
Seth Curry was not as important to the Mavs as DFS is. And Curry makes twice as much as Finney Smith does. Doe Doe is our only good wing defender and our best defender 1-4
i mean that's what we said about Seth Curry and his contract
Seth Curry would be a great fit on this team. Oh wait
Can I offer one Oladipo ? I‚Äôd honestly take Seth Curry and a decent 2nd rd pick in return. - Heat
"That's what makes it even worse. No one asked for Ben. It was Thybulle, Maxey and Danny Green as a filler I think. You could literally start Lowry, Seth Curry as the back court. Move Ben to SF and most of the problems are solved. He can do fast breaks and doesn't have to do half court sets. Or if nothing is working, run Ben as PG with Bench since you have Lowry."
Mavs fans downvoted the hell out of me for calling this when it happened. J rich went to my alma mater. He is and never was more valuable than Seth Curry.
"Mavericks need to get my boy Bonzo Lall on the team ASAP Rocky. He can give them some of that Seth Curry Magic that helped them get one of the best offenses of all time while also adding in size, youth, and defensive ability. Don't overpay for Lowry and Conley and watch them get hurt and waste precious years of Luka. Get Lonzo, and have them grown alongside each other."
Might one Seth Curry be of interest?
Maybe they could trade him for Seth Curry? I feel like he would fit well with Luka
They traded Seth Curry away why again?
MPJ - I watched the nuggets all season. I just don‚Äôt get it. He‚Äôs so lost on defense. Best case is a tall Seth Curry
"That would be the single most influential thing Curry could do.  After that, Curry exclusively starts scoring via blocks. He somehow found a way to do it. But how?  Eventually Kerr, freshly graduated from scientist school, realizes it's his DNA. He's a super hero basically.  Warriors then trade for Seth prior to the DNA news going public.  The Curry brothers then go on to 3 peat and retire from the league.  And guess who got FMVP all 3 times?  Curry!"
"Also you know getting off of Al Horfords terrible contract for a great 3 and D wing in Danny Green and committing arguably the heist of the offseason last year by getting Seth Curry (a guy that averaged 21 on 79% TS in the Hawks series) for Josh Richardson who was space killer and played like 20 minutes total through games 5-7 of the Clippers series, netting unleashed MVP Embiid with all this spacing and a 1st seed finish  But continue"
"Sign and trades never, ever yield the value for the team losing the potential FA. Ben wouldn‚Äôt be involved in a Lowry S&amp;T unless there were significant other pieces and it was like a multi team one, which idk is even possible. It‚Äôd be Hill, maybe Seth curry and a young guy or something if we maybe can double S&amp;T Korkmaz"
"Morey also had not great moves and times   The 2018-2019 offseason was literally disgusting. No moves whatsoever for like the first week, as all these vets were getting signed for cheap we did nothing   And then we sign a squad of Melo, MCW, Ennis, Bruno to replace our 3 &amp;d wings Ariza and Luc. Didn‚Äôt sign a backup big even though we knew Nene was turning into stone.  He‚Äôs definitely a top tier gm, but people don‚Äôt talk about his flaws. Doesn‚Äôt value draft picks, doesn‚Äôt look into the g league for talent. Doesn‚Äôt account for injuries by getting proper fitting backups. He‚Äôs very topheavy/star focused.   The Seth Curry move was special for them definitely"
"Morey got rid of the Al Horford contract after 1 season and traded Josh Richardson for 3 years of prime Seth Curry. He also acquired Harden in Houston in the first place. And Chris Paul. And Dwight Howard. And Russell Westbrook. Sure Harden and CP3 were the reasons the team challenged that KD-era Warriors, but Morey built it."
Their defense is gonna fall off a cliff if they end up having a Seth Curry-CJ starting backcourt lol. Wonder if they‚Äôd try to start Tisse
"How's this?  Sixers get:   * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * OG Anunoby  * 4th overall  Raptors get:   * Ben Simmons  * Tyrese Maxey  * Matisse Thybulle  * 15h overall (from Wizards)  * 28 overall, 2023, 2027 Sixers 1sts  Sixers move Ben for Beal. Instant upgrade, and worth burning future 1sts and prospects for. A core of Embiid/Beal/Harris with Danny Green, Seth Curry is filthy and actually has a chance against the Nets imo   Raptors want to win now, they get an upgrade at SF and also assets that they can use or flip for another vet.   Wizards start their rebuild right by getting an incredibly talented young SF and the 4th overall pick in exchange for their all-star."
"No shit Sherlock is not the same as telling someone to shut the fuck up so stop with that.  You know it too.   And with the volunteer / obligation thing, this is a matter of opinion. You think volunteering obligates you go 100% and I don‚Äôt. Agree to disagree, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre right nor me.   I‚Äôll counter, what would be better for the team: Damian lillard play at 75% effort or Seth curry at 100%? And don‚Äôt say guys like Westbrook cuz I guarantee he wouldn‚Äôt risk injury either. It‚Äôs no surprise that every player outside of jrue is not giving 100% effort."
I know people will disagree with this but if the Nets traded Kyrie+filler for Ben+Seth Curry+a pick or two they‚Äôd be better off
Harden for Simmons + Seth Curry + 1st  Who says no?
I wonder how much more money say Seth curry would make with a fiba line
"Jarret Allen, Bradley Beal, Middleton, Durant, LaVine, Seth Curry, Kevin Huerter, DeJounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, DeAndre Ayton, Trae Young.   I would be running a ton."
some bro in our sub proposed rozier and a 1st for dwight and seth curry.......some delusional folks in sixers land.
"There‚Äôs a middle ground lol  brogdon and a first? Decent value, not sure if I‚Äôd do it though  A buddy hield centered package? The sixers want quality starters who fit the sixers needs, not an overpaid roleplayer. Hield is just a better seth curry."
"Shoutout NC  PG: Chris Paul, Devontae Graham   SG: Steph Curry, Seth Curry  SF: Brandon Ingram, TJ Warren  PF: PJ Tucker, Montrezl Harrell  C: Bam Adebayo, Hassan Whiteside"
"It‚Äôs likely Collins is retained and I‚Äôd be surprised if Reddish is dealt‚Ä¶if Hunter is healthy (which is a big if) Huerter is firmly in a bench role.   Now if Hunter isn‚Äôt healthy long term, this wouldn‚Äôt be a bad draft to take a swing at 3/D guy like Trey Murphy (would likely have to move into the back end of the lottery for him) or take the pure upside pick in Jalen Johnson. We shouldn‚Äôt be trying to log Kevin at the 3 when he‚Äôs at his best using his size against smaller guards. Seth Curry will tell you that."
i don‚Äôt think beal with one year left on his deal is gonna cost simmons maxey thybulle and 3 firsts. plus they have hills contract and seth curry as well
Dames place could've been Curry... I mean Seth Curry
"It's a tricky spot for sure. We don't *have* to get the person who runs the offense back 1 to 1 in the Simmons trade, that could come from a subsequent Tobias Harris trade or something, but I imagine we'd be gutting our depth at that point. We can't just trade Simmons for a scorer though, that'll be a disaster.  The other issue I have with the CJ rumor specifically is we already have Seth Curry on a crazy good contract at the same position playing the same role. CJ is a better pure scorer than Seth, but I don't think he's $25/mil per year better, not even close. Nothing about the CJ trade makes sense unless it's a 3 team deal and he's going elsewhere.  I also think Maxey has legit potential to grow into a player that can run the offense every night. He showed promising hints of that in the playoffs this year. Him developing ahead of schedule would be a godsend and make all of this easier to manage, but that's a big if. The way he's trending, Maxey is what Fultz should've been for us."
"In the regular season he made that. Also he gets a lot of money for a long time.  &gt; Dude had Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake, and some others, he doesn't need to be relied on to shoot  The playoffs would suggest he would have to. As taking away Simmons has been a easy winning strategy for 4 years now."
"Shoulda traded for Seth Curry, kept Dwight, hell even kept Avery Bradley"
Seth curry
Seth Curry?
Players like Seth Curry and Donte DiVincenzo would also carry 16 seeds to natties in March Madness
"Not the same team, but Seth Curry got his brother into the league"
Trent may have more upside but they already have Seth curry to do what he does. And they could get Lowry without giving up Simmons so why would they do that. Also in general they could get better value than that for ben
Also OP puts the entire blame on Ben when the entire team fell apart in the series except Joel (still had TO issues) and Seth Curry (got abused on defense).
"its unbelievable people are ok with this russ choice. Same shit as last year, i felt like i was mad for thinking fucking SETH CURRY PLS , over a career 30% shooter in schroeder, or a non shooter in harrel. I cant believe the lakers management has no interest in providing any spacing for lebron and AD. yes, we won without good shooters, but why make things harder then they have to be ffs? If we couldve just added shooting to that championship team, it would've been near perfect (outside of playmaking without lebron). It's so incredibly frustrating watching lakers players brick everything, and be behind 10 threes everygame and have to make that up by just being better. But we got lebron and AD so who cares right? Imagine the bucks didnt surround Giannis with shooters, ffs. Lets play on hard mode. Lebron is our best shooter, and Russ doesnt play hard on defence. So half Russ's supposed value of playing hard isnt there if he doesn't bother with half the game."
"Who cares if he can't shoot? There's plenty of other people on other teams that can shoot. Dude had an all-star season averaging 14/7/7/1.6/.6 and got the all defensive first team. It's ridiculous that people act like he's trash because he doesn't shoot. Dude had Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, Shake, and some others, he doesn't need to be relied on to shoot"
"It‚Äôs not just that, his skill set is exactly what they need to compliment embiid. They could have had him for maxey , DG, Scott and some random picks at the deadline . A line up of Lowry, Seth curry , Simmons, harris and embiid is excellent and would have beaten or seriously challenged bucks/nets this year"
In a 2v2 I got giannis and thanassis better overrall seth and curry but heres a better question who would u rather add to your team giannis and thanassis or seth and steph remember steph is 33 before just saying right away obviously the curry's
Luka not having the help or luka hugging the ball and not allowing his team mates to be in rhythm..take seth curry for instance. Look at his ppg playing with luka and his production playing with embiid..
Seth Curry putting up 36 in that Game 5 76ers lost and being the only reason the game was close
"Just to add on to this solid list  https://theundefeated.com/features/one-big-nba-family-curry-rivers-deeply-related/  &gt; Austin Rivers said he was initially skeptical when he heard his sister was dating an NBA player. But when he found out it was his former college teammate, his feelings changed.  &gt; ‚ÄúWhen you hear your sister is dating an NBA player, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOh s‚Äî,‚Äô ‚Äù Austin Rivers said. ‚ÄúNBA players travel a lot. There is a reputation. You don‚Äôt want your sister to get hurt. But when I heard it was Seth, I was relieved because he is one of the guys that act the right way.‚Äù  Then Austin himself cheats."
"I mean it's Daryl Morey, there's only a few guys that argument works for and he's definitely one of them. Came in last offseason and got us off Al Horford's contract for Danny Green and flipped Josh Richardson for Seth Curry. There's not many others I'd want to be our GM"
I don't know how you can run it back. It seems obvious not even in hindsight that Philly is nowhere near a contender. Having some combination of Geroge Hill and Seth Curry as your best perimeter players is nowhere near good enough. The only time Philly looked like a contender is when Jimmy Buttler was on a squad filling that role.  I also don't see how Simmons increases his value short of becoming a totally different player. I don't know how you can walk into the playoffs with this squad again with the exact flaws. In my opinion you absolutely have to trade Simmons for the best lead ballhandler you can get your hands on.
"He also cheated on Doc Rivers daughter, who is now married to Seth Curry"
"For a team as imbalanced as Philly, it may very well have. Philly was trying to win a title with some combination of Geroge Hill and Seth Curry as their best perimeter players. Seth Curry who got played off the floor multiple times by Kevin Hurter.   The most damning indictment of Philly's roster-building was Atlanta playing Trea and Lou Will at the same time and Philly not having a single player who could attack them in isolation or in the pick and roll. Almost any team in the playoffs would make barbeque chicken of those lineups.  I think Philly gets by Atlanta easily with a capable ball-handler who can run pick and roll and carry bench units. It was worth overpaying a little for Philly for what should have been a cakewalk to the ECF."
"&gt;I mean George Karl is a dickhead, but he's not wrong and this is same sentiment his first coach had that was pretty much removed because of Carmelo.  Uh huh.  So was George Karl right about Demarcus Cousins, Damian Lillard, Ray Allen, Gary Payton, Kenyon Martin, Seth Curry, Andre Iguoudala, etc.  George Karl is tweeting that his coaching staff valued defense when his players have said that was the exact opposite of what went down in the locker room.   &gt;but he's not wrong and this is same sentiment his first coach had that was pretty much removed because of Carmelo.  Like everything is through this extremely shallow lens.   Bzdelik was fired for the exact same reason every other coach is fired in the league. Management wanted them to be doing better than they were doing. Carmelo had two coaches in Denver. Literally try applying the same metric to *any* other player.   &gt;The lockout impacted trade deals how?  Not all the traded players were on the team the next year. The lockout meant that those players who might have re-signed (such as to remain an asset) signed overseas.   &gt;So Melo had a poor coach-player relationship with Bzdelik, George Karl, and Mike D'Antoni to start his career. Karl is a known shithead, the other two are well liked and Mike D'Antoni is especially well liked by players and Melo essentially caused him to resign.  D'Antoni never wanted Melo to begin with, he wanted Deron Williams. D'Antoni was upset because Melo wouldn't reduce his role so he could have a point guard centered offense....on a team with the highest paid front-court in the league. D'Antoni's inability to adjust his system is what led him to resigning. And it's the *exact* same reason he didn't work out in LA."

"Be nice my guy, I‚Äôm just thinking salary wise you‚Äôre gonna have to match it somehow. I will certainly give everything for Dame feel free to fill that different with worse salary.

Championship &gt; SETH CURRY LMAO
We lost the next one because AD wasn‚Äôt in the playoffs anymore you think Seth Curry would have got us there? And we retooled this year pretty fucking well.  But all that said Kawhi can eat a bag of them.
"Me bruh  Bet if the lakers hadn‚Äôt sat around for Kawhi, lakers would‚Äôve offered Seth curry the deal that the mavs did"
"\&gt; Seth Curry is the only guy on the team that's a good shooter, and he only takes 4.9 3PA per game  He shot 45%. 45% on about 5 attempts a game is elite by any measure.  Danny is streaky, but the bottom line is he averaged over .405 on over 6 attempts a game through the season.  Harris shot .394 and was regularly getting fked by Simmons in terms of spacing and had to function as the self shot creator taking more difficult shots.  Embiid has one of the better touches out of centers today.  He basically had three 40% 3pt shooters and one of the most dominant centers in the league with him.  I suggest looking at other lineups for comparison. Claiming he didn't have shooters to work with is the epitome of bullshit."
"hmm  Could do Bertans, Thomas Bryant, Avdija and picks for Tobias? (Does work financially)  Bertans would be shooting, which is always good, but he‚Äôs kinda awful at everything other than shooting. Like a bigger, worse, Seth Curry. Dunno if they want Bryant with Joel + Drummond. Tho he could play the 4? Sixers probably wouldn‚Äôt want Avdija. Isn‚Äôt too good rn, and Sixers don‚Äôt want to wait to get their value.   Wizards would love it   PG: Dinwiddie - Neto - Holiday SG: Beal - KCP SF: Tobias - Kispert PF: Rui - Kuzma C: Gafford - Trezz"
"Seth Curry is the only guy on the team that's a *good* shooter, and he only takes 4.9 3PA per game. Green is still *alright*, but that's it."
"https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?SeasonYear=2009-10  steph went to the combine and was measured at 6'2"" without shoes, 6'3.25"" with shoes  kyrie did not bother with the combine  does kyrie not look a little shorter?  https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?SeasonYear=2013-14  seth curry 6'1"" barefoot, 6'3"" in shoes"
"Seth Curry averaged like 18 at fucking Duke lol, yeah he went undrafted but he‚Äôs not like the other players mentioned here"
"Seth Curry(45% 3pt), Danny Green(40% 3pt), Tobias Harris(39% 3pt), Joel Embiid(38% 3pt).  When Green got hurt in the playoffs they replaced him with Korkmaz(37.5% 3pt)  The 76ers had pretty much as perfect of a roster construction as you could ever hope to put around Simmons in the NBA without moving him to Center."
Steph Curry looks sideways at young Seth Curry and Damian Lee.
You never know how long it could take for someone to break out and make the league. Not saying he will make the league but we saw guys like Seth Curry go from G-League to getting cut from the NBA to being a lethal shooter. You just never know.
"Dame Green Korkmaz Harris Embiid. Seth Curry, Shake Milton and Drummond off the bench. All of the role players are complimentary to Dame and Embiid."
I agree Embiid made Seth Curry look great in the playoffs In the two man game. Dame would work 3x as good.
1 - Steph Curry 2 - Dell Curry 3 - chicken curry  4 - Sonya Curry 5 - Seth Curry
"Seth Curry for JRich is something I‚Äôll never forgive (and knew was a mistake as soon as it happened). I followed Seth when he was still on the Kings, monitored his RFA (SAC rescinded lol) and tweeted at Cuban to sign him the first time around. Then he came back to Dallas from Portland, balled out and was on an great team friendly deal. To send that away for a player whose reputation clearly exceeded ability was inexcusable."
Seth Curry
Pop is fine at his age. He also had a solid set of assistants there too.   But the picking of players especially with Colangelo is questionable at best. The team needed more shooters. A Seth Curry/Tim Hardaway Jr might fit well for a team that could use shooters.
Oh yeah the Sixers should absolutely roll out a backcourt of FVV and Seth Curry. That‚Äôll work.
Seth curry
"We would still have Seth Curry, Shake, Niang, and Kork.  That's not amazing but it's more than solid with Lillard starting"
I keep thinking Devin Booker is Seth Curry.
I keep thinking D Book is Seth Curry
Devin ‚ÄúSeth Curry‚Äù Booker needs to be subbed out of the game for a perimeter defender
I combine Seth Curry and Steph Curry to create Seth Curry
"I couldn't really appreciate how good his game was watching this live cause my stomach was in my asshole on every possession. After I watched the rerun I was like damn his midrange was stuck in automatic, just complete domination of the Seth Curry mismatch. I really hope we can afford to re-sign him before some other team throws a huge (deserved) bag at him"
~~Seth Curry~~ **Doc Rivers** lowlights video lmao  subbing shake out to put seth in should have been instant termination
Seth Curry lowlights video lmao
Philly would be a good spot for him but who would they trade out? Danny Green or Seth Curry?
"&gt; kept the Lakers on the hook for like 3 days so they can't sign any good FAs  for years i have begged people to name which FAs decided against the lakers during that time. seth curry? not exactly earth shattering.   to me this is the weirdest persistent r/nba narrative, partly because nobody anywhere can give me a remotely convincing answer, but people always flame the shit out of me for asking lmao"
"If curry lets me do it, I'm dumping Klay. His deal is likely awful going forward. Simmons is owed less money and is younger. I would like Seth Curry + Ben Simmons back. (or Danny Green instead of Seth if you must).    If Curry doesn't want to trade the splash brother for his real brother, then I've got nothing. Wiggins' deal is shorter and he's basically the same age as Simmons."
"Went to one of those team-affiliated signings and met Harrison Barnes/Seth Curry, Barnes was super nice and polite, Seth was kind of an ass  Met Alex Caruso while at A&amp;M, I thought he was a decent player and had size/potential, but this was right before he kinda became A&amp;M‚Äôs star. So I asked him for a photo at the Rec and he almost seemed surprised, but he was a good dude and nice and obliged me"
"Dude you just listed Seth Curry, Danny Green and Furkan Korkmaz as like prized assets?"
"Tyrell Terry basically missed most of his rookie season last year cause of personal reasons so I‚Äôm excited to see him play again, especially cause his skill set would be extremely useful for us if he pans out. Basically our Seth Curry replacement hopefully lol.  Also signed UDFA EJ Onu who‚Äôs 6‚Äô11 with a 7‚Äô9 wingspan and I so desperately want him to be good because I like long bois."
He had Seth Curry already.
Seth ‚ÄúSteph Curry‚Äù Curry  Wardell ‚ÄúSteph Curry‚Äù Curry
"Yeah and we still have the best center, Seth curry, Danny G, Tobias, furky jerky. The fuck you have beyond Beal and rai?"
"I mean it‚Äôs not like Danny green and Seth Curry are slouches (or Jj reddick, who Simmons played with for two years).   I think we can probably assume Simmons not being able to shoot is more on him than it is a matter of who the mentors are around him"
&gt;  But to call it an attitude issue when someone won't report back happily after being blamed for losing a game (which is entirely a team effort)   this is a little silly - obviously some people are more responsible for the loss than others. seth curry isn't responsible for the loss at all. embiid's turnovers are a little responsible for the loss but at least he went 11/21 and 7/10. simmons was in the game 36 minutes and attempted four fucking shots  you can also blame harris btw. and doc rivers
"Here.  76ers get: CJ and Covington  Blazers get: Simmons and Markkanen  Bulls get: Seth Curry, Doug Jones and a 1st from Portland"
If Beal wanted to be on a contender I would be open to a deal for Ben that included Seth Curry and sent Bertans contract to the Sixers
The one star I‚Äôm always interested in is the career 3pt % battle between the Curry brothers. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html. Usually Seth is on top over Steph.
Get your hands off Seth curry
"Let‚Äôs talk about matchups then. Danny Green wouldn‚Äôt be able to score efficiently against Huerter or anyone on the Hawks like Seth did. Seth was averaging 22 on absurd efficiency, he was only taking 12 shots a game. Taking away those shots and giving them to Danny Green would hurt the offense a lot, Curry was literally carrying all the shooting for the Sixers."
"So prove it.  What is your definition of best shooter? Steph Curry is still easily the best shooter in the league by both the eye test and stats and not close.  Durant is also in a different universe. Shot eFG% of fucking 60.8%, 53.7% on 2s, 45% on 3s, and 88% from FT.  So those are 2 unarguables.   For last year specifically Zach Levine had a much better shooting year (killed Dames numbers on similar volume), but hasn‚Äôt had the same year to year consistency.  Kylie Irving also was head and shoulders above Dame, literally in the 50/40/90 club last year.  Now we get into what you define as a good shooter. Harden had a worse year statistically last year, but I don‚Äôt think many people would argue he‚Äôs a worse shooter.  Seth Curry has smaller volume but shoots WAY better than Dame, esp from 3. Joe Harris also had much lower volume but blew away the eagle in combined 2 pt and 3pt shooting. 47.5% on 6.4 3pt attempts per game.  And ofc Klay Thompson was hurt, but is anyone really taking Dame over Klay for shooting?  So last year Dame was at least 5th, if not 7th or 8th depending on how you judge shooting. Going into next year assuming Klay and Harden are healthy, I‚Äôm easily putting Steph, Durant, Harden, Kylie, and Thompson as better shooters.  So yeah, I won‚Äôt wait for you to respond with facts, cause I know they aren‚Äôt coming."
nobody on that team (including the coach) showed up in the biggest moment besides like seth curry and sometimes embiid
Booker is literally just Seth curry at this point. Headband and all
yeah shouldve brought seth Curry if hes just gonna spot up and defend
"Difference is Ingram isn't elite shooting off the dribble and off screens while Curry is elite at every facet of shooting.  It's not related to the two people being compared. Lonzo shoots about the same percentage as Ingram does on off the dribble threes on obviously less attempts, slightly better I think.  Just because Ingram gets those kinds of shots off more than Lonzo while Lonzo shot off the catch more doesn't make give them the same comparison as steph vs Seth lol. That just more comes from the defined roles they had on the team."
"""How they get the shot off isn't really related.""  It is so absolutely related and I can't believe you actually believe this. There are players with better 3p% than Curry, what's amazing about Curry is how he's efficient with all the crazy shots he makes from all different forms off offense -- off screens, catch and shoot, off the dribble whatever.  You're not gonna tell me Seth is a better shooter than Steph, are you?"
**Seth Curry** beat Westbrook and Beal  Simmons cost his team a game getting hacked
"Those three guys you just listed are some of the better guard defenders in the league. I‚Äôm just saying Monk is better than like a Cam Payne, or Seth Curry, or Trae Young, who are all guys who played deep into the playoffs. Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs great but can be hidden when needs to be."
"Didn't the Mavs have Seth Curry, Bogut, and 2 other players named Thompson and Green on the roster at one point a few years back?  Oh and Harrison Barnes"
"&gt; trade Curry to the Pistons  Keep Detroit in [purgatory](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yg9x9dul) then, too  EDIT: Not only does ESPN let you trade Cade for Seth/Drummond/Tolliver, it actually lets you do just Seth/Drummond for both Cunningham and Thor, and claims that that results in the Pistons winning 2 more games and the Sixers winning 1 less, lmao"
"In case you're wondering how the Sixers managed to avoid this penalty with Embiid, Simmons, and Harris all on maxes, the rest of their roster is currently:  Seth Curry on a stupidly good contract, Andre Drummond on a minimum, and a bench where the oldest player is 24 year old Shake Milton"
"Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Eddy Curry. Del is the hype man of the Curries."
"Wardell Curry I, Wardell Curry II, Seth Curry"
"The game is more than efficient scoring. If he can set up guys like Seth Curry, Danny Green etc with kick out 3‚Äôs, if he can find passes due to his elite court vision. If he can guard 1-5 so that you can switch everything, he is one of the most useful team pieces there is. I‚Äôm not saying he doesn‚Äôt need to learn to shoot because he does need at least a midrange, but all the weaknesses and flaws everyone is pointing out was known to be an issue months ago. My issue is it wasn‚Äôt dealt with right"
I thought The Onion wrote this or something. Jesus Christ someone get Seth Curry a helmet.
"He will not start, don‚Äôt forget Seth Curry"
"Last year Morey pulled off that Horford deal then got Seth Curry, I feel like this guy has something up his sleeves. I can't see him sitting around."
"On paper yes but Tobias probably makes too much money to get fair value for him. Maxey and Thybulle's salaries aren't high enough for salary matching purposes. Seth Curry you could trade but you can't give up your best 3 point shooter if you're keeping Simmons.  It basically hinges on a Ben Simmons trade (and whatever other pieces are involved). If they don't trade Simmons, the Sixers probably got worse this off-season"
Are you basing this off of one month where he hasnt made a trade yet? Just last year he turned Horford and JRich into Seth Curry and Danny Green.
"do Seth Curry and Tobias Harris not exist to you? re-signed Korkmaz, who is a shooter  also Danny Green hasn't signed anywhere...  if you're gonna make fun of us for not making FA or trade moves, say the roster in general is not good, whatever. But the shooting thing is not really the leg to stand on atm"
At first I read it as Seth Curry and got excited. Damn
Seth Curry?
"The other problem they have which you alluded to is that Seth Curry can get exploited on defense, but they need him out there anyway because someone needs to balance out the awful spacing you get with Ben  Not much flexibility"
Yeah honestly strangest decade for any team in the league. I hope they rework around the same core of Simmons and embid. At least you got Seth Curry on a great contract. I think he has 6th man potential this season.
"Dort, OG, Cam Payne, Jaylen Brown, Seth Curry"
I don‚Äôt understand what people think the appeal is of adding CJ McCollum to philly pairing him with Seth Curry in a small horrible defensive backcourt. Then in this one you add another 6‚Äô3 wing as well.   I actually believe in Simmons perhaps working it out at some stage on another team and think this is kind of a win for Portland depending on what picks they give up but it‚Äôs still an overpay considering Simmons lack of value right now.
Seth Curry
So basically we‚Äôre paying 10 million for a 3 and D guy that‚Äôs better than the 3 and D guy we traded freaking Seth Curry for.   Gosh I‚Äôm glad that old front office is gone
"Steph Curry, Dell Curry, Seth Curry"
He's a great third option behind Joel and Seth Curry! Contract is a bit bad but alas
"Simmons, Seth curry for Brogdon, turner and a first is more than plenty."
"Seth Curry and Steph Curry are coming to Portland, to get the big 3 curry. Dame Curry Norm RoCo Nurk Curry CJ Simons   Easy ring."
Best metric is isolation defense..playoffs is mostly isolation basketball anyways.  Worst isolation defenders like Seth Curry get torched!!
Seth Curry was a medium guy.
Seth Curry and Harrison Barnes would look pretty good on the Mavs right now...
Seth Curry in the Philadelphia 76ers Jersey and Steph Curry in the Philadelphia Warriors Jersey is gonna confuse some people.
"Seth Curry is not on a 20M contract, 7.2M so not sure why you would include him, no shit he lived up to that.   Joe Harris shot what, 30% against the Bucks? Didn't exactly help the Nets win.   Plenty of people think Hield is overpaid. Hield is going to get moved because he isn't good enough for that price tag to win, he has never played in a high leverage NBA game in his life so we don't know how he'll look in the playoffs. Maybe he can win on a team with 2 other superstars making that much money but that's about it.   Bertans, another overpaid shooter that disappears when you need him."
The Seth Curry sometimes playing backup point disrespect
Lakers could have signed other free agents like Brogdon or seth curry but waited on kawhi to sign. Kawhi acted like he was planning to sign with the Lakers then went to the clippers
Lakers could have signed Seth Curry and Brogdon. They waited on kawhi instead
I‚Äôll take one Seth curry please. Lol
Tobias Harris would be a king bruh. Jesus Christ. Buddy‚Äôs defense isn‚Äôt good compared to Seth curry? Buddy is a decent on ball defender and that‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd ever say about curry. Throw in being a legit volume 3 point shooter and someone that can create for themselves a few times a game and the impact of the two isn‚Äôt comparable.
which free agents are you talking about? seth curry? anybody else?  i'll wait
"Who‚Äôs the third scoring option...? Buddy is still shooting 10 threes a game there with Simmons and Embiid. Even if you think he won‚Äôt, comparing the rest of his game to Seth curry is so disrespectful."
&gt;	buddy barely gives you more than Seth Curry does  What
"March 25, 2019. The Brooklyn Nets are playing at the Portland Trail Blazers. It's a tough game all game long, and is the game most remembered for Portland Center, Jusuf Nurkic, suffering a gruesome compound fracture in overtime.  When it happened, every Brooklyn Nets big man had fouled out. Jared Dudley was playing center, and Nurkic was feasting. As Nurkic dominated the glass, he must've pushed himself to the point of exhaustion, and when he came done partially on someone else's foot, his weight came down wrong and his leg shattered. He would be out for for the better part of the next two years, and when he returned he was nowhere near his peak form.   But it didn't have to happen... Near the end of regulation, down one point, Seth Curry with the Blazers was fouled. Two shots. He missed one, but made the other... And right there, overtime could've been prevented. Nurkic could've walked away healthy, had Curry not split the pair. He could've made em both and won, or missed em both and lost, a fair trade for any blazers fan of it had meant keep Nurkic in one piece.  Had he not been injured... The Blazers could've given the Warriors a real test in the WCF, which resulted in a sweep, but only after blowing leads in 3 of the 4 games. This is the same team that beat the warriors twice in the regular season, waved goodbye to OKC, and beat the Nuggets in 7 games on the backs of CJ, ET, and Enes Kanter's separated shoulder. They gave the warriors a real run for their money in those games, and had Nurkic been healthy, he would've been considered a top 5 big man in the league going into those playoffs. Instead, with Nurkic out indefinitely, the Blazers had a giant hole to fill at the 5. Had Nurk been healthy, they could've beat the Warriors and potentially been to the first finals in lord knows how long, and Dame could've had a serious shot at a chip.   And that's why you gotta make your free throws."
Seth curry for one
"who, specifically, did the lakers ""pass"" on that year? nobody is ever able to answer that  that was the narrative on r/nba, yes  in actual reality though, the only free agent name even remotely linked to LAL that offseason was, like, Seth Curry I guess? and even he ran straight for a Dallas reunion without a shred of consideration for or discussion with any other team  but yeah, the popular narrative here is ""haha kawhi punked the lakers lmao lakers bad"" when in reality the lakers neither gained nor lost a single tangible asset from the whole weird saga  and *not only was that narrative nonsensical and ignorant of the reality of free agents at the time*, but **the lakers ended up winning the title**, so it's even more hilariously confusing when people act like kawhi somehow ""fleeced"" the lakers  kawhi fleeced the lakers right into an NBA title i guess lol"
There also the holding out on announcing a decision you've already made just to try and sabotage the Lakers from going out and signing a player like Seth curry that they really wanted.  And he's now saying he has an issue with the clipper staff as well. Dude is a diva and a snake.
I was hoping to get Seth Curry but we ended up with Danny Green
"The Mavs have signed Seth Curry, Wes Matthews, Deandre Jordan, tried to sign Dwight Howard, and traded for pieces like Tyson Chandler, Shawn Marion and Monta Ellis over the last few years. Not sure where the ‚ÄúEuropean bias‚Äù is coming from other than his comments while he was riding the high from drafting Luka. Also not sure what you‚Äôre implying with the Montreal/Luka issue, that doesn‚Äôt connect to Cuban at all. Mavs got plenty of other things to criticize like how they hire coaches and front office staff"
"Vince Carter played with Dell Curry, then played against Steph and Seth."
In the 2011 finals Lebron James took as many shots as seth curry in the second round. Ok Lebron took 90 shots over 6 games and Curry took 88  In no world should a 26 year LeBron be taking as many shots as the third option on the sixers team. 2011 was a pretty bad performance for a number 1 option
Seth curry for Deandre jordan
"No, the Seth Curry of his day: mad handle, extraordinary passer, and could shoot from anywhere. I love Russell, but he‚Äôs not even close to being the sharpshooter that the Pistol was."
"I think it's safe to assume when someone just says ""Curry"" they are talking about Steph and not Seth...."
"Seth Curry. Good defensive IQ, makes his rotations, doesnt look lost, hes just too small too weak and too slow to keep up with most players"
" FTs are big part of the game if he cant get to the ft line, is a weakness who cant be ignored, and its not like joe harris, seth curry and a lot of other catch and shoot players have a lot of Fta, he is just inneficient and very inconsistent for someone who only good atribute is shooting 3s"
Seth Curry is very poggers for me now.
"To people like us, Seth Curry on Linus Tech Tips is sick.  But to people who don't care about basketball, Seth Curry doesn't generate the popularity Steph does."
"Never spent any time looking at Seth Curry but damn, he looks just like his dad."
seth curry has officially become more famous than steph
Seth Curry performed better in the playoffs than Ben ‚Äúall-star‚Äù Simmons. If you play better than an allstar what does that make you?
that was just genuinely enjoyable. Seth Curry seems like a nice dude
IS IT TIME TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT SETH CURRY? HE MIGHT GET ADDICTED TO PC GAMING JUST LIKE HIS TEAMMATE BEN SIMMONS? HOW DOES THIS AFFECT HIS LEGACY?
Why is Seth Curry associating with this soyboy?
Yep! I dont mean to entirely discredit this mans shooting ability but Ive played some NAIA and some D3 and for me the difference is the overall body type and athlete at NAIA was commonly worse. I had more trouble finishing after the transfer and I remember thinking everyone was longer and faster.   NAIA occasionally gets the diamond in the rough style prospect but normally is undersized skilled guys who couldnt make a NCAA roster.   He probably shot over and was defended by ppl his size whereas Tyrell Terry or Seth Curry had to shoot over NBA prospects and D1 athletes
If you replace Seth Curry with Davion Mitchell or maybe even Matisse Thybulle they would be my favorites.
"Remember that the Raptors were Vegas favourites to get Kawhi too.  Anyone who thinks that big money in Vegas doesn't know what they're doing is stupid. The Raps have good odds because there's probably insider information that the Raps are pushing for it.   My fellow Raptors fans are significantly undervaluing Simmons here. Without blinking I'm offering FVV/Dragic/Boucher + 3 FRPs (top X protected) for Simmons and trade filler... unfortunately, looking at the 76'ers, the only trade filler that really works is Seth Curry."
"You asked for thoughts?? I gave you an offer in terms of what is fair for both sides. If you think Morey is taking less than that, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. Maybe a little less. 1 less pick or so. Give or take. But he‚Äôs not budging much. What in your mind is a fair deal if mine isn‚Äôt? Toronto isn‚Äôt moving Siakam for Simmons. He makes 29 mil. It would base around FVV for sure, and to get to that 29 mil mark area, OG and Gary Trent make most sense. Maybe Seth Curry. I could see FVV + Seth Curry + 2 firsts."
"Yes, but it doesn't matter if you have a good center if they're just dropping 3's on you because seth and CJ can't cover guards.  The problem would be like Hawks vs Sixers, but 10x worse.  Even with all those guys AND ben, we struggled, and Embiid looked clueless against the ""Trae/Capella"" lob/floaters.    I honestly could see them putting up 150 on us if it was Curry/CJ.  Trae Just waltzes into the paint, then if Embiid comes, he passes for the easy oop to Capella.  If he stays on capella, takes the easy floater.  Istead of CJ/Curry, you can put Green on Trae again, lol.  How did that go?  Literally might have been the most one sided matchup I've seen all season.  Just every play Green looked like he didn't belong in the NBA when he was defending Trae."
We aren't really a trade match with Boston but this thread was supposed to be realistic trades not jokes. I am not even sure what a realistic trade with Boston would be but maybe Simmons/Shake Milton/Seth Curry and 2 firsts for Jaylen Brown? Obviously a trade like this wouldn't happen but it's semi-realistic
"Why tho? In that trade scenario the sixers would get a scoring guard who plays zero defense and isn't a playmaker. That's like duplicating what Seth Curry already brings to the table. Sure, CJ is a lot better than Seth but if they already have 1/2 CJ for like a little less than a 1/10 of his salary, i don't see why they'd add him.   Sure it helps them with their needed scoring depth and CJ is the best 'star' on the market, but for a team already shallow on the playmaking department, i don't see how adding CJ just for the sake of making a trade would work.   Sixers know Ben is the best player available for that position and if they can't get a trade replacement for what he brings to the table, I just don't see how they'd win any trade at the moment."
"I would like to have a modern nba player with the nickname pickles ü•í. Any suggestions? Seth ""Pickles"" Curry?"
"losing porzingis and Seth Curry for a better version of Seth Curry, that‚Äôs rough"
"What about FVV + Siakam for Simmons, Seth Curry, and Shake Milton? Siakam is pretty nasty contract and who knows if he can turn around his play. Raptors get some shooting back + a young player and Simmons."
tbf Morey has only made like one good move since 2018 and that was the Seth Curry trade. Besides that the rest of his trades have been pretty bad
"calling me a clown.. look, like i said before, that trade wouldn't make sense for the sixers. we already have a malik beasley in seth curry, so he becomes redundant. and pat bev for ben simmons is not equal value. three point shooting is important, but without simmons, who is creating those three point shots? there is no way sixers make that trade"
"Seth Curry. I think he's really good, but it's sad that he'll probably only be remembered for being Damion Lee's brother in law"
pat bev is washed. he has been cut and traded how many times this offseason? and we already have a malik beasley type player in seth curry. no need for malik's below average d. thanks!
"I mean, what are the big tactical errors that Rivers made against Atlanta? Philly's starters won their minutes. The bench is a dumpster fire. They don't have anyone that can carry a bench unit so Rivers is essentially just throwing shit at the wall and hoping they can squeeze out something from Harris, or one of Maxey or Shake get's hot.   The roster is incredibly flawed. The best perimeter player on the roster is Seth Curry who was getting played off the court by Kevin Hurter. Instead of Kyle Lowry, the deadline reinforcements was Geroge Hill who looked competently washed and gave Philly nothing.   And, I haven't even mentioned the second-best player on the roster crumbing like a cookie and not even really playable down the stretches of games.    I think last year we saw a similar roster issue. In that, the Clippers just couldn't match up with Jokic. The Clippers had one center on the roster Zubac who got in foul trouble a lot. The only other option at the centre was Trez who just completely annihilated by Jokic.    I feel like a lot of this criticism is pretty unfair, and doesn't really come with much of Doc should have done X,Y or Z."
Embiid did more than enough. Seth curry of all ppl did more than enough. Harris was mediocre. Thybulle was mediocre. And then you have Simmons giving an all time terrible performance. He was historically bad. An average Lonzo wins the series for the sixers.
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that‚Äôs why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can‚Äôt have two non-shooting players on the floor in today‚Äôs nba. Ben also prob isn‚Äôt gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You‚Äôre not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
Remember when the Mavs traded for KP and it was a dumpster fire of a move that never benefited them?  That‚Äôs not true but we‚Äôll lose the context with time so someday people will think it‚Äôs true.  Remember when the Mavs traded a great shooter in Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and then immediately got rid of him when they realized what the rest of the league realized - Josh Richardson sucks? Again - all the context is gone from that statement but the context goes away with time.  Remember when their org exploded and they got rid of one of the longest tenured head coaches at the time?
"People are dumb. They say things  like ""HE DOESN'T SCORE AT ALL ANY MORE!"" but in reality his PPG during the series with the Hawks was like....4 or 5 less? Stats don't really often display what we tend to notice because we're naturally biased I reckon. Like...during that series, I remember Seth Curry not playing well, but statistically, I bet if I looked it up, it's probably normal."
What‚Äôs funny is Simmons is literally teammates with arguably the best of those 10 centers you mentioned. And then the other 3 positions are Seth Curry (historically great shooter) Danny Green (3 &amp; D) and Tobias Harris (Offensive star that can shoot and play D). He literally has the perfect fit around him in Philly right now and we all saw what happened.
"Sure, you can say he played a great series while still being skeptical of it being indicative of the type of thing to expect generally.   Seth Curry shot 60% from 3 against us in the 6ers series, I'm not penciling him in for that moving forward."
"Hield is trash. There's a reason the Kings of all teams have benched him in the past and it's not because he's a mismanaged superstar. The only positive skill he brings is shooting near 40% from 3. Terrible defender. Bad passer. And despite his great jump shot his overall scoring efficiency is mediocre. If the best player they can get is Buddy Hield they'd be better off holding Simmons hostage out of spite. This deal might actually hurt the Sixers because they'd be tempted to play Hield over Thybulle or Seth Curry in real minutes. And if Hield is bad, Bagley is far worse."
steph does it well compared to who? jrue holiday? seth curry and dame?
So he's basically Seth Curry which is something they have.
"How is that what you're talking about? Harden's defense is absolutely no where near that level.  I feel like you don't watch Harden tbh. He's average at worst on defense.  I think what you see is him not being an elite defensive player. Because you should watch the guys I mentioned, those guys actively cause their teams to collapse leads and they are borderline unplayable in the playoffs (Melo and Kanter more than Seth)  It's got nothing to do with his offense either. Harden could go 2/11 and his defense still wouldn't kill his team. Just watch that nets win when he came back and he mostly just standing around throwing passes.  The truth is, if Harden was that bad at D. It would show up somewhere in his box score advanced stats. Usually woeful defenders have negative DBPM for example  Kanter: -1.8 DBPM  Melo: -1.6 DBPM  Curry: -0.8 DBPM  Harden: +0.9 DBPM  The stats are not the end all be all of course. But they're telling for really bad defenders."
"Not really though.  Enes Kanter, Melo, Seth Curry. These are all guys who's defense is so bad they neuter their team's effectiveness on the defensive end.  Harden's defense is meh at its worst. But it's not something that hurts his team and he plays great on ball defense, which is all you want from a wing/guard."
Seth Curry
"&gt; Seth Curry was the only role player that really showed up for the full series  Seth Curry literally had the most efficient scoring series in the history of basketball lmao, ""showing up"" is really underselling it."
"Exactly. Who do they have better than Simmons? Tobi maybe, then what? Matisse? Danny Green? Seth Curry?"
"Yeah, as a Kings fan I agree. 76ers can already play 5-out with 38%+ 3pt shooters: Curry, Kork, Green, Tobi, Joel. Everybody loves another 3pt shooter, but if they trade Simmons for even more spacing without getting back a PG that can start in the playoffs they will get significantly worse. Imagine Seth Curry trying to drive and kick against Jrue Holiday.   The Buddy to the 76ers rumors started when Simmons was still presumed to be a part of their core. In a vacuum Philly would love to add him for spare parts and late 1sts, but if they send Simmons out, they need Fox, Haliburton, or a 3rd team's starting-caliber PG to come back."
"It's not a weird stat. He is catching all of the blame even though Embiid shit the bed with a 4/20 shooting performance in Game 4 (and was clearly impacted by the injury - definitely not his fault), Doc was god awful all series, and Seth Curry was the only role player that really showed up for the full series. Doc is pulling his classic ""anybody but me"" routine. Guys like Ray Allen, Blake Griffin, Montrezl Harrell, and even Tim Duncan when he could have signed with the Magic are just collateral damage for him. Fuck Doc Rivers.  Simmons has a ton of faults, but he is still a plus-player by any stretch and brings a ton to the team. Morey asking for the farm in return is probably because his analytics have him as a massive boost to the team overall."
Would they be all in on Seth Curry as the starter at PG then?  This scenario leaves them really thin at that position.
"Words matter. A source stating that Simmons doesn‚Äôt want to play in Portland is different than Simmons or Rich Paul stating it themselves.   The Sixers aren‚Äôt begging for CJ McCollum. They arguably have a better deal available in Malcom Brogdon anyways since he is a much more capable PG than CJ is.   I‚Äôm not acting like Portland is begging for Ben Simmons right now, I‚Äôm acting like CJ McCollum doesnt move the needle for the Sixers and I could make the argument that it makes them significantly worse defensively and marginally better offensively. CJ is a significantly better offensive player than Ben but is a significantly worse distributor. Any additional offense you might get from him over Ben is negated by a Seth Curry, CJ McCollum backcourt. If Dame and CJ got torched as often as they did, Seth and CJ are gonna be COOKED."
Sure but it‚Äôs not worth trading him if you aren‚Äôt getting a more talented player in return imo. They have Seth Curry already who‚Äôs one of the best floor spacing role players in the league
They aren‚Äôt attractive for Simmons.  It makes the Sixers worse.  This is like if the Sixers thought they could get a low tier all star for Seth Curry.  Curry is useful in his role but that‚Äôs just not happening
"76ers really have great team chemistry/character guys outside of Ben.  Maxey is super positive, Matisse and Korkmaz are best buds, Troel ""the Process"" Embiid is hilarious and super loyal, Green is a classic locker room vet, Seth Curry is super positive, the list goes on.  Get rid of Ben with some guys who are happy to be on a winner and play within themselves and Phi is gonna look soooo different."
"I like Seth Curry, and I root for him to do well in any uniform he‚Äôs in. Buddy Hield is light years ahead of him, though. Seth will always be Seth, but I believe Buddy, given the right team and fit, can be a monster shooter in this league."
sixers fans will still claim he's the best gm in the league because he got seth curry despite fumbling harden and any sort of decent return for simmons
"It was his role because the Sixers don't have a single other PG on the roster man. Theyve had a bunch of SGs like Seth, Maxey, Danny Green, Richardson etc.   They've yet to have a single player next to Simmons that can actually run an offense.   You can't have him in a Draymond role without a PG. And there's no PG in the entire league that runs the PnR more similarly to curry than Dame. All he has to do is run the 4v3s Dame creates.  Will he be draymond on defense? No. He's a perimeter defender. But he can easily be him on offense. His BBIQ may be lower, but he's also taller and more athletic, a better passer, and a vastly better finisher that actually puts pressure on the help defender"
"he was also the one huerter was attacking over and over again in game 7. huerter had 27 points on 18 shots and there was a stretch where he scored in 4 straight possessions in the second half that really sucked the life out of our squad  i love love love curry, and he‚Äôs got an amazing contract, but *if* there‚Äôs an improvement over curry on the market i‚Äôd take it. gotta remember if we wont have ben, seth isn‚Äôt gonna be able to hide as well this year next to danny green (yet another year older) and whichever point guard we have"
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"&gt;  Huh, they cover each other‚Äôs weaknesses perfectly.  Draymond could be paired with literally anyone and help cover their weaknesses.  KP is still a bad defender.  &gt;  KP is way too laterally slow to play the 4 next to a big 5.  You're right.  He's also too weak to play the 5, too slow in every direction to play 3, and unlike all good defensive 4's he's not switchable.  &gt;  KP before this year was actually a very good rim protector, he just needs good help defense in the pnr which draymond can provide.  That's not why he stopped being a good rim defender.  He stopped being a good rim defender because his knees are torn apart and he can't move, and he hasn't added any strength to compensate.  &gt;  On offense, dray gives luka a secondary playmaker and KP can cover for draymonds lack of shooting with his spacing.  Yeah, KP's spacing helps Dray.  That's really the only benefit to pairing them.  Frankly, Luka plays off ball so little I genuinely don't know if he's good off ball.  In terms of cuts, he doesn't have much quickness, but he's as smart as they come with good instincts so I'm sure he could be good this way.  &gt;  They give Dallas the flexibility to run KP as the 4 and Dray as the 5 on offense and then switch to KP as the 5 and Dray as the 4 on defense.  You can't really start Dray at the 5.  It's good in small doses for small ball, but the amount of energy it takes for him to play 5 means we typically only played our death squad or Hamptons 5 (our Harrison Barnes and KD small ball sets) a maximum of 10 minutes in any given game.  The basic problem is this:  KP can't move well enough to guard anyone outside of 10 feet, and he gets bullied at the rim.  Luka is barely a positive defender because he's sharp and strong, but he also lacks lateral movement.  The Mavs two biggest problems were that they had 2-3 people on the court at any given time who could get barbecued in the iso, and that they had the same people who couldn't switch onto other players.  Your offense, especially when you had Seth Curry instead of Josh Richardson, was terrifying.  But the basic idea is that if you guys are able to survive Jason Kidd's coaching, you desperately need a versatile defensive 4 who can maybe hit a 3 at a decent clip."
"Why not Wiggins and Moody to Kings‚Ä¶ Simmons, Seth Curry to GSW  Barnes, Hield and 3 GSW FRP‚Äôs to 6ers?"
"The Curry brothers are better. Steph is much better than Brook, and Seth is not much worse than Robin (if he even is)."
"Mannings is a great answer as they were both champs, no idea how it slipped my mind, especially since I'm a Broncos fan.  The Gasol brothers was the true answer I was looking for as they both have had roughly equally successful careers.   Seth has not played well long enough for me to think the Curry brothers together are better.   Hard to ignore the Williams sisters."
I think Steph is so much better than both of them and Seth isnt too far behind them that the curry brothers would have that spot.
"It is kinda tricky, the Kings are just not a good team to trade with for the 76ers. In that trade we desperately need someone who is capable of running the offense. Fox is that guy in Sacramento but I understand he's valuable for them.      THey are also high on Hali, who I think we would take, but he is not ideal for the Sixers, he is not a proven PG and he played a comboguard role. If they believe in Mitchell I guueeeess he could be on the table, but apparently it is not the case.     No way we would take a Hield/Barnes/Bagley based package - that would put sophomore Maxey, Shake Milton, a shoot first microwave guard who shouldn't really handle the ball for too long, and Seth Curry as our only point guards.      Dear Morey, please take the Wolves package and ask for D'Angelo Russell as its centerpiece. Both teams will be happy, D'Lo is a clutch shooter who can run the pick and roll - slow but steady."
"Not true, I have to disagree.    The team have been propping up Ben ever since he's been in the league.   He's gotten top minutes, credit and glory of a top player and is paid like one too.   This is on Ben.   Doc gave him the green light to shoot more and from range, Ben decided not to.   It wasn't Doc or the team that shot 30% from the line in the playoffs, it was Ben.   It wasn't the team that decided not to abuse a 6'1 guard on the blocks, it was Ben.   The team didn't pass up dunks out of fear of getting fouled, it was Ben.    With the big money, the All Star appearances and the endorsements of a superstar,, also come the pressure and expectations of a superstar.     There is absolutely nothing stopping him from hiring a real shooting coach (that's not his brother) to help him.   Nothing stopping him from practicing hitting 500 free throws after each practice.   He's played with and have coaches that are/were elite shooters.  How do you play with  JJ Redick, Seth Curry, Danny Green and not ask then for tips and help?   Embiid worked on his game as an All Star.   The Joel of the past season is miles better than the Embiid of 2 seasons ago.   This is all on Ben and this is coming from a huge Simmons fan."
"How does a he fit as a max player with Kyrie, CP3 or Harden? His only offensive skill is passing and you're putting him with ball dominant players. And setting screens for Seth Curry is not feasible offense when Simmons can't shoot or exploit mismatches. Just switch the screen. Curry can't take a mismatch 1 on 1 and even in the rare instance Simmons can you can just hack him."
Give his money to Seth Curry.
"&gt; I would argue Seth Curry certainly accomplished that.  accomplished what? you still couldn't put ben in the roll spot with Seth because either Dwight or Embiid was in the game. maybe you could but Doc is too stupid to even attempt putting embiid or dwight in the dunker spot rather than Ben.  &gt;Daryl Morey personally brought in Doc.  doc was hired before Morey resigned from Houston. improving his players is abstract at best. the Clippers performed significantly better in the playoffs this year despite negligible difference in talent vs the year before. shit they got to the conference finals after losing their best player.  if you want to bring up tobias, i'd argue that removing Butler and Horford had a more significant impact on his efficiency this year. he was allowed to back down smaller players and take mid range shots. in the past he was always on the floor with one of horford or ben.   Doc still doesn't have Tobias shooting 3's with the volume this team needs. Doc had ZERO creativity utilizing Simmons.  &gt;Which stretch five was available?  this year? olynyk. dedmond was sitting at home, at least he can make FT jumpers consistently. we also have BBall Paul on the roster but Doc refused to even let him play during the regular season because he was tryharding for the 1 seed. How'd that work out?  but it wasn't just this year. they've failed to put a stretch 5 on the roster outside of embiid since Ersan left after the 17-18 season.  &gt;Typing good arguments on a discussion board   you consider r/nba a discussion board? hilarious. it's a flame fest where you get your jokes in to be voted to the top of the thread and then the rest of the circle jerk falls in place. especially when it comes to the sixers."
"I would argue Seth Curry certainly accomplished that. Especially in the post season. Danny Green was a great shooter. I would agree that the lack of shooting the year prior was a nightmare. I‚Äôd also argue Fultz was literally brought in to accomplish every single thing you listed until he got the yips.     Daryl Morey personally brought in Doc. He wanted him in Houston too. He‚Äôs a coach who‚Äôs improved his players in every stop, including here.   Which stretch five was available? We signed Dwight for the minimum. I‚Äôd have loved an other option but I don‚Äôt see one. We also were a defensive minded team and Dwight held down the rim while Embiid sat. Dwight also played most of his minutes with the second unit. The star he player most with was Tobias. Not sure what game taoe you‚Äôre watching.   Joerger is a good coach. So is Doc. So is Cassell. We have a great staff. It‚Äôd be a shame to lose any of them     I don‚Äôt think you made very good points. Your argument is a gross simplification of how hard it is to win in the NBA. The Sixers fell apart and Ben got in his head. We failed. It wasn‚Äôt a bad shot     Typing good arguments on a discussion board is not a bad thing. If you want to meme around, there‚Äôs way better places for it"
They wouldn‚Äôt have Seth (in theory)   Butler was traded for JRich who was traded for curry
Its a problem. If you wanna start Seth Curry.
I mean I'd believe it with Maxey and Seth curry
"They have Seth Curry, they don't need Hield.  It would have to be like Barnes, Mitchell, Bagley, and two firsts."
"CJ and Seth Curry doesnt seem like a great backcourt. I don‚Äôt know if Philly has to get a pg back but I would think if you want to not take a huge step back you need someone to replace Ben, They should have made a trade before free agency so they could have got the best player availability and sign a pg there. It really feels like there‚Äôs only a handful of teams that can make a deal and not sure how great the return will be."
I just think it would be really fun to watch Seth Curry and Buddy Hield shooting a bunch of threes together.
Seth ‚ÄúThe Regular Expression‚Äù Curry
Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * McDaniels  * Prince  * Maxey  * 2 Wolves 1sts  * 2 Sixers 1sts
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
"D‚ÄôLo sucks until it comes to trading him, then he‚Äôs the only point guard fit for Philly and no way they‚Äôd take anything less  They need Beasley as their Seth Curry replacement. That‚Äôs the best player they will get in the trade, along with McDaniels, and whomever else  Just too bad we don‚Äôt have Rubio anymore, that might have helped."
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
"Lets go Ben, Seth Curry and 2 unprotected 1st rnd picks for Lillard.   If I am Portland that's the only deal I take in a Lillard for Ben deal."
"In a Lillard trade I could see:  Ben, Seth Curry and a unprotected 1st for Lillard."
"Wolves: Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe  76ers: Kristaps Porzingis, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Tyrell Terry  Mavs: Patrick Beverly, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey"
Who is that young guy if not Maxey?  Edit:  also Seth Curry is better than you're giving him credit for here.
ben+young guy+pick‚Äôs return would be a significant upgrade over seth curry or danny green  its not an important argument really but maxey could start for us and id be okay with it as long as our 2-3 spot is upgraded a good bit
So you are telling me that is not Ben Simmons fault if we lost that series against Atlanta?? The man who was supposed to be our 2nd guy averaged 11 pts in a playoff series even Seth Curry played 15x better than him the entire playoffs
"Morey got out from the Horford contract, Seth Curry for free, and the 1 seed in the East in his first year.   Brain rot and hot takes are the lifeblood of this sub."
"Honestly not really. Sure the Kings are in California but they don't have a lot that Philly would be interested in aside from Harrison Barnes.  For all of Ben's faults, the two things he's able to provide are wing defense and ball-handling (the fact that he's a single player that can do *both* of those things makes him special). In most scenarios, Philly would need to get two players back to fill that void. It's why I think the best theoretical return for Philly would be OG and FVV from Toronto.  Sacramento can provide that on a much weaker scale. It'd be Barnes and one of either Haliburton or Mitchell. I don't see Philly being 100% interested in either of those guards since they're so young.   Buddy Hield only makes sense if the 76ers were actually keeping Simmons. Can you imagine how awful a Seth Curry and Buddy Hield backcourt would be? Sure they can shoot great, but neither of those guys are actual playmakers."
Simmons + Seth Curry returning to Portland for CJ + RoCo return to Philly.
Hield makes sense *if you're keeping Ben Simmons*. Neither Hield or Seth Curry can actually run the point.
"All time or nah? If it's all time, I'd go  Steph - Jrue - Dominique - Giannis - Pau  Bench: Marc, Marcus Morris, Markieff, Lamelo, Lonzo, Seth Curry, Gerard Wilkins, Thanasis"
"Some of us know the truth. The man carries the team and Seth is the next most dangerous man they have imo.   This is just a highlight of, ""Why the fuck isn't their point gaurd taking control of the offence more. Particularly in the 4th"".  Some of that shit was just good defence as well. Like one of them he is triple teamed with no support and no options. What, we just expect Embiid to have handles like Kyrie and Curry now?"
Unless it‚Äôs Doc Rivers in which case Seth Curry will 1v1 Steph the entire game regardless of heat
The games were practically played in the dark because Seth curry shot the lights out. What did he average from 3 for the series? I thought I read it was 78%. That makes up for even the worst of 3 PT shooters including Ben
"I guess I‚Äôm just annoyed at the fact that we don‚Äôt get credit for beating them when Trae was injured, we had no Deandre Hunter, no Cam Reddish, and an injured Bogi who shot around 15 - 20 % every game because his knee was noticeably injured. To add to it Seth Curry averaged 21 on 79% true shooting and Joel still averaged 30ppg and it‚Äôs like damn, we deserve some fucking respect you know? All I hear are oh well 6ers lost to themselves and it‚Äôs like no, you lost to the Hawks without 3 starters and an injured Trae."
"He wasn't even the 3rd option in these playoffs, he was 4th behind Seth Curry"
"Or even just keep Simmons. The Butler-Simmons-Embiid team was pretty good, and were a few improvements (like Seth Curry) away from being elite.   But they went with the $109m backup center instead."
How did people know he'd be great?    Klay was 39% from 3s during his senior year at Washington State in 2010-2011.  That wasn't even enough for the top 100 shooters that year.    Seth Curry was 50th or so at 44%.  Ian Clark shot 43% and wasn't nearly as good.
"[List of 2nd generation NBA talents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second-generation_National_Basketball_Association_players)  Notables: Jerami/Jerian Grant &amp; Harvey Grant, Tim Hardaway Sr &amp; Jr, Del Curry &amp; Steph/Seth Curry, Mychal Thompson &amp; Klay Thompson, Bill Walton &amp; Luke Walton,"
8th is too low for Seth Curry. He should be 1st.
I‚Äôve never seen anyone in the Curry family put up 73% TS in a playoff run and outplay a second place DPOY. Therefore Seth &gt; Dell and that scrub Wardell (family disappointment)
Seth Curry needed more help.
Dame will get an mvp award.  Seth curry will win the 3 point contest
"Seth Curry getting abused on defense is on Doc Rivers to stop.   Seth has never for a single second been a defensive stopper so it should and was part of the Hawks game plan and Doc Rivers (or any coach with a triple digit IQ) should be able to predict that being the case and compensate for it in his own game plan, or at the very least make reactive adjustments in the moment, which we all know Doc would rather die than do."
Agreed. Hard to blame him on defense bc I actually think his positioning was solid he just simply doesn't have the length to contest taller guys. Like if you actually look at the shots they were making against him he's right in their grill but it just isn't enough to bother them.  It's on the coaching staff for not even attempting to hide him. Like if the hawks are effectively hiding Trae young I think we can hide seth curry
"Wonder if Callie Rivers calls Seth ""The Other Curry""."
That Seth curry trade was such a heist
"Are these guys high percentage shooters or guys who get open looks cause of Luka but will look like trash come playoff time.  It's why I hated the Seth Curry trade the moment i saw it. Just because you have a guy who can do it all, doesn't mean you make them do it all."
Exactly. Ben‚Äôs value is so low sixers might accept Westbrook for Ben + Seth Curry
I disagree as well. The KP move was a gamble worth taking. Just sucks it hasn't worked out. I think their real issue is falling in love with role players and forgetting their identity. The Seth curry trade was bad. Just giving up a real high value contract for an average one. They have too many guys that really need a defined role in order to succeed.    I will give credit for Powell though. Before he got hurt he definitely outplayed my expectations. And you can't predict an injury like that   Also the knicks owned/still own their other pick(s)
"And what about Seth Curry?  He has to take responsibility for shooting so well, it made Ben even more insecure in his shot....."
"Oh please. Ben was by far the biggest reason they lost. He scored less than 10ppg. He straight up stopped shooting towards the end of the series. 3 shots in game 2. 4 shots in game 5. 4 in game 7.  The frustrating thing is when Ben did try to score, he usually scored. But he was scared shitless of going to the line, where he shot 33%. He wants to be respected after that? Yeah right.  Embiid played well, Seth Curry had a fantastic series, Harris was decent...Ben shit the bed and he's THE reason they lost."
"Sorry that the Sixers don‚Äôt want your scraps for an all star dpoy candidate. Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a couple crappy late picks. Wow yeah! That‚Äôs definitely not wasting Embiids prime. Those two players literally add nothing to our team. We have Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz and Seth Curry who all play a similar shooting guard role to beasley. So if we trade for him it literally just pushes one of our good young role players who are in need of development out of the roster for a player who is not that much better. Yes beasley averaged 19 last year but he adds nothing new to our team that we need and he only averaged that much cuz kat and dlo were out for most of the season. He isn‚Äôt taking 16 shots a night at the Sixers. Jaden McDaniels, sure he‚Äôs an good young prospect but his ceiling isn‚Äôt that high and we have Tobias Harris and George‚Äôs Niang who are both better than him. Niang shoots 40% + from 3. So McDaniels would be lucky to even be in the bench rotation. In conclusion, we get nothing"
Problem with CJ McCollum is that means Seth Curry gets pushed out. They can‚Äôt be on the court at the same time because they are both defensive liabilities and we need a ball carrier that can distribute. That isn‚Äôt one of CJs strengths.
Seth Curry the point god and it ain't even close.
Seth Curry
"A few reasons, but We basically had to bet everything on KP and We have had no tradable draft assets because of it. We traded multiple first round picks for KP after trading a first round pick for Luka. Ironically if there was no lottery system we would‚Äôve had the 3rd pick originally and wouldn‚Äôt have needed to trade up. This meant we didn‚Äôt have any 1st round picks that we could trade for 5 years (I think?) because of the Stephan rule. It‚Äôs really tough to trade for good players without first round picks, especially when all the players you draft are projects (josh green, Tyler hey, etc.) so they aren‚Äôt worth much anyways.  In addition, a few years ago we thought we were getting Kemba, but when that fell through our backup plan was seth curry (awesome player), and Delon Wright. Analytics said Wright would be great for Luka (efficient player, good at defense) but he was awful next to Luka (hesitant to shoot, mediocre at best defensively) so that was a bust.  The following offseason, instead of spending our money for guys like bogonovich we were somewhat held hostage by the idea that Giannis might not re-sign with the bucks. Props to the hawks for bowing out of those sweepstakes early and instead shoring up their roster, seems like that was the right move. Because we wanted cap space, we traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson (1yr deal +1 yr player option). We expected him to be the exact player we were hoping to get from Delon Wright, and that he would play above his contract, thus leading him to opt out of Giannis were to be available. Unfortunately he became Delon Wright 2.0 (hesitant to shoot, mediocre defensively), and Giannis re-signed with the bucks later in that offseason. We also traded for James Johnson (expiring) and then traded him for JJ Redick (expiring).  This off-season we had a decent amount of money so we were hoping for Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately he took his talents to south beach. We seem to finally understand our best option is to just spend our money on good role players instead of swinging for big players, which led to re-signing THJ, and signing Bullock and Brown. I think our roster is better than last year, but the coaching change will likely take some time to adjust for the players.  tldr;  Trading for KP and Luka cost us tons of draft capital  We prioritized cap space for star players, but never signed any star players."
"Simmons is in no way the 76ers best asset.   Better assets include:  * 2027 and 2028 FRPs * Seth Curry * Korkmaz * Thybulle * Maxey * Isaiah Joe   Ben Simmons is on a max contract and is probably impossible to build around. You realistically can't get a better team for him than the 76ers are now. If the 76ers can't even get to the ECF with him, then no team is getting to a conference finals with him."
"They have Seth Curry, kind of already got him. A weaker version than him but they got his skill set in him. High volume 40% 3‚Äôs shooting guard who has bad defense"
So when are you gonna post your next ‚ÄúSixers opponent should attack Seth Curry‚Äù post? Those are like your classics lol.
"""Either Ben plays for us (Does not look like it's happening) or we're getting an impact player (Also not happening because nobody would give up an impact player for Simmons)"". Objectively stating two things you want to happen is not evidence of fucking anything.  Either Angelina Jolie pleasures me tonight or Jennifer Lawrence does. Just because I say the things I want to happen, doesn't mean they're going to happen. I bet Morey would be pretty stoked to trade Simmons for Curry, but right now he'd be lucky to get Seth, or even Ayesha."
Seth Curry also played the best basketball of his life against the Hawks. He was a monster that series
"That‚Äôs a huge problem. And a big part of his playmaking was just handing the ball to Seth Curry, standing near the hoop, and not boxing out for rebounds."
Seth Curry.  May be too harsh.
iirc for some reason he seems to have a grudge against seth curry too and went out of his way to make some posts about his defense.
Danny Green is playing SF though... Seth Curry is in the SG spot as far as starters go.
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
"Actually yes, I do love me some Seth Curry too.   üòâ"
The rare Seth Curry fan I see. Nice!
"Gonna add to this. All of these plays, the defenses used different schemes.   1. So some tried to switch so that the guy covering Malone goes to cover Stockton at the elbow. The guy on Stockton tries to find someone uncovered and often got lost. And then a 3rd guy rotated from someone else to try to stop Malone at the rim.  - As a ball handler, Ben Just wouldn't scare people that way at the elbow with shooting.  - As the screener, looks better. Ben Simmons is a rim threat obviously because he's large. In that situation, he might not always go as aggressively to the rim though if the ball handler passed him. At times, he passes that off to whoever's man would rotate to defend the dunk/layup.   2. Malone's defender fully sagged off. Stockton's defender went under the screen. Malone's screen was so good on that, that Stockton was either able to drive to the rim and/or pass, or shoot from the elbow.  - Could work if it was a Seth Curry/Simmons P&amp;R with Seth as the ball handler, except in that instance, no one would ordinarily go under on Seth. Simmons defender might play colder to him on that screen to possibly switch. Does Ben Simmons attack that guy in the post or pass it off? Is there an Embiid clogging up space in the paint. If he's at the 3 point line, that's a win for the defending team.  - As the ball handler? You let him shoot the midrange.   For every one of the different iterations of how they defended that P&amp;R, it's reliant on Simmons going aggressively to the rim, or being able to shoot from midrange, or there not being a center in there, or having a capable passer/shooter type to be the ball handler. I still like the play though. It just needs him to shoot from deeper midrange for the love of Christ. Just threaten it."
"But that's the only thing he does. He's a bad ball handler, his efficiency is bad despite his shooting ability, he plays horrible defense, and he can't consistently start for a 35 win team. He would likely be better in the Seth Curry role but he would also never take that role because he thinks he's a star. I also don't agree that his shot creation is worth anything, he shot under 45% on 2s last season and put up 16.6 points on 14 shots a game."
Yea maybe Seth curry
dude loves seth curry more than his own son lmao
"''Police, hello? Help me, I'm Ben Simmons 6' 10'', Seth Curry tryna beat me up''"
"Then why are the other bigs all so much more efficient in the pnr? And it's not because they have Ben to handle the ball, he's terrible as a pnr ball handler, it's hard to screen a defender when he never has to leave the paint. Ben is behind Shake, Maxey, Tobi, and Seth Curry in volume as a pnr handler while being way less efficient, once again near the bottom of the league in efficiency. If Mike Scott, Furkan Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, and Tony Bradley can all be effective rollers with Maxey and Seth as the best PnR ball handlers on the roster, why can't Ben?"
If he had the character and determination of Seth Curry he'd be in contention for GOAT status.
"Can those other teams offer 3x all star Ben Simmons, some picks, maxey or thybulle with Seth curry?"
"Buddy would just be another SG for us that can't play make and isn't super useful since we already have Seth Curry. Yeah he's a good player but he doesn't move the needle for us even slightly.   Then, Bagley might not even get minutes over a guy like Niang, he adds pretty much no value to a team trying to contend.  That trade would be an absolute disaster and does nothing for our roster construction or chances to compete."
"Harris didn‚Äôt play well and he actually is supposed to be a scoring threat for them, Seth Curry got cooked by Trae young and honestly all the Hawks guards cooked him. Doc has awful rotations that were all bench players at certain points. Simmons missed an open dunk and didn‚Äôt shoot the ball in 4th quarters. Simmons could have taken a bunch of 4th quarter shots and it wouldn‚Äôt have changed the ways everybody else fucked up too.  It‚Äôs easy to say Simmons was the main issue but this is the same guy who when he didn‚Äôt play during the playoffs the Sixers got swept by Boston. I can‚Äôt blame the teams failures on Simmons in good faith knowing that without him they literally didn‚Äôt win a game"
"Sure, i guess looking at a situation with nuance now means you are someone's burner.  This isn't complicated buddy, they were all at fault for losing that series aginast the Hawks, from Doc to all the players (minus Seth Curry), but the organization/coaches/players all blamed Ben for literally NO reason.  Joel Embiid went to the media and literally said that he felt the turning point of Game 7 was when they had a layup, but ended up with a FT. Ben Simmons should've responded saying that he felt that the turning point of the game was when his center almost had a triple double with turnovers and his 200 million small forward shot 8-24 from the field.  They all shit the bed, but blamed one guy for it and now are shocked that this guy doesn't respect them anymore, wtf. Whatever, he is going to get traded, the Sixers will be worse because they won't get equal value and will end up as a perpetual second round team."
"Doc Rivers Game 1 Pregame Speech:  Can you smell it? There's a life force in here tonight. Do you feel it? I look around this room and I see potential.  [to Seth Curry] I see the future chairman of a Fortune 500 company.  [to Andre Drummund] I see a famous rap artist.  [to Joel Embiid] I see the President of the United States of America.  Seth Curry:  He's from Cameroon.   Doc:  Being an only child,educated entirely by private tutors my whole life,I'm looking forward to interacting with children like Ben Simmons for the first time.  I'm gonna teach you,and I bet you might teach me a little something also.  Now, those of you from western Pennsylvania probably know my father, Doc Rivers senior, the ""lighting fixture"" king.  All the lights you'll see around this arena have been donated by him.  But I'm gonna do old Dad one better.  I'm not gonna give you a light.  I'm gonna show you the light!  And to help me do it, let's meet the new coaching staff of the 76ers!"
honestly sixers minus Simmons would be a plus.  Ben was quickly becoming option #4 for baskets when Seth Curry started stabilizing and become dependable with buckets.  obviously sixer fans happy to see shake and maxey getting more minutes.  we will see
"I think that is very very clear at this point. The real question is - what is the 6ers plan. Ben is obviously not focused on winning a championship this year. The 6ers should be - this isnt the way to win one. Ben is obviously willing to punt this year, which sucks, but for some reason Morey has decided he will just punt it too. With an uninterested, suspended ""injuried"" Ben throughout the year I put their championship hopes at ""other teams best players need to get injured"" Embiid is a beast, but Tobias or Seth Curry or whoever their second best player is will not be enough to beat the elite teams in the East or the West."
is that guy related to Seth Curry by any chance?
Seth Curry the diplomat
"Very new basketball fan and man i fucking love KD, he's not even on my team but he might be my first jersey purchase. It's either him or seth curry"
"If he could have Seth Curry on him every game, he'd make $40 million annually."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
16m for one good playoff game against Seth curry damn.
**WHAT A FUCKING STEAL! THE CORE IS BACK FOR MORE. SETH CURRY WATCH YA FRONT**
The only world Grayson is getting minutes over Donte is if Grayson magically turns into Seth Curry.
"I mean I'm much more into the just raw G/F/C distinction and I think that's probably the better way to look at a team like the nets especially, if you want to get into the small stuff and say Harden is their PG I don't think you're wrong I'm just probably going to consider him a SG for his entire career. As for the Seth curry point I might but that's only cause I don't think Ben is a guard at all but rather a lebron like point-forward, which again, might not be the most popular opinion."
Ben Simmons would have been traded in a package with Tobias Harris and Seth Curry just to make the trade balanced.
"Just to be clear, we're talking about Steph here right? Stephen Wardell Curry? Not seth not ayesha not dell nor sonya? As in Steph Curry"
Robert Covington or Seth Curry
Seth Curry
Seth curry would like a word mr porter jr
"Seth Curry is a starter, isn't he?  he started all games he played in last year, anyway.  or does Ben get traded for CJ in these simulations?"
"Stats matter, until they don‚Äôt.   You‚Äôre looking at last seasons numbers, a season that kawhi was limited with injury. Seth curry did play better defense than kawhi last season. It‚Äôs not that difficult to understand.   Look at career and Lowry is still lower than dragic.   I‚Äôm not trolling. Lowry plays terrible defense. Individual and team. Anyone who says otherwise is either oblivious or thinks he cute. I have a guess on which you are"
You‚Äôre literally using a defensive metric that says Kyle Kuzma and Seth Curry are better defensive players than Kawhi Leonard. If that doesn‚Äôt tell you defensive metrics aren‚Äôt shit I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I‚Äôm 90% sure you‚Äôre trolling here though.
Seth Curry comparisons
"But he doesn‚Äôt do it dirty, how can you hate on someone just doing well? I think it‚Äôs ok to hate players like bev or draymond (kicking people in the testicles) because of their dirty physicality but how do you hate Wardell ‚Äúbrother of Seth curry‚Äù curry?"
I've seen too many players get Seth Curry comps as if its an easy role to fill. Its extremely difficult  playing the 2 when you're at that much of a physical disadvantage. Extremely small margin of error.
Mavs got truly fleeced by the Sixers. Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and a waived second rounder.
he was supposed to be seth  curry
The Mavs traded Seth Curry for him and Richardson and were hoping that Terry would be the next Seth Curry. They now dumped both players basically
"Seth Curry played in the G League and now he's pretty much an elite role player. NBA execs would be stupid to turn down siblings of insanely talented players, they have the same genetics"
"No one after his college career was over thought Seth Curry would have much of an NBA future, but through his own hard work, he is having quite a decent career."
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
"i saw it too lmao. must be a crazy sixers fan lmao. the blazers get simmons, barnes, seth curry and a first for what, for dame and cj. lmaooo. and not to talk about literally everything else"
"I'd love to see Seth Curry traded to Golden State, it'd be neat to see the Curry bros play together, and Golden State adding a guy who's shot 45% from three on five attempts per game the past two years and is great at moving off-ball would be super fun to watch."
Seth Curry over Drummond.
seth curry
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
I wish we could get Seth Curry back :(
"Mavs had Seth Curry which is the genetically closest player to Steph and Cuban traded his ass. Seth was playing great. It was like having Steph-lite. All the running off-ball, going through screens and creating angles for others worked so well when Seth was here. Seth also had great playoff performances for that bargain contract. And then they've traded Seth for Richardson who fell off rotation in playoffs and returned almost nothing to the Mavs. Cuban was not able to see the value of Curry style game for less than $10m salary.  Anyway, I don't think Marc value Steph Curry's game, he is into the results. I**f Steph was a Maverick when he was having ankle injuries, Cuban would trade him** for some mediocre player. **Like he did to S.Nash** and let him be **MVP** elsewhere."
"I'd say he's different than Seth Curry tbh  Seth is a MUCH better shooter, FVV has the edge at pretty much everything else though"
"If OKC would agree to make the sixers 2025 1st round pick unprotected, then the sixers will have all but 1 of their draft picks. Seth Curry is on a really good contract and he would be valuable to any tanking team purely to flip for draft picks.  And maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe, are all quality young players. Even Paul Reed, Shake Milton, and Jaden Springer have a bit of trade value. Are any of them elite prospects? Hell no. Notice I said ""decent war chest of assets"". Not the best in the league. There are teams with better war chests.   Let's say dame became available in a trade. The knicks, nuggets and warriors could probably all beat the sixers best offer. But would the knicks be willing to go all in on Dame this early into their rebuild? We all know what Lacob has said about wanting to build for the future. Now maybe the warriors would go all in on dame, but it would cost a pretty penny to beat the sixers offer, and it's not clear that they would do that. And would the nuggets be willing to offer murray AND mpj? They can't even trade MPJ until next year because of the poison pill provision."
"That's probably the ideal fit, but I think just a shot creating 2 guard like Book, CJ, Beal etc. would suffice as well.   I mean they were the 1 seed with Seth Curry playing that role last year."
"hm... apparently seth curry is actually ""seth adham curry""."
Steph curry and Seth p curry
Seth Curry was a 2 star recruit lol
Seth Curry and Damian Lee were both all acc; Seth led duke in scoring his sr year.   Zaire Wade could barely get off the bench for his prep team and was a fringe division 1 player.
"Seth curry averaged 18 a game at Duke, Zaire is a mid-major caliber player"
"There was already a pretty good nba player who shot underhandedly and he was among the best ft shooters of all time, if not the very best.  There have been studies saying underhand shooting is ‚Äúscientifically‚Äù better.  But I think they are very inaccurate studies as they are based on the assumption that a player can be as accurate under handed as they are over handed.    If Shaq did it I think you would see bigs do it if they shoot really bad like Dwight Howard.  And maybe we‚Äôd see a few more shooters who struggle at the  FT line in high 60‚Äôs low 70‚Äôs try it, but I doubt it‚Äôd become universal.  Guys like steph curry Seth curry aren‚Äôt changing from their 90%+ overhand free throws no matter how many other players do it.  I think for bigs who don‚Äôt take jumpers anyway, or even guys like Ben Simmons who don‚Äôt take jumpers, it could make sense.  Going to the ft line cold either way if you don‚Äôt take jumpers in game."
As was Seth curry and damion lee.
"Because that team badly needed spacing, and Seth Curry is one of the best shooters in the league."
"For the 6ers side? They‚Äôll get over that. Ben‚Äôs defensive versatility is huge for them but their inability to finish games is way more glaring. No one on their team can get you a basket when in the last few minutes   Embiid gets pushed out and is forced to touch the ball way outside his spots. No one can create their own shot from out there so they rely on Seth Curry way too much. Kyrie would eliminate that issue   Thybulle is obviously not the same as Ben but he‚Äôd probably get you a decent percentage of what Ben does on defense, especially if he does improve this year even further"
"I mean with Lowry we would‚Äôve had no guarantee he would re sign and we also would lose our two best wing defenders. Despite what some people would like you to believe, it wasn‚Äôt just because of Ben that we lost that series. The Hawks wings were abusing us once Danny Green got hurt. K‚Äôvon Huerter doesn‚Äôt shoot over Seth Curry every possession if we had the ability to play Danny Green over Shake Milton and George Hill. Yes I think having Lowry would help but for the price Masai was asking I think we actually get worse"
Also turns out Seth Curry doesn't actually post-up.
Psh. They ain‚Äôt yelling for Steph. Seth Curry is the GOAT
"Using him as a screener is very pointless, that's an easy under the screen and it resets   Plus they don't have a ballhandler like that, who can he PnR with Seth Curry?"
He‚Äôs basically a PF in the half court and a PG in transition. He runs some two man actions with Seth Curry but it was usually to free Curry up for a 3 or to get downhill. Maybe a better PG scan unlock him but idk
I musta missed something because I don't remember seth curry and jaylen brown being better than irving and tatum
"He‚Äôs just gotta be able to throw the post entry pass, set up for a three, and play defense. You don‚Äôt need Simmons level creation. That‚Äôs what embiid is for.  I get that the league is all guard centric now, but, as a spurs fan, I‚Äôve seen offenses win chips just feeding the post all day. It can be done.  They feed embiid. He dominates. They double him. Embiid kicks out for a wide open 3. Seth curry or maxey or whomever makes the shot."
Switch Tatum with Seth Curry and I agree  /s
Just gonna sneak in Seth Curry and Miles Bridges like that
seth curry LOL
"Eric Gordon &gt; Seth Curry  Yeah, I know. But EG can handle the ball reliably, is a lot sturdier on defence, and can score on drives a lot better than Seth can WHILE being just as good of a 3 point shooter‚Ä¶ sometimes.  Seth Curry is way more consistent, I totally get that, but the upside of EG is way better, and I honestly think your medium-night EG is a more valuable piece."
"Reports are saying Josh Green is looking awesome. I haven't heard as much about him, but I'm still hoping Tyrell Terry can develop into a Buddy Hield/JJ Redick type as our Seth Curry replacement. That trade still hurts so much."
"It might be more about fit and size, if Seth Curry is starting him and Maxey in the backcourt is pretty small. Shake is also a better shooter."
"Seth curry is going to have a dominant year with an expanded role. People will write him off as a known quantity, but he will very important to 6rs success this year"
"Well, if you gotta give up Seth Curry it‚Äôs only fair that you get back equal value."
"Agreed.  Ben (and Joel to a lesser extent) make three-point specialists look good and cover for them on D.   **JJ Redick** set the record for the oldest player to set a career high in ppg, then broke his own record the next year.    **Landry Shamet** was first team all-rookie with the sixers and hasn't matched any of his advanced stats from that season since (PER, TS, BPM, WS, VORP).    **Dario Saric** was a quality starter in his early twenties, second on a 50 win team in scoring and he has been a bench player after he left.  **Covington** is another guy who set all his career highs in philly.  **Furkan Korkmaz** was a free agent anybody could have had for the minimum but he's only a rotation player in Philly because Simmons covers for him on defense and sets him up on offense.  **Seth Curry** was a MLE signing who played on 5 teams in his first three seasons and has found a real home in Philly alongside Jo and Ben.  All these guys take at least half of their shots from three.  Ben is a tough fit and he shat the bed in the playoffs after he fell apart at the line but it's easy to forget he's a three-time all-star who made an all-nba team for a reason."
"Since this isn;t the Sixers sub where all of this has been discussed endlessly here, a couple points to throw out to let you know where I am coming from here:   1.  Joel Embiid is a MUCH better OFFENSIVE player with Ben Simmons on the court vs without him.  More efficient, better shooting percentages, better advanced stats.   2.  Sixers starting lineup with Ben Simmons is +15.9, and was statistiaclly top 3 in the league amongst starting lineups OFFENSIVELY.  Without Ben Simmons on the floor, the Sixers had one of the worst Offensive ratings   3.  The Sixers have no financial flexibility.  Approx 24 million over cap so no signings of deep meaning will happen, Tobias Harris is an above average player but is a negative trade asset and is under contract for years.  This contract is a huge limiting factor, so one of our 3 max guys would cost us more to move him.   4.  Ben Simmons is the only playmaker / primary ball handler on the roster.  Even if Ben was playing, about 10-15 minutes a game a 30% shooter in Maxey (who is more of a 2 guard then playmaker anyways) or Shake Milton would be the backup and would again cause our offense to tank without Simmons, and in 2021-2022 we now have 48 minutes a game of no PG to look forward to at this point.   5.  Biggest need for the team was a shot creator to play alongside Ben.  If Ben is traded, our biggest need becomes a primary ball handler.  Spacing around Joel is not the biggest need (see the Sixers offensively with an on shooter in Simmons).  Perfect world we trade Tobias for a guy like CJ Mccollum and Ben suits up.  That would provide a bigger then 0% chance to advance and improve upon our squad from last year.  Unfortunately this ship has sailed and has no shot of happening, Ben is never going to see the court for us again.   6.  To address your comment about Embiid...If Ben Simmons is traded for peanuts, then yes Morey will trade Embiid in the next few years, and will trade Danny Green, Seth Curry, and other role players this year most likely.  It is definitely rebuild time.  Luckily for us Ben Simmons is under contract for 4 years, so there is no panic."
"Bruh take that +29 out of here this man averaged less points than 6, yes I said 6 hawks players. Less points than Seth curry who is a journeyman player, 30% from the line and he thinks he doesn't deserve any blame. He lost that series when teams know they can win if the game is close by sending you to the line you're not a positive.   Lmfaooooo like Idk why you're dickriding Simmons so hard he's in the wrong and the fact that you keep saying the sixers thrashed him after is hilarious considering they atleast had enough loyalty to not trade him for James harden who would've improved the sixer immensely"
I still can‚Äôt believe Mavs straight up traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
"&gt; My point was that you're being dense if you really believe there are no non-all star players the 6ers could get that help them. They are literally 1 piece away from being a contender RIGHT NOW.  So again, who are these above average pass-first PGs that are available and would work in a deal for Simmons?  &gt; but you can't really act like Jrue was a proven player before he went to the Bucks.   Just because you didn't know anything about Jrue Holiday doesn't mean nobody knew anything about Jrue Holiday, friend.  &gt; You underrate how good Embiid is. He was 2nd in MVP voting last year and if he played more games he may have actually won it.   He would have, but he didn't. Also, when was the last time a team won the championship whose second best player was of the caliber of Seth Curry?  &gt; He doesn't need another superstar, just like how the Suns and Bucks did not.  Your argument is that Giannis/Middleton/Holiday is a similar caliber lineup as Embiid/Seth Curry/Tobias Harris? Or, to your (unrealistic) example, Embiid/Rubio/Curry? Really? Same with CP3/Booker/Ayton?  I don't really care to debate the definition of the term ""superstar"", but I also never said he needed a superstar. I said mediocre role players wouldn't cut it, which is pretty objectively true. Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are both a tier above ""role player"" even if they're a tier or two below ""superstar"".   &gt; If Morey can't find a trade for a non-all star like Jrue or some other player like him, and the 6ers don't win a chip with him doing whatever the fuck he's trying to do, I think we gotta reconsider if he's that good of a GM...  I _again_ ask where these players are that are of the caliber of Jrue Holiday that are available for Simmons? I think you're really underrate Jrue Holiday. Like a lot."
Ben is a better player than D'Angelo and Seth is icing on the cake. I'd rather have Simmons over D'Angelo and Beverly so Curry is just a bonus
"Bagley and his dad have been such assholes that I would hope this doesn‚Äôt hurt our player relations reputation. We didn‚Äôt trade Bjelica or Seth Curry when it would have made sense, in part to accommodate their wishes (I think). Bagley had three years to earn a spot in the rotation and couldn‚Äôt do it. We already tried trading him last year and it didn‚Äôt work out. He will for sure be gone by the deadline."
I miss Seth Curry
Talk about diminishing value  2019: Traded for Jimmy Butler  2020: Traded for Seth Curry  2021: Traded for Moses Brown
"In terms of ability, yes. However, take ability and price tag into account and I think he's right. The difference between Rubio's salary and DLo's salary is a Jordan Clarkson or a Derrick Rose or a Marcus Smart or a  Pat Bev.  Once you factor in DLo's 29.5m price tag and I'll take Rubio and Clarkson. I'll take Lonzo + Caruso. I'll take LaVine + Seth Curry. I'll take Murray and Rose."
Seth Curry having a real NICE season so far
"Sixers were also missing Curry.  Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid would be a very good starting 5.   Donte, Brook, and Thybulle off the bench is not a bad 8 man rotation."
Curry 48%  Niang 41%  Furk 36%  what's unsustainable there?  Maybe seth drops down to 42?
Best player on the Sixers along with Seth Curry
lol damn you got pissed off REALLY fast  calls this sub weird then throws 2 unnecessary shots at seth curry as a warriors fan
"Ok, his trade deadline deal for hill didn‚Äôt work. He managed to turn the albatross of horfords contract into danny green, and fleeced the mavs in the Seth curry move. Maxey, Joe and BBall Paul were a master class in drafting, and his free agent additions of Drummond on the minimum and Niang have been perfect so far this year. So. Yeah. Miss me on the injured George hill swing he took last year"
"&gt; hit him and how Morris body collapsed on itself?  He shoved him in the back, across the shoulders, and Morris actively exaggerated the contact.  A forearm shove across the shoulders is just about the least dangerous way to hit someone. They can see where they're falling, you're not endangering any joints, and they have all their limbs available for controlling the fall.  If Markieff Morris is that fragile, he shouldn't be playing, and he *definitely* shouldn't be taking cheap shots on a guy roughly his size.  But he's a pathetic little bitch and always has been. This is the dude who was sitting on the bench in a Wizards @ Blazers game and decided that the right thing to do in the moment was to lean forward to where Seth Curry was standing on the court, because *play was live*, and *pull his shorts down*.  I'd be disappointed in a nine-year-old for that shit.  Fuck Markieff Morris and fuck his extremely fake ""injury""."

I'll always hate Markief after [he got away with this short pull on Seth Curry that cost us a last second shot to win the game that year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbBZWg6UjZg)
seth curry really on something this year's start
While I understand the info...here are two cavets:  1- Small sample size   2- Seth Curry is playing at a level he's unlikely to continue to play at (though he'll still be good).
Seth Curry 30/30 from 3 game incoming
Seth Curry holders would be on easy street right now
seth curry
"The Seth Curry disrespect is real. What we actually need is a reliable starting SF who is solid and offense and defense, not SG. Heck I'd take another quality PG over starting SG.   Danny Green has been off, and Thybulle is offensively weak. I like Kork there but having him come off the bench and late game to torch teams is ideal."
Seth curry first option now
Yeah they added Seth Curry though
Seth Curry
Send Seth Curry next pls.
"He was kinda forced to have it in the previous years. Embiid was not even close to the passer he is now and he struggled when double teamed, seth curry didn't have as good of handles, was a terrible passer, we had harris being actually bad until last year when he got better as a end option, and option as in he is likely scoring when he gets the ball or making the obvious easy pass. Furk couldn't drive or pass, just shoot.  Who's gonna take the ball? It has to be simmons and he got everyone great 3s and he got everyone open. He made elite level passes and was good in that department.  His scoring and free throws have been a joke, but last year they were the worst in the past few years, he choked hard as fuck. Not top 20 that's obvious but you're delusional if you don't think he's top 100. He's the best perimeter defender in the league."
seth curry should be making 3 times his salary though
thats just because seth curry is underpaid by 25 million dollars a year
"Everyone's going to mention Caruso as exactly what he's talking about, but don't forget Seth Curry was a G-Leaguer, too. My brother in Santa Cruz to my nephew wanting to go to Golden State games: ""We have Curry at home."""
I think it‚Äôs a stretch but if Boston had someone like Buddy Hield or even a Seth Curry to a lesser degree would make a world of difference.
Seth Curry boutta just fuck around and average 30 on 50/50/90 shooting
"I could see JB and JRich for Ben, Seth Curry, and Maxey/Thybulle + a 1st maybe?"
I like Seth Curry as a complimentary piece to Simmons and Tatum. Idk the numbers but if Boston can swing it while keeping Smart I think they‚Äôre contenders.
"The starters this year outside of Embiid:  Tyrese Maxey, Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Paul Reed  Maxey's minutes doubled and so naturally his 3 PA went up. Seth Curry is shooting the same amount of 3PA pretty much (4.9 vs 5.2). Shake Milton is shooting 0.3 more 3PA and shooting 7% worse."
"well I guess I'd take Simmons, 5 unprotected FRP's, Seth Curry and the rights to half of Joel's points per night for Jaylen, 2 Seconds and Grant Williams.  BUT I wouldn't be happy about it"
Seth Curry most definitely will continue shooting 70% TS for an entire year actually :)
How about Seth Curry?
"It was obvious Embiid was hurt so his ‚Äúall star‚Äù healthy young team mate really should have stepped up and taken some shots. Instead they had to rely on Seth ‚Äústeph‚Äù Curry on that, even with his insane production, Ben couldn‚Äôt get them over the hump."
"Pretty sure that connection is the whole reason he even got a shit with the Warriors g league team in the first place, the same with Seth Curry. Steph got them into the NBA door then they had to grind to actually stay in the league"
Yeah and Seth Curry is married to Austin Rivers' sister/Doc Rivers' daughter.  Curry's are on their way to creating an NBA dynasty.
Seth Curry loll
"I‚Äôm rooting for the Sixers because I love seeing Seth Curry play well / succeed, but I‚Äôm also rooting for them because of the drama. If Philly can legit get 55+ wins and establish themselves as a contender without Simmons, it‚Äôs going to get juicy."
"Thats stripper is now PG‚Äôs wife, why not refer to her as that if your gonna give Seth Curry that respect"
"Seth ""Stephen Curry"" Curry"
Seth Curry best Curry
You spelled Seth Curry wrong.
I miss Seth Curry.
"Hello, Police? Seth Curry is beating me up!"
So far?  If it‚Äôs so far Seth Curry and FurKobe Korkmaz are both on these lists.
Seth Curry   Nah it‚Äôs Miles Bridges right now of course but gotta shout out the local Curry
Seth Curry and PG
"So my thoughts aren't too relevant on if I think he is either ""great"" or ""terrible"" in the long run right, but the league views Ben as a 3x All Star, 2x All NBA Defensive 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team player who also was a ROY and a runner up for the DPOY last year at the age of 25 with 4 years of control left on his contract.  He is an elite defensive player even before all the handchecking and such that is allowed now, and a pass first playmaker of a team that lost to Kawhi in a buzzer beater in game 7, saw his team get swept when he was injured, and held Trae Young to 5-23 shooting in that game 7 where he passed up a layup.   He is a non shooter, and despite that still averaged 15 - 7 - 7 on an FG% of 0.56 last year (down year).  I know it's a meme to think he is ""terrible"" because he doesn't shoot outside of the paint, but he is a winning player that has never missed the playoffs in his career (when healthy) and the 76ers (prior to this year) were below .500 in games he missed that still featured Joel Embiid in the lineup.     Tyrese Maxey and Korkmaz are making great strides this year.  Seth Curry is playing like a #2 offensive option and George Niang / Drummond have been miles ahead of Mike Scott and Dwight respectively so I am extremely happy with how we are playing.  That doesn't take away from what Ben Simmons is as a player."
"Wait, you don't think cj is a better offensive player than Seth Curry? First maxey, then thybulle, now this. Nobody overvalues their  roleplayers quite like sixers fans."
CJ is a poor man's seth curry
"Being the 2nd option to Embiid is not the same as being the 2nd option to Dame though. CJ and Dame fill a similar role and as much as I like Dame, Embiid is just a better player right now.  Another example, this isn't quite the same but Seth Curry is doing way better with the Sixers than he did with the Blazers."
"yeah but like, this way luka could shoot over josh richardson  the same josh richardson who the mavericks traded seth curry to the 76ers for, because josh richardson is a better defender  and then the mavericks sent him to boston this season"
"Seth ""Steph"" Curry"
Seth Curry is freaking amazing
Pretty crazy that Seth curry has never missed a jump shot.
"What‚Äôs scary is the sixers have the number 1 offense right now even with Embiid shooting 41%. Seth Curry is going to fall back to earth at some point, but they look really, really good on offense without Simmons out there.   Dame has been so bad I would not be surprised if he didn‚Äôt make the all star team. I think he‚Äôll figure things out eventually but his averages are gonna be brought down a ton by this abysmal start. McCollum might even make it in over Dame, which would be quite the bizarro world outcome."
It would be a bigger problem in a hard capped league. Ben is not going to provide us any financial flexibility by disappearing from the roster so we need to get something of value back for it to help.  We‚Äôre also in a situation where we don‚Äôt actually have a pressing need for anything(I had actually thought that we‚Äôd probably want a point guard by now but Maxey is far more developed than I had expected) and have a shockingly young roster with only Danny Green and Seth Curry over 30.  This means if anything trading Ben could actually accelerate our window rather than extend it.
And Seth Curry
Seth Curry &gt; Steph Curry
It‚Äôs hard to believe but Seth Curry is already 31yrs old. He isn‚Äôt a young player like the others that have been named so far.
True true. Seth curry if he keeps playing like this has an outside shot.
What's Seth Curry doing these days?
Seth Curry if he can keep this pace up
"He has been so pure I for real recently Googled the following: ""how to stop seth curry"""
Weren't you guys saying the Mavs had the best offense in NBA history just 2 seasons ago? Was Seth Curry that much of a game changer..
Thats pretty much what happened. A lot of people said it was a win win but man i swear they must have not been watching mavs games because seth curry was amazing for our offense
Imagine trading away Seth Curry. Now imagine you got literally nothing in return. Yea wtf Mavs?
"And Seth Curry -  61,6% from the field, 53% from three on 5.5 attempts lmao"
"The margin of error is pretty low when you get a guy who makes you go ‚Äúoh shit we can compete NOW‚Äù   Even KD didn‚Äôt move the needle enough for the Sonics/thunder that they still got Westbrook, harden and Ibaka.  So, I think the Mavs recognized that and swung for the fence with Porzingis, and in an alternate reality he averaged 22/11 and 2 blocks and plays 65 games a year and it‚Äôs a home run.   You look at the fact that even after Luka‚Äôs rookie year (and we tried to tank a bit at the end because our hawks pick was protected) that still only ended up being the 10th pick, Luka made us too good to get any other high lottery talent immediately.   That isn‚Äôt to say there weren‚Äôt shitty moves! THJ is a win, and let‚Äôs assume we still got Porzingis. For the life of me I don‚Äôt have any idea why we traded Barnes away. He wasn‚Äôt a perfect player and struggled with being the 1st option at times, but he chose us and would‚Äôve been PERFECT WITH Luka and has improved each year  I don‚Äôt know if we could‚Äôve gotten Seth if we kept HB but a lineup of Curry/THJ/Luka/HB/Porzingis is very good. The Mavs have been good at finding and developing some talent: pre injury Dwight Powell was decent, the contract is bad. And maxi and DFS are very good, those guys would honestly be perfect with Lebron and AD on the Lakers because they‚Äôre spot up shooters and defenders who don‚Äôt need the ball. Those guys‚Äô shortcomings aren‚Äôt their faults and honestly aren‚Äôt our front office either. Neither was drafted and both are good players. But, if we don‚Äôt have an AD, we now NEED scoring from our other 3 starters and can‚Äôt rely on that from those guys.  If Luka and KP were more like Lebron and AD combining for 50-55 points, we would be fine having two guys not scoring much. But they aren‚Äôt starter quality guys on a team that needs scoring"
"Still, any one out of these three:  1. not trading Harrison Barnes for nothing 2. not trading Seth Curry for nothing 3. not whiffing on the Josh Green pick  would have our team in a much better position now"
They did have Seth Curry and got rid of him
-Traded Seth curry away  -Porzingis max took away cap space to sign people  -no good draft picks since Luka/Brunson
Not every team has the personnel to run solid drop defense... Especially not the Sixers w Seth Curry bro
I LIKE SETH CURRY
"Embiid is amazing at designated hand offs and drawing help when in the post while also spacing the floor, Embiid besides Jokic is the perfect person for a player like JJ and Seth Curry to play with with his mix of skills."
The disrespect to Seth Curry
"I would say Herro, Clarkson, Seth Curry, and Vucevic. And reluctantly, Westbrook."
"Oh wow, Seth Curry. So in total, you missed a role player and an All Star. We were missing two role players, a near All Star, and a top 10 player in the league. And again, you got torched by a G Leaguer that game.   The difference is that Dame is far more reliant on his offensive output than Embiid is. So even if Embiid isn't shooting well, he won't be a net negative unless there's something exceptionally wrong with him.   So do you believe that the Suns, Bucks, Celtics, and Hawks will all miss the playoffs? They hardly look playoff caliber right now either."
"Truth. Who does he think he is, Seth Curry?"
"Schedule is irrelevant when again we aren‚Äôt a full team , and Seth Curry is one of the greatest shooters of all time wtf are you talking about lmao"
Zach Lowe literally wrote today about how the sixers offensive success is largely due to the schedule.  And yes - im being delusional for not taking a team running their offense through Seth curry as a serious title contender.  The reality is you are a delusional homer that has forgotten regular season basketball doesn‚Äôt matter.

"Seth Curry vs Ben Simmons phenomenon.   A lot of bad on ball defenders also make up for it in team defense but it is just harder to quantify. Seth isn't bad though. Damion Lee is also having a similar effect on the Warriors. Being a 2 way player is overrated in the NBA, even younger Kawhi didn't stand out in defense rating at all compared to guys like Draymond or Gobert."
This is the same dude who said the Wizards could have beaten the Sixers if they attacked Seth Curry. Proof you can get upvotes on Reddit as long as your thread is long enough
Dallas trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson might lowkey be one of the worst trades of the decade
Will you talk about Seth Curry though ?
I'm still amazed you guys got Seth Curry for Richardson. I was shocked the Mavs did that at the time the trade happened. It just keeps looking worse.
"CP3 trade was bad? You do know how close that team was taking down the historically great Warriors.   And let‚Äôs see, he discovered Patrick Beverly, Chandler Parson, Clint Capella, Tyrese Maxey. Traded for Seth Curry, got rid of Al Horford contract while picking up Danny Green. Harden trade was definitely not his only good transaction.   Oh, btw. Simmons was the one who requested the trade. Team fined him when he claimed that he had mental issue m, but refused to cooperate and provide any update.  If you tell you boss you need a mental break. Your boss will probably let you take few days off. But after taking a break for couple weeks, don‚Äôt you think your boss has the right to ask you provide any update or a give them a doctor note?"
"I detest Coach K, but you can‚Äôt really blame him for the development of one and dones. It‚Äôs just not nearly enough time - they arrive shortly before season starts and they‚Äôre gone as soon as it‚Äôs over. They don‚Äôt even have full offseasons in the program.   And that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many Duke busts. They‚Äôre all highly touted high school recruits who don‚Äôt stay.   But if you look to the guys who stay at Duke and develop, they‚Äôre doing fine. Allen, Seth Curry, Mason Plumlee, etc. Not superstars but well developed useful NBA players."
Seth Curry
"So out of Maxey, Fox and Seth Curry, who's coming off the bench?"
Seth curry is a pretty good no.2 pg I admit
Seth Curry
"You can thank Silver and Colangelo for that. Hinkie set us up so well, got forced out by Silver for Colangelo who messed up every draft asset Hinkie got us. Then proceeded to create burner Twitter accounts to shit on his own best player (Embiid), and built the team (poorly) around Ben who isn‚Äôt even playing for us now.   Morey has come in and saved us a bit (trading J Rich for Seth Curry, etc.) but that Colangelo era will be hard to overcome."
Sixers got better in year two post Butler after we flipped Horford and J-Rich into Seth Curry and Danny Green.  The heat were completely average last season.
"There wasn't downside other than not being able to sign other players for that money.   Kemba wasn't the answer, so the alternative was maybe to try and build a deeper bench with someone like Seth Curry, Danny Green, or even JJ Reddick (who shot 45% from 3 in 2019).   As for the draft - yeah it's a crapshoot, but his constant drafting of project wings who lacked traditional skillsets was frustrating. Yabusele, Semi Ojeleye, even Grant to some extent, Zizic, Bird...a crapshoot means you hit once in a while beyond the lottery, and since 2016 we legit are 1/12 or 2/12 depending on how you slot Grant.   If you go out and spend on big pieces in FA, you need to have a better hit rate in the draft to fill a deeper bench. But you can't sign the wrong FA, and miss in the draft consistently.   Again, his moves before Kemba were good. But 2019 and 2020 were both major misses, and it wasn't looking like the tune was going to change in 2021, so I welcome the change."
"\^ this guy knows the sixers.  the 'oh shit- 6 seconds left' offensive scheme works when seth curry has a ts% of 70%+ or when furkan unlocks a cheat code, but the rest of the time, it's rough sledding."
Joel Embiid   Tyrese Maxey   Tobias Harris   Ben Simmons   Seth Curry   Danny Green   Mattisse Thybulle   Furkan Korkmaz
Seth Curry scares me.
"I never want to see Niang, Korkmaz, and Seth Curry again"
And if you put Seth curry in 1960-70 he would average 50ppg‚Ä¶ the issue is we are comparing eras and it‚Äôs hard to drop players in different ones. All time greats would be elite always but there‚Äôs more factors to it than that
Then it would be all modern players. Seth curry is a better basketball player than any player before bird/ magic‚Ä¶
"Man I wouldn‚Äôt feel so bad if we had just kept the championship team made minor adjustments around shooting Pelinka really made awful decisions since then , then Bron and AD added disaster by wanting Russ abd Pelinka stupid ass name chaser agreed. I would legit feel good about our chances with the 2020 n1 seed in the west.  Just depending on Bron n AD health . It‚Äôs baffling this is how we‚Äôre spending brons last prime. Sigh, getting slightly better shooting when Seth curry was available was too hard I guess , rather get useless six men and no fit. Ffs . Westbrook is my least favourite player since I‚Äôve got into nba. I can‚Äôt even root for this team , just don‚Äôt care . Our old defensive core I could , now it‚Äôs not even team and Russ just makes me feel depressed . Is this how my nba fandom ends after finding Lebron dunk videos during covid lockdown."
Seth Curry is wildly underpaid
Seth Curry BUT I'M NOT MAD
"seth curry, not biased"
Yeah bro I‚Äôm sick of this dude. Fire him. He still acts like he‚Äôs in Dallas with Luka and Seth curry plus Tim hard away on the wings
"Sixers are in a tricky situation right now...not only do they need to trade Simmons but most teams will likely play hardball and request Maxey,Seth Curry,Niang,Korkmaz or Shake.   They can offer Thybule with Simmons but any smart organization that wants to play hardball will likely require one of those players or Picks because the Sixers have less leverage since everyone knows they need to get rid Simmons.  OKC definitely isn‚Äôt trading assets without a pick. As for the Blazers...surely they could just get both a SG who can defend and one that is good at shooting to help dame.  Maybe Sixers should try trading with the Kings,Pacers,Pistons and Magic. Something tells me the Rockets would play hard ball out of spite though..."
"The depth on this team is absurd already.  ‚ÄúThe Sixers could really use a point guard to split time with Maxey and Shake. Or a shooting guard to split time with Seth Curry and Isaiah Joe. Or a small forward to split time with Matisse, Furkan, and Danny Green. Or a power forward to split time with Tobias and Niang. Or a center to split time with Embiid and Drummond.‚Äù"
"in comparison to other SG's in the NBA, he's probably among the least athletic along with Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry."
"LeBron with Embiid, Tobias Harris and Seth Curry would honestly be very interesting. Thybulle is already your defensive anchor and Furkan can turn into a sniper at any moment."
"Threes are easy for Seth curry as well, but we wouldn't say he does it like his brother does, would we?"
"Seth Curry wouldn't win the MVP, finals MVP, MIPY, and DPOY"
"Did you watch the game the Wizards had next, against the Warriors?  Steph Curry was a man on a mission. Normally when he goes off he's filled with joy, he's dancing, he's smiling. Not that night. Just cold and intent. Dropped 51 points of ""fuck you and fuck your team"" on them.  Seth Curry was avenged. You don't fuck with Steph's little brother, apparently."
I've fought Seth Curry before.  It went *okay*.
"What happens?  It makes every news station, article, website, newspaper, it makes Shaqtin, the NBA.com top 10, Inside the NBA, The Starters even make a comeback special for it, Chuck and Shaq become friends, Metta World Peace changes his name back to Ron Artest, Dwyane Wade returns to basketball citing ""I have now seen it all"", LeBron James retires also citing the same thing. The NBA expands to 32 teams one in Las Vegas, the other. Kevin Durant signs with OKC. David Sterns zombie corpse returns to rule the NBA. Robert Sarver signs DA to a Max extension.

The NBA expands to 32 teams one in Las Vegas, the other. Kevin Durant signs with OKC. David Sterns zombie corpse returns to rule the NBA. Robert Sarver signs DA to a Max extension. The NBA erects netting around the basketball court like indoor beach volleyball and also abolishes the 1 year in college rules and allows players to start at any age they want. David Sterns reanimated rotting corpse proposes we introduce a 2pt free throw line further out allowing players to make a choice between taking 1 and 2 point free throws.

"Yeah, Seth Curry"
"Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey, duh"
if they keep nailing these late round draft picks like maxey and getting coup contracts like seth curry I dont see what the difference is from his point of view
you also have seth curry and usually one of korkmaz or milton will be playing well in any given game.   thybulle will need his minutes too when he gets back though you can run him at SF pretty easily
Andre Drummond should never start again. Charles Bassey stepped up for the Sixers off the bench. Seth Curry regained his rhythm. No one not named Jokic wanted to show up for the Nuggets tonight. Some of the Nuggets turnovers were brutal to watch. Nuggets need Jamal back. There was no Zeke Nnaji and that saddens me.
"Steph ""Not his brother 'Seth'"" Curry is the Bob Gibson of Basketball. They are going to have to do something about the 3 pt line because of this guy."
Jokic defending Seth Curry better then guards says it all.
"Nets trading James Harden for Simmons + Seth Curry and a pick or two would actually be pretty dope ngl, IF they think that Harden is leaving this offseason."
"Patty Mills, Gary Trent and Seth Curry. The Blazers had some serious talent they let slip away."
this is neat bait post where you have a title about seth curry and then five interview questions about ben simmons. interesting tactic
For his career he‚Äôs started about 45% of the games he‚Äôs appeared in. Specifically over the last 3 seasons (not including this year) he started 43% of the games he appeared in. Source: [Stats](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2326307/seth-curry)
He'd at least be a Seth Curry type player
"The Harden Trade alone is bad, but he also moved Horford's contract for Danny Green and got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. Also his analytics driven approach to... everything just makes it seem like he's more interested in squeezing out hidden value than he is trying to mutually benefit both teams."
Seth Curry is 2 inches shorter than them.
"No, but he won another type of shootout that produced Steph Curry and Seth Curry."
"What, like a Danny Green or a Seth Curry or a Thybulle or maybe Niang? We got ‚Äòem all, plenty of role players. Trading him for picks only makes sense if it‚Äôs not a star."
"&gt; Nor do we have minutes for them  That's the underappreciated angle in this.  JuSt TrAdE fOr McCoLlUm  And then do what? Bench Seth Curry who is shooting better than McCollum? Like what are they getting at this stage that really improves their record for this season? Maybe there was space over the summer where they should have just shipped him off for fungible assets like draft picks and worried about a blockbuster down the line, but we're past that point now. There truly is only a handful of players that would actually alter their fortunes this year, and absent one of those, they might as well wait it out at least until the trade deadline to see if someone gets desperate to save their career (NO DAVID GRIFFIN, NO! PUT THE CELL PHONE DOWN) or, to be honest, this offseason around the draft."
"The sixers think very highly of themselves and somehow imagine their championship window as very long. Yes, the have Harris and Embiid locked up, which I've never thought is a good fit for 70 mil a year. Seth Curry has one more year at 8 mil. He is worth more than that clearly. Niang one more year at 3.5 mil. Maxey is locked up for 2 more on a team friendly contract. Danny Green, one more year. Korkmaz, two years on a team friendly deal. Thybulle one more year.   Here is my point. Their championship window is next year. It becomes very very hard to win a championship without a top 5 player if you dont have cheap roll players. At the end of next season they will have Korkmaz and Maxey on a team friendly deal. They will not get anybody to come back for less than they make now, except maybe a 36/37 year old Danny Green. I dont understand this plan at all, ""multi-year thing""??? They have this year and next and then without a major free agent splash/trade etc. their window closes.   Also, James Harden? Are they fucking crazy. Why would he want to play in Philly. That should not be a plan you think about. Same with Dame. And next year, even if Dame becomes available you are now offering players on expiring deals who would have to agree to extensions for any of it to make sense. After next season, unless Simmons becomes a superstar they will have nobody in which to sweeten the deal for a true superstar in that trade."
Literally no one‚Äôs shooting is linear. You‚Äôre describing things that happen to elite shooters like Seth Curry and his brother.   And hot hand effect has absolutely been settled. It‚Äôs always going to be a debate because there are always going to be people who are wrong.
No Embiid. No Thybulle. No Danny Green. No Seth Curry for two of the losses. Tobias missed some and just came back after actually being impacted by COVID. That‚Äôs the reason they‚Äôve lost the last 5. They were 8-2 before COVID impacted them.
No Embiid. No Danny Green. No Thybulle. No Tobias for some of those losses and no Seth Curry for 2 of them. A classic case of just looking at the record and not understand what happened to the team due to COVID.
Seth Curry
"This is a situation Morey inherited.  All the moves made since he took over (trading JRick for Seth Curry, Dumping bum ass Al Horford for basically nothing) have been stellar."
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers‚Äô combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there‚Äôs no need to take on more players of that ilk.   Cue armchair experts moaning about how Sixers should trade him for a bunch of role players."
"That is a perfect trade for Lebron, here is why...  Lebron goes back to the East and gets to play with Embiid. You have Seth Curry, Korkmaz, Tobi to hit shots. Maxey who Lebron can do the whole young guy under his wing thing with. Have enough defenders like Thybulle and Embiid so Bron doesn't have to play defense.  He will probably write a letter to Philly and leave Simmons name off it before the deal goes down.  This whole idea that the Lakers say no... but when Lebron is the GM wouldn't even matter lol /s"
"Our head coach and star player did not shit on him lol. Doc said he didn't know if he was a championship PG and Embiid said the passed up dunk was the turning point in the game.  The main issue is exactly what you said, a guy shooting 33% from the FT line and failing to make a FG in the 4th quarter of games 5, 6, and 7. NBA GM's have thousands of minutes of footage of Ben and can weigh the positives and negatives.  Most people believe in Morey because his 15+ year track record is pretty good and what he did for the sixers day 1 was trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and get off the Al Horford contract. Nobody is sucking his dick we just think this strategy is our best option. Trading him for Buddy Heild closes our championship window anyway, might as well rebuild if that's what we wanted to do"
"Chris Paul, Jaylen Brown, Kawhi, Pat Bev, Lamelo Ball, Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, Markieff &amp; Marcus Morris, Jokic, Steph &amp; Seth Curry   All of these combined should result in chaos = I walk free"
"...With the way coaching is going it's gotta be someone whom stars respect. As insane as this is, my guess for good coaches would be...  Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Udonis Haslem, Spencer Dinwiddie, Fred Van Vleet, Lonzo Ball."
Also good god a Seth Curry and CJ McCollum backcourt especially in crunch time is about the worst defensive duo a playoff team would ever form.
"I think k the problem with AD and the Lakers is really Russ because he fucking manage to have almost 30% of USG% while been a role player by pure skillset... and when your pointguard plays like shit you can be Jokic, Embiid or Kareem you as a bigman could do just so much for your team. And he is playing still good to maintain them above 0.500.  Give to AD players like Seth Curry or Maxey instead of Westbrook and he will lead the team like Embiid did. And of course Vogel is a good coach, but rather known to be good on defense rather than offense, so coaching also is very important for a bigman."
Morey fleeced the mavs for Seth curry less than 2 years ago lol
"In honor of the Staples center name change, here‚Äôs the All Ugly-Ass NFT Ape Twitter Avatar Team, or the Right-Click Save-As Superstars.   PG: Steph Curry SG: Seth Curry SF: Tyrese Halliburton  PF: Josh Hart C: Rudy Gobert  GM‚Äôed by Daryl Morey.   All these players have NFT avatars on Twitter.  Obviously this team is incredibly small, but that‚Äôs only fitting for such a forward-looking group. I could‚Äôve used Tobias Harris at the 4 but I wanted to take them from all different teams for varieties sake."
"But why would they?   Before Embiid went out with COVID, they were doing just fine without him.  They don't need role players, they already have a fuckton of good ones, they need a real 2nd star, not Seth Curry or Tobias Harris doing their best impression of one."
"Most overrated GM in league has in one calendar year done the following, but please, go on, tell me more   \-Flipped Al Horford for Danny Green  \-Acquired seth curry for some guy named josh richardson  \-Signed Niang/Korkmaz to below market deals, currently both wayyyy outperforming their contracts  \-Drafted Tyrese Maxey"
people are shitting on OP thinking it's some kind of attack on Seth Curry when he just provided some fun data lol
Would still love to have Seth Curry.
Seth Curry DLo Barnes KD McGee  Not terrible
"Trade Steph Curry, Klay, and 3 1st rounds for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry. Rebuild starts here. Sell our stadium too and let's move to Vegas."
Seth and Steph Curry
"Seth Curry, please come back"
A few NBA bets I was looking at for tonight  Seth Curry over 15 points  KD over 43 P/R/A  Clippers -7.5  76res +10  How we feel about these?
He has Maxey and Seth Curry. Which is a way more reliable option than Westbrick at this point.
"You highlight a point then ignore it. Miami didn‚Äôt let him . Pelinka is an incompetent fool his decisions without Lebron have been awful the last couple years . Seriously I wanted Seth curry last year who would‚Äôve been perfect and blew up on the 6ers instead this bozo gets attracted by fancy names . ‚Äò oh two 6moty candidates‚Äô, nvm the damn fit or playoffs he‚Äôs so hopeless I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôd do a better job since I predict everything he chose going to shit when it mattered in playoffs abd it did . So I don‚Äôt really think you can place this entirely on LEGM. He has influence but clearly it lies with the gm etc at the end ."
You can add Seth Curry and Chris Boucher to the Warriors
Mavs fans were really upset at losing Seth Curry.
Cavs Rubio or mobley 76ers Seth curry
"The issue int he 4th was that neither Ben nor Tobias wanted to initiate our offense so we just threw it to Emiid at the elbow over and over. That's poor coaching and mostly a Ben issue. Embiid's TO's, if you go back and watch them, are all self inflicted by the sixers stagnant offense with no movement outside Seth Curry.  Easy to blame Embiid but go back and watch those games. He's like 4th in terms of responsibility for that IMO"
"Cole Anthony, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry, Larry Nance Jr, Claxton, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland are all 2nd generation."
Seth Curry has gotten nice and Andrew Wiggins too
The Mavs traded away Seth Curry. All our fans are still angry about that lol.
Budget Seth Curry
Steph Curry is just a budget Seth Curry
Mods - please shut down this Seth Curry - Mavs sub-thread.
Agree. This would be much better reserved for Seth Curry post than a Jokic post.
CJ and Nurk for Seth Curry Ben Simmons and Thybulle
"Technically the most efficient shot In basketball is a Seth Curry 3, he has the highest career 3PT% among active players. I think he‚Äôs second all time to Kerr"
Seth Curry. He should be PAID
I have Seth curry in my top 10
Think he‚Äôs still looking for his diaper after what seth curry did to him the other night
"Or maybe it‚Äôs the fuvking GM fault . And the cheap ass owners who didn‚Äôt want to pay lux tax for Caruso ? I don‚Äôt doubt legm and AD had influence on the roster but Pelinka decisions have been fuckibg putrid and people here acting like the guy getting paid to do the damn job has less say then stars who give him suggestions is just delusional skip bayless level takes . Yes I partly blame those two for westbrick but what about last year ffs? Seth curry a great fitting piece was available instead Pelinka got the shiny 6moty award guys for some reason not actually thinking for a second how they‚Äôd fucking fit. He‚Äôs fuckibg ass and people just sound delusional putting it on players over the same GM who had failed in four years to build a good shooting team around Lebron ffs, how competent do you think he is ? He‚Äôll get another volume bench scoring guard and think he did something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Normally I think experts are experts but Pelinka moves been so awful I wish I could at least play Lakers gm last few years lol."
The bad deal was from the Mavs perspective.   &gt;How was trading for Seth Curry a bad deal? They sent  Josh Richardson back
How was trading for Seth Curry a bad deal? They sent  Josh Richardson back
"Y‚Äôall are more like great than good.   Embiid is handily top 10, Tobias is not overpaid by too much; but it‚Äôs really all the guys like Maxey, Korkz, Seth worst trade deal in history Curry, and Half-Career Crisis Andre that are just rising to the challenge insanely well.   Also: scapegoating legitimately works at bringing people together. Seems like Embiid and Tobi are being very kind and good-faith with Ben, but I‚Äôm still throwing that out there."
"two of these guys are memes: duncan robinson, joe ingles  one of these guys plays on the best team in the league: seth curry  one of these guys plays for a team of mercenaries: joe harris  And then there's Buddy Hield, who is the best player on this list."
"I think it was his sophomore year that Davidson went to the Elite 8 but yeah. Been a huge Curry fan since that 08 run. I had never seen someone play like that before, ever.   Poor Seth Greenberg."
"Wow, I have to applaud your effort here!  However, in my mind, you have more or less proven my point. Because even though those moves all are beautiful, they're not a similar series of fake-outs or bamboozles like the one Seth did: Crossover, shotfake, shotfake, backdoor, 4 moves with his defender completely losing where he is.  One of them gets close, the second link, Curry against Kawhi. Loved watching that one, thank you!"
"Bruh, Seth Curry is better than Russ."
I cringed when people thought Tyrel Terry was out Seth Curry replacement. Lmao. 2019 biggest bust and worst trade I have seen Mavs done.
Steph Curry Seth Curry and Def Curry
AND they‚Äôre playing Seth Curry for significant minutes.
"Embiid   Simmons  Seth Curry  SM  Maxey  Thybulle  Danny Green  No sense protecting Tobias Harris, no one's touching that contract with a 10-foot pole."
Damion Lee is married to Sydel Curry (the sister of Steph and Seth)
"&gt; He's out Chris Bosh/Kevin Love.  I think he's more of a Paul Pierce guy for us (not as good but similar role). Honestly at least so far, our starters kind of line up a bit with the Doc Rivers Celtics  Simmons - Rondo (good passers and defenders with poor shooting)  Ray Allen - Seth Curry (elite shooting)  Tobias - Paul Pierce (well-rounded forward who can create his own shot when the offense isn't clicking as a team)  Embiid - KG (Paint monster on both ends)  Danny Green - James Posey (total 3&amp;D with probably better defense than shooting)  ______________  Now I'm not saying these players are on the same levels or are identical, but it is funny how there are some striking similarities just in terms of player archetype lol"
"Celtics if you‚Äôre talking about talent, Sixers if you‚Äôre talking about assets used to build the roster out. The Celtics were more talented but the Sixers sent out a bunch of assets for Jimmy and Harris and used cap space to eventually turn all of that into Seth Curry, Danny Green, and losing a first."
"This season so far means absolutely nothing to me, but the only team that has consistently looked great at communicating, passing, flow on offense, etc. is the Sixers. We are undefeated with Embiid, Ben's defense somehow looks better than last year (although his offense hasn't changed a bit), Seth Curry is better than people give him credit for, we actually have a viable bench, Dwight is the best backup Embiid has ever had, Green looks better every game on both ends, Tobi is playing like he is finally worth more than half his contract, and team chemistry is at an all time high. That doesn't mean we're the best (frankly I still don't think anyone beats the Lakers) but we are definitely better than I anticipated.  I don't know if we can beat Milwaukee or Boston in the post-season (Indiana is also getting slept on big time with four incredible defenders in their starting lineup w/o TJ Warren) but I do think we could beat the Lakers in the Finals. But like I said, this season shouldn't mean anything to anyone till at least February."
Depends: are Damion Lee (married to Sydel Curry) and Austin Rivers (sister Callie is married to Seth Curry) honorary Currys?
You blame everything on Brett but last year he didn‚Äôt have Seth Curry or Danny Green
"Forward Tobias Harris yelled out, ‚ÄúThere you go! There you go.‚Äù Sharpshooter Seth Curry gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Ben Simmons yelled out, ‚ÄúWe got an [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Embiid hit the locker room door, former NBA great Allen Iverson hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
(pre-injury) Jonathan Isaac   Tyrese Haliburton   Lamelo Ball   Ja Morant   Dame   Draymond   Coby White   Aleksej Poku≈°evski    Zion   Anthony Edwards   Jarrett Allen   Seth Curry
The Mavericks gave us Seth Curry lolol
Seth Curry is my father
Seth curry is ridiculous
Seth curry has gotta be one of the best assets in the league
I love Seth Curry. Thank you Morey!
Seth curry is cash money
"I mean i think that could be said about any Curry wether that's Del, Steph or Seth. All great shooters in their own right as well as Harden and Klay I guess. But out of those mentioned I'd say it's a toss up between Steph and Seth. Although who knows in the future with guys like Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro"
It's too bad Seth changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to go to Davidson and instead went to Liberty.  We could have had the Curry brothers raining holy hell in 2009.  Seth led all freshmen in scoring at Liberty before transferring to Duke.    WTF was Virginia Tech thinking not recruiting the sons of one of their best players of all time?
"I just don‚Äôt feel you can a title nowadays without an elite perimeter shot creator. Tobias Harris is not consistent enough, Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt one and Seth Curry isn‚Äôt one. If they had been able to keep Jimmy over Tobias I would‚Äôve thought so but they couldn‚Äôt."
"Yes, Sixers could win a championship this year. I wouldn't bet on it, but it's within the realm of possibility. They shored up the biggest weakness without adding any new problems. Embiid and Harris are playing better this season so far and Seth Curry has been a huge acquisition for them. Also I think Embiid being on a team with an all-time great center is helping as well."
Simmons is about to unlock Seth curry the same way draymond unlocked Steph
"Goddamn, Sixers get swept in the first round but add Seth Curry and Danny Green and all of a sudden they could beat the Bucks because **the Bucks** are the ones who underperform."
"&gt;once you get out of NY and LA it drops off hard  North Carolina can put together a nice team.  Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Seth Curry, Zion Williamson, Hassan Whiteside.  Montrezl Harrell off the bench.  Ohio's not bad: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, CJ McCollum, Larry Nance, but they don't really have a center -- Omari Spellman, I guess.  Terry Rozier or Caris LeVert off the bench.  Georgia can send: Malcolm Brogdon, Caldwell-Pope, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Dwight Howard with Malik Beasley off the bench.  Those are pretty respectable teams."
"It was around the time they traded Monta away and decided to make Curry the central player of the team.  They signed him to a non-guaranteed contract and cut him before pre-season was over, then signed him to the G League.  And they didn't keep him all that long.  It was like they gave him a look as a favor to Steph, but never really took anything Seth did seriously."
That‚Äôs cool and all but Seth still the better Curry. üò§
Seth doesn't need to be on the pg he should just be on the weakest offensive player like steph is on the warriors. Against the rockets curry guarded Tucker a pf/C
"Career? Pretty much impossible, Seth is already 30. It's possible he has a better single season that Curry but that's with him being a bit younger, and Steph maybe a little past his prime. Seth's best season may best Steph's worst, but will never match Steph's best."
"That's not a problem when Simmons is an elite passer and you have Seth Curry and 2 more shooters next to those 2 non-shooters. Also, embiid is definitely good in the clutch. Simmons is the weak link scoring wise, but his playmaking and defense make up for it."
"This is a pg driven league, you want Simmons's length and agility on the pg not Seth Curry."
what would it take for seth curry to end up having a better career than steph?
i'm pretty sure seth curry and klay thompson's little brother were on the same G-league team together. warriors are definitely all about that nepotism
That‚Äôs what everyone said about Seth curry. Why don‚Äôt you wait and stop attacking him.
Sure but I feel like they should've gotten more. Seth Curry on a cheap 3 year contract is definitely more valuable than Josh Richardson on a slightly cheap 1 year contract.
Swap Lamelo with Maxey and Wood with Seth Curry and I agree.
What tiny sample size are we talking about here? Has Seth Curry been shooting around ~45% from 3 for the last four seasons or no? You can find me in threads when this trade was made months ago preaching how this was a W for the Sixers and an L for the Mavs.
Lol Seth Curry wasnt why our offense was elite last season
Seth Curry &gt;&gt;&gt; JRich
Another fun fact. Seth Curry is leading his team to a winning record.
Seth Curry*
Seth Curry and Shake Milton would like a word
Ben Simmons + Seth Curry is a good combo
"Yeah I think that's the big outlier compared to any other team he could reasonably end up in. Philly could feasibly still make a strong showing after a Simmons/Thybulle trade with their remaining pieces... *if* the Rockets decide to deal with Morey after all, which Tilman may still reject for spite reasons. Tobi starting the season strong and Seth 'The Better Brother' Curry doing work for them has definitely made them look like potential early favorites for getting out of the East.   Nobody else can both feasibly make a trade for Harden and still end up making it an upgrade for him to go there. Nets will either not happen or end up being somewhat self-defeating because they'd have to give us Kyrie or KD at this point. Heat would be strong with Bam/Jimmy^2 core, but Rockets have no reason to take any Heat package that doesn't involve Bam. Boston won't do a Brown/Smart/picks package because as scary as Tatum and the Stepback Boys would be, they would have shit for depth compared to any other contender and that's even assuming there's no further concerns about Kemba's knee issues.   Who else... Toronto I guess? Probably not happening to begin with, but especially right now a Siakam package looks the least valuable it pretty much ever has. Denver would be a dark horse imo but they won't give up Murray/MPJ and we don't want or need anything else. Personally I would watch every Nuggets game if they went for it though, can you imagine the Harden Jokic 2 man game? That level of offensive flexibility would be unholy to see.  I'm expecting either Harden and Tucker to Philly at or just before the trade deadline for Simmons/Thybulle/Maxey +1FRP, or Harden stays and the Rockets make a run for it this year"
SC = Seth Curry
Seth Curry deserves to be on a real contender
"Really impressed with this team the last 2 games, a lot of people are going to owe Tobias an apology if he keeps playing like this.   Also Seth Curry is the perfect player for this team, he's so good. A lot of people are comparing him to having JJ Reddick back but while both are elite 3pt shooters their playstyle is quite different, he's not creating his own 3pt shot off Embiid dribble handoffs like JJ used to, but instead he's a much better ball handler and much more confident taking it inside. His passing and defence have been solid too, could not be happier about trading for him.  For the Hornets, I was impressed with LaMelo, I had kind of written him off as a meme player who wouldn't amount to much but he looked really good. Give him a couple of years to develop and he could be a problem. Also I don't know what Rozier is doing in his other games because I never hear him talked about but he always roasts the sixers lol."
"Absolutely loved 90% of what Tobi did here. My one question is I wonder if it's by design when he gets the ball and immediately swings it to Thybulle, or if that's his decision. There were at least 3 possessions when Tobi got the ball and passed to an equally well guarded Thybulle, which I can only make sense of if the idea is to move the ball around and look for an entry pass into the post, but each time Thybulle just ended up passing it back to either Tobi or Ben at the top of the arc. If he's both not open to immediately shoot or drive himself + there isn't anyone else open who he has a better passing angle to, I just don't understand the decision. Obviously if the defense is equal, Tobi is much better at both creating his own shot and distributing.          I said ""I love Seth Curry"" several times throughout the game. He's been on the wishlist for years now, and somehow despite all that hype I already built up for him, he's still exceeding expectations.           Jo gets hacked for multiple possessions in a row with no call. Unfortunately, when this happens you can see him get frustrated. This is what led to his tech for an elbow. I understand the frustration but responding like that can dig holes quickly in games we aren't steady up by double digits.           Overall -- it's early, it's the Hornets, etc., but god damn it's already clearly a different team. Watching us shoot threes with no hesitation is so refreshing. It's like we're finally playing modern basketball."
"I agree with you. It feels like every thread is a trade referendum, like with these two or Seth Curry and JRich. Like, shit, let me just enjoy the good basketball boys."
people undervalue seth curry as a role player. Blazers went to the WCF with him and have not looked nearly as good last years or to start this year dispite people hyping them up. And Dallas is struggling early. You just can't replace the spacing of a guy who has shot 45% from 3 the last 2 years and is off to an early 51% this year. he is a proven elite shooter that defenses have to cover making things way easier for the stars on his team
The trade was made to clear cap space for Giannis. JRich is on his last year with a player option he will opt out of. THJ is expiring. If we clear those two it's 33M of cap space. Move Dwight Powell it's around 45M. With Seth Curry it's around 37M.
I love Seth Curry so much.
"Philly's best chance to win the East was in 2019, that team was LOADED. I just need to see this 76ers team win games against elite teams before I become a believer. You all got swept out of the first round just a few months ago. You all basically just traded J-Richardson, Hortford for Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Dwight Howard. I don't know if the difference is big enough but we shall see"
They have looked amazing! Seth Curry is exactly who they needed and Embiid is now a 3 level threat.   I think they are a finals contender
They don't have Seth Curry for spacing.
"Yo, Seth curry is not just a spot up shooter. The guy is a fucking bucket"
Seth Curry and Tobias. How you gonna do embiid like that?
"Tbf Seth Curry is always hurt though, it's why he's bounced around so much."
Seth Curry is so good. I wish the Lakers got him in FA instead of Green back then
Seth Curry has been better than advertised goodness me
"I have been clowning on Tobias Harris since his early-season slump last year. Holy shit, outside of game 1, he‚Äôs looked really good to start this season.  I think he and Doc link up well. Also helps that we finally have two legit threats from deep in Seth Curry and the continually impressing Shake Milton.  I‚Äôm a little worried bc I feel hope right now, hahah"
Seth Curry has been far more than I could have hoped for.
seth curry = best curry
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Seth Curry. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting 3's on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Daddy Seth. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"Seth Curry is very good. Obviously one of the best shooters ever, but he also has more on ball juice than given credit for.   Also, people overthink Ben Simmons. Watching him play, it's so clear how good he is."
Seth Curry. What a perfect fit.

Seth Curry is so good. So fucking good. He has done it all today
"Simmons, Green, Embiid and Harris can really help hide Seth Curry on defence as well. Making him a much better fit as well.   He just looks so much more comfortable as SF/PF than an SG."
I fucking love Seth Curry!
Seth Curry &gt; Josh Richardson.
Seth Curry is already a better playmaker for the Sixers than Horford ever was. You love to see it
I dont know what the Mavericks were thinking trading Seth Curry.
Is Seth Curry actually the greatest basketball player of all time?
seth curry= best curry
Seth Curry is the greatest player in the history of Charlotte basketball
Did anyone know Seth Curry was this good. Man can do it all
Facts. I‚Äôm glad J Rich is helping the Mavs with his perimeter defense but we desperately needed shooting and we got it. Seth Curry for 8 mill a year/3 years is a steal
Some players just love playing for certain coaches and damn does Harris play well under Doc. Will be interesting to see if he can keep it going.   Improved Harris and Seth Curry make 76ers so much better than last year.
Seth Curry 8 Milly
Seth Curry
&gt;Curry.  hide Seth
"He needs to watch some tape from his brother, Seth (Better Curry) Curry."
Could Seth curry be a temporary Steph curry replacement?
"The warriors never had Seth Curry, get your fax right"
"I don't think hero-ball is the right word. Those shots could have easily fallen in for him, they just didn't tonight. I don't watch too many Celtics games cause as a Sixers fan I am contractually obligated to vomit after a certain amount of time,  but it does seem like Boston needs more pure jump shooters (like Seth Curry, Bertans, Duncan Robinson types) rather than shot creators. Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Kemba together feels a little redundant but what do I know."
"Watching the game its hard to blame Doncic for Mavs offensive issues.  Josh Richardson is huge downgrade from Seth Curry. He was providing spacing with his 3pt threat but he was also great offball player that run around the picks and create better offensive possessions.  I never liked D.Powell and with the injury, he looks worse.  Finally, J.Richardson's defense is overrated as hell. Even 2nd year player Herro gets easy foul calls on him effortlessly."
They traded Seth Curry to the Sixers and KP is out.
"I think they stand no chance to Boston, Bucks and Nets in the playoffs. Seth Curry wont change things that much and Tobi is not always as good as the last game."
"Luka will be fine once he gets into game shape. Although, I don‚Äôt think getting rid of Seth curry was the right move. And losing porzingis is a huge blow obviously. He‚Äôs too injury prone and I would trade him as soon as he slings together a few good games."
85 million. rather have seth curry whos a better shooter.
Seth Curry has been a blessing man
Lol Seth Curry wasnt that vital to our team. We would still be 1-3 with him
"pretty high for Seth Curry, don't you think.."
"I think he‚Äôs definitely the best player on that Celtics team  Edit: I think tatum is very good, but gets a bit overrated at times because he‚Äôs an iso step back player that reminds people of Kobe. Top 20 player, not top 12 or 10 which people sometimes say he is. Very likable guy but I am too a sixers fan so take that as you will ahahah go Seth curry"
"you mentioned Seth Curry has a brother, is this true?"
‚ÄúSeth Curry has really started to develop these past few years into a solid spot up shooter.‚Äù He has the 2nd highest 3 point percentage of all time. ‚ÄúSolid‚Äù is the understatement of the eon.
Because the NBA isn't taking the contact tracing remotely seriously.   It's make believe science. We know the average incubation period is 3-5 days. We know many won't test positive until they start showing some level of symptoms.   Seth Curry was actively positive with our team ALL day. He literally sat next to Embiid. In what universe should Embiid not be quarantining?   We really going off 2 day incubation test results to say who's good to play and who isn't? Because that's dumb as hell.
Lamelo is what the Lakers hoped Lonzo would be lmao. Lonzo is the Seth Curry to Steph Curry.
"Of the Sixers roster, only 9 were cleared to play and theoretically healthy: the 7 who played, Ben and Joel. The rest are either actually injured (Mike Scott) or forced to quarantine because contact tracing to Seth Curry due to COVID. Because the NBA requires you have 8 active and Ben and Joel were both ""hurt"" (read: kinda sore and really not feeling like having to play 40 minutes for a game the NBA fucked the team over for), they deactivated both Ben and Joel and reactivated Mike Scott, fully intending him to not play a minute.  I do think Ben and Joel could have played and there was a good chance we win the game if they do... but I think Doc was sending a Fuck You to the NBA for making us play this game when basically ALL our players should be quarantined because ALL of them have been in contact with Seth. He didn't want to risk the stars we did have getting hurt in a game we were fucked in from the get go."
CJ McCollum for two time most improved player. But Seth Curry should be in the convo for MIP.
"Seth Curry is married to Callie Rivers, Austin's sister"
curry family now has four. Seth Steph Damion Lee and Austin Rivers
Why isn‚Äôt anyone talking about Seth curry üçõ testing positive mid game?
"Kevin Durant: shut down for 7 days after being in close contact with an unknown positive person, despite testing negative himself  Joel Embiid (and Ben Simmons): literally on video rubbing his hands on his face after a high five with Seth Curry who is positive, also tests negative, but available to play?"
"Which makes absolutely no sense because teammates will talk in close proximity all the time.  * If Tatum and Beal having a chat at the game is enough to write Beal off then the entire Celtics roster should be written off because they've been in close proximity a lot more frequently.   * Same goes with Seth Curry and the 76ers.   If one conversation is enough to pull a player from games, then what about all the huddles and team strategising?  The league's logic is entirely inconsistent."
Same as the Sixers-Wizards a few days ago happening a day before Seth Curry was positive. Then the NBA clears Embiid who sat next to him and Ben Simmons who fistbumped him
"swapping Seth Curry for Josh Richardson made us a better team, Josh Richardson is the better player overall though. Don't say he's better just because the team is playing better"
It‚Äôs really confusing how this works. The Wizards played against the Celtics last night and I haven‚Äôt heard a single thing regarding any Wizards players. The Seth Curry thing before that was also a head-scratcher... The NBA is being reeeeal cagey about this lol
"Yeah but it‚Äôs totally different having 3 players with COVID and one player with COVID  Mclemore, Jones and KJ all had COVID. Seth Curry is the only one who had COVID on the Sixers  Y‚Äôall still had 9 guys, we did not and that‚Äôs why the league had to postpone.  When we had 9 players, the league made us play even though the rest of our team was quarantined"
"Yeah I have two players on IR because of Covid, Tatum and Seth Curry"
"Literally, two bullet points down:  ""You had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them):""  Embiid touched Seth Curry and then touched his face right after. Embiid should be quarantined as well as the rest of the team."
"Seth is out b/c covid. I believe the other 2 are out for general rest reasons. Joel was recently in the close contact group but was cleared from it so hes at least able to dress. Whether Embiid should be cleared or not is another question, he was sitting next to Seth on the bench during the 1st quarter before people knew Curry had covid"
"Kevin Durant is still isolating and not allowed to play despite testing negative.   Embiid and Simmons were cleared only so they wouldn't have to postpone the game. they are literally on video fist bumping and high fiving Seth Curry, Embiid rubbed his face twice immediately after."
Lol. The meltdown is about the nba forcing us to start players today despite insane Covid implications.  The game should be postponed for the safety of both teams.  Not Seth Curry being out.
"Meanwhile the Sixers:      ""We dont have Seth Curry, might as well call it quits"""
"So your telling me Embiid, who sat on the bench next to Seth curry, should be cool to play this game?"
"I'm not sure of the effectiveness of the contact tracing when Seth Curry played on Wednesday, travelled with the team to Brookyln and sat on the bench on Thursday, and tested positive that evening.  You can't honestly say the NBA is prioritising safety to the degree they were last season. Revenue has taken precedent."
"Embiid was literally sitting next to Seth Curry the first quarter of the game 2 days ago when he had a positive test. The league called it close contact themselves when they ruled the guys questionable due to safety protocol. And if Seth was contagious against the Wizards which I think is likely having gone through myself and my close friend group receiving COVID, literally everyone who was on the court at the same time as Seth Curry was in close contact. COVID is a disease that mostly spreads through aerosols and I guarantee Seth was spreading lots in a competitive basketball game."
And the league cleared 3 players who had been in close contact with Seth due to what guidelines???? Pretty sure Harden was deemed ineligible for at least 4 days following going to a strip club. These guys had been in close contact with Curry 2 days ago and they‚Äôre cleared? It takes more than 2 days after exposure for a test to come back positive. In reality there isn‚Äôt a single guy that played against the Wizards and Nets that shouldn‚Äôt be in quarantine.
Seems like they're doing this because the NBA doesn't want them to list players out for potential future positive results - i.e. there being an incubation period and there being that chance they get a positive result (due to Seth Curry) in another day or two. It's the safe thing to do imo. The NBA is idiotic if they don't have a plan for this scenario.
Lmfao. Sixers are saying fuck you to the league.   Absolute joke. Seth Curry was fucking positive on the bench on national television. He traveled with the entire team that day while positive with Covid. We already have a staff member test positive. Joel Embiid physically touched Seth on the bench and then wiped his face twice.   I get fans don't want unfair circumstances regarding postponements. But the precedent was set with Houston and this is a worse situation.   Absolute clown show.
the wizards played the Sixers right before they played the celtics. Sixers have seth curry and are going through covid protocols. Tatum now might have covid. Might all be a massive coincidence
Derozan might be a case of too many cooks. I‚Äôd take someone like JJ Redick or Seth Curry who could be a 3pt spark off the bench
any word on how seth curry is doing? hope he beats this thing quick he has been so fun to watch
"Considering Embiid was sitting right next to Seth Curry during the first quarter on national television, I think that's a definite absolutely.  I'm excited to see Doc and Elton lace em up again. Maybe Cassell, too."
"Seth Curry did not play against the Nets because of ankle soreness. A fun question for the NBA would be: with a COVID test pending, would he have been allowed to start the game if he were healthy while he awaited the results of the test? And if the answer is no then why was he allowed to sit on the bench?   The obvious conclusion, of course, is that he would have been allowed to start in that game and the Nets (and the NBA) are kind of lucky that he was out anyway."
I was talking about Seth Curry.
"Pretty much him, Wood or Seth Curry at this point."
Kleber Finney-Smith and Seth Curry were all great cheap contract signings
Seth Curry
Seth no longer best Curry but still happy we got him!
"I saw a crazy stat from Kevin O'Connor the other day, something like 80+ players have more touches in the half court than Steph Curry over the first couple weeks, including Seth Curry lol"
Seth Curry
"Nah just playing us, we made Seth Curry and Terrance Ross look All-NBA."
"Ok, but the Wizards were bumpin and grindin on Seth Curry two days ago when they played. Do they only count penetration or what?"
"AD is averaging 22-9-4 and lebron is averaging 24-9-8. Harris is averaging 19-9-3. AD had a really rough start to the year and he‚Äôs not a top 5 player. Steph KD Bron Giannis Kawhi Harden Luka Jokic all have arguments over AD. It ain‚Äôt like embiid has been doing it by himself. Harris has been balling, Simmons is Simmons. Seth Curry is averaging 17 a game lol. That doesn‚Äôt disqualify him?"
"It's definitely interesting whether Seth Curry will have infected anyone. He was covid-positive, and on a team bench for the first quarter."
Seth Curry is playing like it right now. If he can keep this up then it will be him.
Seth Curry
"The issue is the league protocol says if anyone is suspected of being in contact with someone who tests positive, they are required to remain quarantined for a week even if every test during that week is negative. Seth Curry interacted with his entire team and members of the Nets before being told he tested positive.   Plus, they played the Wizards the night before and someone can be infected/contagious days before a test would start showing positive. As far as I'm aware that means everyone in that game is considered at risk through contact tracing."
"So here's my understanding of things. You're not contagious until you test positive and are symptomatic, which takes 3-5 days. So even if Seth Curry coughed on Embiids Shirley Temple right before gametime, Embiid wouldn't be contagious during the game. So if the sixers all test negative today, then the nets should in theory be in the clear. I'd imagine the sixers players wil start testing positive around Sunday and keeping them isolated will end that chain of the virus. Nets and Wiz should be fine.  EDIT: Not a doctor but live with someone undergoing chemo and have talked extensively to doctors about how to organize caretaking. We have 3 people who take turns with caretaking and we've been getting tested weekly."

Why is Shams saying 'the player' when we all know it's Seth Curry
"Seth Curry on the sixers tested positive for Covid. Seth had contact with his team, prior to the positive test. I wouldn‚Äôt play either."
And they play Washington who just played Seth Curry and Philly who are in active quarantine.  Just feels like this is going to be the Gobert touching all the mics moment from last year
Trez is going to sit in the playoffs. His defense is flat out terrible. Not to mention he's going to take shots away from AD. Gasol fat ass will be unplayable as well so he is no different from Dwight just a worse version.  You should have went after Seth Curry.
"No one else is saying it, but Seth Curry better not have acted like an idiot to contract the virus..."
"If Seth tested positive, it is really possible that he has COVID for a few days, and just now started mild symptoms or is carrying the virus without any symptoms. Anyway, by the time you are known as a positive case, you should quarantine yourself for 14 days from the first day of symptoms OR positive test, if no symptoms are detected, to assure you are not transmitting it further. Curry may have infected the whole Sixers roster and personel, and the game starting with a pending test is just stupid as fuck, since it may contaminate everybody involved.  Really irresponsible from the NBA."
So how does curry get to the game with the virus? I will go out on a limb everyday of the week and say seth would be one of the most professional and responsible guys in the league.  This is gonna be a fucking weird and likely broken nba season with early precedents like this.
"ya ppl brought up seth curry in this thread, i've been following his whole career bc of obvious reasons lol and it really is true  he was 2* who went to liberty, managed to transfer to duke, he was on and off our g league team for mad long (waived, signed, waived, signed), some summer league, some 10 days, finally signed w the kings to a tiny deal (2y 2m), barely played for a while, finally got to play, played well!... then had his minutes cut cause george karl is a dickhead (who said he'd flame out of the league lol), went to dallas where he finally got consistent minutes, then had a major injury, and u prolly know the rest  if u look at his first 2 nba years its 1 game w memphis 1 game w cleveland 2 games w phoenix, each time being assigned or waived right after  also if we're talking about the random nepotism stuff, damion lee also kinda looks like a decent rotational nba guy who seemed to only be signed to our g league team cause he's steph's brother in law lol  u really never know there's a lot of randomness to it"
I think they just implemented player tracking (like chips in their pants or something) so they can know who had contact with Seth curry. He was on the bench when he found out though in the 1st quarter
He probably sensed Seth Curry lol
Seth Curry.  Knew he was too sick the last game
Bro they literally probably all have COVID lmao and this is the second game of a back to back. Seth Curry just tested positive and the whole team still played.
N we love Seth curry
Damn it‚Äôs Seth curry
It's been above 50% all season long.  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/2326307/seth-curry
"I'm sure they wondered why Seth Curry left the bench after the 1st quarter. I'm guessing if they didn't knew, it was at least in the back of their minds."
Seth Curry tested positive.  Season over Adam silver deflating all the basketballs as we speak.
"Yeah we had no chance we Seth ""best Curry in the league"" Curry. I hope we can see a good match up between these tes with both at full strenght."
RIP Seth Curry
Seth Curry
drafted both durant and seth curry
Seth Curry confirmed is the Sixers'best player
Apparently Seth Curry is a lot more important to this team than we thought
They were missing defensive anchor Seth Curry
So are the Sixers trassh without superstar Seth Curry?  Only kidding but that was really pathetic even if it was a b2b.
"Guys hes clearly talking about Seth""Who is steph"" Curry."
U guys look like the sixers from last season without seth curry to space the floor.
"Yeah sure the Nets were missing KD, Kyrie, and Dinwiddie. But we were missing Seth Curry. Please do not insult the Greater Curry by pretending those 3 are even comparable to him."
Not saying missing Seth curry is kevin Durant n kyrie combined but missing Seth curry is the equilvane t
No Seth Curry tonight. And the Nets without them are still a playoff team.
Seth curry is what makes this team go
Dang Seth Curry really does make the Sixers work.
Sixers can't win without Seth Curry
Seth curry MVP clearly
Seth Curry is the 76ers MVP
Damn this is what happens when Seth Curry and his league leading 79% TS isn‚Äôt on the court huh
"Unrelated, where is Seth Curry"
Seth Curry shooting 59% from 3 lol
Seth curry
Seth Curry is underrated.
Steph... seth curry
"No KD, No Kyrie, No Seth Curry &amp; No Ernie ;("
"Love the Ball matchup, but Seth curry is also turning out pretty nice for the sizers üëÄ"
"i can't wait to see my favorite players, seth curry and kyrie irving, going head-to-head in this playoff preview!!"
Seth Curry is out?
"Well yeah... None of JJ Redick, Seth Curry, or Duncan Robinson achieved that last year."
I'm all in on Seth Curry. Let's gooo skyfucker jr
Sixers on the second night of a back-to-back and with Seth Curry out are about to lose after giving up 46 points to LeVert.
"""player driven"" by who? a couple of dudes (if hes talking about d book and seth curry) who talked shit to him and then lost? and this is me generously interpreting their shit talk as ""criticism"""
"Yeah, they could beat the Celtics.   Stevens always schemes pretty well against them and at full strength, it's a toss-up. You can argue that you can put Simmons on Tatum and hamper his scoring, but that doesn't stop Brown from eating Seth Curry alive or Kemba feasting in drop coverage.   They do have better personnel and a better coach now, so you'd have to see the matchup and how each coach counters the other effectively. Two years ago I was certain they'd beat a rookie Tatum and a sophomore Brown, but that didn't happen."
Yes if they can do the following  1. Joel Embiid stays healthy  2. Ben Simmons cancels out one of the Jays 3. Seth Curry/Tobias Harris can play at 80% of their current levels.
Seth Curry for Harden straight up
"Realistic and factual take. Still, Sixers looking real good and Embiid is off to a fantastic start. That Seth Curry acquisition looking real good too"
"Disagree; he doesn't need to find another career today. He's thankfully covered financially, why not give it all to go for his dreams? He might never be good enough, but he's toeing the line clearly. Not saying he's Seth Curry, but Seth Curry could have easily given up prior to cracking into the league. I'm sure Gelo also believes he's just one opportunity away."
"Lmaoo comparing tatums impact to Seth curry   Okay our tallest player is out, how granular we gonna take this"
"sixers should've been running away with this game...what happened?  are we going to say ""well they didn't have seth curry""?"
You misspelled ‚ÄúSeth Curry‚Äù in the Ohio section but overall great job!
iim convinced Seth curry was a figment of my imagination at this point
"&gt; You keep bringing up a 100% win rate against the Rockets without KD... what, in the regular season? What? You think that‚Äôs a salient point?  No this includes playoffs as well when KD was injured   &gt;  wouldn‚Äôt that only highlight KD‚Äôs impact? That he was able to make up for his superstar teammate‚Äôs relative struggles and then some against a tough Rockets team?  Because if you actually watch, KD started doing this after game 2 of Clippers before any injury. He went from being super passive (only averaging 12 FGA over a month) to super aggressive for no reason other than to fill his own ego.   &gt; I know it was especially clear how unimportant KD was to that team when he got injured and they went on to lose to the Raptors 4-2.  No one here is claiming KD wasn't unimportant, stop attacking a strawman. What's being discussed here is KD had a 'stylistic tension' with the team which hurt the team, not always, but very frequently depending on what he wanted to prove. KD wasn't playing ego iso ball in 2017 when this team was at its absolute peak.   &gt;  that ‚Äústylistic tension‚Äù and actual impact on the court are two completely different arguments.  Except it's not, every sane person agrees Golden State looked like a completely different team without KD. Seth Curry claims Golden State was 'not better, but harder to guard due to increased ball motion' when KD was injured. Literally even the shit analysts could see the difference like night and day. Which means you're even below that level. And I emphasize again that KD did not always have this iso mentality on Golden State because the dude is damn fickle, it's evaluated on a series by series basis.  &gt; how unimportant KD was to that team when he got injured and they went on to lose to the Raptors 4-2.  Yeah no fucking shit, the Warriors were a top heavy team paying KD big money, when he's injured we have to play guys like Quinn Cook and McKinnie to guard Kawhi Leonard and Lowry. It's a fucking testament to how well Curry impacts the offense that they even won those 2 games."
Seth Curry
"I'm not saying he's just that. Seth Curry isn't just that either. They both have a solid floor game and are good finishers who punish closeouts. And yes, they can shoot on the move too.  Neither are the off-ball threat that guys like Duncan or Bertans or even JJ Redick are though."
"You then compared him to Seth Curry, who you called ""almost exclusively a spot-up shooter"".   I'm also interested in seeing stats that compare Robinson and Harris. I'm not saying you're wrong, but just by the eye test I feel like Harris makes a ton of shots from off-ball movement and at a high percentage."
"He's not marginally better though. Duncan takes insane shots on the move and coming off of screens, which is a legitimate game-changing skill. There are 3, maybe 4 people who can do this as well as Duncan.  Harris can shoot on the move, but not nearly as well. It's like comparing Steph and Seth Curry. Steph has literally every shot in his 3pt repertoire, but Seth is almost exclusively a spot-up shooter from 3. Even if he shoots that shot better, it doesn't make him a better shooter."
"Looks like Robert Williams and Seth Curry are back tomorrow, the first to return this season I believe."
Philly? Hell no  Unless Seth Curry shoots 50% from 3 in a series and Embiid averages 35
finally I don't have to meme that Seth Curry is the best Curry
Seth Curry
"The dunk contest and three point contest. I mean, why limit them to all stars? Just have the best shooters, even if they are guys like Bertans or Redick or Seth Curry who'll never make an All Star team. I also find the idea of random players in the dunk contest quite fun."
seth curry?? i thought he was on the sixers
Like when Dwight grabbed Seth Curry by his jersey and held him so that Danny Green could hit a 3. I have no sympathy for the Lakers lmao
A 10% increase to 2020-2021 Seth Curry would be a 69.5% 3pt shooter
I take the 10% and then sign Seth Curry who is now Steph Curry due to the 10% increase
"The injuries suck. If you all failed this season and gave the warriors a good pick that‚Äôs just the world sometimes, but it sucks if it‚Äôs injuries deciding that and not just the team.  Sixers need shooting and Wolves need defense, but it‚Äôs funny there‚Äôs not really a trade there that makes either team better. Sixers getting Lavine or a player like that would be great, but Seth Curry looks like the best shooter we‚Äôve had since JJ.  I‚Äôm not sure who the wolves could make a move for, but you‚Äôll be competing with teams like Portland for any defensive anchor that becomes available so hopefully Edwards sky rockets his value this season and you have some flexibility in the off-season to decide if you‚Äôre going all in with KAT and DLo or not"
We've had Seth Curry and Danny Green which is just kind of hilarious
"Seth Curry played 1 game in a Cavs uniform. Did not realize that. Also didn't realize that dude has been on 7 teams in 6 years.   That's kinda wild since he has a ""much better than journeyman"" skill set."
"I think the 76ers would have been better going by O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs report  James Harden/Shake Milton/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Seth Curry, Thybulle and Dwight Howard off the bench  I don‚Äôt see how you stop them"
Yep also had Bynum that year as well and something I didn't remember Seth Curry haha.
Shake milton and seth curry have both been great this year anyway so maxey isn't even really needed though
"second best father/son duo of all time behind dell and Steph/Seth Curry?  most other player/son duos had one or both dad and son average/middle of the pack  Dell was 6MOTY, and one son is the best shooter of all time (the other plays for GSW)  Arvydas was an all timer outside of the NBA, and Domatas is a solid all star  anyone other duo better?"
I mean they didn't let him walk. They traded him. And as great as Seth is the trade was absolutely worth it for both sides. Dallas really needed some defense with a little shooting and Philly REALLY needed as much shooting as they could get. And Richardson was clearly an awkward fit in Philly so I think it was a good bet that he'd be able to improve more on Dallas. Also Dallas has a lot of shooters so Curry is missed a lot less than Richardson's defense was needed.
"Most people thought that Simmons for harden was the trade even tho harden wanted Brooklyn.  I think the 76ers will regret not trading for harden even tho their team has improved from a year ago with doc, Seth curry, Danny green and tyrese maxey."
The issue was never his shooting he's been shooting the rock fine all year.   The issue is shooting is pretty much the *only* thing he can do. Clippers fans were hoping he'd come in and be a good playmaker off the bench as well as creating his own shot every now and then and he hasn't really lived up to that. Not to mention he's a turnstile on defense.   If you're paying 15+ million a year for a pure shooter it's a bit of an overpay. Seth Curry is making half that and I'd say is a better shooter/player than Kennard as well. Doug McDermott is another example of a pure shooter and he's only making $7 million a year.
Also because he got called a bitch ass by Seth Curry. Hard to come back from that shit.
"A team being significantly better 4-8 makes a world of difference come playoff time, especially considering that the given the chemistry issues and the fit issues that the Nets have with their top 3 (if kyrie doesnt retire, top 2 if he does), the Bucks/Heat/Celtics/76ers are all close enough top end wise that having much better depth would more than make up for the difference  You can hype up the Nets scrubs all you want, but Harris is no better than DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson, Justin Holiday, KCP, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mikal Bridges, Trent Jr, etc etc etc  And even if Harris was a hair better than any of those guys, which again he's not, each of those teams are sooo much better 5-8 that it isn't even comparable. Bruce Brown, Shamet, TLC, Chiozza are all players that only see playing time because of how bad the depth is on the Nets. Okay maybe Brown would get bench time on other teams, but even that is stretching  I'm not grasping at anything. I'm literally spitting facts of why the Nets are not title contenders as currently constructed, and I have evidence to back it up considering that they struggled to beat the worst team in the league yesterday  Keep spinning the facts, whatchu got next?"
3. Tobias Harris 4. Seth Curry/Shake Milton
"We loved Seth but we needed better perimeter defense. Also, there were plenty of times where we were on a run against the Clippers until Kawhi got the switch onto Curry, backed him down, and hit the mid range j. Curry was an amazing floor spacer but we needed defense more than offense to compete against the other playoff teams"
"Not a Dallas fan, so bear with me.   Why did they let Seth Curry walk? Too much $$$? Or he wanted a better team?  He's been a journeyman, but I think he's a solid asset.   Even if his defense is suspect, he would've been nice for his shooting."
"Yeah. Makes you wonder why the fuck they didn't pursue someone like Redick or Seth Curry, who could actually put up that many open 3s efficiently.   sigh"
"Celtics fans generally respect the organization and roster construction from Ainge, but wish he made plays for bigger players. We feel like Brown and Tatum are good, but the rest of the roster won't get us over the hump. I get the impression 76ers fans have a bit less faith, because although they have two great franchise players, they've made seriously boneheaded and impulsive moves and mortgaged the team's future on two guys who may never work out.  I think Celtics fans should be optimistic because Brown and Tatum are very, very young, and 76ers fans should be optimistic because they've cleaned house and got Seth Curry now.   However, winning in the NBA is never a guarantee, and you need to find a way to enjoy a team trying to compete."
I miss seth curry
"If Seth Curry didn't give Tatum and the whole league covid, this wouldn't have happened"

Seth Curry Simmons pnr üëÄ
I question the validity of a stat that says Payton Prichard brings almost as much value as Jayson Tatum or that Jeff Teague is better than Marcus Smart or that Shake Milton is the second offensive player on Philly behind Seth Curry and also the second best defender.   There are so many glaring discrepancies in this stat that I doubt there should be much stock put in it.
I first thought about this trade last year before the 6ers has Seth curry who I think would make Coby redundant. Also this was when Coby was going off.
"Okay, let's analyse that timespan then by possession:  1. Harris blows by Fultz and help is stuck with a shooter (Green and Curry) while Aaron Gordon is way too late to help because he either hesitates with Simmons at the top of the key or he reacts way too slow, could be both to me. 2. Simmons brings the ball up, Fultz tries to steal it and gets called for a reach-in. From the inbound, Curry and Embiid attack the basket with 3 guys at the rim except for Gordon who guards Simmons, but he focuses much more on the paint/ball than Simmons. 3. Simmons drives down the lane himself and kicks out to a \*wide open\* Seth Curry who hits the three. Not much here either. 4. Simmons stays in the dunker's spot for nearly the entire possession, Embiid hits the jumper. Not much here either. 5. Simmons runs up the floor, gets attention from two guys, passes to Harris who hits the 3. The attention could also have been to prevent a Simmons drive and open dunk/layup so unclear too, but probably not because of his three-point threat. 6. Simmons brings the ball down the court. At the top of the key, his man (AG again) seems more concerned with getting around the Embiid screen than a Simmons three, despite the large gap between the two. Embiid then makes a gorgeous move to dunk on Vucevic, but Simmons in the dunker's spot didn't have any three-point threat this time either. 7. Curry and Embiid in a pick and pop with Simmons in the corner. His man doesn't seem concerned with a three though, which might be because a pass out to Simmons from Curry's position would have been very risky, but he is at the edge of the paint either way. 8. Simmons isn't at the three-point line at any point in this possession. 9. Simmons drives down the court in transition, gets doubled and passes to a trailing Harris who hits the lightly contested three. 10. Simmons passes at the beginning of the shot clock but stands in the dunkers' spot until he screens for an open three for Shake Milton. 11. Simmons isn't even a part of the offense, as he crosses half court after Harris gets it to Embiid in the paint who earns free throws. 12. Embiid draws a foul early into the shot clock, no special attention for Simmons again.  So I guess you were right, as Simmons didn't get much extra attention (\*maybe\* in that 1st possession I guess) at the three-point line, but he wasn't in that position very often either. A better explanation for this (difference with previous season) would probably be that the Sixers defense got them many transition opportunities (in which Simmons does excel) and that guys like Green, Curry and Shake force guys to think about their shooting before they help out/double Embiid or a driver. Maybe you could bring a bit more to the table to support your argument than just ""lol"" next time I guess."
Seth Curry over Murray
"Honestly I'm still taking Buddy Hield, KD, Joe Harris, Seth Curry and a bunch of other guys over him. Just because he shoots really deep attempts doesn't make him a better shooter."
Seth Curry
Who tf is going to dime Simmons up on a slash for the 76ers?  Gonna run a high post set with Seth Curry lol?
"I don't know if it will get me killed, but we should never have traded Seth Curry and Porzingis will never be healthy in the playoffs."
"Is it crazy to say that shake milton is the 3rd best player for the sixers?  Ben simmions defensively his impressive... but his scoring ability just looks even worse. He seriosully looks disinterested to attack the paint, he just doesn't seem to look even like ben simmions of previous years.    For your post  until seth curry comes back i would start shake milton, or just bring him off the bench but play him 30+ mintues. Ben maybe he should move to the foward poisiton, but i doubt that will change his scoring ability. He doesn't attack the rim as much anymore, and in the 4th he hinders the teams offense since he just sucks at shooting."
Tyrell Terry is Poor man's Seth Curry. Josh Green is really poor man's josh richardson.
Yeah it was this week. Either it was a troll or some people should just not be allowed to have opinions.  I also delved into the post history and he suggested Seth Curry could win MVP if he averaged 20 while shooting over 60% from 3
Seth went to the 76ers basically at the same time Klay got injured. Would've been interesting to see Curry^2 over StOubre. Probably would be better offensively and chemistry wise a lot sooner.
"Because offense is inherently more important than defense in basketball. The 01 run made it especially clear that the entire Lakers roster could play decent defense while also being able to play offense, while the Sixers players were decent to good defenders that couldn‚Äôt hit a layup if their life was on the line. It‚Äôs the same reason why Matisse Thybulle struggles to break the rotation but Seth Curry is a starter. the reason they lost is because Shaq had no problem scoring on the Sixers‚Äô ‚Äúelite‚Äù defensive players, and even if he sat the rest of the team could field a good offense. Meanwhile Shaq and Kobe would essentially soft double Iverson and just let Eric Snow brick free throw line shots. ‚ÄúElite defense‚Äù falls apart against great offense in the NBA which is why you can list defensive accolades all day but that Sixers team around Iverson was just not anywhere near as good as most other finals teams in history"
"I get it.  I really like Larry Nance Jr., Meyers Leonard, Seth Curry, and some other non-stars. Dunno why, but some guys I'm just drawn to root for."
"Agreed.  There's going to be an Embiid-esque mismatch on almost every single possession based on who is guarding who for Brooklyn.  If Seth Curry is on the floor, this will be a LeBron level mismatch hunt, but with Brooklyn having 3 different people that can do it on any given possession."
"Nah, the shots guys like Seth Curry, Duncan Robinson or Kyle Korver are taking are not open. But they're usually catch and shoot, while Doncic for example shoots almost exclusively off the dribble"
"I mean, Seth Curry is at nearly 60% with more shots on the season so far. So in a way, it kind of is curry-like lol."
"Lmao I mean why wouldn't we? It's not like that's crazy low volume or anything.   Seth Curry who's known as one of the best shooters in the NBA has only taken 42 3s. Hell even one of the best shooters on your squad, Luke Kennard, who's made a career taking and making 3s has only shot 38 as well.   That volume is about what you'd expect from a 3+D role player like KCP 14 games into the season, especially with him missing a few.   No one thinks he's going to keep shooting that high of a percentage from 3, that'd be ludicrous. However, it's undeniable that he's off to a blazing hot start and there's no reason to think he won't be able to hit his 3s at around a 40-42% rate this year the way he's going right now."
Seth Curry is shooting almost 60% from 3
"We should send the so called MVP Steph to the G league and trade for his much superior brother Seth ""the Cook"" Curry"
"Coach Spoelstra is generally considered one of the smartest head coaches in the league. He surely knows Ben's shooting attempts and scoring are both down this year. And yet he still decided to pack the paint and form a wall around him in back to back games. He gave up 12 assists in game one, and decided that it was worth it not to have him attack the paint with one person defending him. He did the same thing the second game and Ben got 12 assists again.   People don't build a wall against him because they enjoy seeing him pass to open shooters in the corner just like people don't double Embiid because they like seeing Seth Curry shoot wide open threes. They do it because the alternative is worse."
"Pfft, not notable.  Seth Curry is .05 percentage points away from the 60/60/100 club."
"Seth Curry has been their 2nd best player, but Simmons has still been good"
Sixers are 9-4. 2nd best record in the East. 3rd best in the whole NBA. And they looked fantastic before Seth Curry got COVID.   People need to calm down on the Simmons hate.
George Hill  Seth Curry  Duncan Robinson  Robert Covington  Brook Lopez
"Yea, that team is way better constructed. Harden/Seth Curry/Danny Green/Tobias/Embiid with Shake Milton and Dwight coming off the bench is a more balanced team than KD/Kyrie/Harden and a bunch of G leaguers."
No? They got infected by Seth Curry
"I think it‚Äôs a very interesting question. Based purely on basketball, Harden is an obvious upgrade 1 for 1 over any other player on the Sixers. But there are a few worries I would have trading for him:  Facilitation - Embiid needs shooters. Everyone knows that. Seth Curry is already proving how good Embiid and shooters can make each other. But I don‚Äôt think Embiid needs a black hole who always has the ball. I‚Äôm not saying I wouldn‚Äôt be floored to add Harden to this team, but I do question whether he would bring as much out of Joel as the Curry/Green combo has so far. Losing Ben would yet again expose us as a team without a top tier ball handler. I guess Shake or Tyrese could fill that role in coming years, but not during a potential 2021 playoff run.  Personality - we all know Harden loves his strip clubs and parties. He‚Äôs also proving to be outspoken and occasionally controversial during his departure from Houston. He also has historic hiccups with staying in game shape. I think all of these things could have the potential to aggravate or influence Joel in a negative way. Joel has also been the leader of this team for 5+ years now. A player like Harden coming in with more talent and that personality could be rough   Conclusion: I wouldn‚Äôt say no to James Harden on my favorite team, but I think there‚Äôs reason enough to believe he might not be the perfect fit he was touted as, and I think the sixers are fine the way they are"
"Not trying to blame anyone, just trying to get this timeline right. So the Wizards played the Nets on 1/3. KD goes on covid protocol on 1/4, Tyler Johnson on 1/7. Seth Curry tests negative in the morning/afternoon on the 7th, but then positive that evening. The following morning a Sixers training staff member also tests positive. Wizards play Celtics on the 8th and Tatum tests positive the next day."
"Well on the plus side for them, they're going to be preeminent favorite to get whoever is bought out because they have playing time and open roster spots up for grabs.   I think your team is the only one that stands a chance because of Embiid, however I'm not sure you have enough perimeter scoring from the likes of Seth Curry/Shake/Maxey/Tobias to win 4 out of 7 vs. this team.   Like Jeff Green, for all his notable flaws as a player, isn't actually THAT bad as a man defender, he did a very good job on Giannis in their game last year in the bubble, and if you look at how much Crowder gave Giannis trouble, you can imagine Jeff Green being able to pose the same problem.   When push comes to shove at the end of games, they are probably going to switch 1-5, which is why they probably need one more 3&amp;D wing as Joe Harris is probably too much of a defensive liability on quick guards. However, I won't put it past them to get like, a Trevor Ariza, or somebody of that ilk."
I'm sure he'll regress somewhat but I can't even complain about the contract anymore because Seth Curry and Shake Milton's deals smooth it out.
"How? Seth curry tested positive the day after playing the wizards, doesn‚Äôt it take a few days to test positive with the ‚Äúincubation period‚Äù. The Celtics had someone test positive before playing the wizards and then Tatum tested positive the day after playing the wizards. I might just not understand how COVID transmission works but haven‚Äôt they just been unlucky playing against players who already had COVID before playing them?"
I blame seth curry lol
"It's hard to trace back but, Seth Curry tested positive after playing the Wizards,  while playing the Nets game. Both teams had to stay over in NY. Then the Celtics played the Wizards and Robert Willaims tested positive the same day, but it takes 7-10 days so who knows how far back Curry got it"
Of course he does. You saw him chatting it up with Tatum? You saw him guarding Seth Curry lol.  I really blame the NBA. This was obviously gonna happen but they let Wizards play games anyway.
Imagine having very little to no spacing from last season to this. Seth Curry is perfect. Just fills that huge gap seamlessly.
Seth Curry could win it
Seth Curry
"Yeah but I also have: Jimmy, Nurkic, Seth Curry, MPJ, Covington, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and so on. It‚Äôs a struggle to find GP and/or players not shitting the bed every week so far."
"Idk man, Dell Curry by himself produced Seth and Steph. Canon's gonna have Dell, Seth, and Steph training him."
"Draymond, Blake Griffin, and Seth Curry."
"Avery Bradley, Seth Curry, Robert Covington, Jae Crowder, Shaq"
"Seth Curry, Mikal Bridges, Duncan Robinson, and Lauri Markannen."
"He had the Rockets as consistently one of the best teams in the NBA for the last near-decade. He is easily one of the best execs in the NBA. Easily. If not for the Warriors all time great team beating them, he likely has a title with Houston too.   And look what he‚Äôs done for us already in just ONE year:  Offloaded Horford‚Äôs deal for just a 1st and 2nd round pick. And also got Green back in the deal. Veteran shooter we need.   Traded Richardson and Seth Curry. Curry has been nothing short of amazing so far and is an incredible fit on this team.   Signed Dwight to a vet min deal. Say what you will, but Dwight has been a great vet presence the last couple seasons and he is a really good back up to Embiid. For peanuts.   Drafted Maxey at 21. Then went and got two more rookies in Paul Reed and Isiah Joe who have both had some really good moments for us.  Basically, he came in and fucking crushed free agency and immediately made some tweaks to the roster that have it looking like the best team in the East and then also fucking crushed the draft.   I‚Äôd take a bullet for Daryl Morey. He‚Äôs the best thing to happen to Philly professional sports since Nick Foles took us to the promise land"
Him and Seth Curry gonna fight for that title
Seth Curry won't end the season shooting 60% from deep. Calling it now.
2020 Seth curry to the sixers good point
Seth Curry defo needs an invite
Seth Curry 100% 30 for 30 FT streak ends!

"I heard one of our commentators mention Seth Curry is 6'3"" the other day and I was trying to reconcile the fact that he looks like a baby next to these dudes with the fact that he's taller than me"
"seth curry plays like such a pussy, he‚Äôs scared to shoot if anyone is near him"
Seth Curry will break Korver's 3 point accuracy record.
"Doris: Yeah, Seth Curry was better than Brunson, but Brunson is on a rookie deal."
"&gt;Simmons doesn‚Äôt even stand in the corner...he‚Äôd be in the dunker‚Äôs spot if anything lol it‚Äôs Seth and Green in the corners. Regardless, basketball is nowhere near that simple and neither is shutting down Embiid.   It is that simple when it comes to shutting down Simmons in the playoffs. He's the one player who can genuinely guard by doing one simple thing; leaving him open from range. His off ball cuts aren't enough to combat that weakness.  &gt;For instance I‚Äôm fairly sure Giannis isn‚Äôt even Simmons‚Äô primary defender in the half court. They‚Äôd likely have Middleton or Jrue on him.  I'd assume Lopez on Embiid, Giannis on Ben, Middleton on Tobias, Jrue on Curry/Donny D. That way Giannis can stunt hard at Embiid and help with whatever as a top tier help defender, but the Bucks have versatility overall.   &gt;Not to mention Giannis needs to worry about getting clamped himself. Guy‚Äôs regressed in two straight postseasons against elite defences. Meanwhile Embiid averaged 30 ppg on 60 TS% against the Celtics with Tobias throwing up bricks.   True about Giannis, but I think he has a better chance of averaging 25 vs the Sixers than the Simmons has of even averaging 15. Giannis, unless Bud reaaaally screws the pooch, won't be put in positions to be locked up like he was vs Toronto years ago  &gt;I trust Embiid‚Äôs game to hold up in the playoffs more than I do Giannis. Not saying they should be favoured over the Bucks or anything but they‚Äôre absolutely real threats to get past them, especially with that stifling defence.  Of course they're major threats to get past them. They have as good as a chance as anyone but the Nets in the East, but they have very exploitable weaknesses that can't be solved by Embiid's post ups"
"No, Seth Curry is more than good enough"
"A lot of their success is based on unsustainable play from Joel Embiid. I can't believe people are falling for the ""Sixers are real contenders!"" shit yet again. At the end of the day, either Tobias Harris or Seth Curry is their second best half court threats and that's not enough."
Steph fans:  Steph Curry casually makes a sandwich üëÄüëÄüëÄ  Enough already. Seth shoots at a higher percentage and Steph is on a losing team. We get it. He's good. Relax.
Seth Curry with (P) speed.
Okay well why doesn‚Äôt Seth curry improve on D or kuzma improve his passing? They‚Äôre just bad at those things. Of course guys work on their game. Do you not think Danny green has done hours and hours of dribbling drills? He‚Äôs just not good at dribbling. Why doesn‚Äôt Seth curry play defense like Danny green? He would be a better player!!!!!
"Why tf would you draw up a play for tobias fucking Harris when you have Joel Embiid and Seth Curry on the team as options?  Brainlet level play from doc, holy shit"
Very weird. Harris and Embiid packed the paint while Danny Green and Seth Curry weren't even moving. I assume they were meant to be ready for a dribble hand off to shoot a three but it was really awkward and left Simmons with no options.
"unless Tyrell Terry becomes, well unironically the next Seth curry, this Mavs jrich Seth trade looking worse everyday"
Seth Curry revenge game
SETH CURRY WITH THE SHOT BOI
SETH CURRY WITH THE SHOT
Seth curry is money
"Shooters that can drive when closed out on, Joe Harris, KCP, Seth Curry, Kuzma, McDermott, Huerter, Bogdanovic etc. its really not impossible or too much to ask a guy to develop his game over the years so he can take advantage of an open driving lane. Like I said they just need to be average at it not D Wade level."
I was like these are not the state of Seth curry and Danny green so far
Seth Curry #1
Seth doesn't run like those guys but he's a mega high iq shot selector. He mastered when to shoot and where the nearest defender is. What I'm trying to say is I miss Seth curry
Wait Seth curry dont shoot the T fee throw
"I love Lebron and Curry. But if I just get Giannis, Lillard, and KD with a bunch of great role players like Seth Curry or J Harris. And maybe a couple rising talents like Wiseman or Jeremy Grant.   There ain't nothing those two can do to stop that team."
"seth curry is the most disrespected player on this 76ers team. he‚Äôs arguably their best shooter and they refuse to give it to him when he‚Äôs open lol. they hit him there, but he‚Äôs literally open ALL THE TIME if you just watch him on the floor."
"Isn‚Äôt that why Seth Curry is a better offensive player than Danny green though, because he can take someone on and do more than stand there and shoot."
"Very few. It‚Äôs only valuable if you can shoot off movement which is super hard. It‚Äôs really like him, Ellington, Redick, Bertans, and a couple other guys. Even a guy like Seth Curry doesn‚Äôt really do that too much, since he doesn‚Äôt shoot off movement much. He‚Äôll run quick loops to catch the ball off a DHO but not the kind of stuff you see from those other guys."
Sixers legend Robert Covington vs Blazers legend Seth Curry
You have Seth Curry. Be happy and thankful. Leave our Gary alone.
True of Luka too in a couple years tbh. He'd be smart to take the QO and then bail. Can't trust an organization who made that KP deal and thought Richardson would be an upgrade over Seth Curry. Awful moves.
WHERES SETH CURRY??
Patty Mahomes reminds me of a mix of Seth Curry and Steph Curry; so this checks out.
"Wow, just looked that up. Seth Curry is killing it this season!"
Getting Seth Curry for Josh Richardson should be enough to at least be in the running.
Seth Curry. Dude is lights out this season. His fg% and 3p% are both over .500
"That's great for Kawhi's case if the Clippers still win those games despite not having Paul George. If they struggle, then the argument is only further cemented to the voters that Kawhi needs PG's help  As things are currently, I wouldn't want LeBron winning MVP, but c'mon man AD is shooting 70% from the FT line when he normally shoots in the 80%.  I'm saying, and many others are, that Embiid is doing really well considering the help he has and if the Sixers keep it up, the MVP is his. It seems unlikely that the Sixers record will keep up now that they lost one of their greatest floor spacers in Seth Curry.  Jokic, as much as I love him, is on a losing team right now. If Denver turn it around, he's definitely in the conversation.  Narrative does play a role in electing a MVP and I think a lot of people, myself included, want to see LeBron get another MVP before he retires akin to what Kareem did. KD had a case to win MVP himself off of narrative until Harden joined the Nets. Giannis is still the monster that he is, but will voter fatigue kick in for him? Mitchell the star player of the first seed right now. As it stands KD and Jokic are out of the race. It's just LeBron, Embiid, Mitchell, Giannis, and Kawhi. Embiid and LeBron, imo, have the best overall case but if the Sixers lose more games are Seth recovers from Covid, then LeBron and Mitchell are the runner-up. Hell, Mitchell might just win it if the Jazz keep up their performance due to being the best player on the best team."
"Exactly. 18 games in the season, you get a million posts about Seth Curry on pace for a 50/50/100 season lol"
"I was wondering how Steph Curry shot so few free throws until this comment.  Ohhhh Seth, not Steph"
I wanna say thay was blind trust but thats just his Curry sense tingling anytime a three is about to go in.   Seth did this a few times at Duke and I remember seeing Dell do it once or twice back in the day.
"Is this supposed to be a dig or something? Seth was borderline unplayable on defense against the Clippers in the playoffs. He's a regular season dynamo who has to be surrounded by a great defensive team to do well in the playoffs. We didn't have that. And he was the only trade piece we had with enough value to get someone like Richardson who can (theoretically) be a better fit for our team in the playoffs.  If Richardson folds in the playoffs, we lost the trade, period. Any other metric used to judge the trade is inadequate because the trade was made for the playoffs...not the regular season.  (And the reason we might miss the playoffs this year is covid. Not trading Curry for Richardson. Seeing how badly Curry's shooting dropped after he got covid should be evidence enough for that.)"
1. James Harden 2. Bradley Beal 3. Devin Booker 4. Donovan Mitchell 5. Jrue Holiday 6. CJ McCollum 7. Victor Oladipo 8. Seth Curry 9. Danny Green
Proves that Seth is the superior Curry
"The Celtics have 3 players to guard the Nets big 3, they are the only team in the East that have 3 players I trust to do that, also they have scheme versatility defensively, their bigs can get of the paint to contest Kyrie and KD out of PNR they have the best defense against Brooklyn.  &amp;#x200B;  Offensively Boston and Milwaukee (unless Brookly gets another center), Kemba and Tatum can kill Jordan's drop coverage, just like Middleton, and Brooklyn has no good option on Giannis.  Embiid can kill the Nets inside too, but I'm not sure you can rely on EMbiid iso vs Deandre to be more efficient than KD/Kyrie/Harden in a series especially because one of them will have Seth Curry/Tobi Harris/Shake Milton on them.  Miami's off ball movement can destroy the Nets defender, Harden especially but both KD and Harden are pretty decent match up's for Butler.  So I's say Boston &gt; Bucks &gt; Philly &gt; Miami"
"Seth Curry felt like shit for a while too. Tonight he had a good game, so maybe he's back to feeling well, but who knows. I don't think athletes want to be too upfront about how they're feeling b/c they don't know what'll happen in the future, and they also don't want to lower their perceived value as a player even if they think something long-term or even permanent happened."
it was a 2nd of a back-to-back and w/o Seth Curry. Philly starters are 14-0
I‚Äôll take LA and Brooklyn as far as duos go but man if that 76ers roster isn‚Äôt perfect for what they‚Äôve been trying to do. Seth Curry shooting 50/50/100 and Tobias Harris playing like an all star again are what has separated the 76ers from the Nuggets for example
"No, cleveland sucks. I think dallas or Denver should.. they need more shooters and the lose of seth curry/j grant has hurt both teams..."
"That doesn't change the fact that those narratives are parroted.. Also saying there's a video about anything doesn't disprove that the vid is factual.. because otherwise you can use that argument for anything.   I literally just got done hearing Bill Simmon's reference that Steph was getting shit from social media on his podcast. Curry has referenced ""hearing the noise/critics""   When Curry had his 62pt game Seth Curry referenced his brothers legacy:https://twitter.com/sdotcurry/status/1345943379255947265  Donovan Mitchell said mfs was talking crazy:https://twitter.com/spidadmitchell/status/1345943345022070784  All the crazy talk was about how Curry had to ""prove himself"", how he needed to carry a bad team to the playoffs or his legacy should be questioned. All of this is what basically was talked about in the video. I know it's just bullshit takes, but they were loud.. Even NBA players noticed it, idk how y'all haven't."
"I remember when Steph Curry got drafted, a lot said he'd be Jason Terry coming off the bench to be effective. Just so many nonsensical takes from people pretending to know what they are talking about. The same thing with Seth. I said for years he had talent to at least be a 6th man in the NBA because of his incredible shooting when he played in the G league. So many people kept shitting on him, saying he wasn't big or athletic enough. Yet JJ Barea was consistently getting minutes in the NBA at that point."
"When you‚Äôre comparing a HoFer to Seth Curry, it might be a slight stretch"
i read this as seth curry mvp chances
"It's because they're both their teams best playmakers despite their shooting.  For the Sixers especially. Simmons is a bad playmaker in the playoffs because his weaknesses get exposed more, but he's still their best playmaker by a mile... Especially with Seth Curry being injured and not being the same since coming back. Dude looks bad.."
"As a European fan it's quite hard to actually watch all the NBA games or teams since they only show selected national TV games I think for me so thanks for the heads up since I have limited access to actual game footage.       One point I'd like to add is that in contrast, Giannis who actually also is not the most talented shooter tries to integrate it into his game. I don't want to jump to any conclusions here but I think maybe playing alongside Joel and the current iteration of the sixers with their shooters in Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Danny Green gives Simmons faith that the space he creates will be used but also lets him rely on his team a bit too much on the offensive side? What I'm trying to say is that if Simmons would be able to at least score at a medium rate from jumpers or 3 pointers, he would be up in this tier of players who will be regularly in the MVP discussion as well as it would improve the chance of the sixers actually winning the title.      at least thats what Gianni's is trying to do I guess and he doesn't have a clear cut MVP candidate on his side. I know the comparison isn't entirely fair in terms of game impact or team environment but their lack of shooting touch is obviously a problem for both"
Jalen Brunson exists.     maybe don't trade Seth Curry???   let Josh Richardson touch the ball sometimes????   and Trey Burke can't even get touches off the bench.
"I'm sure you know this, but you guys didn't have your winning lineup either.  Simmons sat, Seth only played the 1st quarter (I watched Blazers stream so idk why Curry couldn't finish the game.  If you know, I'd like to hear), and Embiid hurt his knee which IMO made him play less physically than he normally could.  Yes, his middies were butter in the 1st half.  But, especially on defense, I think he would've done more while healthy.  A damn Kanter-Hood double shouldn't stop him without him worrying about his knee"
People have already run this through the trade machine. Danny Green or Seth Curry plus salary filler meets the match requirement. From there it‚Äôs a question of what young players/picks makes the deal work.
Bro you were a 3 seed with Jimmy and Redick and a fucking 6 seed last year. You‚Äôre trash. Can‚Äôt get out of the 2nd round and Jimmy did it on his own. Sixers will always be bums and Danny Green + Seth Curry ain‚Äôt changing that.
"We played today without Tobias Harris, George Hill, Seth Curry, or Dwight Howard."
Seth Curry has been fantastic. I absolutely love him.
Seth Curry really helps out lineup.
"Seth Curry  He‚Äôs a great bench player but a probably a below average starter. He‚Äôs thought of as an elite shooter, which he is, but it‚Äôs on way too low a volume. He just passed up way too many semi-open looks, probably because his shot is so slow. His spacing is still very valuable, but shooting-wise I don‚Äôt consider him the same tier as flamethrowers like Hield, Joe Harris, even Danny."
&gt;Seth Curry  Averaged 37ppg in the WCF   Are you sure about that?
"Uhhh let's see, Simmons made the all star game and is a DPOY candidate, Murray... not so much.   Tobias should've made the all star game and is a great defender, MPJ has been more efficient but wasn't close to all star like production in the first half of the year, and while improved defensively is not nearly as good there as tobias.   Danny green and seth curry are both better players than will Barton.   And AG has been on the nuggets for 10 games, and they've gone 8-2 lol."
76ers fans. Hows everyone on the roster not named Embiid or Ben Simmons doing ??  I feel like I never hear about Seth Curry
Would start over Seth Curry immediatly no cap
Seth Curry for sure
"&gt; Have you seen the Mavs play when he goes to the bench?  Mavs last year were still a top 10 offense in the league when Luka was off the court (and played better defense). They roster isn't changed too much compared to last year except Seth Curry and some Covid protocols. How the Mavs play without Luka is actually one of the strongest points that say he is overrated. He has helped the offense more this year than he has last year, but he has also made the defense even worse."
Didn't we lose this exact same way last year with Seth Curry bricking two free throws?
3 point shooters I‚Äôm most confident it‚Äôll go in when they shoot it   3) Tobias Harris   2) Seth curry   1) Ben Simmons at the end quarters
"One of the reasons Ben Simmons has been weak in the playoffs is spacing.  You guys didn‚Äôt have a real offense and lacked spacing.  JJ Redick running around the perimeter was a life line.  But this year you have some actual shooters and Tobi has stepped up his percentage again.  If they can‚Äôt pack the key against Simmons and Embiid without giving up good looks to people like Tobi and Seth Curry, they will have to give him a little more leeway.  I don‚Äôt think Drummond would abuse them like that in a playoff game just because they‚Äôd pack the key and force him to get rid of the ball or take bad shots, but Embiid is not Drummond and they don‚Äôt have an answer.  Their entire backcourt might foul out trying to slow him down like prime Dwight Howard."
SETH CURRY  vs.  JOE HARRIS
"Embiid was great but the 76ers were also riding Tobias Harris's Career season, Simmons being Simmons and Seth Curry starting off the season with unprecedented 3 point shooting. The floor was incredibly spaced allowing Embiid to absolutely feast. Put Jokic on that team and the 76ers are even better. Where Embiid has the leg up is in defensive rim protection but I think Jokic's facilitation and offensive prowess beats that out. Meanwhile the Nuggets were playing without MPJ and with Jamal Murray having a terrible start to the season where Jokic was and still is the sole reason their team are even playoff contenders. Jokic brings more to his team that leads to winning than any other player in the league making the Nuggets a playoff team which is literally the definition of the most valuable player."
"Is it time to be legitimately concerned about Damian Lillard? I think he might be washed now.... He clearly can't floor raise. He's been getting carried all this time. I think he's no longer a great shooter, Seth Curry might be better."
Maybe Christian Wood or Seth Curry then.
Bruson cooking PG like Seth curry did last year
"You guys have had a good team around him, I think the Mavs bench or cast around Luka was the best in the NBA per net rating? And in the playoffs they definitely played like it; Burke, Seth Curry (even if he's not here anymore) and other guys played out of their minds last playoffs  It's just that your 2nd option is unreliable, that's the problem, due to health and volatility in performance. KP's probably traded by next deadline if he doesn't ball out"
**Starters**  Steph Curry   Jrue Holiday   Justin Holiday   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Brook Lopez    **Bench**    LaMelo Ball   Marcus Morris   Seth Curry   Robin Lopez   Markieff Morris   Thanasis Antetokounmpo   Kostas Antetokounmpo    **Coaching staff**   Mike D'antoni   Dan D'antoni
"Generally speaking Redditors love certain categories of players.  1. Volume shooter with good TS - Curry, Dame, Beal, Lavine   2. 3 point specialist with high consistency - Ingles, Joe Harris, Clarkson, Seth Curry   3. Lots of blocks and steal - Myles Turner, Thybulle   4. 3 &amp; D specialists - Covington, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  Sometimes they go out of fashion but based on what I have seen here, it is generally true.  Players with 'clutch' reputation also have a lot of goodwill.   On the other hand, Triple double gang has polarized reputation."
"Kinda impossible to be ‚Äòrandom‚Äô and have that type of impact in the playoffs but I get what you mean‚Ä¶  **Seth Curry**- can‚Äôt be understated enough how much of a non-scorer Simmons is. All it takes is a smart coach and the right defender and he‚Äôs practically Draymond green. So, Curry will be that 3rd scorer and I can see him having a 20-25 point timely game   **Joe Harris**- Jump shots will stop falling for 2 of the big 3, and Harris will get open looks and have a 20 point game. Media will jump all over it  for the unsung hero angle   **Mikal Bridges**- he‚Äôs not even really random but since it‚Äôs vs LA the masses and media will be shocked at anyone other than the big names playing big. Bridges will have at least 1 game where he‚Äôs hitting open 3s all game   **Enes Kanter** - Kanter always gets buckets, he‚Äôs gonna have that 1 game where he gets enough minutes and shots to score around 20. Denver may be a perfect matchup for him since they will almost always have a traditional 5 in so Kanter can stay on the court"
Seth Curry
As long as Seth Curry isn't suiting up for the Mavs
"How are you going to not double Embiid and get him in foul trouble? You‚Äôre going to get the opposing center in foul trouble and he‚Äôs going to shoot 16 FTA per game on whoever wants that smoke  If you double him, yeah Ben can cut but that‚Äôs why you rotate and you make guys like Danny Green and Seth Curry beat you  Over the course of a series if you play Embiid 1 on 1 and expect any Center to contain him I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a solid game plan"
"My 2K simulation of this year's playoffs has you guys in the Conference Finals, beating both the Knicks and Sixers (minus Seth Curry) in 7 games.   One thing I think people are sleeping on with this team is when everybody is healthy and can play more minutes, you guys have 6 really good players between Trae, Bogdan, Hunter, Gallo, Collins, and Capela. Huerter is a solid af 7th man as well.   I don't think you guys have even played Trae/Bogdan/Hunter/Collins/Capela at all, have you? Or Trae/Bogdan/Hunter/Gallo/Collins at the 5, that lineup will hemorrhage points, but will be unstoppable on offense."
I mean whoever Seth Curry is guarding is a pretty big mismatch. He can't guard Beal or Westbrook. Maybe Bertans but Bertans can shoot over him.
outside of simmons/thybulle our guards are eh defensively. westbrook is going to have danny green or seth curry on him at some point. beal also typically goes off against us.   the defense you're right there. going to have to double embiid and live with the results. help defense isn't exactly a strong point for the wiz so i'd expect/hope for a lot of weakside tobias drives after a swing pass.
Seth Curry and Danny Green will totally light it up while Green can neutralize a hurt Beal and Simmons too big and too good of a defender for Russ
his name is seth curry
I'm ready for seth curry to avg 24 pts a game on 8 3s.
"One thing I've encountered is that it recognizes different players with the same name as the same player (the example I found was trying to go from Jerry West to Seth Curry, where it connected them through two different Mark Jones as the same player). This is obviously an outlier in a pretty frivolous program, so it's the definition of inconsequential, just something I noticed. Thanks for making this and sharing it with us!"
Wes Matthews on the Lakers      Seth Curry on the 76ers      Bruce Brown on the Nets      OG on the raptors
"‚Äú2003 draft pick Lebron James, and brother of Seth Curry, Steph, battle it out in the play-in‚Äù"
Didn‚Äôt know Seth Curry was so popular.
"The fact that they won 4-2 against you when they had a way worse roster? And you basically only added Porzingis (who played 3/6 games last year) and he is, obviously, coming from an injury? And lost Seth Curry"
Theres some people that basically just order by length with PG being the shortest guy  That concept just hilariously breaks when applying it to some teams lmao  Seth curry would be our point guard
"3 curry - dell, Steph and seth. So middle one was the right choice again  Clutch / lucky"
"True the top guys have not played as well as they can and it is on them to perform. Green and curry are much more limited than what I was thinking, nobody is scared of a Seth curry pick and roll. I just think this team would be insanely hard to stop if you replaced Tobias Harris‚Äôs salary slotwith a guy like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, maybe even Kemba walker or Jrue holiday etc..   obviously that‚Äôs true cause most of those guys are all better than Harris but also cause every other high level playoff offense we‚Äôve seen has somebody who is a legitimately good perimeter creator and the sixers have the least perimeter creation of any contender and I think that imbalance is largely cause they gave all that money to Harris. It‚Äôs also bad because every team has to play big against embiid and the sixers do a terrible job of taking advantage of slow bigs by forcing them to play in space because their guards are so limited"
I meant they do in Seth curry and Danny green tho. At some point it's on the top guys. Embild has shown some flashes. But we haven't seen a Simmons fully take over.
"I think Curry trade was even better. Seth Curry has a bargain contract. And he just adds an additional layer to any offense he plays in. He's so good in off-ball plays and as a 3-pt threat.  And the bonus side is 76ers get rid of JRich. JRich is a player who improves his former team as he leave them. After JRich, Miami Heat had a renaissance and now 76ers having the same. Dallas is suffering though."
seth curry and danny green. so obvious.
I think losing Seth curry was huge and Jrich has been underwhelming
Would've been hilarious if Danny's first name was Steph. Steph Green x Seth Curry = Exodia
Already considered good and added Danny Green and Seth Curry and Dwight Howard and found a way to effectively use Tobias Harris
I mean Evan Turner and Seth Curry would make this bench infinitely better  Collins would offer it something it doesn‚Äôt have
76ers pay Seth Curry $70m in secret to get plastic surgery to look like Steph. They then kidnap Steph and give him plastic surgery to look like Seth. Seth then goes to San Fran and takes Steph‚Äôs place while Steph gets to play with Embiid and Simmons. Everyone wins! Except the Warriors.
"Worth pointing out that the last two seasons for Zinger are both shortened, so 57 and 43 aren‚Äôt quite as bad as they seem, and the 48 and 0 game seasons are from the same injury. I‚Äôm not arguing he isn‚Äôt injury prone, but it‚Äôs a little context.  Personally, as a Mavs fan, I don‚Äôt think the team looks ‚Äúwoeful‚Äù at all. The Seth Curry/Richardson trade didn‚Äôt turn out as great as they‚Äôd hoped but it‚Äôs not a huge bust either - Seth wasn‚Äôt as good for us as he‚Äôs been for the Sixers. KP being injured all the time sucks, he‚Äôs off the books in 3 years (before we have to worry about Luka potentially leaving), and the Mavs have space to improve the roster around him and Luka before then. And even if the roster doesn‚Äôt improve a ton, the Mavs are fairly locked in for what, finishing somewhere in the 7th-3rd range every year in the West? That‚Äôs not too bad. They weren‚Äôt far off from beating the Clips last year, they could give em a good run (or even beat them) this year. All it would take is one healthy Porzingis postseason, or Luka making more strides with his game, and the Mavs are gonna be in great shape even without roster changes. I think they‚Äôre gonna be fine - there‚Äôs much worse things than being a perennial playoff team with the best young star in the league."
"Genes and practicing right from the get go. Hand eye coordination usually passes down in family, hence you get a family of shooters like Dell, Steph, and Seth Curry. In terms of practicing the right way, Klay had a doctor constructing his shot and he stuck with it"
"They upgraded they‚Äôre playmaking with rondo and Ibaka should be able protect the rim but i worry about his inability to handle matchups against shifty guards(as showcased vs Boston last year where nurse was forced into playing OG at the 5) and his vulnerability in the low post vs high level offensive bigs( such as AD). The other big aren‚Äôt exactly defensive stoppers either(Cousins and Zubac)  They also finished with a worse record this season and a worse defensive rating while admittedly getting better offensively.   I agree that the mavs likely wont beat them mainly because they lost guys like seth curry and i doubt Trey burke can get to the level of play he showed in the bubble. Not necessarily because the clippers have shown themselves to be a much better team, im ready to give them props if im wrong though"
yalll lost seth curry who i thought was the diff maker
"Mavs probably got tired of watching team exploit Seth on switches. It was an easy bucket every time Seth‚Äôs man screened the ball handler and forced the switch. Kawhi absolutely feasted on that, and I think the Mavs decided they couldn‚Äôt play Seth in the closing lineup.  Richardson was supposed to be the answer but unfortunately his offense has been turrible, and his defense hasn‚Äôt been good enough to justify him in crunch time, though we may see more of it this series because I think Brunson will get targeted like Curry."
Can't forget we turned Jimmy into Seth Curry
Sixers also had an FO change that turned Al Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry. That's what saved us the most.
"Seth Curry, Bronny Jr, Steph Curry and Lebron with Dell Curry and Delonte West in the coaching staff"
Hindsight but seth curry for josh richardson was a terrible trade for the mavs lol
"I mean, he has the 2nd most 3 pointers made in a season ever. If it wasn't for a guy named Steph, he would have the 1st and 2nd most made in a season. The difficulty was insane those years too.   But lets look at a top 10...  1. Steph  2. Dame  It gets debatable after that in no particular order  3. KD 4. CJ 5. Duncan 6. Redick 7. Joe Harris 8. Seth Curry 9. Paul George 10. Kyrie  Not sure I put Harden in top 10 of simply ""shooter"" either. I guess ahead of PG or CJ?   Guys who could be top 10 if you swapped any of those out... Harden, MPJ, Ingles?"
"This Steph guy seems ok, but he's no Seth Curry"
"And this is what Colangelo &amp; Brand did with all of them:  **Grant** - traded for a rental of Ilyasova and an OKC 2020 1st. The 1st was later traded for Anzejs Pasecniks who's rights were renounced before he ever played a game here, and Ilyasova was traded for a 2nd that was sold for cash considerations  **Holmes** - traded for cash considerations  **Noel** - traded for two 2nds and Justin Anderson. One 2nd was traded for cash. the other was packaged with two more 2nds for a rental of Alex Burks and Glenn Robinson III. Anderson was packaged with Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (Colangelo 1st round pick) for Mike Muscala, who was packaged in the Tobias Harris trade  **McConnell** left as a FA  **Okafor** was packaged with a 2nd for a rental of Trevor Booker, BC paid an asset to get rid of him when the year prior Hinkie was very close to trading Okafor for Boston's unprotected Brooklyn pick which became Tatum, but Scott O'Neil/ownership blocked the trade. (Ainge confirmed it was close)  **Covington + Saric** were packaged with 2nds for a rental of Butler, who was traded for Josh Richardson, who was packaged with a 2nd for Seth Curry  **The Kings 1st** was traded away in the Fultz trade  **The Lakers 1st** was Mikal Bridges but they traded him for a Miami 2021 1st and Zhaire Smith. Smith was traded for cash and the 1st was packaged for Harris  --------  Just an incredible, astonishingly bad stretch of waste with no long term vision"
"You are ignorant. Getting rid of the Horford without giving up much of anything was huge not only financially but on the roster makeup of this team. Grabbing Dwight on the cheap to replace Horford (and frankly he's playing better than Horford did) has been one of the key additions we made this year.   We also got Seth Curry and his super team friendly contract for the eternal letdown JRich, that was a nice win as well. Danny Green has also really been a steadying force.  You're ""95%"" doesn't cover two of our starters and our backup center, sounds like shit math to me."
Seth Curry.
*Seth Curry makes a shot*   ‚ÄúMo Cheeks from DOWNTOWN‚Äù
"Wtf he somehow traded Al Horford for Danny Green, absolutely scammed the Mavs out of Seth Curry, snatched George Hill from the Thunder for 2 second rounders due in like 5 years, scooped the best backup center in the league from the Lakers for like $2 million, had a fantastic draft, has done like 10 other trades/signings to fill out the end of bench depth going into the playoffs, and has additionally managed to do absolutely nothing stupid (which is not a given in this league).  Morey has done an absolutely unbelievable job, dude committed highway robbery like 5 separate times already lmao"
"&gt; It started flickering while Seth Curry was shooting freethrows   Oh god, both Curry brothers fucked by lighting this year. Steph by ""literally"" shooting the lights out of the arena during the 2nd b2b Pels game (after which he went on a cold streak), and now his bro Seth with the flickering shot clock while shooting FTs."
"Obviously it did but trading Horford and J Rich for Seth Curry and Danny Green were huge improvements for our teams composition. Signing Howard (don't remember if Morey was hired before or after that though) sured up the weakest part of our rotation as well. He's really constructed a great team to compliment Ben, Embiid, and Harris (silencing everybody who said they couldn't complete together)"
One of the above-the-basket shot clocks stopped working. Some maintenance person checked it out right before 2nd half started up (when it was noticed) and they decided it would just be easiest and fair to turn off the other one. Then It started flickering while Seth Curry was shooting freethrows and he was like ‚Äúuhhh this is distracting‚Äù but the refs had him shoot both before maintenance came over and turned it off.
Tobias Harris or Sous Seth Curry as FMVP confirmed
"Most 3s on the Mavs in the Luka era have been either self-generated (step-back, pull-up), or catch-and shoot (including catch-sidestep-shoot). Luka also likes to know where players (not immediately involved in screening action) are at all times so he knows where to aim passes without looking (telegraphing) when surrounded by four defenders deep in the paint.  Redick historically thrived off of dribble handoffs, kind of like Duncan Robinson. Seth Curry could do it last year, but it's just not a playtype Mavs have done much. Most of the few DHO plays they've run lately were to set up Luka's drives and shake off defenders -- an easier thing for a big to do, there's a lot more timing involved with a DHO-&gt;3pt shot for a Redick or Robinson and it's something that requires at least a few practice days.  Thanks! Looking forward to see what chaos Beal and Russ can bring to the East!"

"To say someone at age 26 had an 'outlier year' is dumb. Was Kyle Lowry's 2nd year with the Raptors an 'outlier year', or Brandon Ingram's year last year an outlier? How about Julius Randle's year this year? Lastly, Seth Curry year 4 an outlier? Please carry on"
I feel like Seth Curry has been having his best year so far with us.
The #sixers are 15-0 when Seth Curry scores 17+ this season.  https://twitter.com/therealmikekb/status/1393397114294652928
"Are you dumb? Mo Bamba managed to hold Embiid to 13, but even then, the Magic are so bad and they can't handle Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and Shake Milton. Hell they even let Mike Scott get 8 pts.  Why would one mediocre player make a huge difference?"
"This is the core problem with this team.  Luka shoots a higher % on contested shots than his teammates do when open or wide-open.  I'd say he needs someone who can reliably drain shots when there isn't a defender within 10 feet of them, like Seth Curry, but it hurts too much.  edit:  Luka also shoots a higher % on contested shots than he does at the line (in the playoffs), so everyone and even Luka himself would be right there with us pointing that terrible flaw out."
"I watched maybe 100 NBA games this season alone, I think I've seen a carry called twice, and I'm pretty sure both of those were called on Seth Curry."
I didn't even know Seth Curry fans exist
Anyone else thought Rivers and Seth Curry would be out of the league by now but instead they're playing big minutes on playoff teams? Felt like they only got minutes because of their names but now they're legit players
Seth Curry ain't fixing their defense
Are you telling me Richardson isn't as good as Seth Curry?
"I think you can. Kawhi is a good example - yes, he‚Äôs the best offensive player but he‚Äôs the best defender. And I think you can around Ben too. He can lockdown, facilitate, and rebound. You put him with a Brad Beal and another decent wing/stretch 4 and you got something. Hence why a healthy Sixers with Embiid, Tobias(if he shows up), Seth Curry, ?Danny Green, it‚Äôs a problem. I get folks will say Embiid is who they‚Äôve built around but it‚Äôs kinda 1A, 1B-C.  Edit: and yes the fact this dude can‚Äôt hit a 15 foot J is a HUGE problem but what he does off the ball is worth note. Remember how offensively (scoring)limited Magic was? Just saying. Give the kid time."
They just need Seth Curry and DeAndre Jordan.
pretty sure that's not the case this year after losing Seth Curry
"I understand your response, but tbh in all the clippers playoffs runs whenever the game mattered most, 70% of the time he stepped his game up, at the end of the day I didn't guarantee that we will hit the jackpot with him that's my view on the situation as he's way better than Richardson (which by the way he averaged 5 ppg on a 39% fgp and 30% from three in this years playoffs) the man that we traded Seth Fucking Curry for, it's my point of view I can be wrong.   Your comment make sense but still defensively Richardson didn't help much since he's a complete liability on the offensive end."
"You would be surprised. I ran the numbers for the 4 best spot up shooters I could think of Seth Curry, Joe Harris, Marcus Morris and Bryn Forbes and none of them shoot better than 2.37 percent better at home than away."
"&gt; Dallas will keep developing players in Carlisles system and next to the Spurs it‚Äôs about a stable an environment as there is in the NBA  I'm not sure what you meant exactly, but the Dallas FO is much worse than the Spurs FO. Dallas obviously got Luka, but they got rid of Seth Curry. Gave Porzingis 100M contract. Got Josh richardson who sucks. Got JJ who didn't play.   Spurs have been muhc better at finding diamonds in the rough with Keldon, DJM, Derrick white, etc. I'm not sure if Dallas has really been that ""stable"" , but I do agree Carlisle is a great coach"
Honestly think they woulda won with Seth Curry
"You can‚Äôt really blame Nelson (GM) for the roster. He did the right thing and got Luka a second potential All-Star and All-NBA level player on paper in Porzingis, but his health always injured, and he got THJ who was mostly seen as a filler who turned out to be a good starting guard next to Luka or a great 6th man.   He got Dorian Finney on a great contract. His biggest mistake was trading Seth Curry for Richardson who regressed even more. But you can‚Äôt blame him for taking a chance a having a longer plan, because if Richardson returned to his Miami form he would be equally in value as Seth and 3 years younger which sets the Mavs core for a longer period of time.  Also, the Mavs still hope to get someone of All Star potential in the free agency with the potential cap space. I think they have 34 millions.  Here‚Äôs the thing. Even if Porzingis was playing like he was in NY I doubt they could win with this roster this year. They weren‚Äôt a better team than a healthy Lakers team, or the Jazz, or Nets or the 76ers in the East."
"&gt;The Mavs can't run things through Porzingis and Jalen Brunson dropped a stinker in the series, so they really didn't have any other options.  That was supposed to be Josh Richardson. They traded away shooting (Seth Curry) for better playmaking and defense. But then they used him as a spot-up shooter."
They give Spurs example while they had Ginobili/Diaw type of players in their bench.  Doncic is willing to share the ball. Even if we had Seth Curry you‚Äôd see Luka‚Äôs usage to go down easily
I would agree but I didn't think he was happy with Atlanta.  He's exactly what trae needs but for some reason I thought it was a contract year for him. Maybe they max him.  But maybe luka just needs Seth curry and a bogdonavic or two and that'll be the victory.
Bruh what happened to the mavs picks this year. Did they even see the floor. A Canadian bust and a Seth Curry replacement who also didn't contribute
"This season devolved for a myriad of reasons and I think this trade was part of it, but I think the Mavs overachieved last year to even make the playoffs and didn't get heaps better so it makes sense to me that they made the playoffs and saw an early exit. I believe my prediction to myself (and thus, my season expectation/hope) at the beginning of the season was a 6-seed and a first round exit, so they even outperformed that. Contextually, the only team above the Mavs in the West from last season that got visibly worse (to me) from last year were the Rockets (by a lot), Thunder (by a lot), and Clippers (by not so much and in fact this Clippers iteration may be more successful, who knows, NBA is weird) whereas teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Nuggets and Suns got objectively better/healthier.  Mavs didn't do very much to make a leap. It always felt like this was the last season of experimentation to me. Try some lineup/player type combinations and see what sticks. I think we learned a lot. DFS took a huge leap in the 2nd half of the season (but didn't really bring it consistently to the playoffs), it's unclear whether Maxi is finally regressing or just too beaten up to be usable, KP is probably not the second star/unicorn they wanted him to be due to injury or mental stuff, but more visibly, we carried 4 nearly unplayable rookies (I like Josh Green and want to see him develop, but I don't believe he's currently an NBA player) a super narrow Boban, and a Trey Burke all season. You just can't have 5-6 guys on an NBA roster who see  next to no minutes other than garbage time and expect to be a deep playoff contender, y'know? That's possibly a roster management issue and I think Donnie's seat is a little hot (and should be), but mostly it says to me that this team was not constructed with the goal of competing for a title and I think that's fine, not every team should be so long as there's a plan for the future (which I do think there is!).  I always believed that the roadmap looked something like this: Year 1 of Luka was just play with Dirk, have some fun, adjust to the speed of the NBA, get the torch passed, etc. Year 2 was letting Luka be the guy for better or for worse, put the offense in the hands of a kid who can't drink in the US yet and see what you have. Maybe get him a potential partner/2nd option if the deal is right and experiment with that. Probably won't make the playoffs, that's fine, who cares. Start collecting some expirings for the next season or two and point towards a FA year that you think could end up strong. Year 3 is the low playoff seed year (unless you use the offseason pre-Y3 to get a big splashy FA, Dallas didn't) and get some experience under the brightest lights. Year 4 is probably the FA target year. You get 1 more season before Luka's superduperubermax prevents you from affording much and requires strong drafting/scouting, so use it wisely. This FA class could've had Giannis (someone Donnie had been vocal about wanting to draft, but Cuban shut down because he wanted cap space for one last title run with Dirk), could still have Kawhi, Jrue Holiday, Oladipo, etc., that's a pretty reasonable FA class to target in on 2-3 years out. Year 4 would be the opening of the window and for as long as you have Luka + 2nd star, you'll be a top 4 seed in the West (provided no injuries or whatever)   I think the biggest deal people don't realize or sweep under the rug with Seth is that he has some red flags. He's nearly 31, wanted starter minutes (Philly did give him nearly 29 MPG this season compared to Dallas' 24.6 last year, which is effectively what Brunson played this year (25)), but has historically been a pretty underwhelming defender in addition to being a low volume shooter. He only averages about 5 3s attempted per game. He's a flashy scorer (and is a Curry) but he takes pretty ""safe"" shots. We have no idea what he looks like with a higher volume if he say, took THJ amounts of shots, because he's just never really done it for a whole season. His line looks a lot like Jalen and I think we'd just much rather have Jalen who is 6 years younger than Curry and still able to develop.  I also digress. Ultimately, I'm sad right now/today/this week, but I think the truth is the Mavs performed as-expected/as-hoped. There were a lot of downs this season (for us AND everyone else, COVID sucks) but some ups too. This offseason is going to impact the future of this franchise likely more than any offseason outside of 2019 and I have no reason to not be optimistic and will continue to be optimistic until proven otherwise and if that happens, we'll go from there I guess."
"Props to Kawhi for really answering the bell. Luka was the best player in this series, but Kawhi realized the level he needed to get to and did it down the stretch to hold off the Mavs. The Mavs are gonna win a championship within the next 3 years though, count on it. They just need to figure out the right pieces to put around Luka, and imo, they had it in Seth Curry. I think Seth would have been huge for this team. But now it's back to the drawing board. THJ is a great start though. I think both of those guys would have been key to getting it done. I think Luka is gonna come back better than ever next year."
Seems like a mistake to lose Seth Curry
"I feel like that's harsh.   We all thought Dallas fleeced the Knicks for KP, and Tim Hardaway Jr. was thrown in as cap filler and proved to be a super helpful player. Also Finney-Smith and Kleber may not be playmakers, but are both helpful role players on team-friendly deals. Brunson was a 2nd round pick. Dwight Powell had great P&amp;R chemistry with Luka before tearing his achilles.   And yeah, you can't gloss over how great of a trade the Luka trade was.  In my view this pretty much comes down to KP being injury prone and not gelling with Luka. The Seth Curry trade was also a miss, but if anything aimed to satisfy their need of that 2nd ball handler and not just be Luka, KP + shooting.  But that's still an insanely productive last 3 years transitioning out of the Dirk era, especially when compared to a team like the Spurs post Duncan."
"I agree hindsight is 20/20. If I'm the mavs I would take the chance on KP as well, and that has mostly tied their hands. I thought Seth Curry for Richardson was bad when it happened. I could be wrong, but I heard Dallas has been trying to preserve enough room for another max. Outside of KP THJ and previously CLee, their players don't make too much. I think they'd be better off securing a couple more 17M role players than kicking the can and hoping for another max. Im curious to see what/if they pay THJ and Brunson next year.    Now I'm just shooting the shit because i know you meant it more as a lofty hypothetical,  but Hali + Luka would be an amazing combination to watch develop over the years."
Seth Curry in the finals gonna be the GOAT
"Offence was not the problem the mavs had, it was defence. Seth Curry is not a great defender."
"I honestly have not watched Kemba that much to know really.  We pretty much had one of if not the best bench last year. We have gotten rid of 2 playmakers in Barea and Seth Curry and this year the bench has struggled offensively.  Brunson is quite clearly a really good player and it seemed like him being fairly small made the Clippers are really bad matchup for him. Kemba might possibly struggle in similar ways, i don't know.  I agree with you that we need an instant offense guy who can create his own shot. THJ is shooting well and can at least somewhat drive to the bucket on a hard closeout but that's about it.  The roster obviously needs improvement, the FO shot their shot with the Seth Curry for Jason Richardson trade to improve defense and it hasn't worked.   I don't think Donnie is a bad GM like a lot of Mavs fans do right now because I don't believe it's on Donnie that the Mavs can't attract free agents."
Isn't that what they tried to do last year when they traded Seth Curry?
They really traded Seth Curry for nothing.
The only issue is they need work on the roster. KP and some of the role players really let Luka down. Seth curry not on the team also hurt. GM change could be nice like how Phili did but finding a better gm could be hard since you don‚Äôt have someone like Morey on the market
"Was Porzingis really good when he was with the Knicks? I never actually saw him play until he got to the Mavs, and I've always been really unimpressed with him.  Also Dallas really should have kept Seth Curry, I don't know why that dude gets traded every year."
"Kenyon Martin Jr/Sr, Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr, Gary Payton II/Sr, Cole Anthony/Greg Anthony (never realized he was his son until just now), Seth and Steph Curry/Dell Curry, Austin Rivers/Doc Rivers, Glenn Robinson III/Glenn Robinson Jr, Domantas Sabonis/Arvydas Sabonis, Jerami Grant/Harvey Grant (and uncle Horace Grant)...  There's so many more current players whose fathers played but I don't remember watching their fathers... it's crazy..."
"They tried to address that issue when they traded Seth curry for Richardson, hoping that he could be another ball handler. It didn‚Äôt work out but atleast they tried"
On the flip side you guys should never let Seth curry go. The blazers got conned when they let him go and the mavs got double conned by letting him go for Richardson.
seth curry trade :(
‚ÄúI just think they made a bad business decision‚Äù - Seth Curry
"Seth Curry huh, how ironic lol."
That Seth Curry trade was bad...
If only they kept Seth Curry
Seth Curry destroyed the Clippers in his minutes last year.  I honestly think Mavs would have won the series if they had Curry instead of Richardson.
"As a past Mavs bandwagon, I want Seth Curry back"
Someone like seth curry? Lol
The Seth Curry Josh Richardson trade was a tough blow. Hated it then and I hate it even more now.
One of the biggest mistakes this off-season was trading away Seth curry for josh Richardson. Richardson was a complete nonfactor in the playoffs. He was complete trash offensively and defensively
Mavs are close to being a second round team   They just need:  * A second option who can create his own shot (maybe Hardaway Jr grows into this role)  * A rim protector/alley oop partner like Capela  * A reliable sharpshooter like Bogdonovic or Seth Curry   So like.. 2 years?
Mavs FO says that every year then they end up with Josh Richardson (For Seth Curry :( ) and James Johnson
"Last year narrative was but they missed KP, This year narrative is Seth curry lol."
Seth Curry doesn‚Äôt miss fr
They win this with Seth Curry
Yes for Seth curry
Seth curry was great in mavs smh
That Seth Curry Richardson trade was a terrible move
"Quite honestly, Brunson was virtually unplayable this series as well. Seeing him and Trey Burke running around out there instead of Seth Curry pains my soul."
You need such a hard reset. The team is terribly constructed around Luka. Should‚Äôve kept Seth Curry
Why have Seth Curry when you can have 6 minutes of Josh Richardson
Mavs shouldn't have let Seth Curry go
Dorian is pre good. Not great offense but good. Think seth curry trade was a mistake. Whats the point of getting richardson if he barely plays the series. Seth can put up points and isnt THAT bad on d
"Nah I ain't fucking off. Donnie Nelson and the FO have built and embarrasment around Luka. The only guy who did anything was Dodo. Trading Seth Curry for fucking Josh Richardson, giving KP the full max. Rick being alergic to playing Powell, despite playing Boban for heavy minutes. Luka just averaged 36/10/8 for a fucking 7 game series and they lost. This guy deserves 1000x better than what this FO has given him."
Trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson so we have more perimeter defence against teams like the Clippers and then proceed not to play J Rich at all. I mean he‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been playing great lately but surely it‚Äôs better then Trey Burke who‚Äôs done fuck all this season.
"Mavs gotta relax, the team is going to be ok. If KP can stay healthy then I have no doubt he can get back to All Star form, they are a player away regardless‚Ä¶ should have never traded away Seth Curry..,"
"We also gave up 126 points, which was supposedly going to be helped by giving away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson"
Carlisle blew it in game 3 and game 6. But the roster is terrible. Donnie Nelson trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson is one of the biggest head scratchers of this last offseason.
"Offense spacing man   You think Seth Curry and Korkmaz alone is enough of a spacing factor to make an nba offense work?   Tobias/Ben/Embiid all play inside, yes two of them can shoot but they play inside.   You add Thybulle here and this is a recipe for a disaster offense   Green isn‚Äôt anything crazy himself, but it allows for some additional room"
Mavs shot 28% from deep. Really makes you wonder why in the fuck they gave away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson.
Wouldn't it be fucking great if the Mavs had a man named Seth Curry who could nail those open 3s Luka creates?
If only Dallas had a great shooter like Seth Curry
I don't think they understand that forcing a switch means making the defender go over the screen because of a shooting threat + being able to attack off the dribble. Seth Curry is the only dude on the 76ers who could probably force a switch off a PnR but he's also tiny so he's not going to punish Trae.
So why did the Mavs trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson again? Josh barely played.
By attempting to increase defense they ended up decreasing offense. Seth curry would have been a valuable offensive piece this series.
Still don't understand why Mavs traded Seth Curry for Richardson.
Seth Curry shouldve stayed on this mavs team
mavs could really use a seth curry
I miss Seth Curry
And not the ‚Äútrading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson‚Äù type of moves
Seth Curry. Oh wait
Realllllly should have kept seth curry
seth curry and trey burke absolutely sliced clips last year in the bubble
Lowkey Seth Curry for Josh Richardson was a disaster for the Mavs... Dude has played 6 minutes and is scoreless in a fucking Game 7 and clearly isn‚Äôt even good enough on defense to be out there
Dallas really misses seth curry they lost the trade
I miss Seth Curry
This dallas team is useless. Disgusting. Front Office better do something about it. But will it work? Seth Curry was 5/9 from 3 today. Just saying
KP just chilling out there in the 3pt. Zero movement. Seth Curry was way more valuable than this bum
They had Seth Curry then traded him for Josh Richardson. Richardson is hot garbage holy shit he looks bad.
If only they had you know Seth curry or something.
A solid shooter like Seth Curry could help
The Sixers actually fleeced the fuck out of Dallas with the Seth Curry-Josh Richardson trade
I miss Seth Curry.
I mean I said it before the season started but trading Seth Curry which was a steal of a contract for Richardson was a horrific decision.
Start of 3rd quarter:  Clint Capela barrelling into Seth Curry that should've been an offensive foul and his 4th which would've took him out of the game? Then Simmons gets called for 2 soft ones at half court and the sixers had to put Danny Green back on Trae Young.  Refs whistled everything in the 1st half and then decided not to call anything in the 4th quarter.
This series woulda been over if the Mavs had Seth Curry instead of Richardson
How about rich man's Seth Curry
First step is to unsubscribe to r/NBA because you won't learn anything here. You'll start to believe the best player is the one that most recently played and you'll learn about advances metrics that prove that Steve Curr and Seth Curry are the actual best shooters of all time.   Also stay away from sports debate shows.
"I am serious. The 3rd quarter was particularly bad. Simmons called for 2 quick fouls on Trae Young for playing normal defense. Trae pushing off Thybulle, getting called for a foul, being reviewed and upheld was ridiculous. Seth Curry was set under the rim and Capela plowed through him and it wasn‚Äôt an offensive foul lol.   Poorly officiated game. We benefitted in the 4th, but to act like there weren‚Äôt moments the Hawks benefitted is dumb."
If the Mavericks still had Seth Curry this series would already be over. That trade for Richardson was atrocious.
WARDELL SETH CURRY
"Guys, could Seth Curry be related to NBA superstar Steph?"
Seth ‚ÄòSteph‚Äô Curry
I miss Seth curry
Man I miss Seth Curry
Seth Curry literally just falls over any time a player comes near him
Seth Curry falling is the most effective play in basketball
"Jordan vs Curry finals seem good to me   Oh wait, Clarkson and Seth, nvm"
Seth curry is gonna fill the vacancy. MITWestbrook in shambles
he‚Äôs gonna demand tommy to trade for seth curry and then send him to the gulag
Look at Seth curry. Was absolutely fire to start the season got covid and was a shadow of the until like last week
"Sixers fan here, our boy Seth Curry got it and didn‚Äôt return to form til the end of the season. Mike Scott got it too but he was always trash"
Seth Curry is still dealing with long haul after effects.  COVID ain't no game.
Seth Curry was the exact same way
"Seth Curry  But more serious options are Embiid, Donovan Mitchell, Booker, CP, Trae Young"
Bud had those guys out there playing like Seth Curry
Idk if the Nets win this series I can see both Seth Curry and Trae going after Harden as much as possible.
"A late 30s Steph Curry is at worst Seth Curry, which is still pretty damn good."
"Why do people say if a team were built around Ben and put in a Giannis-like role, he would thrive more? Ben this year has a near 50/40/90 shooter in Tobias Harris who can give you 20+ ppg. Seth Curry, an elite 3 point shooter shooting 45 percent from 3. Danny Green, who has revived himself back into a 40+ percent 3 point shooter on over 6 attempts a game. He also has Kormaz and George Hill, who are both near 40 percent 3 point shooters (Hill lead the league last year at 46 percent shooting). You say he needs a stretch 5, but Embiid is one of the best shooting big men in the league, as he is one of the best mid range scorers and shoots 38 percent from 3. Simmons has great shooters all around him. Better than Giannis. But even with an ideal roster built around him, and great shooters all around him , he still can't dominate a game or thrive in a Giannis-like role, because he lacks aggression and he is not skilled enough to consistently score.    The thing is, when Embiid misses long stretches during the regular season, Ben has the opportunity to shine and maximize his offense, but he never does. When Embiid was out for that stretch of games in the regular season, it was Tobias Harris who played out of his mind and mostly carried the 76ers. Ben, more or less, had the same offensive output he has always had."
"At that point all the offense will be on Seth Curry, and you want him fresh for the next round, so they might as well sit him too and let George Hill run the offense"
"He has been a huge disappointment, basically a nonfactor all series except on defense, but even then Trae Young has figured out how to be effective against Ben Simmons already. Defense is important, but having guys on the court who only really bring defense is a huge liability. They looked better with Thybulle + Seth Curry on the court often times."
"1. Philly, for Embiid and Seth Curry 2. Atlanta, dope city and love Trae 3. Utah, for Mitchell and Conley  I do enjoy watching the Suns but can't bring myself to actively root for Chris Paul"
"Blame the GM lol. That other GM, you know the guy who got Trae Young. Seems to know what he's doing  Also Seth Curry prob took too many shots for lukas liking so he traded his ass away lol.  Mavs don't have a first rounder for a while now so that problem isn't going to change all of a sudden. Free agents don't want to come to Dallas and play with luka"
"Lol a word to the wise, quit while you're ahead.  You're in a bit over your head here.    &amp;#x200B;  1.  I bring up Joel's 21 rebounds because you tried to make it seem like he wasn't effective on defense.  He was, to the tune of 21 rebounds, and he altered multiple drives by the Hawks that won't show up in the box score.  The Hawks are the best lob team in the NBA.  If you look at which point guards have passed the most lobs to which big men this season Trae to John Collins and Trae to Clint Capela are both in the top 10.  If embiid was not in the game it would have been lob city in the A last night and the Hawks would have won by more.  Period.   2. The hawks have the leading rebounder in the NBA in Clint Capela, are 14th in offensive rebounds and 6th in defensive rebounds.  But they're not a good rebounding team.  Sure.   3. Saying that a team would play better if their most inefficient offensive player didn't shoot the ball as much is a lazy argument and not actual basketball analysis, hence why I haven't acknowledged it.  You literally would have to assume that other players would pick up the slack when Seth Curry was the only 76er starter that had a good shooting night.   Trae and Bogi combined for like 12/50 last night, maybe if they would have just not taken those shots in the first half the Hawks would have won by 20.  See how dumb this argument is?    &amp;#x200B;  Are we finished here yet?"
Curry's only hit their peak when closing in on 30. Seth Curry unanimous MVP officially in progress
I swear Dallas sent Seth Curry to the east to fuck with us
"Lol how is this downvoted. Luka's shot quality metrics for his teammates are ridiculously high. Seth Curry had a career year with us because Luka increased his shot quality metrics a ton versus Seth's shot quality in Portland, and even versus his prior stint with the Mavs.  Switch Luka and Trae on these two teams and Luka would absolutely sizzle with Collins/Bogi/Gallo/Huerter"
"Because he's suggesting that Luka's stats are ""empty"", meaning he gets a lot of big numbers but doesn't help his team win. Which is completely wrong.  There are many reasons why,but one example is to look at ""shot quality metrics."" These are advanced tracking numbers that look at how ""good"" a shot was, regardless of whether it went in or not. And Luka's teammates have much higher shot quality when he is in the game, compared to when he is not (or compared to when those players are on other teams; Seth Curry for example had far better shot quality with Luka than he did on his previous team)."
"But why don't they attack Seth Curry? Nate McMillan, there is a way to beat the Sixers"
"Because of Luka and the changes to the game itself. Not because of the Mavs' roster. Our record from last year was broken by like six or seven teams this year.  Don't get me wrong, the team plays super hard and some are on real good contracts. And THJ has been better than expected. But we're asking 4th/5th/6th men to play ""up"" a spot. And then there's KP who isn't really a 2nd anyone.  Also, we had Seth curry last year. Our spacing was stupid good. But with him playing next to Luka and KP our defense was even worse than it was this year."
"Seth Curry is currently averaging 33 MPG in this series after you guaranteed he wouldn't hit 20 MPG haha  For you to be right, the series needs to go to seven, and Seth can play at most seven minutes across those three games. Good luck  Charles Barkley level guarantee following some Charles Barkley level analysis"
"I mean, isn‚Äôt Seth Curry like the most efficient 3pt shooter of all-time? Seems like a pretty good guy to take that shot"
TIL Seth Curry lives rent free in some redditor‚Äôs head
My dude. You didn‚Äôt have to waste you time on this lmao.  We‚Äôre fully aware that MITWestbrook is not credible for anything Seth Curry related.
This dude has some serious beef with Seth Curry and nobody knows why
"Seth Curry has been killing us this whole series, his shooting has been absolutely insane"
love it. Let the hate for Seth curry run through you
This dude takes r/nba stupidity to a whole new level every time Seth Curry sets foot on a basketball court
Dude you just need to stop. You have a massive hate boner for Seth and it‚Äôs annoying. Yes Curry is their worst defender and everyone could see that Solo was not playing meaningful minutes. You‚Äôre not some genius savant you‚Äôre just some nephew who still doesn‚Äôt understand bad defenders can be hidden by a good defensive system.
This dude really hates Seth Curry lol
Seth curry dropping 40 next game
Seth Curry is the bane of my existence
"""Oh holy god save us, Curry is wide open behind the arc"" brand crowd energy, available both in classic Steph and low carb Seth"
"This is the first time I'd be happy if either of multiple teams win. CP3, DBook, Ayton, Donovan, Kawhi, PG, Giannis, Jrue, Trae, Embiid, Seth Curry And Harden. It would be fun to see any of them as champions (Kawhi with 3 Finals MVPS would be insane)"
"No matter how the series ends, I never wanna see Tobias Harris and Seth Curry again holy shit."
Because if you even LOOK like you‚Äôre gonna foul you‚Äôre getting Seth Curry jumping into your arms and getting three free throws  Less risky to just play defence
"omg my stomach dropped when curry put up that 3 they gave him wayyy to much space there, really tryna implode in classic hawks fashion.  not today though, seth ain't steph and that ain't it.  let's go hawks woooo! 76rs may be from philly but the hawks exemplify the spirit of the pigeon boys and they brought it to the ring today CAW!!!"
Every team in the NBA makes the same fucking mistake - no idea why. We set ourselves up to get Atlanta Sports'd by Seth Curry
"Trae and Bogdan only shot a combined 17-50, but still outscored Philly's star duo of ~~Embiid and Simmons~~ Tobias Harris and Seth Curry."
that mfer Seth curry is gonna hit a 3 isn't he?
"IDK how you get Seth Curry out of S. Curry. HUGE DIFFERENCE, WAKE UP MAN"
Seth curry a bitch flopper
Flopping fine inc for Seth Curry there? lmao what a joke
Get Seth curry in the game
The Mavs traded Seth Curry and a 2nd round pick away to receive Josh Richardson and the corpse of JJ Reddic. LOL.  Sixers made such a deal there.
Seth Curry is so good. I can‚Äôt believe we got him for Josh Richardson straight up.
Seth curry was goat pickup
What were Mavericks thinking trading Seth Curry?
"Seth Curry, more like Steph Curry"
Why did the Mavs trade Seth Curry?
Seth curry is underrated af
"Seth Curry is just out here saying naw bitch. Every time the Hawks do anything and get the crowd going, Seth says naw."
Seth curry has never missed a shot in his life you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise
seth curry is uglier than trae but people don‚Äôt talk about it enough
"the courtside Hawks fans are embarrassing lmao, yelling at Seth curry"
Trading Seth Curry on that contract was such an idiotic move
Fire Donnie Nelson who traded Seth Curry away
"Just a reminder the Mavs traded Seth Curry, on a top five contract in the league, for Josh Richardson who became unplayable in key moments of the playoffs.   Just an absolutely unholy heist by Morey.   Like it was not even close to an even trade despite how long people pretended it was to be nice."
Pulling for the 76ers to make the finals to keep that James/Curry finals streak alive‚Ä¶ Seth Curry finals MVP ‚Ä¶ calling Vegas now
"Seth Curry, best Curry"
Seth curry is Eli Manning and Steph is Peyton manning
When do we trade Joel to get a better complement for Seth Curry
Seth Curry is the most disrespected player in the NBA by front offices.  Every fan wants him on their team he ends up somewhere for peanuts.
Hawks have no chance if Bogdonavic doesn‚Äôt outplay Seth Curry.
Mavs really traded Seth Curry
SETH CURRY
Traes just been trash since game one. Period. M dude has as many points as SETH Curry. That's a problem. Can't win games when your star player isn't playing like a star in his own fucking arena
For a second there I would have thought he was talking about Seth Curry
That‚Äôs Seth Curry not Steph
Do you mean Seth Curry?
"Welcome to ""Seth Curry and the G Leaguers"""
Is Seth Curry the best contract in the NBA?
How the hell did the Sixers get Seth Curry?
The Seth curry game
"Seth Curry with the shot, boy! 360 wit the wrist, boyyy"
Seth Curry is cooking
Seth Curry cooking them boys
Seth Curry is trying to help us neutrals out at least.
"You‚Äôre not wrong, but Philly fans immediately knew that was a steal and thanked fuck for Morey.  Richardson was not the best defensive wing Seth Curry coulda bought the Mavs, decidedly."
"I realize this is mostly a joke, but the situations aren't even in the same universe. This whole article is being published against the backdrop of Luka literally saying he is going to sign his Rose rule extension, but involves speculation about a rift that ""could"" impact Luka ""in the future."" Worse yet, the article half-heartedly notes that Volugaris' contract is set to expire, a fact buried deep in the piece because it obviously doesn't support the faux-concern this article is meant to drum up.  Not to mention, if you read the description of Voulgaris as the ""shadow GM,"" it doesn't hold up to any scrutiny. The entire thing is primarily based on anecdotes about how Voulgaris pushed for Seth Curry and Delon Wright and two of our draft picks, but Seth and Delon are **not on the Mavs anymore**. Moreover, the article strangely notes that all of the big trades made by the Mavs have been spear-headed by Donnie Nelson and that Voulgaris approved of them, but stops well short of suggesting Nelson needed or required Voulgaris's approval. Altogether, other than complete conjecture, none of the ""facts"" in the article support the notion that Voulgaris served in any capacity other than as our director of analytics, which is a capacity in which it would make sense for him to provide lineup insights to Rick Carlisle. The article goes a long way to twist this into something nefarious, but it makes no sense.   The concerning thing coming out of the article for me has less to do with Luka and more to do with whomever in the Mavs organization so clearly has an axe to grind with Voulgaris and chose to try to make him look bad to Tim Cato. That internal rift is what the Mavs actually need to address."
&gt;and pushed for trades that made the team worse  Which trade is that? Didn't he push for the team to acquire seth curry and then your GM traded him away for josh richardson?
"This is more about his people skills than basketball decisions, seems like his preferred guys like seth curry were pretty good moves for the team"
I got downvoted when I said the jrich was a bad trade when Seth curry did better than him in the previous playoffs. Now their fucked in cap space and trade deals
Whoever was behind the Seth Curry trade needs to bounce. How can you trade a 45% 3 point shooter?
"Dallas announced Voulgaris‚Äô hiring in the fall of 2018 with a title ‚Äî director of quantitative research and development ‚Äî that vastly understated his actual role. Multiple league and team sources tell The Athletic that Voulgaris has been the most influential voice within the Mavericks front office since joining the team, either initiating or approving virtually every transaction made over the past two seasons. Those same sources add that Voulgaris has frequently gone as far as scripting the starting lineups and rotations for longtime head coach Rick Carlisle.  That influence has spanned Doncic‚Äôs three seasons in Dallas. While he had been drafted prior to Voulgaris‚Äô arrival ‚Äî Donnie Nelson, the team‚Äôs longtime president of basketball operations, was the driving force behind trading up to acquire the Slovenian wunderkind, a process he described in detail to The Athletic last year ‚Äî Cuban had sought out Voulgaris‚Äô basketball advice in the years before putting him on the team‚Äôs payroll. As one team source says, ‚ÄúMark Cuban is the most powerful person in the organization, but whoever he‚Äôs listening to is second.‚Äù Cuban was won over by Voulgaris‚Äô vision: an analytics-driven spread pick-and-roll offense with Doncic as the focal point which he has tried implementing in the past seasons.  It‚Äôs unclear when the Cuban and Voulgaris relationship began, but their coming together is perhaps unsurprising given Cuban‚Äôs origin as a self-made tech billionaire whose first major purchase was the Mavericks. Voulgaris has never been shy about his desire to run a team. In an ESPN feature from 2013, Voulgaris is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe whole process (of becoming a highly successful gambler) has led me to believe that I‚Äôd be able to put together a better team than almost any general manager in the league. If not maybe all.‚Äù  The way Voulgaris tells it ‚Äî the ESPN feature is the only notable reporting ever focused on him, and he declined an interview request from The Athletic shortly after being hired ‚Äî he began gambling on the NBA in the late 1990s and had made millions by the early 2000s. His success, he says, came in part from an instinctual reading of certain coaches. It finally failed him during the 2003-04 season, causing him to lose much of his gambling wealth and step away temporarily, only returning once he‚Äôd developed an analytics model that brought back his old edge. He says he did exactly that, his new model beating the odds at a rate higher than five percent. In 2009, he gave up gambling again to consult for an unnamed NBA franchise. The advisory role lasted one season; he returned to his previous life afterward and began publicly promoting himself. In the coming years, he became a well-known presence in the basketball world.  Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team‚Äôs games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team‚Äôs roster grew substantially that offseason. It was Voulgaris who initiated the team‚Äôs acquisitions of Seth Curry and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. ‚ÄúHe was the only person that believed that,‚Äù one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team‚Äôs first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason. He was traded that offseason.  Because Voulgaris‚Äô influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office ‚Äî and executives around the league who interacted with them ‚Äî were often confused about who actually held power. ‚ÄúWe had two general managers,‚Äù a team source says. Nelson remained the team‚Äôs president of basketball operations, a role he has held since 2005, and other executives and agents continued largely communicating with him or Cuban regarding personnel matters. Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J. Redick in 2021. But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions ‚Äî or explicitly approved them."
Championship? Possible unless the Nets get Harden or Kyrie back ASAP. Seth Curry MVP? Maybe in 2K‚Ä¶
"Cam Payne/Seth Curry. On one hand Cam has orchestrated the Suns offense well, scores more than CP3 but he doesn‚Äôt let anything get out of hand. On other hand Seth is averaging 20+ ppg which is insane for a dude we got that didn‚Äôt fit the team."
"Seth curry, Ja morant, ayton"
Seth Curry stole u/MITWestbrook‚Äôs girl
ESPN: Is Seth Curry the better overall player than Steph Curry?
"&gt; I'm a pseudo-Sixer fan now,‚Äù Stephen said, predicting a Philadelphia-Utah Finals, with Philadelphia winning and Seth Curry named Finals MVP.  I too predict Utah to make the Finals."
Seth Curry is an odd choice of players someone could hate
"Seth Curry, he has been elite"
"you barely won by 3 when we didn't have Ben, Tobias, or Seth Curry"
There's still Seth Curry on the Sixers.
Seth Curry is much better than Schroder in today‚Äôs NBA. He‚Äôs a steady shooter and a more dangerous 3rd/4th option who doesn‚Äôt need the ball as much.
seth curry
All this to get swept by Seth Curry. Couldn't be me...
"Giannis, Mitchell, Embiid, KD, and Seth Curry, if you want to punch all of your teammates in the dick, I understand and would join you in spirits."
Greatest pure shooters of all time:  1. Seth Curry 2. Seth Curry's brother
GIANNI$ IS THE GREEK SETH CURRY
replace simmons and gobert with role players like caruso or seth curry and this team will win.
"I love how every Seth Curry post somehow takes a dig or tries to discredit what Steph has done for the sport of basketball. I mean, I love them both and hope they get to be teammates someday. I also think it‚Äôs a travesty that Seth only makes 3mil a year while there are a plethora of less talented players making 20mil+."
"Melo had the best 4th quarter 3pt % in the league - Portland fans like to talk shit about their current players then jerk off to pics of them in 2 years talking about the ""good old days"". We did the same thing to seth curry most of 2019."
"You 76ers fans were literally bitching and whining about Elton Brand not even a year ago because of how crap you guys said their roster was. How incredibly poor said roster was constructed.  Now, the 76ers, because of Seth (not Steph) Curry has this elite roster?  What happened to the ""Elton Brand has provided us a terrible roster and no coach could have done more with this roster"" takes freely flowing from Reddit and 76ers fans by the end of last year?  Funny how that works...  ""Embiid and Simmons have improved a lot."" LOL you say that so ironically. Man I wonder who Embiid and Simmons coach is...  I'll do the math for you: It has been 20 years since the 76ers has had a regular season as good as this one. TWENTY YEARS!!!!  You have to go back to the mid-80s to get a regular season clearly better than this last one. Half of Reddit's parents weren't even born the last time Philly had seasons as good (80s and 70s) as this past season.  But please continue to downplay Doc.   &amp;#x200B;  You get an ""easy"" bracket for having a good regular season...something the 76ers sadly know very little about prior to Doc."
I'd rather have Ben Simmons on the Mavs than Seth Curry.
all I see is Dell Curry when I look at Seth
Seth Curry had an on / off of +29 in the playoffs last year.
Seth Curry
"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna have our fans there and Seth Curry to carry us again, so it‚Äôs gonna be great‚Äù  There, I fixed it for you ben."
"Well the one guy in his lowlights post said it best. He found one stat with a tiny sample size about Seth Curry not being good at guarding isolation, got clowned for it and now is using bias and what not to try to prove Seth is the worst defender of all time. He said this:  &gt;Seth has never blocked a 3 point shot in his life due to his short short wing span. NBA should consider all 3s wide open when Seth Curry defends it.  Which is like, stupid as fuck to say. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the vast majority of NBA players haven‚Äôt blocked a three point shot in their career. You don‚Äôt need go-go gadget Chris Boucher. It‚Äôs about getting a hand in the face, getting your body in there, making it awkward for the shooter. He‚Äôs using 3 point blocks to quantify defense. Seth is like, not even as bad as most point guards are defensively."
Man hating Seth Curry is such a weird hill to embarrass yourself on. Just give it up.
so seth curry
"What a dumb statement after curry is having the best series of his career and multiple times has had the best games of his career, the dude averaged 13 points in the regular season and you're telling me doc isn't the one leading him towards this? This is a build up over the entire season of docs coaching towards Seth, changing the role he's used to and forcing him to take harder shots.    Seth Curry isn't an example of bad coaching if anything it's good coaching.  Dwight on the other hand getting 10+ minutes every game and consistently being the biggest negative on the team is a little repulsive though."
Don't you have Tobias (who has been great all series) and Seth (the better Curry)?
&gt;Rivers can‚Äôt magically find shot creators at this point in the season.  Idk that Seth Curry guy seems really good at getting shots. Maybe Doc could try drawing up an offense and running some plays. I think thats called coaching
"Max contract player putting up 6 points in an elimination game, having to be taken out and replaced by a 20 year old rookie because he's literally unplayable at the end of close playoff games. He's getting payed 30 million this year to run dribble hand offs with Seth Curry and not even touch the ball because of his poor free throw shooting. ""Why is he getting criticism"""
"I was making a comparison with seth and steph's defense, but yeah. Steph has good help defense and I actually would argue that he's a more than average defender. Same goes for Seth, though. MITWestbrook complained about Seth's defense but Seth picking Trae's pockets actually gave them enough space to win the game handily.   People keep talking about the Curry bros' defense as if they're Luke Kennard levels but that's just disingenuous. You're forgetting Steph was a STL leader for the 2015-2016 season."
Seth Curry won them the game
Ben Simmons as Rondo.   Seth Curry as Ray Allen.   Tobias Harris as Paul Pierce.    Joel Embid as Kevin Garnett.   And Doc Rivers as Doc Rivers???   It's a wrap boys
seth curry &gt; westbrook in the playoffs
Seth curry is carrying this team
"he needs a good offseason which it doesnt seem like hes going to get with the season starting again in like 90 days.  He was a sniper last year, he was our seth curry last year on a team with no one that could shoot.  He bulked up some and his shot changed a bit so he needs to adjust now."
"Seth Curry has been one of the most underrated players in the league for a while. He is literally always such an asset to every team he is on. I miss him on the blazers, he made our bench actually good for once"
Sounds exactly like Steph Curry before his max deal. He signed a super cheap contract due to his constant ankle injury. Hopefully Seth will get a nice payday after this
Even SETH Curry is the favorite there.
Seth Curry has played at an allstar level and Maxey is a solid contributor.  That's a big difference from last time through.
Sixers have Seth Curry. What the Sixers need is a PG. Ben is a PF.
"Me too man. It is like if you criticize defensive specialists like Gobert or Simmons and explain why they won't beat a high powered offense, you get mass downvoted and the analytical nerds pull out their stats and explain to you why you are wrong. Okay, that's cool what they can do in the regular season, but what about the playoffs when defenses tighten up, scoring becomes much harder to do, and offense is even at a higher premium now? Suddenly your defensive specialists who can't shoot, space the floor, or quite frankly score at all, are gameplanned against and you are much easier to defend to the other team. They can essentially do 4 vs 5 on you every time down the floor. Having that extra man on the court who can at least make a defense respect your scoring, is huge. Look at Seth Curry for example. A pretty bad defender, but he has been way more valuable for the 76ers than Ben in the Hawks series. Is that acceptable for your max contract all star, to be outplayed by a spot up shooting role player making 8 million a year?   Also, Gobert has been schemed against multiple playoff series. The Rockets did the same exact thing to him 2 years in a row to counter Gobert's paint defense. They surrounded Harden and CP3 with shooters, and Gobert's defense was countered by the small ball Rockets. It is no surprise the Clippers were able to pull this same strategy off."
Seth Curry has taken Ben Simmons spot in the Philly big 3
seth curry best shooter of all time
Bro he got Seth curry for 8m a year for 3 years for an expiring j rich and 36th pick looool  And he moved Horford for only one first round pick
"I legitimately don't understand people who hate Seth. He's the epitome of someone who wasn't gifted physically but worked his ass off for years just to be able to stand with these guys. He should be r/nba's poster boy.    Dude went undrafted, killed himself playing G-league, played almost 0 minutes on the Suns and Cavs, finally got the chance to play on the Kings, went to Dallas, got injured a whole year, only to show up for the Blazers in the playoffs, returned to Dallas only to be traded, and then became a certified starter for the Sixers. My guy went to hell and back just to be in the same conversation as his superstar older brother.   Y'all could hate on guys like Ben Simmons who had all the physical gifts but not the inclination to get better. But not this guy.   Also, Seth has just as much defense as Steph and yet no one complains about Steph's defense. Wanting defense instead of offense will get you trading Richardson for Curry and those guys are now out of jobs."
thank god for seth curry
Seth-en Curry.
 Might take away from all this is how great a player Seth Curry has turned into
"Seth Curry just keeps getting better. Mad respect to him. What a series so far tho, let's see if the Sixers can manage to not choke Game 7"
"Who would have thought it would have been Pat ""Seth Curry"" Bev to close it out."
Not as bad but Seth curry this series averaging 23 on 60% from three on like 8 attempts a game
I think at this point everybody is aware that he's an idiot who just hates Seth Curry for some weird reason. There's only a few delusional people who think he's smart solely because he makes posts with a lot of words and numbers that nobody actually reads.
&gt; 76ers 2021: we are shit cause we have our second best player in the playoffs.  Are we watching the same series? Seth Curry popping off
"So has Seth Curry always been this good, or has he just had a breakout series. This is insane the dude doesn‚Äôt miss!"
All the big names came out like Tyrese Maxey and Seth ‚Äúliterally Steph‚Äù Curry
Seth Curry? Maybe.
Simmons had a couple nice passes to Seth Curry.
"Big 3.  Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry."
Seth curry has been so important
"You need playmakers, mate. Look at the Mavericks, who had Luka and a bounty of shooters, but they fell apart late when Luka inevitably tired and no one else was able to create. Hell, look at your own Sixers, who count on Joel to create and when he's exhausted, you're left with Seth Curry heroics. When Joel's exhausted and trying to post up for the fiftieth time this game late in the fourth quarter, you think Joel'd rather have yet another shooter to stand around in the corner and hope his man leaves him, or you think Joel'd rather have a playmaker drive the ball and force rotations to make something happen?"
Yeah that's the progression isnt it.  Crazy reading it laid out like that but you're 100% right.  Seth Curry is 100% certified process
"Well yeah, that‚Äôs a better option.   Interesting trade for both sides:   Simmons and Seth Curry for CJ and RoCo"
People are forgetting when Simmons was hurt when Philly was playing Boston and it was Embiid all by himself. Except the other 76ers couldn‚Äôt dribble the ball or throw a good pass into the post to Embiid. That was disgusting to watch. I guess Seth Curry and Maxey help but people are forgetting how much Simmons matters to Philly.
"Seth Curry, AKA the Sixers' second-best player"
"I watched the game. All I saw from the Sixers were the rookie, Seth Curry, Harris, and Simmons benched."
"Seth ""Steph"" Curry"
Philly closing it out.   Trae going off for 5 3s and 35+  Embiid 30+   Seth curry 25+   Easy parlay right there
"I don‚Äôt think Atlanta shoots that poorly from the line again. Also the Sixers went 7/11 from 3 again and Curry once again had an insane game, he‚Äôs gotta crash sometime soon and cold Seth is basically unplayable  However I still am picking the higher rated team at home so Philly"
Seth CURRY-ING the sixers to the win
"I mean Robert Covington and Dario Saric turned into Jimmy Butler turned into Josh Richardson turned into Seth Curry, so maybe Seth Curry was the final stage of the process all along"
It‚Äôs amazing that Seth Curry playing like a max player is what‚Äôs saving their season.
"Can't imagine anyone enjoyed this game besides 76er fans.  For neutrals, just low level of basketball you wouldn't expect from a series with a 1 seed pushed to the brink, in game 6 of a second round playoff series. Who even played well? Not even great, just decent? Just Trae and Seth, and even Trae was 13-30.  For Hawks fans obviously this game sucked, watching the game flop in a home closeout game. Collins was utterly invisible outside of the dunk, the shooters didn't show up, although Galo made some later and Huerter wasn't awful.  Just a pretty garbage game. No flow, no good basketball, ends with a free throw parade. Bleh.  Also, it's continually amazing me to me to see Seth Curry dominate with efficiency when you realize the Mavs traded him for someone that couldn't even get minutes."
Seth ‚ÄúSteph‚Äù Curry
Where‚Äôs that massive Seth Curry hater at tonight?  Dudes averaging 21.8 on 61.5 FG% and 59.3% from 3
Seth ‚ÄúSteph Curry‚Äù Curry
Mavs should get Seth Curry and JJ Reddick.
"""The Hawks should attack Seth Curry""  Meanwhile the dude had the clutchest defensive play of the game stripping Trae with a minute left"
"Seth Curry is unreal man, always show up when the team needs him the most!"
they are shit cause they have Seth Curry playing?
Seth Curry &gt; Ben Simmons lol
Seth Curry is the 76ers saviour.
Seth Curry is criminally underpaid and I‚Äôll trade Ben for a bag of chips
I can't believe Seth Curry is making 8 million per year for the next two years.
Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry saved The Process
"my dad is impressed with himself and wants me to share with y‚Äôall his new nickname for seth curry:   Bowfinger.   it‚Äôs a reference to the steve martin movie where eddie murphy has a less famous brother ‚Äî aka seth in relation to steph.   also, seth shoots deadly 3pt shots like a bow &amp; arrow except he does it with his fingers!   BOWFINGER   fucking genius."
This game had everything. Blown leads. Hot and cold streaks. Fights. Logo shots. Crazy posterizers and blocks. A blackout. Trae young. Tyrese Maxey. Seth Curry.   Now onto Game 7
who knew seth curry was the sixers second best player
Sheesh  Edit: the 6ers are so lucky they lucked into Morey retooling their roster masterfully to have them in a place where they can still contend with guys like Seth Curry getting buckets when Simmons fucking blows for an *entire* series
Seth Curry shoots like 88% at the line why do we not have him do this
"My company https://assfordoge.com - almost got Seth Curry to be our spokesperson when he was in Dallas, dude was just happy to get any endorsements. Now the dude is actually wanting compensation"
"Seth Curry, not only the best player in the KP trade but the best ball handler on the Sixers lol"
"Seth Curry is really creating a legacy in these playoffs, unreal stats"
Seth Curry is the third best player in the series...
Seth Curry is better than Ben Simmons
"The lights really must hate the Curry family, first Steph against the Pels and now Seth against the Hawks"
That‚Äôs not an offensive foul lmao. And Collins pushed him first. And he tried to kill Seth Curry. Fuck him
That was a basketball play. No fouls we just go again from the seth curry shot.
Seth Curry has saved Doc‚Äôs career tonight if they hold on. two back to back meltdowns with championship level teams would have seen him out the league.
Seth Curry looks like he just woke up and started balling.
Why was Seth Curry out so long?
Why is Seth Curry on the bench right now?!
Look at Doc! Seth Curry is benched right now he cant save you
Seth Curry is very good at basketball
"Simply put.. if we stop Seth Curry we win this game. Never though I'd say that, but there we are."
All I can say is. Seth curry for SURE loves his wife. Cause wow he‚Äôs doing his fking best for his father in law. Like REALLY trying. Jfc Ben Simmons looks like a black hole this 2nd half on offense tho
Somehow = Seth Curry
Why is Seth curry doing this
"The sixers are full of fake tough guys, but it's hard to dislike Seth curry, dude is good wish he played for us"
Is Seth Curry the best basketball player in the family? People are asking.
Dort is on a UDFA rookie contract btw   to answer the question probably Seth Curry or Lavine or Rozier
"Nah, its not ben. Ben could have played better, but it's not on ben. You should be able to beat the atlanta hawks when your second best player who's not even known as a scorer is playing terrible.  This isn't the milwaukee bucks or Brooklyn Nets. Philly is not playing Kawhi's raptors. They're playing the atlanta hawks. Even if ben sat out the whole series, they would have been favored to beat them in 4 or 5 games.  They almost did that. Those blown leads and the lineups in game 7 cost them that opportunity.  Me putting the blame on ben for the collapse is like me putting the blame on seth curry because he can't guard huerter. It's a half ass analogy, but what I'm saying is that They had opportunities to win the game and I don't feel the coach maximize those opportunities even with the poor play from simmons. Lue sat kyrie and kevin love to win a playoff game. Doc can't do that to not blow two massive leads?"
"Doc is a terrible coach. He's had so many great players, hof players and he's won once, and made 2 finals appearances, while the celtics made multiple conf finals when he left, only to be really stopped by lebron during doc's clipper tenure.   Brett Brown lost to kawhi leonard on a basket with 04.2 to go. Doc Rivers lost to kevin huerter bulling seth curry in the post in game 7.  Who's really responsible for the collapse? it's doc. Think about it the 26pt lead. Does that happen without hack a ben? How is atlanta going to generate 27 points without fouling a terrible FT shooter to come back in the game. You mean you couldn't keep ben out for that amount of time?  Come on man. I've seen the doc story way too much. He made Kawhi Leonard look like tony snell in game 7 and had him guarding Jokic because he refused to take out montrezl harrell who was a -61 for the entire playoff run. Jokic even said it himself that Zubac is a tough defender after the series.   Doc didn't play zu in second halfs of the game, pretty much all year.   When Ben Simmons gets traded and he will and Doc messes up again, you'll see doc is a bigger issue to worry about then ben simmons. Ben simmons just has a shit contract, that's really all. He's a decent player, just not a max or big contract player."
"Morey did some magic with the roster he had, he damn near even got them Harden if not for fertita's grudge.   I wholeheartedly believed the sixers were done, imagine digging out of maxing both Harford and Harris and not having good shooters.   Not only did he get rid of Al, he also got Curry and Green uuh Seth and Danny, obviously lol"
Seth Curry has a great contract for what he brings.
what do you he'd be able to cover for Seth Curry defensively? that's what simmons did all series
Steph with Seth off the bench is Curry 2x as spicy.
How much of that was even Doc vs replacing Horford &amp; Josh Richardson with Danny Green &amp; Seth Curry and having pieces around Tobias that actually made sense?
"I'm just saying hed be able to cover for Seth Curry defensively and he wouldn't be a liability on offense. he isn't as good as Ben Simmons in a vacuum. he's a better fit on some teams, though. I would love nothing more than to trade DeRozan for Ben, honestly, more than DJ. it helps both teams. if I'm the Sixers, I demand Derrick White before anyone else on our team."
"As a rookie it was just Simmons and Embiid and a bunch of spot up shooters. Since then he's played with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, even Josh Richardson and Seth Curry don't need to just sit on the 3 point line to score points."
How's Morey to blame? He pulled 2 rabbits out of a hat to move Horford and get Seth curry.  He was given an awful deck and made em decent. Ya he could have moved Simmons but was probably hoping to get Dame or Beal this off season. Couldn't have foreseen Simmons completely tanking his value
Joel showed the hell up. Having Lowry to space the floor and let Embiid dominate inside even more would really have wrecked whatever the Hawks wanted to do defensively. Especially with how great Seth Curry and Tobias Harris (minus game 5 and 7)
You say that as if Seth Curry is a good defender
You say that as if Huerter didn't make bucket after bucket on Seth Curry in a game 7
"Joel embiid, Seth Curry , thybulle, maxey, korkmaz  yeah that's cool the problem is you got Max trash brother twins on the salary cap"
Seth Curry
Value for points/spacing: Seth curry at about 8 million a year.  Value for attention/recognition: Lebron at 38 million.  Value for not contributing and being a black hole contract(aka Eddie curry award): Kevin love at 30 million.
"Seth Curry 2 yr, 16.6m  Jaylen Brown 3 yr, 80m"
And the Seth curry trade being great. That‚Äôs about it lol
"Also, Huerter was abusing Seth Curry in the 4th quarter, which really killed the 76ers lineups. They needed Seth for offense, but every time they put him Huerter just destroyed him. That match up was kind of the key to the game, with Trae having a bad shooting night. He was also cooking Korkmaz earlier in the game.  Also, he nailed his 3 free throws and iced the game.  Gallo is a great player, we expect him to be great. Nobody expected Huerter to be the key to game 7."
A 40 year old Lowry wouldn‚Äôt even be better than Seth Curry
I mean he got Dwight and Seth Curry  who were good good contributors this season.  Him giving Simmons-Embiid a year to see if it can really work or not doesn't mean he's washed.
"He was good against the 8th seed, bad against Atlanta. Man got outplayed by Seth Curry"
"I mean all he needs is to be the 1 on offense surrounded by 3 shooters and a rim running big and then he should play the 3 or 4 on defense. Imagine a lineup of Seth Curry, THJ, Lauri Markenenan and maybe someone like Rob Williams or another lob threat big."
"Sure, sometimes players get hot  He‚Äôs Seth Curry"
"Who do they even have on their roster at this point?   DM;DR is on the wrong side of 30 and still hasn't developed a 3pt shot himself, nor does he play much defense.   He does have a great mid-range game, so that would be a bit better than what Ben offers offensively, but the Sixers are likely better off with Seth Curry than DM;DR.   Philly would need a point guard in a Simmons trade. I mean.... I supposed DM;DR could play point. That was essentially his role with the Spurs (he did lead them in assists). He could share the backcourt with Seth?   Dejounte Murray is the better defender.  I'm not sure what Pop would even do with Simmons, other than maybe just put him at power forward, which is where he should be."
"Jamal Murray   MPJ  Bogdan   OG  Simmons  Bench- Seth Curry, Smart, and Christian Wood"
"Hasn't that sentiment turned out to be exactly true? I think we can be absolutely positive that Gobert isn't as good in the playoffs as he is in the regular season, and we just arguing to what degree.   And, we are also absolutely positive that Embiid and Simmons doesnt work in the playoffs despite all the regular season net rating numbers etc that says it does.  The only kinda playoffs are different ""hot take"" that hasn't be bourn out is Trea will get picked on. But, the Knicks and Sixers didn't have the personal to do it. I mean, the Hawks were playing Lou will and Trea at the same time and the Sixers couldn't do anything about it while Kevin Huerter played Seth Curry off the court at various points.  Obviously, Trea will never get played off the court, he's a fantastic offensive player. But, we haven't see what it looks like when an elite permitter player targets him the way other weak links like MPJ get picked on."
"Disagree, noone has ever suggested Ben is a headcase that would be afraid to dunk on Seth Curry. This is different for me because personally I think sixers easily win that series if Ben plays like his usual self."
"People have to look at this situation from both sides I think, Ben Simmons, even though he has never been a shooter, has been effective on both ends of the court simply because he is a presence and he makes his teammates better. He hasn't lost his athleticism, he wasn't injured or anything, come playoff time something got to his head more so than usual. Last year in the bubble they got swept by the Celtics without Ben Simmons, they year before that they were very competitive vs the champions, Raptors. You don't regress from 14-7-6 playoff average alongside Jimmy Butler to below 10 average vs the Hawks in the span of 2 years. More than Ben Simmons, I think Doc Rivers approached this team totally wrong and made massive mistakes in team lineups and rotation. Seth Curry was guarding Huerter for almost all of game 7, who is 5 inches shorter instead of Thybulle or Korkmaz, who was a starter in the series but didn't play more than 20 minutes. They also had no solid gameplan other than giving Embiid the ball wherever he was on the floor, and expecting him to drive to the rim, leading to turnovers. He is talented, sure, but he is not Giannis. Play him closer to the post, put Curry-Korkmaz in the perimeter, with Harris as a midrange threat they would have won this series 4-2. Apparantly this was too hard for Doc Rivers to notice."
"People just vastly underestimate the importance of playmaking in basketball. Imagine Wiggins, Seth Curry, Tobias and Embiid. Thats disgusting"
"Lakers take him and make him their center:  LeBron, Seth Curry, KCP, AD, Simmons"
"Tobias was 8/24, Embiid had 8 turnovers, Seth Curry got bullied on defense giving up 27 to kevin huerter (by the way ive said huerter was gonna be a beast for a few years now because he cooked us way back then, of course he had to prove me right at the worst time). People are shitting on ben for what he didnt do, he was +1 in game 7 and Embiid was -6, Tobias I think was -4. I know its single game +/- but it still means something"
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Seth Curry F: Danny Green F: Tobias Harris C: Dwight Howard
"Literally just get 4 elite shooters and let ben go 1 on 1. People will see what ben is capable of when he doesnt get doubled every drive. His shooters now are decent but theyre not elite shooters, its still not worth letting ben dribble 1 on 1. He also needs a shot creating pg thats good at playmaking too. If hes in the dunker spot or setting screens he can score but he needs better playmakers than seth curry, tobias and embiid"
"That's being incredibly reductionist. Using this same logic Giannis is a bad player.  The problem for Simmons and the Sixers is that he's a poor fit with Embiid, not that he's bad. To make the most of either one of Embiid and Simmons you want to surround them with 4 shooters, but the Sixers keep going out and getting the most talented player available, fit be damned. Seth Curry and Danny Green are like their only free agent signing that actually fit either of their stars in recent memory.  At this point unless Simmons makes an incredible improvement this off season (unlikely considering his lack of development so far) they need to move him for someone who can actually make Embiid's job easier before Embiid decides he's sick of this shit and wants out, but again that does not make Ben a bad player."
I meant like a Seth Curry (sigh) type elite shooter.
Seth Curry balling out just makes me more angry at kawhi. The Lakers would have signed Curry if kawhi had made his decision in a timely fashion. Instead he kept us waiting and Curry took the deal from Dallas cuz he had never gotten a big payday and he didn't wanna risk losing the offer. Imagine if the Lakers had this dude playing alongside LeBron and AD üò©
"Unless you have Seth lead the bench unit and get a bit more playing time for Thybulle. Not saying you‚Äôre wrong, but it feels like a tough position to improve; there aren‚Äôt exactly a ton of candidates who space the floor like Curry and play elite D."
Trae didn't have to defend much at all. Our offense is shit at exploiting matchups. He followed Korkmaz or Thybulle around so he wouldn't have to do much and could focus on offense.   Compare that to how much defending Seth Curry had to do
"Maybe the issue is the sixers are using him as one of their main offensive guys when he needs to be like a 4th option on offense and be on the court mainly for defense.   Like the sixers have embiid who is an obvious big talent and then they have seth curry and Tobias harris as their only other really scoring options which, let‚Äôs be real, aren‚Äôt the best options for your 2 and 3 scoring guys.   Embiid needs someone that‚Äôs on his level offensively. Maybe seth curry will be there next year but they need a huge rework. It‚Äôs obvious how much they need embiid to bail them out on possessions. It just isn‚Äôt sustainable for four quarters. Sure isn‚Äôt sustainable over a 7 game series. You can forget about making a finals run with that kind of game plane."
"$8m is a great value contract for someone who shoots a 40+% clip from 3 on pretty high volume, 76ers really shouldn't be entertaining offers for Seth Curry unless some team is desperate to overpay for him"
Seth Curry to Memphis for De‚ÄôAnthony Melton
"If/when Porzingis, DFS, THJ, Brunson, and Kleber move on to different teams, most of them will be seen as better players then they are now and have a better perception. Similar to Seth Curry."
"I get why people are saying this, but imagine playing CJ next to Seth Curry. Literally zero perimeter defense between them.  Simmons+Maxey+1sts for Dame tho... assuming Portland is willing to ship him off."

Prob gonna just trade seth curry for another wing or backup big. Hopefully a decent role player.
"OK BRACE YOURSELVES FOR THIS ONE  Demar + for Simmons, whatever prospect + salary package for Lowry, Demar and Lowry reunite and win a ring with Embiid and Seth Curry in Philly.   How high am I right now."
Yeah but everybody has strengths and weaknesses. Would you ask Shaq to defend Seth Curry on the outside? Gobert is good when he's utilised correctly and the coaching staff should've done better in that. Probably should've removed him outright once they saw how the clippers exploited the defense. So yeah I also blame the coaching on that one.
At least Kuz chucks threes like he's Seth Curry.
"They had Seth Curry shooting 60% from deep, but hey good luck!"
"Because the younger brother of the guy who is the greatest shooter ever and the son of an NBA sharpshooter also being a crazy level shooter means that Trae is terrible on defense. It doesn't mean that Seth Curry is just a great shooter and the Sixers offense was generating open shots for him regardless of Trae, Huerter, Bogdan, or Lou Will being on him so he was making them"
Because we think it‚Äôs bad but more so it‚Äôs awkward given how close it is. His coach was the father of the woman he cheated on and Seth Curry is their current husband. It‚Äôs just odd.
"I think Doc Rivers' comments were more or less to save his own job.  Players have bad games and bad series.  Doc Rivers made a point to continually take Ben Simmons in and out of the game because of fear of him being a liability.  That straight up tells Simmons, 'you're a liability and I cant trust you to help our team win.'  In doing this, Doc further diminishes his number 2 players aggressiveness and confidence.  Simmons could have continued crashing the boards, pushing the pace, and running at the rim.  Defenses would have continued to converge on Simmons and he could give up lobs to Embiid or kick out to Seth curry or whatever.  Doc also made a lot of late game decisions to run Embiid in isolation FROM THE 3 POINT LINE.  Embiid is good, but hes also big and slow.  If he's starting his post up from the 3 point line, hes going to pull the double before he gets into the paint.  A good play would be have simmons carry up the ball, have embiid in the mid post.  Curry sets a screen for Simmons and Simmons cuts to the basket and curry rolls for an open 3.  the cutting simmons now has options to take it to the cup himself...if he pulls a double, embiid can set up for a lob, end if its clogged, dish it to curry because hes wide open.  Obviously you cant rinse and repeat that one play over and over, but the point Im making here is that its not isolation ball over and over and over again.  As good as Embiid is, he's not going to win the games by himself, he needs help.  They need to move the ball and take open looks and not force it.  Doc Rivers failed the 76ers and completely diminished Ben Simmons career in the process."
"We need Seth Curry. Small, nimble, *cheap* , shooter to balance out the team of bigs we have."
and JJ Redick. the team the Raptors had to get past was much stronger than this current 76ers team... they were much scarier in crunch time because they had multiple scorers   they're very fortunate Seth Curry is much more talented than his MLE contract signifies
Imagine 76ers trading Simmons to have a backcourt of CJ plus Seth curry? Yeah me neither
You need to understand that playing simmons makes you 4 v 5 in offense. The hawks completely ignored him. You cant do that with wiggins. Wiggins can score 40 pts if he wants to and play an all star level defense against great wings. You need to understand the situation. Simmons on offense will force teams to double on embiid and you are forced to play woth seth curry which in turn will get abuse in the defensive side‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt think morey is overhyped. He‚Äôs the one that brought seth curry and Danny green if I recall correctly.  Philly easily has the worst early exit though
"Honestly I find this whole narrative that this was all Ben's fault kind of gross.  The narrative should be that a team that match the 76ers in win percentage post All star break proved they were just as good as a 1 seed.   The hawks won game 5 &amp; 7 b\\c Seth Curry was a match up they hunted for.  The Hawks won b\\c Joel had 8 turnovers in game 7. The Hawks won b\\c Tobias Harris is a volume shooter and for most of the series was having an abysmal time finding the net. The Hawks won b\\c Docs line ups were really bad. Doc killed his floor spacing having Ben and Dwight out on the floor at the same time. No one should be counting on Ben to win a game. His role is similar to Draymond's right now. We don't count on Draymond to win the game for Golden State, so why do we expect Ben to blow up the scoreboard?  Anyways Rant over."
"CJ is like a really souped up version of Seth Curry, it's a similar archetype and I agree, I don't think it's a great fit for the Sixers aside from the shot creation. Also, if Embiid is in his prime, CJ has shat the bad on a lot of big games. Lowry did earlier in his career to some extent, but I think he was more than proven he shows up."
"Them Lightskins gotta stick together. I‚Äôll be awaiting the Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and George Hill statements defending Simmons shortly."
Remember when Mavs went from Seth Curry to Josh Richardson and we thought we got a lot better?   I try not to :(
Seth curry üòÇ
Seth curry
"Dude wanted to be the one in control. You know the one who brings it up, passes it to seth curry at the logo, then screens, goes in the paint and does nothing."
"Kevin Huerter roasted Seth Curry.  Repeatedly.  But Seth hit a couple of threes, so it doesnt matter at all."
"They were worse because they were surrounded by josh richardson and Al horford. Now they are surrounded by Seth curry and Danny green, both high volume 40 percent 3 point shooters."
"I mean, beal would be more consistently great than curry. Dropping 30 would be a fantastic game from seth, but par for the course from beal. Obviously lowry would still be a big pickup, and i don‚Äôt think beal is on the market anyways. I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre that close as individual players"
"Maybe, but how much more does Beal give you than what Curry gave them in this series. I know Beal's better than Seth, but Seth was a beast this series for the most part for the Sixers, and all you're really doing is transferring that scoring to another player that might be a bit more efficient this series, and then *maybe* you beat the fifth seed Hawks. Big deal. Let's not pretend beating the Hawks was Philly's goal this year. The fact that they lost is embarrassing, but even scraping a win probably doesn't change shit for them in the big picture. They literally have no one doing what Lowry would have provided them, so his impact to the Sixers would be ***way*** bigger to their team than Bradley Beal. Beal is a great name brand player to throw in there, but what does he really change for that team? Their gaping flaws still exist. Beal's a fantastic scorer, but he isn't what they need to really contend. Maybe I'm biased."
"Daryl Morey has also been shit since 2019. He gave a massive overpay for Russ,Traded Capela and a draft pick for Covington then in Philly the Seth Curry trade was good but he ultimately was not willing to give up the Farm for Harden and then decided George Hill was the better option than Kyle Lowry"
"CJ is better than Seth, put the lesser Curry back on the bench"
"Dude the last time I saw a pro athlete look as dejected and totally lost was when Rick Ankiel couldn‚Äôt throw the ball over the plate and got converted to an outfielder. Simmons‚Äô value is at an all time low and it‚Äôs plainly obvious his teammates and coach have given up on him. He‚Äôs a lock to be traded this off-season and everyone knows it, meaning nobody will jump to give up real assets for him. You‚Äôre gonna get a contract swap, and you MIGHT get a pick if you throw in Seth Curry back."
I‚Äôll go against the grain.  They shouldn‚Äôt trade him.  More like they can‚Äôt trade him.  The only way they contend is if they get a top 10-15 player in return.  Everyone likes to say CJ McCollum but they aren‚Äôt going to win with him.  He‚Äôs just basically a slightly better Seth Curry.  Maybe a Beal sign and trade?  No idea what amount of assets the Sixers would have to package to entice Washington if Beal even agrees to do a sign and trade
"ya ur right trade rumors are mentioning CJ so that must be the ONLY viable candidate right? You sound stupid man come on literally read what you just said and its ""obvious"" i implied CJ? You literally are just assuming so much from what you read on r/nba lmfao.  Go look last year how many ""rumors"" saw us getting danny green, dwight, and seth curry.  Also wait since when the fuck is CJ a point guard?"
"Fuck that. Ben has had 4 years to work on his game, and has objectively gotten worse. This wasn‚Äôt one bad game on offense for him. It‚Äôs a culmination of years of fans, analysts, even other players screaming at him to shoot the ball.    I can tell Embiid works on his game. He‚Äôs gotten better every year even dealing with a ton of injuries. I can tell Seth Curry works on his game. I can even tell Tobias works on his game, love him or hate him he‚Äôs an elite 3rd option on a championship team. But when your 2nd option takes 3 shots in 7 4th quarters of the playoffs, you get the blame.   I don‚Äôt want to hear about Coach, or Embiid, or Tobi, or anyone. This series is about Ben Simmons caring only about going out to LA, dating Kardashians, making 25 second instagram clips then going to play Fortnite or whatever. He has no heart, no desire to win, get him out of this city."
He's a great cuddle buddy says Seth Curry
Seth Curry balling out too on that bargain contract
"Nah we got Seth Curry for Butler.   S&amp;Td Butler for JRich, traded JRich for Curry."
"CJ McCollum is a low iq guard who can‚Äôt defend. The CJ for Simmons rumors need to die, as currently constructed the Seth curry + CJ backcourt would  be hilariously bad"
"Yes, yes...I am the idiot for thinking Seth Curry and Danny Green (who got hurt) and Dwight Howard is not the fucking difference between a elite roster and apparently a poor one."
Tobias and Ben both on max contracts to be outplayed by Seth Curry. I still can't believe they gave Tobias a fucking max contract lmao.
Seth had a good series but you can‚Äôt expect him to maintain that  I‚Äôll say it again since it went over your head the first time: **28**/6/5 in 33 games without his teams best player. It is uneducated to suggest a guy like that isn‚Äôt capable of giving you more than Seth curry.
"Year 1 their rookie years: Both teams are trash and the Mavs win 4 more games that's it and are buoyed by the late season addition of THJ.    Neither is instantly a good team.  Seriously good look at their rookie years they are very similar from a statistical standpoint.  Luka scored more on higher usage, Trae assisted more, both had similar efficiency.  Really wasn't a wide gulf in performance. Mavs season results in a lottery pick but they have trade it to the Hawks to get Luka.  Year 2:  Mavs make good roster moves to bring in Tingus (good move at the time), Curry, full year of THJ.  Mavs make the lower end of the playoffs because they are a good team.  Hawks actively run out a completely shit roster around Trae.  Half of it is no longer in the league, Collins suspended 25 games, and a bunch of rookies/ second year guys. A team that was purpose built to lose. Trae has massive year despite all of this.  Hawks made the decision that even though Trae was great as well rookie year to continue on the rebuild path.  Year 3: Mavs make no real moves other than trading away Seth for Richardson in the hopes of conserving cap space to lure someone.  They still healthy for majority of the year (seriously so few injuries, but did lose some time to COVID) and finish in the middle of the pack out west.  Hawks know now is the time to hit go and don't waste time trying to land a massive FA and build a team around Trae that fits his skillset.  Hawks slog thru having the 4th most games lost to injury all year.  Finally get mostly healthy for the first round and cruise thru the Knicks. 2nd round lose Hunter. Bogi hurts his knee and is ineffective and Trae plays thru a bum shoulder and they get thru the 1 seed to the conference final.  Mavs made their move to compete now last year and it worked.  Hawks made the decision to do it in year 3 and just did it better."
seth curry feels your disrespect mang
"Ja was putting up all time numbers against the reigning DPOTY, Trae Young has been averaging an efficient 30/10 against the two best defenses in the league, lillard damn near beat jordan‚Äôs record, KD is averaging like 50, Mitchell was basically better against the Grizzlies than the clippers fresh off an injury where he missed 16 games, Luka has only played against the clippers but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd put up numbers against anyone, Jokic was putting up crazy stats in his one series, and even roleplayers are consistently having huge games like Seth Curry damn near being a 30ppg scorer through a series"
"Yea it‚Äôs not Simmons fault directly, Embiid can learn to play better for sure. His team mates/coaches aren‚Äôt making things any easier for him, quite the contrary. Seth isn‚Äôt creating space for him, Embiid is creating that space for Curry."
"I mean, I agree.  If you have championship aspirations you absolutely take the superstar when the opportunity presents itself.  I said in another comment, tanking is playing the numbers, but you still have to do the rest of it right, and the Sixers didn't.  Outside of the Seth Curry trade, you can criticize just about every move they've made since getting rid of Hinkie.  But I think them being as good as they are right now, despite years and years of incompetence from their FO, is if anything proof of how successful tanking can be."
Seth Curry?   Tyrese Maxey?  Also btw what happened with Tyrese Maxey in game 7
"Certain players have that killer mentality of I want that shot. Trae has it. We saw yesterday Red Velvet has it. Joel Embiid has it, Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey have it.  Giannis Antetakumpo has it.   Ben Simmons doesn't.   Antetakumpo isn't a great FT shooter. Dwight isn't a Great FT. Shaq too. But these guys were like okay whatever I'm still gonna body you in the post and my body is built to take those shots and you'll wear out faster than I do. And if they 0-2 and 1-2 and 0-3 and 1-3 or 2-3  they add up.   Simmons should have embraced Hack-A-Ben made the shots he can make and then just dominate on defense.   I'm a moron when it comes to basketball"
"True Tobias is not a reliable second option. At this point, Reggie Jackson would be better.  Seth Curry and Tobias are not good enough as 2nd and 3rd options to get to the ECF   whereas the Atl play fearlessly, shoot fearlessly and knew the Sixers were playing scared. Raja Bell would say a team that doesn't know any better with that much confidence is dangerous af.    They're playing with house money from lottery to the sky."
"Bruh...Ben has Embiid, Tobias, Seth Curry. He had Butler once."
"Seth Curry averaging 21 points on 79% TS is literally stepping up in the biggest way possible. Every playoff team would kill to get that kind of production from anyone, role player or star. We all know Simmons is paid to be the second best player and totally underperformed. But saying Embiid averaged too many turnovers because Curry was the second best player, when Curry had an outstanding series that would rank as the second best on a number of eliminated playoff teams, is a dumb take."
"Big Collar obliterated their assets.  If he was smart, he would have taken the war chest and traded for a vet star (butler) earlier and not got Fultz, if anything traded down and taken a real pg like fox, Mitchell hell I even was ok with monk and Dsj at the time. But I really wanted fox. It‚Äôs just been below average and below average deals that have backfired.  At least Tobi has salvaged some,  And the Seth Curry trade was key. Wouldn‚Äôt have him without the Butler trade.  End of the day, their core is still young, hungry and experienced."
"Ben's had a horrid series, but I think its clear that the 76ers roster doesn't fit with him perfectly either -- he's much more suited to be the roller in a PnR who can make good reads in 4-on-3 situations a la Draymond then he is to be the facilitator whose not great at creating advantages. I think spacing tends to matter less if you're the roller in the PnR if you're a good passer since you can attack the rim and force someone to commit to you. He also provides Portland with some much needed wing-defense.  There's a reason why Portland have been so vocal about wanting Dray. We aren't trading Dray but Simmons can definitely play in a similar role.  As for Philly, they can run CJ at the point whose pretty much a better version of Seth Curry and give Seth more minutes with the bench."
"i don't think it's a coincidence it's Danny who's saying this. always was an A+ locker room guy, and he's right in saying it. yes, Simmons was a huge disappointment and was a direct negative on them because he couldn't hit free throws. that said, there just was never much scoring on this team outside of Embiid and Seth Curry.   Maybe I'm just blinded by trade potential but I think if you give him wide open spacing  where it can be his own team, I think he can be a great player. he isn't a no. 1 on a champion, but he's still a very good NBA player. I mean shit, were talking about maxing John Collins in our sub, is it that outlandish to prefer Simmons over that? I don't think so."
Yep. That is your position. The 76ers went from a terrible roster last year that supposedly Elton Brand needed to be fired...to suddenly a roster so elite that having the best season in your last 20 years...  was all due to the addition of ... Seth Curry and Danny Green!!!  Please stop. Just stop.  You and I both know that is complete and utter nonsense.
yes let's have a backcourt of Seth Curry and CJ McCollum
Seth Curry and CJ are so similar tho
"CJ, Derrick Jones Jr, and a 1st for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, who says no?"
"Hawks were the only team to beat Milwaukee in Milwaukee. They were the 1 in 10-1.  The entire series flipped because Trae got hurt. But if the Hawks don't play the Bucks it is unlikely the same set of circumstances unfold where Trae steps on a refs foot, it's such a random event that it probably only happened in this one scenario versus Bucks for whatever reason it happened.  But a healthy Hawks beat an injured Nets. And they would beat a healthy Suns.    The same way they obliterated the knicks and defeated the Top Seeded 76ers who had an MVP level guy in Joel Embiid and Seth Curry shooting 55 percent from three on high volume. Plus 76ers D was lockdown they were better than Suns.   Also I am not a Hawks fan I am a Lakers fan but just calling things fairly from what I saw"
Bruh how is Seth curry making 8 mil when kuzma out there making 13 mil
"The issue is it‚Äôs a very small sample size. Luka isn‚Äôt even on the leaderboard for active players in ppg because he hasn‚Äôt played enough to qualify.  Some more fun facts: In only 13 games over the last 2 years, Luka‚Äôs had a game with 35.3% ts and with 36.3%. The only guy you mentioned with 2 at least that bad over the past 2 years is Booker who played 22 games this year to Luka‚Äôs 13 total.  In the 35.3% ts game last year, he had 13 points on 14 fga while KP had 34 on 80.6% ts and only 4 more fga than Luka despite playing 9 more minutes. Seth Curry had 22 points on a 100% ts and got only 11 shots playing slightly longer. In this year‚Äôs 36.3% ts game, KP had 18 points on 12 shots for a 63.4% ts. Luka took double the number of attempts (24) to end up with 19 points. Both games were losses.  Luka also holds the record for 2nd most turnovers in any playoff game (or play in) game in league history after Harden‚Äôs 12 turnover game in the final game vs the 2016 Warriors. Nobody else has ever had as many or more. Even Harden only had that 1 game and he‚Äôs played 137 games in the playoffs.  This isn‚Äôt meant to shit on him. Just saying there‚Äôs way more to the story than 40 pojnt games."
Like what other shooters lol the wings are Seth Curry and Danny Green and Tobi is a great shooter as well   The only space killer on the floor is Ben
Klay is one of the best defenders in the leauge at his position...Steve Kerr definitely wasn't that.   Klay can also do alot more offensively than catch and shoot and way better than Kerr ever did.   Absolutely no one was game planning for Steve Kerr.  I think the comp you're looking for here is something like a Seth Curry.
*Seth curry has entered the chat*
Where is Seth Curry on this list?
&gt; Half of Steph Curry  Seth?
"CJ traded for Tobias is the only move I can think of. Similar players, but the Dame and CJ just isnt going to get it done defensively and that gives the 76ers a perimeter threat.   I dont know if the 76ers want CJ with Seth Curry playing like he did though"
Steph curry  Seth curry  Dell curry  Robert Hurry  Yao Ming
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
Seth Curry's brother -&gt; Seth Curry
Seth Curry ‚Äî&gt; Steph Curry
"Devin Booker is a poor man‚Äôs Dame Lillard and a rich man‚Äôs Seth Curry lol CP3 needs to jump ship and say screw the money, he can use a ring and an actual contender can use him off the bench"
"Absolutely. That's a lot of talented shooting to space the floor around a generational talent of a center in Embiid. If Lebron was able to drag his early Cavs teams through the playoffs, I believe a healthy Embiid could be competitive with that roster in the playoffs.  Tobias is like Melo with better defense, Seth is low-sodium Steph Curry, and CJ is a Devin Booker / DeMar DeRozan type of scorer. That team, anchored by a talented defensive center with a solid post game like Embiid, could beat a lot of playoff teams in a 7 game series.  Ideally they would also get a veteran point guard like Rondo to run their offense and rack up double-digit assists every game with limited scoring, although Rondo - Curry - CJ could be rough defensively and Seth might have to shift to 6th man."
But they haven't though? Why do you think everyone switches so much and hunts?  The Hawks killed Seth Curry. The Clippers have the best defensive tandem in the league and Luka still ate them up  Straight up Bud almost lost the series because they didn't go after Harden.  It's why individual defense is overrated until clutch time. The team with the best defenders 1-5 usually wins
"Get out of my head Morey. If I want to imagine Seth Curry pegging the shit out of Doc Rivers, that‚Äôs my choice."
&gt;more and more teams are going to go with what the clippers did in the playoffs vs Jazz and start 5 wing players and make you guard them.  Tell this to everyone who thinks Seth Curry was the missing link.
We might be able to pry Seth Curry in return for that package.
"KD's team was injured and played the 2x MVP+DPOY 6ers with 2 stars a Seth curry shooting lights out got smoked by a 0 allstar team, nothing more embarrassing than that. You also got SWEPT by the Celtics in the first round lmao."
Seth Curry is untouchable with that contract
Seth curry back. Trust me. I literally said ‚Äúthank god Seth curry isn‚Äôt here anymore‚Äù several times during the playoffs
"Yeah, if we can't get dame or lowry, goran and fournier are 2 guys I'd be interested in. I think they're both solidly in the ""bad defender, but better than seth curry"" category. The only question is, are either of them better enough than seth to make the upgrade worthwhile.  Also worth noting that the sixers are not a switch everything team, so hopefully they'd be able to hide a guy like goran more easily."
"I'd like if the sixers could get some value out of seth curry and replace him with goran. Obviously seth is a better fit in the offensive lineup than goran, but I'd imagine goran isn't as bad of a defender, and he can actually be the focal point of our bench offense."
The 6ers have a pretty talented roster outside Embiid? Seth Curry was their 2nd best player that series and he should be a team's 5th starter or 6th man. Tobias Harris can only score and that's inconsistent and Simmons can only defend in the playoffs and his lack of a shot sabotage's Embiid.
"All the without Luka pieces were the same. Seth Curry was a huge help and had an amazing year, but again, you can think it was Seth Curry who transformed their offense to pretty much an top10 NBA offense without Luka, or you can think this year something wasn't right, either injuries, COVID issue, or some players regressing, but again, it wasn't that long ago and the core is pretty much the same, I can't see the reasons why they can't at least be a decent team without Luka next year. When just a season ago they were incredible.  I've tried to ask Mavs fans numerous time what happen with team this year, when last season they were really good without Luka while this year offense couldn't do anything.  But they never have an answer to that."
"Playoffs certainly have a different style of game.   Simmons is a great transition basketball player, but there is less transition basketball in the playoffs because the teams are better and don't give up as many fast-break points.   But a player's inability to shoot always shows up in the playoffs. LeBron got shut down by the Mavs in the finals. Then he developed his jump shot. Giannis got shut down by the Raptors and Heat.  Simmons is running into this now. But he just never developed his shot.  &amp;#x200B;  The Dame comparison... I'm not sure that works for me. Dame can shoot. And he often excels in the playoffs. For example, he only dropped 28 a game in the regular season but was dropping 34 a game against the Nuggets. And he shot almost 45% from the arc. It's just that his team isn't that good. There isn't as much fire power. Had he had Embiid, Seth Curry, and Harris rather than CJ, Kanter, and Power, then the team would have certainly performed better.   &amp;#x200B;  In fact, I've no doubt that if the Sixers had Lillard in place of Simmons, I've no doubt that the Sixers would have won a title this year."
I believe he played like shit at the combine in Chicago. That plus he‚Äôs not athletic didn‚Äôt help. Dude passed the eye test for sure tho and can launch from deep. Could be a Seth Curry type development arc there
"yeah, I mean he at least has a bit more size than Seth Curry, and he can do a lot on offense even if he doesn't have a single elite skill.  I don't know how much the Celtics are interested in taking back salary, seems like they want to duck the tax this year and preserve cap space for next offseason.  If they S&amp;T Fournier somewhere, they'd probably be looking to just create a TPE (Celtics and TPEs, name a more iconic duo)."
"Thanks. Yeah, Curry is pretty clearly the better player at this point. Turned Seth Curry into Moses Brown, not ideal."
Where are the Mavs fans who swore that Richardson was much better than Seth Curry? He was so good that he lasted a season and was replaced by a center.
"Would be hard to fit fournier and stay under the hard cap while keeping ben, but it‚Äôs possible. TBH his scoring would be so good for the sixers, I don‚Äôt even care if he bleeds a little bit of value with poor team defense, just can‚Äôt have him be a seeve onball like seth curry where he gets targeted in the playoffs.  Would also be curious how a s&amp;t would playout, it might only make sense for the C‚Äôs if the sixers can send Ben to a team that can absorb most of his contract, so that fournier can go to philly as a 3-way without boston taking back salary."
"I like Seth, but I'm not trading Curry for Curry, lol!"
"They can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not a mistake that Phoenix lost to first healthy team they ran up on.   Philly would be a great spot for CP3, I imagine. Move Simmons to the 4 full time and let Seth Curry spell CP to keep him fresh. This was his first Finals and it‚Äôs telling that in his first Finals in his career, he was simply gassed. Dude blew up."
"I mean, that 2019 team was the only team that looked like a real contender because they had Jimmy Buttler. I think it's pretty obvious watching Philly that they won't be a contender until they bring in a high-level ball hander. They are not contenders with George Hill and Seth Curry as their best permitter players."
"A lot of the fan base hates him bc we traded Seth curry for him, even though Jrich had a ‚Äúdown year‚Äù his production was right around career avg"
"I feel like there's a lot of blame to go around. Embiid turnovers and stuff like this, Simmons obviously, Tobias not stepping up, Seth Curry getting killed on defense (played super well overall though), Thybulle series sealing foul, doc rivers blowing another lead, and the bench not doing anything at all."
"Listen if steve Kerr is shooting 52% from 3 (when they shortened the 3 point line from 23'9 to 22"" from 1994-1997) then Seth Curry shooting 60% from 3. KD probably shoots 65% on 22 foot 3s. Steph Curry might be near 70%."
Seth Curry got torched on defense in Game 7.
"Pretty much everyone outside of Seth Curry can have some percentage of the blame, either by having bad moments or underperforming in certain moments"
"That Jimmy Butler saga was pretty damn lucky. You got the second best player on your team for RoCo, Saric and second round pick. People always point out losing Jimmy for JRich, but you then replaced him with Seth Curry - finding his production is lucky too. In general, the Sixers have been a FA destination over the past couple of years due to the perception that they're ready to compete. Compare them with other perpetually plagued franchises (i.e. Blazers), you have to agree that the sixers enjoy some amount of FA fortune.  Also to reiterate, since I think it's by far the biggest one - keeping Embiid healthy is also so damn lucky. Folks really thought he was gonna go the way of Greg Oden."
A role player that can shoot 3's? Heck yeah! Seth Curry on $8m/year? Even better.
The most realistic player from the FA class  for them to get is Seth Curry. So Seth Curry and Nerlens Noel is enough to go from getting swept by the Celtics to making some noise in the playoffs? Tell me you don‚Äôt watch basketball without telling me
I like Brogdon more than McCollum for the Sixers. Better defense I believe. That's needed if your other guard is Seth Curry.
"The collective Currys, especially if you include in-laws  Dell, Steph, and Seth obviously but then you also have Austin Rivers (sister Callie is married to Seth) and Damion Lee (married to Sydel Curry).   Five people with NBA careers is pretty impressive."
Currys includes dell curry I presume who had a way better career than seth
Seth curry getting more of his minutes
I think the 76ers should take that if it's offered and then trade Seth Curry for a guard that's better on defense.  CJ / Tobias / RoCo / Embiid sounds nice
Uh his dad is Dell Curry. Seth is also an amazing shooter. They got their fundamentals from their dad.
"Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Dell Curry?"
"Liangelo Ball, Seth Curry, Steph Curry"
"I'm not even a Philly fan lol so I could care less about who they get in return. My gripe is the non stop hate piling on Simmons when he's not the only person the blame. Doc, Embiid, Harris have all escaped any blame pretty much and the entirety of it has fallen on one guy because it's the easy thing to do and people think it's funny. Reporters (from the like of Bleacher Report so don't know if you can even call them reporters) are just throwing out any rubbish news and people are buying it. ""Simmons wants to live in LA because he's a socialite"" like cmon the guy has wanted to stay in Philly his whole career so that report is clearly rubbish.  I hope for his sakes he does leave Philly because as soon as he does, all their fans who have been tearing into him will realize how much he did for that team and how much his play makes them work. Yeah he can't shoot but does Seth Curry have the best year of his career if Simmons isn't creating all those open looks for him?"
"&gt;&gt;Tell me another player who'll get boo'd for turning down open 3s.  &gt;Seth Curry, Tobias Harris...Pretty much everyone on the team that isn't a big man.  Find 1 time that happened anytime last year. What an absolute lie."
Steph Curry  Seth Curry  Bryn Forbes
"Seth Curry, Tobias Harris, (Danny Green has never turned down an open three but he got booed in the playoffs for missing them). Pretty much everyone on the team that isn't a big man."
"CJ McCollum, bonus is that opens them up to using Seth Curry in trade."
"I think Philly would immediately be better swapping a permitter player for Simmons. Philly has such an unbalanced roster. They are trying to be contenders with Seth Curry as their best permitter creator. That's nowhere near good enough to challenge for a title no matter how good Embiid is. They just flat out don't have anywhere near enough playmaking and shot creation to win a playoff series vs a good team. There is no team that has won playing this way since the Hakeem Rockets when illegal defence rules still existed.  Maybe Simmons for Russell or someone of that ilk isn't equal value in a vacuum depending on what you think of Simmons, but that doesn't matter. You almost never get equal value and Philly has had a giant hole in their roster since Buttler left. After whiffing on Lowry for the second time Simmons is the only vehicle to fill it. They can hold out for the big fish, but it's an incredibly dangerous game.     Simmons's value isn't going to get higher in my opinion. Another year of putting up 15/7 with a Rudy Gobert shot chart isn't going to change how anyone values Simmons. And, if Dame or Beal don't become available or Simmons doesn't draw the picks and assets Washington and Portland want they are going to be wasting another year of Embiid's prime with a deeply flawed roster that I think has no chance to contend."
Beggars and choosers and all that but a DLo/Seth Curry backcourt puts way too much pressure on Embiid on defence IMO
"Well we know for a fact he cheated on his fiance, who is now married to seth curry.  And multiple pacers fans seem to agree this happened. It doesn't seem like he respects the sanctity of marriage."
"Without a drastic change, I think his only hope is having another high tier playmaker on the team and he gets more comfortable off ball. Biggest thing is lock him in a room until he can make a million free throws in a row.  He doesn't shoot, he's passive on the interior, doesn't have a good post game, doesn't move off ball well, and can't exploit getting to the line because he can't make free throws. Not sure why people think he'd magically do well playing the 4/5.  He's basically had 3 40% 3pt shooters (45% in the case of Seth Curry) and one of the most dominant centers in the league who happens to be a respectable shooter at his position too. If he doesn't work with that, I don't know what to tell you. The only thing people can say he hasn't been given is another great playmaker if you're not counting Butler.  People say he hasn't been used right, but people who have actually watched know he's been put in any many different positions. In the playoffs they tried having other people bring the ball up the court and he'd sit in the dunkers spot. Even when he got good passes he'd pass up numerous opportunities.  He can turn it around, but until now he's had a lot of excuses made for him when in reality he's just a glorified roleplayer imo. You don't drop 5 pts in the playoffs and 30-something% from the line with starter minutes because you aren't being used right."
"No he wasn't, he was traded to the mavs for seth curry. Tyrell terry was actually selected by the mavs wtf are you smoking?"
If you‚Äôre relying on Seth Curry to be your lead halfcourt ball handler then you deserve what you‚Äôve gotten
Seth curry
Portland's is... not good.  PG: Seth Curry  SG: Wes Matthews - Barton  SF: Batum - Harkless  PF: Melo? LMA if he comes back  C: RoLo/Whiteside/Kanter/Plumlee
Would've been Seth Curry on better value (Seth is on great value at the moment though)
My favorite part of that shot is Seth Curry talking shit to the Thunder bench as Dame's dribbling it up like 'You know it's over right?'
That's literally Seth Curry lol  Now Embiid has 2 Seth Curry's
"kind of a weird post, but I steph will play like he is steph curry and seth will play like he is seth curry!"
"This season with good shooters in Danny Green and Seth Curry and playing with Embiid and a Tobias Harris shooting 40% from 3, Simmons averaged 6.9 assists on 3.0 turnovers in 32 minutes a game.   Last season with literally no shooters and offensive weapons on the team, Draymond Green averaged 6.2 assists on 2.3 turnovers per game in 28 minutes per game. Dray is the better playmaker."
"What conversation? I said simmons is a terrible shooter and it‚Äôs holding his game back. Yet he is the starting point guard and starting pg of the 5 with the best numbers in the game. Seth curry had his best year playing next to him. Sixers were a shot at the title this year until he completely crapped his pants in the playoffs and they were still not far away from advancing to the east finals even with their starting small forward out, Embiid playing injured and Ben losing his confidence. They get good shots in the half court. He has amazing vision and accuracy leading the fast break. He defends the best wing. Gets assists.  He has a big flaw and that is shooting. It holds him back from attacking more because he doesn‚Äôt want to go to the line. That makes it harder for him but he still does an amazing job even with that major flaw. You happy now? Sorry I thought on a discussion board you might actually have a grasp of more than just talking points about Simmons game, you might have watched more than a few games and been able see past your blinkers. Lol obviously not and lol you can‚Äôt think for yourself, just jump on the bandwagon"
The 76ers are the first seed they should beat a fifth seed when there is a game 7 in your court and Seth curry played amazing. Joel embiid if he‚Äôs a superstar should find a way.
Tobias avg 19pts on 48% and 36% from three should be good enough to make the ecf. The east only has two elite teams in nets and bucks and they had a cakewalk to the conference finals. Seth curry played really great too. If embiid is praised as a superstar then he should beat the hawks and not choke a 26 pt lead in game 5.
Seth Curry
Seth curry
"no they shouldn‚Äôt have traded for him, and if they weren‚Äôt going to bring back jimmy on top of him they shouldn‚Äôt have brought him back either. they had 38 million in cap space+tobias‚Äô bird rights after they let jimmy walk. they used the space on Horford+Richardson and re upped tobias. literally all 3 were terrible moves  they could have just signed a few good starter level role players for 50 million that offseason or splurged on brogdon in RFA and sent a protected first to milwaukee and then used the rest on a few decent role players. they‚Äôd be in such a better situation than right now   it would have been entirely realistic to sign Bojan (ended up with 4/73) Danny Green (ended up with 2/30) and Seth Curry (ended up 4/32) and they still likely would have had space to make additional moves   signing a guy ‚Äúcause they have to‚Äù almost never works out. if another team was gonna pay tobias the max you let him walk. it‚Äôs tobias fucking harris.   it was a panic move and it sucks. and it‚Äôs an absolutely terrible, incredibly limiting contract to a guy that isn‚Äôt all star caliber in a weak conference, who doesn‚Äôt even fit with our best player!"
Missed chance on Seth Curry :(
"Got rid of horfords awful contract, while adding Danny green, Howard, and seth curry in one off season. Just because he isn't selling Simmons at a low like you want him to, doesn't mean he ain't a top gm in the league.   Getting CJ will help their shooting/spacing issues, but then another issue arises that they will have no one remotely close to be a playmaker on that team."
"Being able to fit anywhere doesn't mean you have the talent level to start everywhere.  Guys like Seth Curry, Ish Smith, Jeff Green - they can always carve out a role, but you may be in trouble if you give them 30-35."
They also don‚Äôt have many Seth curry level shooters
"Walker was an all-star and one of the super six of 96 though. I imagine the bar for him would be first or second option on offense, not Seth Curry."
 Anybody fits with an elite shooter like Seth curry lol
Nah Seth Curry is in the league Bertans and Robinson are getting paid CJ is a horrible defender and not a top 10 guy obn offense. You just have to a really fucking good movement shooter and you'll survive
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"It's pretty universal. It's a much better representation of scoring efficiency than any other stat. What it doesn't tell you is the difficulty of shots a player is taking. You'd expect someone like Bruce Brown or Seth Curry to have a high TS% because they're mostly finishing plays and don't really take shots outside of the flow of the offense.   If someone has a similar role but has a worse TS%, there's cause for concern. And then you get outliers like Curry who have insane efficiency on difficult shots"
"It's because he shows months-long flashes of great rim protection and mobility in the regular season. It was like a year ago when he had an amazing stretch of 30 games or so averaging 26/10/2 with over 2 blocks and a steal on 62% ts, and the defense was above average with KP on the floor all season despite a Luka, Seth Curry, Tim Hardaway Jr, Brunson backcourt rotation. His defensive numbers at the rim suggest he was a great rim protector that season.  Even last season there was a stretch from late February to early April where he looked amazing, his rim protection numbers looked elite, and the Mavs were a top 5 defense over that stretch despite a decently tough schedule. Unfortunately the defense fell apart the last few weeks of the season and the playoffs. Not saying it's much good if he isn't consistent, but as a mavs fan it's not hard to see his defensive impact completely changes the team when he's playing well.  I haven't seen anyone call him a good post up player though"
"I don't know about how is now with the sixers, but I felt Seth Curry was too passive at times."
Seth Curry maybe? He‚Äôs a historically great shooter but doesn‚Äôt shoot as high in volume as other three point specialists.
Wait. Seth Curry is back on the Sixers.
Effiency doesn‚Äôt mean anything on a tanking team. The team Timbs play with never treat them seriously. Seth Curry has a better 3pt% than his brother FYI.
"Gobert‚Äôs impact is tiers above Embiid, especially in carrying a defense in the regular season  Embiid also can‚Äôt endure dominating on offense &amp; playing hard on defense to make up for the weaknesses around him. His health &amp; stamina will suffer even more than they already do.  Even with Ben, the Sixers defense was getting cooked by those guards vs ATL. Embiid was getting cooked in the P&amp;R and it will be even harder for him to play D now. It only takes just one bad defender; remember how bad Seth Curry got cooked"
"For the sixers i don't really see the appeal bc having McCollum makes Seth Curry a lot less valuable to the team, when he is providing great value to us now on his contract. Kind of negates one of our competitive advantages"
Seth Curry with that contract was the best asset of Mavs after Luka.
Lol if they just sit Ben that team is not top 5. The best playmaker on that roster would unironically be Seth Curry
"Over the last 4 years the sixers have steadily declined in 3PA per game, finishing last season right around 27th.   We have one of the most dominate paint players in the league, and have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.   Sixers fans have been quick to say buddy is lacking in defense or other aspects of his game, but we so desperately need a high volume shooter, I struggle to see how he would not immediately make our offense flow better.   Would love if they found a way to get him on the squad.   For reference - last year, Danny Green was our leading 3 point shooter in terms of volume at just 6.3 attempts per game. After that, it was furkan korkmaz and seth curry at 4.9 each. Then we have a steep drop off to Tobias Harris at 3.4 attempts per game.   Further, Danny Green's 6.3 attempts per game ranked him at 48th overall in total attempts, just .1 attempts ahead of John Wall.   All that is to say, Sixers fans should reconsider their desire to have Hield on the team. He's one of the best volume 3 point shooters in recent history."
Yeah that Seth Curry trade was very strange to me. Sure he's not even an okay defender but he was on a cheap 3 year contract while Richardson had only 1 year left on his deal.
"Facts he'd be so good on the Sixers. If I were the Sixers I'd try to do something that ends up like this:  Lost: Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green  Gained: CJ, a decent defensive guard who can shoot (someone like Lonzo, Caruso, Smart, Huerter, KCP, etc.), and a small forward to replace Danny Green."
&gt; Better than Malachi Flynn???????  Yes. He's still better than evil Seth Curry
"Shai, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, Lebron, a healthy Mitchell Robinson"
Seth Curry!! Ohhhh
"Trae was on the court when Lou went off lol. All the defensive attention was on Trae, so Lou Will was just repeatedly cooking Seth Curry because of Trae‚Äôs gravity pulling Simmons."
How exactly did he have ‚Äúthe most efficient postseason in history‚Äù? He didn‚Äôt even have the most efficient postseason in 2021. Seth Curry had both a higher ppg and a higher ts% than he did. So did Kawhi.   His 2021 playoff ts% ranks below that of 68 other qualifying postseasons. Get rid of anyone with a lower ppg and he‚Äôs still far down the list. You can restrict it to only players who made the finals and it still wasn‚Äôt the most efficient (see 2017 KD and possibly more though I haven‚Äôt checked).
"People misread our situation in my mind.  I think turning JRich, Al and 1st into Danny Green and Seth Curry(on a 3 year deal) bought him a lot of goodwill.   Plus he wasn't the idiot who was looking to eventually move Embiid, or his minions left over after burnergate who pissed through so many assets and so much cap space and left us with Al, Tobi and JRich to go with Ben/Jo.    It really was just a multi-year run of ineptitude that rivals anyone in the league outside of Vlade.   So he has a bit of a runway b/c of those things.     For me, I'm really happy he's being patient.  Ben for all his flaws, is a 25 year old all star.  He was just recently in a poll of GM's listed as the 2nd best perimeter defender in the league(behind Jrue) and the 2nd most versitle(behind Giannis).   He has 4 years left and is allegedly not being overly picky on where he ends up, so that should allow teams like Portland, Indy, Cleveland who fear trading and having the guy leave Kawhi style to get involved.   He is better than everyone who has been mentioned as potential trades.   Teams will get antsy once the games start being played.  There are stars at multiple teams that are on the last year of their deals like Beal, Levine or are entering the end of their prime like Dame, or have young stars like Fox, KAT and do not want their guy to be the next one looking to leave and could start to pony up Ben's worth in a few weeks/months.  If not, then you can still take a shitty deal and then you know the roster rebuild starts then.   tl;dr;  i'm fine with how Morey handled this so far.   Shitty deal will always be there; but there are many teams that seem happy now that might not be come December."
"Seth technically has a higher 3pt% than Steph. It‚Äôs kind of a stretch, but you can say Seth is more of a ‚Äúpure shooter‚Äù because spot up 3s is basically all he does, while Curry has more playmaking and driving to the basket in his game"
Well Seth is technically still a  Urey so they did vote for curry
"which dumbass gms didn‚Äôt vote curry lmao  Like KD, sure his front office might have to serve his ego or whatever, he‚Äôs a superstar. But, who is picking Robinson and Seth seriously?"
"Haha yea I also like on different replays (not shown) you can see Seth curry talking to the thunder bench and then dame makes it and he just turns and says probably some cold shit like ‚ÄúI told you, game‚Äù"
I low key like that trade for both teams. Ben Simmons as a third option is nice and he can be their primary defender on lebron and do some of the dirty work.  I think the nets would need to ask for one more guy with Ben Simmons so like Simmons and idk maybe Seth curry for kyrie
"Sixers get: Buddy Hield, Malcom Brogdon, and 2022 frp   Pacers get: Ben Simmons and Seth Curry  Kings get: Sabonis"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Steph Curry is a lot more than just ""3 point scoring"". Dude legitimately belongs in the top 4 players list. He can carry teams, be the team's best player, be the best ""1B player"", and can be the best player on a championship team.  You made him sound like he's Seth Curry hah."
"&gt;I think an offense with Seth curry as its second best player has a cap joel might dip on defense because of the added offensive load too  Tobi is our second best player. Even then I don't know how we're going to look this season, around 6ish seed sounds fair unless Shake, Tisse and Maxey take monster steps."
"I'm not saying they're good but this is the list, excluded Joel of course, since Ben got mad whenever the sixers tried to sign other point guards.  Seth Curry  Shake Milton  TJ McConnell  JJ Redick  Alex Burks  Raul Neto  Markell Fultz"
Bro just getting Josh Richardson‚Äôs ass off the team is an upgrade. What a waste of trading Seth Curry. KP averaged 20/9 in the regular season. He had a bad series against the Clippers but I won‚Äôt write him off till I see him again this year after a healthy off season. Bullock is a solid 3&amp;D replacement for Richardson.
seth curry danny green tobias harris joel embiid :(
A lot of guard shooters set screens and it works well. Seth Curry and JJ Redick have set screens for Simmons. Simmons is bad in half court because he kind of just sits in the dunker role. He doesn't run PnR actions much as the ball handler or the screener but he should get better as a screener and do it more. He gets dribble hand offs sometimes as a play but he's not aggressive enough to be that big of a threat
"It's extremely overvalued in this NBA because of how much NBA teams switch.  Oh, Simmons is on me? Screen for me and now Seth Curry is guarding me. Where is your DPOY level defense on the ball now...?  This isn't a shot at Simmons, just pointing out how much teams switch."
Seth Curry is criminally underrated.
Steph is green curry Seth is Panang
"Yeah nothing says no shooting like Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Joel shooting 38% percent from three."
Good. I would absolutely love to see Seth Curry get more responsibility in a team rather than just a pure shooter.   I think he's super talented. Bro has a 15 assist game under his belt as well (also had 20 points in that game)
If Seth curry doesn‚Äôt shoot at an absurd from 3 and midrange idk if the series even makes it to 7‚Ä¶he was outstanding. Outside of Embiid you can‚Äôt look at anyone else who bended our defense consistently.
Ben got outplayed by Seth Curry lol
Seth Curry dropped 21ppg on 61.4/59.6/66.7; 78.8% TS; 79% eFG; +59 in the 6ers series vs the Hawks. Positive +/- in every game except Game 7.
A real Seth Curry type
Lmao dude I immediately started mocking Embiid getting posted and JC putting it on a tshirt. I know Reddit is full of the socially inept but nothing beyond that point was an actual argument and you‚Äôre mega coping about your own inability to detect that if you try to claim otherwise lol. Anything to justify randomly insulting someone to yourself though right? Or do you really think that I believe in Seth Curry being a mind reader?
A realistic team base off salary cap.   Ben   Seth curry   Harrison Barnes / miles bridges   Kristaps/   Kat/ brook Lopez
"Using Simmons as the best, no other stars:   * PG: Mike Conley  * SG: Seth Curry  * SF: Marcus Morris * PF: Ben Simmons  * C: Myles Turner"
Trae committed a fuck ton of (even with the old rules) offensive fouls to bait out defensive fouls even when he was getting defended by Seth fucking Curry.  If you doubt this look at his numbers when he isn't getting to the line. Its not exactly promising.
"Maxey, Seth Curry, Green, Harris, Drummond. Yeah that ain‚Äôt going anywhere"
"I feel like they could only accomplish this from by giving up a lot which I doubt they will or by fleecing someone. Also doubt.  - I imagine if they traded Simmons for some of the offers they have now, I reckon that needs 2 first rounders as well along with it unless named D'Angelo Russell.  - So then assuming they wanted to flip that return for Lillard (please no, Dame &amp; CJ 4 life) or Beal type, that would require those picks and more Philly 1st round picks.   That's all before whatever the Thunder would ask for. Guessing a 1st rounder as well plus a starter caliber player. Thybulle or Seth Curry or something.   The fit would probably be fine if by some magic, they pull off a trade for both a primary ball handler and Dort. If they kept Seth Curry &amp; Tobias somehow through all this, that leaves a hole at the 3 in the closing lineup for one of Danny Green, Dort &amp; Thybulle.  Ultimately do they need to? I don't think so if they kept Thybulle. Defensively, I think there's enough there to cover what they would lose in a Simmons trade anyway for whatever they can get back offensively to be worthwhile."
"Morey turned Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry.  Simmons going full bitch mode obviously isnt great but trading him for CJ McCollum gets the team nowhere for Embiids entire prime.  Rather wait and see what else is out there or take back a package with picks and prospects easily.  Look where the Sixers were last year as a 6 seed locked into that horford deal.  You are being way over dramatic, it is not his fault Ben decided to burn this shit to the ground"
Gotta agree. I have no idea what Thybulle's offensive game is but I bet they are hoping he at least masters the corner three and becomes a Bruce Bowen type of player. Straight cash from the corner lol. And if Embiid's stamina is questionable there is so much pressure on the guards to create. Too bad Seth Curry can't iso and pnr like Lou Will could. That would be huge for them.
Remember Seth Curry from last year took a while to get back to how he was pre-COVID.  At least a month or so after he came back
"No teams currently are having their hands forced - the only player asking out right now is Simmons. The Sixers are banking on either a star player asking out or an underperforming team getting desperate before the trade deadline. Simmons value won't get any lower - him sitting out is already priced in at this point.   &gt;As for the risk, the risk is that the Sixers, who are supposedly trying to win a championship with a legit MVP candidate, lose their second best player from their rotation for absolutely nothing. You may think getting someone like Hield or McCollum or whoever is ""too little value"", but those are very good NBA players. They help a team and make it better. The Sixers need more of those players, not less.  This basically makes no sense, the whole point of a GM's job is to maximize value on the roster - giving up Simmons for players that are better versions of Seth Curry is just not very smart.   It's not like the Sixers are going to miss out on the playoffs by dropping a few games before the trade deadline. It's the east - I'm pretty sure the rest of the roster keep their heads above water to get more than 40 wins in the end."
"I don't think the 6ers are really in a position to demand that they don't get worse defensively though? Like you're going to be losing this trade, that is the nature of having a guy willing to sit out a season and mortgage a full year of Embiid's contract. Trying to dictate the terms so the trade solves all your problems just kind of seems like misreading the room.  The Blazers wouldn't mind having Seth Curry but don't really need him either, we have Anfernee Simons off the bench in that role shooting at a ridiculous clip, and we need to develop him further + we've got 3 starting guards currently (2 if we trade CJ). I can see the Blazers throwing in Anfernee or Nas, or some picks, but I don't see why they'd give up 2 starters for Simmons when the 6ers clearly don't have leverage.  CJ would play incredibly next to Embiid on offense, and Ben's defense is irreplaceable but despite what ppl might tell you, CJ isn't such a terrible defender that he can't be hidden as your worst guy. Blazers one year had like the ~10th best defense with Dame AND CJ starting. 6ers have better defensive pieces than that Blazers team did by a lot. You've got a spare elite perimeter defender in Thybulle like... I just don't see how the 6ers can afford to be this picky."
"CJ is pretty redundant with Seth Curry who we have on an amazingly cheap contract. CJ scores more, but he's not $20 mil/yr better, we could use upgrades at other positions more."
"I'd rather have a daily Simmons thread than half a page of ""Seth Curry shoots a three"" posts."
"Even if it came down to that fourth pick, they could still easily trade someone like Seth Curry for an extra 2025 first if needed.  3 sixers picks + 3 wolves picks &amp; swaps plus Maxey &amp; Thybulle &amp; McDaniels &amp; swaps is a good offer"
"Andre Iguodala  Marcus Smart  Seth Curry  Toni Kukoc  Draymond Green if he counts, Shaun Livingston otherwise"
did Seth Curry die or?
Remember the guy who used to randomly post Seth Curry hate posts on here lol
"Alternative universe: Sixers trade Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and multiple 1st rd picks, for Curry and Klay. Sixers roll out a small ball lineup of Steph-Klay-DG-Tobias-Simmons.. Matisse and Seth off the bench. SHEESH."
"Give me Pat Bev, PJ tucker, Bobby Portis, Brook Lopez, and Seth curry."
&gt; lookin like an Anthony Davis cosplayer  The absolute disrespect to Seth Curry
Rivers did not tell Simmons to play completely passive and refuse to take shots.  Guys like Seth Curry needed to take more shots because Simmons was completely unable to create his own shot in the playoffs when defenses are keyed in.  He has no bag
"Lol alrighty. I‚Äôm assuming you think Tobias or Seth Curry is the second best offensive player they have which, if true, doesn‚Äôt bode well for your competitiveness next year. He creates like 70% of everyone‚Äôs shots not named Embiid."
"Besides Embiid, the Sixers have Tobias Harris (a serviceable starter), and 3 players that really should be the 6th man on a championship team in Danny Green, Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey. I don't see where the Championship level depth is.  Compare that to their competition with the Nets with Harden, Durant and Kyrie and the Bucks with Giannis, Middleton and Holiday. You can pretty easily see that the Sixers aren't contenders this year and won't be unless they get a Middleton/Kyrie level of player back for Simmons, which is looking increasingly unlikely."
Oladipo and Seth Curry
"Ding. Ding. Ding. We‚Äôre going to get one of these a day. Next he won‚Äôt have a problem with Seth Curry, but he wants someone in the back court who can play defense. Then Thybulle will be a good friend, but he‚Äôd want to play with a wing more like JJ Redick again. Then Doc Rivers will be like a father figure, but he‚Äôll need more of a tactician. Then the hot dog vendors will need to be in better shape to feed the fans faster so they aren‚Äôt cranky."
"Steph curry, Seth curry, dell curry, eddy curry, Jameson curry"
"And eyerolll....  Fine, it's like saying Dame is a miles worse scorer than Seth Curry,  which is equally absurd and illustrates the logical flaw you've decided is the hill you want you die on just as well.  As for points/100 it adjusts for pace. If you want to raw ppg Luka is ahead by a decent margin (~1.5 ppg)."
"&gt;Last, last season we had high iq ball distributors like Seth Curry and Delon Wright. Combine that with KP always being a willing passer and we had good ball movement without Luka"
"Embiid, Harden, Harris, Seth Curry, Thybulle, Howard and the rest of their team would have definitely been better than the Nets' lopsided team."
He‚Äôs taking about the season before. The one with Seth Curry.
"Can anyone explain how Dallas went from having one the best benches in the league to now Luka has no help?   Was Seth Curry really that good? Lol who am I kidding, of course he was"
"They were in 19-20.  Had the best bench in the league and top10 offense without Luka.  Last season they had pretty much the same personal (minus Seth Curry), but couldn't do anything without Luka."
"I mean, Simmons deserves to be scapegoated. He's been absolute shambles against Boston, Toronto, and Atlanta in the playoffs. Or any series not vs first-round cannon fodder like the Wizards where he can just rampage around in transition.  As I see it the system-wide failure is Simmons masquerading as a ball-handler and Philly not acquiring a real one since Buttler left. It's not Doc's fault the best perimeter creator on the team is Seth Curry followed by some combination of Maxey and the ghost of George Hill. Or that Simmons had a meltdown and wouldn't shot and couldn't make a free throw.   Doc is whatever as a coach but, I'm not sure what the big tactical moves Doc could have done. The bench is shambles, Embiid can't play all game, Seth Curry the only ballhandler on the team was played off the court by Kevin Hurter, and the ""2nd best"" player on the team had a total meltdown."
"I don‚Äôt see why the blazers would want Seth curry, he just doesn‚Äôt fit with Dame. It would be the CJ problem all over again with two undersized guards, except Seth is even worse on D"
Our sub thought we won the Josh Richardson - Seth Curry trade
"I dont blame Ben for wanting out at all, the 76ers front office has been awful since he got drafted. Robert Covington, Mikal Bridges and Markelle Fultz are 3 players that are perfect for the team but they traded RoCo and other trade pieces for 1 year of Jimmy Butler (who eventually turned into Seth Curry who i love but id prefer RoCo if i had the choice). Mikal Bridges move completely baffled me and the Fultz situation disgusted me by how the front office acted.   Add all of that ontop of the fact that both their coaches have been subpar (Brett Brown seemed like a nice guy but had some severe mental lapses as a coach) and Doc Rivers... it just seems like he doesnt have people skills, what he said at that interview and the interviews after that is just a joke, and if thats what is being said publicly, whats being said behind closed doors and at practice. I dont blame Ben for not shooting or being aggressive if that's how little confidence his coach has in him.  AND add all the trade rumors hes been dealing with and its all a disaster waiting to happen.  Now saying all that im not saying Ben is blameless, if he ever wants to be a Super Star player he has to change his mind set, he has to hold himself accountable and take initiative. He has all the skills but he doesnt have the mentality to be great, at least not yet. But the amount of criticism he gets is completely disproportionate to the amount of blame he holds."
"That‚Äôs a huge overpay, I‚Äôd do CJ, Roco, and 1 FRP for Ben and Seth Curry"
"You're right, his scoring is that bad huh.   It makes complete sense that he's behind Embiid, and also understandable to be behind Butler... but being behind Tobias Harris and Seth Curry is laughably bad for a player of his caliber."
The deal wasn‚Äôt just Simmons. The deal would be Ben Simmons+ Seth Curry or Matisse Thybulle and then probably some picks. They definitely weren‚Äôt saying it was a 1 for 1 trade.
Steph Curry and Seth Curry and Mychael Mulder
who cares? go switch hunt for Seth Curry or whatever other shitty defender they have to run to compensate for Ben's lack of halfcourt offense
"Seems fair to me. With all his faults, Simmons is a special player, and with a leader like Dame, I can see him really developing. But in that deal, we would need to take Seth Curry back. And remember those firsts would be in the twenties, so they aren't super valuable."
"I mean, yeah‚Ä¶.  The fourth and fifth men would be pretty much average starters.  Joe Ingles.  Duncan Robinson.  Lonzo Ball.  Seth Curry.  Clint Capela.  Mikal Bridges.  Evan Fournier.  Nance.  Gary Trent.  An average starter would be somebody who‚Äôs serviceable on the court, who won‚Äôt win you games singlehandedly but contribute to the overall team.  Do I need to continue?  You need to get off 2k and start actually watching basketball, because your take is braindead."
"Garland shoots significantly more jumpers off the dribble than Sexton at a significantly higher percentages.  He's also shown clear signs of increasing volume and shot difficulty over the two years he's been in the league, something Sexton hasn't.  He also shoots deeper threes and has developed a pretty reliable step back three, again, things Sexton has not done.    Looking at percentages will make you think Seth and Steph Curry are similar shooters.  /u/Hairiest_Walrus"
"It was bad but not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. He's the scapegoat when there are a ton of reasons why the Sixers lost (bad coaching, Embiid turnovers and fatigue, Tobias bad games, Seth Curry defense, Simmons passivity, Danny green injury, bench doing nothing, etc."
"It‚Äôs more just that with Seth Curry either starting or playing a decent role in the SG position, the Sixers would need a decent defender at PG so that they weren‚Äôt abused in that aspect, especially with them losing a DPOY candidate in Simmons and Tobi being a poor defender as well.   I totally see your point but I just feel like CJ, though not being quite as bad a defender as he‚Äôs made out to be, would open up new problems for the 76ers while a healthy Brogdon (not the most likely i guess) would offer a more consistently decent level of play on both sides of the ball, something the 76ers have desperately needed for years.  Looking at the scoring stats for last season, maybe a 23 ppg CJ would be a lot more helpful as they really only have Joel and Tobi putting up really solid scoring numbers."
I hate everyone on the Suns except for Ayton.   I hate everyone on the Sixers except Seth Curry.
"There‚Äôs no need to be aggressive. You shouldn‚Äôt attempt to discuss basketball if you‚Äôre going to get defensive over someone disagreeing with you.  Yes I understand that Steph and Klay play a huge part in Draymond‚Äôs playmaking. But following that same logic, considering the Cavs wouldn‚Äôt have anyone near Steph or Klay in that regard (and no, Garland won‚Äôt be close), then that would mitigate how impactful Simmons can be as a half court playmaker.  &gt;On Philly you have Joel camped in the paint the majority of the game and multiple bodies down low to limit his game‚Ä¶  I fail to see how a lineup consisting of Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen offers *more* spacing than a lineup consisting of Seth Curry and Joel Embiid. Curry is a much better shooter than Garland, and Embiid at least shoots the three a little where Allen doesn‚Äôt at all. In fact, a starting lineup with Simmons, Allen and Mobley might just be the worst spacing lineup in the league. There offence would almost certainly be last in the league."
"Currently he is, he's kind of like what Seth Curry is for the Sixers right now and has been extremely clutch except for that one miss in the other OKC game  It's crazy how big the gap was between him and Westbrook in 17/18 on OKC and somehow Melo is way better now than he was then despite his age"
"The more I watch Curry, the more I'm convinced that getting CJ (and Covington) might be the best move for this team.   A strating 5 of Maxey, CJ, Covington, Harris and Embiid, with Milton, Seth, Thybulle, Korkmaz and Drummond coming off the bench. That's a championship contender"
SETH CURRY AINT NO SPOT UP SHOOTER
I was listening to Ryen Russillo podcast recently and he referred to Seth Curry as a ‚ÄúCJ McCollum lite‚Äù because he‚Äôs more than a shooter now and can occasionally take guys off the dribble.
Seth Curry though
"Seth ""The Closer"" Curry"
God dam I love Seth Curry
Dude I was there tonight we cared way more about booing Drummond and supporting our guys. We picking in the lottery again no doubt and I hope it is top 5 and we can add another impact guy.   I have no problem with guys knocking the rust off and Cade looks great aside from his shot not falling right now but you are god damn right we cheered every make for our guy and the rest. I‚Äôm hopeful for the future and Cade is a huge part of that.   Other than that place was mad empty we sat lower bowl corner for 20 a piece good time to be in town and see Seth Curry hit everything against us.
"Anyone impressed with how much Seth Curry seems to have improved? His production is crazy this year, he‚Äôs getting a huge contract after the season."
"The way Seth Curry has stepped up this season, he‚Äôs gonna get a crazy extension after this season. It‚Äôs impressive to see how much his production has increased."
Franchise cornerstone Seth Curry
The worst part is this is like the 3rd worst mistake...  1. Hiring Kidd  2. KP trade and max without injury protections  3. Seth Curry for Josh Richardson
Seth Curry-Josh Richardson trade looking worse &amp; worse by the game
Hot take:   Trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson did not work out in our favor
"Seth curry is scorching the nets, holy shit."
Really need the replay when he dropped Seth Curry with the crossover. Happened shortly before this.
Why the FUCK did we trade away Seth Curry?
Seth Curry for Josh Richardson is criminal negligence by the Dallas front office.
Seth Curry a bucket now huh
Looks like Seth curry grew up shooting Wilson balls
"Kelly ""Steph 'Seth Curry' Curry"" Olynyk"
Seth curry is insane. Top 30 nba player
How has seth curry managed to randomly get better each season suddenly
Seth Curry the Sixers franchise player now wow
seth curry most improved player book it
"Seth Curry didn't become a starter until he was 30, now he's on track for his best season ever. It's not common, but it can happen if guys stay ready and maximize their best skills."
"Seth Curry such a valuable pick, and he keeps getting thrown all over the place. And its not like he's ever underperformed offensively either.  Too bad about your coach tho."
"Since AI. The major candidates since are Lou Williams and Jrue Holiday.  Here are their best scoring seasons on the Sixers taking both volume and efficiency into account.  **9-10 Lou Williams:**  14 ppg on 47/34/82 58%TS  One other season with 14.9 ppg but his TS was sub-50  **12-13 Jrue Holiday**  17.7 ppg on 43/37/75 50% TS  **20-21 Seth Curry (8 games)**  17.1 ppg on 61/54/85 76% TS  You could make the argument that he is a worse ""scorer"" because a lot of his shots are assisted:  **Assist rates:**  Lou 2pt% 34 3pt% 89  Jrue: 2pt% 25 3pt% 47  Curry: 2pt% 57 3pt% 86  However, I would argue his absurd efficiency still puts him over the top. I am also of the camp that moving offball is a form of shot creation. Tbf, I don't think this is sustainable over the course of the entire season. I see him dropping to somewhere to 15-16ppg on 45+% on 3s which is still absurd."
"Seth Curry was missing as well, he played a quarter and then went out with an injury.  Your excuse doesn‚Äôt hold up, we literally saw how the Sixers would play without Embiid and they were still much better than Portland.  Overall Embiid has been in a slump too but they are 6-2 beating some good teams.  Meanwhile Portland hardly looks playoff caliber."
Seth Curry
seth curry
Seth Curry
Seth Curry and his 74% eFG is the best guard scorer Philly has had since.....man not the highest bar at all but its been a while
Niang and Seth Curry are the new splash brothers
Imagine not saying Seth Curry üò¨
"Seth Curry was killing us on the Embiid PnR last night. He's good, but a higher tier player would be so good with him."
Seth Curry
"As you say there have been many trades that have been worse. The Knicks gave up first round picks for Bargnani. The infamous Nets trade isn‚Äôt even a decade old.   It‚Äôs bad trade but, Seth Curry is a nice rotation player. He‚Äôs not changing the trajectory of your franchise."
"If you follow some nba players on twitch, you will be surprised how less impact they have.  Most get around 100 viewers. Seth Curry was streaming like for 30 viewers. Aaron Gordon got for sponsored streams with other streamers like 500 viewers.  Only Dev Booker had over 1k viewers, but also because he played consistently with other popular streamers/content creators."
Seth Curry has to be in the mix. W/o Ben Simmons they are leaning on him more in the offense and he is delivering.
"Yeah mavs had fine offense and bad defense, you give a little bit of offense and add a little more defense and you win win, offense wont suck csuse jrich wasnt as bad on offense as it was in dallas and was decent def better than seth curry"

"Cool theory, but suggesting that Ben Simmons is ""Giannis with better court vision"" is laughably disrespectful to Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Simmons with confidence would be a bit better than he is. Simmons with the work ethic of Seth Curry is possibly an all-time top 5 player. Simmons with the work ethic of Giannis Antetokounmpo is a top-5 current player.  But Simmons doesn't have the work ethic of Seth Curry or Giannis Antetokounmpo. Simmons has the work ethic of the desk clerk at the DMV who's on their fifth smoke break this hour.  Unless you didn't mean him and you were talking about Giannis down at your local Y, in which case: I don't know that guy, but I'll take it."
And then there's Seth Curry
"&gt;Seth was a great shooter for us, there‚Äôs no denying that.  I can't find in any of those comments where it says ""curry was only good bc luka was passing to him."""
Seth Curry looks like he be beating mfs up
Seth Curry makes 8 million dollars per year.   Davis Bertrans makes 16 million dollars per year.
"Seth Curry in a doc 20 years from now: ""Don't get me wrong, Alex Caruso is a great defender, but I took that personally as fuel"""
"Before this game Seth had the highest eFG% in the league for players with 15+ppg with an unreal 75% . Seth Curry has been absolutely insane this season,  wouldn't even be hard to imagine him as Embiid's new costar if he keeps this up."
Well Seth Curry and Niang are each huge liabilities in defense and if history is any indication they will be attacked relentlessly in the playoffs.  Thybulle hasn‚Äôt proven his jump shot or offensive IQ in general is reliable.   Jury is still out on Maxey but i believe in him much more than the other role players.  Edit: Drummond is much more likely to be a liability than a positive in the playoffs too.
Not a Seth Curry. He was undrafted.
"6'5, good build to be a much better 3&amp;D guy than Seth Curry but dude's been on a steady annual decline ever since leaving Miami.  Doesn't even get the minutes on the Celts now."
Broke: sixers need simmons and harris   Woke: Niang is the second coming of every great player ever and Seth Curry is Steph but better
"It's not all about the quality of players.  Salary and years are more important to teams.  Prioritizing salary and years allows you to take big swings in free agency where you can, theoretically (but not in Dallas), get something big for nothing in return.    Even if the Mavs kept Seth instead of trading him for Richardson, they would have just traded Seth before this season because they needed the cap space to pursue Lowry (and because they didn't want to attach a 1st to Powell to get off his salary, plus they value Maxi too much to dump him for a free agency gamble).  The Mavs expected Richardson to play well enough to opt out of his contract for this season, thus clearing enough space to sign Lowry.  Instead, Richardson opted in and they got Moses Brown back.  So the Mavs chose Tyler Bey, Moses Brown, and a non-zero chance at Kyle Lowry over Seth Curry and no chance at Kyle Lowry.  That's a neutral trade and certainly not one of the worst trades in the last decade."
"We did pass him the ball. He was one of 3 players that could dribble the ball for more than 2 seconds without losing it and all time great shooter and we still traded him.  No idea why we let Morey or whoever was in charge at the Sixers to fleece us like that. There have been so many bad trades and horrible decisions in the last couple of years but the Seth Curry one is special. That shit stings as an all time league history horrible trade.  And this isnt even talking in hindsight. Man was SUPER good for us too. I didnt even know who jrich was before we traded but i was expecting some strong ass dude with insane defense, u know some Kawhi leonard body type with how the trade was set up but nope this little cat with a super awkward shot comes in and was supposed to transcend our defense??? Get the fuck out of here  fuck donnie nelson and whoever yessed this deal"
"2nd picks can turn into anything, you could even get a Seth Curry!"
If you want some good shit you should look up that time the Mavs traded Seth curry to the 6ers for josh Richardson
Seth Curry has been carrying us
Seth Curry and two 2nd round picks
Imagine comparing the nets Celtics trade or the thunder trading james harden to freaking Seth curry lol
If this mavs team had seth curry and clint capela they'd be legit contenders. Wouldn't even need tingus pingus
Seth ‚ÄúSteph‚Äù Curry
Seth Curry is so god damned good. Almost makes up for Fultz.
"He means Seth ""Big Fella"" Curry"
"Josh Richardson for Seth Curry, who says no?"
"I never want to play DeMar again, Jesus Christ. Dude is an absolute killer.  Insane play by Embiid to get that block, thank god Doc actually challenged.  Seth Curry really fucked around and hit his prime at 31 years old. What a beast."
Gimme 7 games of that in May!   Bulls are legit and we‚Äôre deep AF.   We have the best Curry in the league no doubt! Ain‚Äôt gotta worry if Seth gonna score in the 4th. He ain‚Äôt no bitch.
"This Sixers team is being carried by their amazing role players, and that‚Äôs not something I foresaw going into the season. I feel dirty calling Seth Curry a ‚Äúrole player‚Äù because he means so much to this team, but Korkmaz, Thybulle, Drummond, and especially Niang have been terrific as well"
"Seth was the best Curry brother today, their bench outscored ours by 17 and we shot 30% from 3 and we still made it really close. Happy with it. We'll get them on Saturday."
seth curry for josh richardson is an all time trade
Seth curry is so fucking good bro
Splash Brothers 2.0: Seth Curry and Georges Niang
Will never understand the Mavs trading us Seth Curry for JRich.
Remember when the Mavs gave us Seth Curry for Josh Richardson?   Lolololol
Seth Curry for all-star
Throwback to when we traded Josh Richardson for Seth Fucking Curry
Why did Mavericks get rid of Seth curry again?
SETH CURRY
Seth Curry putting the team on his back tho
"Seth ""Steph"" Curry"
Bro Seth Curry is so good wtf
Seth Curry best Curry.
"When Seth curry is makin shit like that,, its curtains"
Imagine trading Seth curry for Josh Richardson
The seth curry trade is honestly astonishing
I still can't believe that the Mavs actually traded Seth Curry to the 6ers
I'm still lowkey mad the Simmons and Embiid managed to lose a game in which Seth Curry dropped 36
"Ah yes, lockdown defender Seth Curry  More of a fuck up by Lonzo tbh"
AND 1 FUCK OFF SETH CURRY
You could replace seth curry with lauri markkanen
Ummm... what? He‚Äôs also a better player than Seth Curry. So should he shoot higher percentages from 3 and from the line than him too?
"No kidding. I'm just thinking about a Holiday - Curry - LaMelo - Morris - Giannis lineup.   Need a bit more muscle? Put in one of the Lopez brothers.   Need some more shooting? Put in Seth Curry.   Need some more playmaking? Put in Lonzo.   The only real ""weakness"" is a SF that can create on their own. But when you have Giannis attacking the rim with an outlet pass to the greatest shooter of all time, who cares."
"A player like Seth Curry is not the difference maker for the current Mavs.  The Mavs shouldnt aim for 10 more wins or just to challenge another contender.  With a player like Luka, you should build a team, that is capable to go to the Finals.  They need to do much bigger steps."
And he was doing this in his first stint.  https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2017/3/1/14772636/seth-curry-has-been-freed
&gt;They would ignore him on offense when he played for Dallas. It would take games where Luka was out or Brunson was injured to show it off.  &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaRLnC2cDw  one game is a small sample size. keep in mind that thj and brunson also had their fair share of breakouts when luka was injured.   us mavs fans have always complained that seth curry was passive and wouldnt shoot unless he was open enough. so many times luka would pass to him and he'd pass out. it was no one's fault but seth that he wasnt playing better.   i am glad to see that he's playing better on philly but remember that he averaged the same stats for yall last year as he did for us. he's clearly changed as a player. he's more assertive now
"That's literally not true, you said that Seth was our 2nd best player last year even tho he wasn't on the team and he called you out for that. He didn't say whether or not he believed curry was our number 2"
"Mavs cannot draft well to save their life ( luka fell into their lap), not a free agent destination and their trades like Seth curry for j rich was surprising to say the least. Add in Kidd was a horrible appointment imo. I can't see luka winning anything in his time there unless something drastically changes. Add in their biggest signing in the last 5 years can't stay healthy and is basically a spot up 3 point shooter"
"Imagine they had someone like Seth Curry, they would look amazing and give a challenge to any contender"
and the seth curry trade  and the harrison barnes trade
"KP was a bust, we didn't draft well and Rick isn't a coach known for developing rookies, the Seth curry trade was awful, and we are unable to attract a lot a free agents. I still don't get why the front office was unable to bring in a secondary play maker and a decent center. I hope Nico Harrison will do moves next winter"
"Hope he follows the Seth Curry route, eventually catches on as a solid starter."
"I'm not trying to say Seth didn't do a sweet package here, I'm just honestly baffled how, in 30 years...""one of the best plays I've ever seen"" would imply this is better than almost *ALL* of the best dunks, crossovers, alley-oops, blocks, steals, pump fakes, passes...from some of the best careers in the NBA. I've been watching the NBA for over 20 years and I think it's common for recency bias to make people forget how amazing previous players/plays were.   This is a sharp play, and if you asked is it one of the best fake outs I've seen, definitely, at least in the past 5-6 years. As far as ""sequencing"" moves goes, there are many of these that I can think of just off the top of my head. Seth Curry's brother has many and these often came against all-time great defenders. Off the top of my head:  - [Curry against Gobert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZOCU2ZzhwE) here he gets the drop on Gobert with a crossover --&gt; hesitation dribble sequence   - [Curry against Kawhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUF8MGH9Fh8) here he strings together a series of feints without the ball to try to lose Kawhi, and then pump fakes into a step-back 3-pointer  - [Curry against Clippers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP54guVj_XE) strings together splitting two defenders into a double crossover (in front -&gt; behind back) into a 180 degree step back 3-pointer.  Curry has many other sequences those are just the ones that occur to me most often.    Kyrie Irving has many memorable sequences: - Vs LAL: https://youtu.be/vT22q0eclyg?t=19 - Vs WAS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpSdLwz10Cs - Vs Team USA: https://youtu.be/a9MfQKnvEkk?t=5 - Vs POR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC0BukoeRQ - Vs MIL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZhpHvTmsmk  Honestly there are so many players who are crafty wizards with the ball and string together moves every night. Just google highlights of skill players like Luka, Kyrie, Joey Crawford, CP3, etc. Almost anyone who is not super athletic and uses moves and tricks to get shots off instead of just jumping over a dude or blowing by him."
"You are right, Seth Curry has a great shot at winning MVP this year."
Seth Curry put OG on to scarves confirmed.
I think they were just too aggressive in trying to field an explosive scoring style offense. Gave up too much defensively for more offensive firepower. The analytics probably weighed heavy into their personnel decision making. Can‚Äôt blame them when you have a talent like Luka that can facilitate for an entire offense though.   The Seth Curry-to-Josh Richardson was really the only clear debacle that the Mavs have made.  THJ is and has been exactly the player that people love and hate. When he catches fire he can win a game by himself but for the most part he‚Äôs an inefficient chucker that doesn‚Äôt do much without the green light. Porzingis on paper was supposed to be a great fit. Shot blocking big that can stretch the floor‚Ä¶but his overall health and inability to consistently create offense for himself made him a bit of a risky acquisition. Powell was looking like a very good player until he blew out his knee and Kleber + DFS are exactly the glue guys you need on a roster.  The Mavs can beat anyone in the league when Doncic + THJ are super efficient  in their FG%/TO. They have enough offense to outscore even the best of teams. In a 7 game playoff series? Unlikely you can maintain that type of reliability offensively to make up for the lack of defensive prowess.
Seth curry?
"By that logic we should just trade him to anyone who can contribute. I don't think its smart to view it that way. The teams success has been in large part due to Simmons, we have 4 years of evidence of that. If we are to be a really good team and get back to those levels of 50+ wins each season we need defensive reenforcement, especially on the wing. It's not really a negotiable part of a Simmons deal, either from Portland or a 3rd team we'd need defense.  If our guards are Maxey, CJ, Seth Curry, Shake Milton and Danny Green we'd get cooked lol"
"Steph curry is one of the biggest on-court showboats and complainers in the NBA, Seth just does his thing and keeps playing. Not sure how Seth's demeanor is less likable"
because Seth Curry went to Duke
I assumed it was because the Mavs FO thought that Tyrell Terry could eventually replace Seth Curry.
"Super underrated comment here, much like Seth Curry"
we regret it every day. we traded down from seth curry to Moses Brown
"I read that as: ""Seth Curry, bamboozling OG."""
"The Sixers lost back to backs to the Knicks and Bucks without: Embiid Harris Danny Green (for one game) Seth Curry Isaiah Joe  Literally 4/5 starters missing. And they played insane basketball. Took both the Knicks and the DEFENDING champs down to the final two minutes (Bucks game was especially tight). Even with a healthy crew, Sixers are moving the ball really well. 4-5 guys in double digits nightly.   The team is so different without Ben and clearly it's for the better."
They moved off Bullock because they wanted more offense and now they're paying the price because Fournier isn't nearly the defender that Bullock is.   Opposite thing happened when the Mavs swapped Seth Curry for Josh Richardson. Kind of funny honestly
seth curry is the greatest player in nba history
"The team is playing with joy and had the best record in the east until Matisse &amp; Embiid went out because of Covid. Not to mention missing Tobias for Covid, Seth Curry for a foot injury, Danny Green for some back shit. The team is winning despite Ben so stop wirh that nonsense. Hes a front-office problem not a team problem."
"I think i get it. It's only a guess, but I think you'd rather take OG outmuscling seth curry, rather than trying to beat Drummond on Speed. OG's going to beat Drummond to the basket, but he is fairly athletic and has made a few blocks from behind this game."
"And do you think we don't know that? We have Maxey, Thybulle, and Shake as realistic young players to trade and Seth Curry + Danny Green as salary matching positive assets. We can trade 3 firsts I'm pretty sure and Daryl is going after a star, we could pick a pretty good package together.  We're not good enough to make anyone besides Embiid untouchable. So far Maxey and Seth Curry look to have improved their game so our package is probably better at the deadline than over the summer. It's still amazing people think an NBA GM of 15+ years doesn't know this stuff..."
you also did not have Seth Curry and Maxey (at least playing this well). This years team is way different or he one of two years ago
crazy seth curry couldn't stay on a team for so long
This NBATV clown crew is shitting all over Seth Curry for some reason
"I'll take Prime Magic. You can still \*somewhat\* replicate what Steph does by surrounding Magic with 3-4 other shooters (Seth Curry, Joe Harris, JJ Reddick types; obviously none are as good as Steph). You cannot however, replicate Magic's playmaking and bb IQ."
I must be living under a rock‚Ä¶Seth Curry is shooting 54.5% from 3??
"Lol if you're tired imagine us.  I think the problem with the CJ swap is the big downgrade in defense for us, and we'd have to get that back with someone like Cov or someone on a 3rd team because we're running Seth Curry out there and CJ + Seth is just really hard to have a good defense around. A straight swap would create a lot of those problems even if it would ""shake things up"". Again that deal has probably been there if either side were that serious, but I don't think the Blazers necessarily wanted to shake things up that much and I don't think the sixers would be willing to do the deal if they didn't get defense in return, which would include more players and result int he same arguments of ""who is sending out additional pieces here?""  There's just so many hurdles I think a deal where Dame asks out in the Summer and puts up #1 on his list is more likely than the straight CJ swap lol no disrespect. Just hard to see how the two sides meet in the middle"
Three way trade:      ben simmons/seth curry/porzingis/sixers firsts to the celtics      marcus smart/time lord to the mavs      jaylen/jrich to the sixers  I think this is actually decent and probably makes the celtics better in the short run. I still don't do it if I'm the celtics tho.
"Other players that are close but under the minimum requirements:  Seth Curry 50.3%FG, 54.5%3P, 88.5%FT but currently under the required FTM.  Svi Mykhailiuk 50.8%FG, 40.0%3P, 89.5%FT but currently under the required FTM.  Let me know if there's others close on the required amount FGM, 3PM, FTM that I've missed."
 Seth Curry and Simmons for Russell is certainly not lose lose Lmfao.  Wolves would cry tears of joy if the Sixers offered that
Sixers would have a tough time starting Seth Curry and DLo together on defense
It's still Curry over Jrue by 0.4 points. Lou had seasons scoring more but on low efficiency.  Only argument is that Seth has Embiid and a competent team compared to Jrue
"J rich is a ball mover and a better ball handler/dribbler than Seth. J rich has multiple seasons with a higher APG than Curry's career best.  I can tell outside of J Rich with Philly, you never watched him play and you never watched Curry outside of Philly either"
Imagine thinking Seth Curry was the reason why we had an elite offense
"Russ on defense gets blown apart by Seth Curry and Shake Milton. On offense he doesn't initiate fast break anymore, opting to hunt the rebound and bring the ball up slow. He doesn't drive. He doesn't draw fouls. What he doesn't give away as turnovers, he gives away as shitty mid range shots.  Russ isn't the problem, but he is a problem."
bruh WB turned it over twice in a row and bricked an open 3 in the span of like 3 minutes in the 4th when it was tied up/2 pt game. he lost them the game. (tbf he did get a block in that sequence though).  what' im surprised less people are saying is seth curry was 6-6 from 3. what a champ
"Terrence Ross on Magic, Murray on Nuggets, Klay, Wiggins (I still believe in him - especially if vs OKC), DLo, PG13, Tatum or Brown (if one is injured and they get a bunch of shots), Jimmy Butler (man scored 40+ in the finals), Westbrook, Embiid, Seth Curry, Kevin Love (hot take but if healthy sure), fucking Austin Rivers, John Wall ( I‚Äôm still a believer), Donavan Mitchell, Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams"

Seth curry seems to have improved a lot and gives them something they lacked and thats an legit shooter
"It is, but Joel's gravity can not be understated. Our only loss was without Joel this season, and it's clear because we basically run our entire offensive scheme through him: pass to Jo, if it's a one-on-one, let him feast, if they double him, he passes out, and we hockey pass the ball around to find the open shooter.   Joel isn't necessarily passing to the guy who will shoot directly (so not showing up as assists or in the stat sheet), but his gravity is creating amazingly open looks that are allowing guys like seth curry to have a career year so far with better 3P% then most players regular FG%. Almost all our 3s are wide open shots when Joel is on the floor it's incredible.   So he doesn't have the same direct passing ability Jokic has, his gravity is essentially creating just as many easier buckets even though they won't show up in his stats as assists. He doesn't get stat assists but the eye test shows that any time he passes out of double team, he may not be the last to pass before the ball finds the open man, but he is the reason we got a man open to begin with.   Combine with defensive prowess and pretty close offensive numbers, as well as better team record so far and me being a homer, I'm so far putting Embiid a bit above Jokic this year (and homer may I be, I had Jokic over Embiid last year)."
Seth was on fire tonight. Curry bois special
Legend has it that Seth Curry and Steph Curry will always have indirectly proportional stat lines.
So let‚Äôs say they have the same contract. You rather have Seth than Steph Curry?
SETH IS THE ONLY CURRY! SETH IS THE ONLY CURRY!
Seth Curry is still shooting 100%.
"Ehhh, it's early and Seth is older and has a risky injury history. Either way, the Mavs desperately needed better defense and the Sixers desperately needed spacing. Richardson is also a good scorer and has some playmaking ability.   I think the Mavs are better off with a versatile defender when they already have great spacing and a terrific offense without Curry, and their ideal closing lineup should have defenders next to Luka.      They're also gonna look a lot better when Porzingis is back. Luka, JRich, Hardaway, Finney-Smith, and KP is excellent for switching and spacing."
Do you realize the top two lineups the Mavs had last year point differential wise didn‚Äôt even include curry?  I like Seth a lot don‚Äôt make me talk shit on him but you‚Äôre going way overboard.
"Not disagreeing that he improves the offensive spacing and what‚Äôs not to like about Seth.   But the top two point differential lineups the Mavs had last year didn‚Äôt include Seth Curry, and like I said in the other post he couldn‚Äôt start in clutch time next to Luka."
No didn‚Äôt you know. Us losing Seth Curry was way more detrimental to our offense than missing KP. And 3 pointers are the most important thing ever to an NBA team!
Seth curry better lol
Cool and? We traded a 3 point specialist for a player that is much better defensively. No fucking duh our 3 point percentage would dip when we got rid of Seth Curry lol. 3 pointers aren‚Äôt the only thing in the NBA
Seth Curry 6/7 3Ps. Bruh.
"We'll just have to see. I think that makes sense   At the same time, i think Shake will close games in a lot of matchups. Better defense now that he's gained weight, better creator, and still a very good shooter.  It will depend what they need, but the overall construct is so much better. If Josh and Danny Green are about the same type and level and contract,  then we exchanged Horford for Seth Curry plus an improved Shake - holy shit."
"Seth ""the better"" Curry"
"Shooting yeah, but his gravity is insane. Seth Curry was 5-5 in the first quarter and although Ben and the system deserve credit as well, the fact that Embiid was doubled on every post possession has to be mentioned.   They are not a good defensive team, but Seth is seeing more open shots than he ever has in his career."
"Curry has a bit of a slower trigger than JJ, also JJ is one of one in guys that can sprint full speed into a dribble hand off and nail a 3 with all that momentum.  but i agree Seth can do more on-ball than JJ forsure."
"We really missed what JJ Redick brought to the table last season. J Rich in a vacuum may be an overall better player than Redick and Curry especially when you consider defense, but he really didn't fit in the Sixers offense at all. Seth is an even better version of JJ Redick and it shows with how much better our offense looks this season so far."
&gt;Seth Curry in tonight's win against the sixers:  bro beat himself
"I've been a fan of Seth Curry since the kings, he has gotten better every year. As a heat fan I was not too pleased when I heard he was joining the 76ers. It's a perfect fit, 76ers are gonna be dangerous this year."
"Seth Curry has basically been the key to unlocking this lineup. He‚Äôs the perfect partner for both Joel and Ben, for Jo bc he runs the two-man game so well and threatens with his ridiculous shooting, for Ben bc, again, he‚Äôs a sniper either off the dribble or off the catch/screen, but also bc he allows Ben to roam a bit more off ball thanks to his solid ballhandling and playmaking."
Seth Curry is just so smooth on the offensive end. And it‚Äôs not just his shooting
Dude. Mavericks bros. WTF? Did we rip you off in that trade or whats going on? Seth Curry has been absolutely insane these past few games.
Beal MIA in 4q. Embiid MVP talk is real. Seth Curry is a fucking baller.
seth curry cray
I know people said Jrich is a better player but Curry is just a better fit for Philly.. but I kinda think Jrich‚Äôs offensive frustrations just make him a worse player than Seth in the 2021 NBA
That Seth Curry contract looking like solid gold. I miss him :(
Seth Curry where have you been all my life
But is he better than Shake Milton+Seth Curry?
he's doing a great job getting up the floor early and sealing his guy deep  also seth curry is the greatest shooter of all time
*It‚Äôs crazy that Seth Curry has a brother in this league that‚Äôs actually good.
Seth curry is unironically a better shooter than this brother
Seth curry best signing/trade of this off-season.
SETH FUCKING CURRY
*Curry Thanksgiving Dinner*  Seth: Hey bro don't forget to drink a lot of water during this meal  Steph: Why?   Seth: I just know you're liable to choke during big events. You know? Unlike me. *flashes FMVP trophy*
Seth Curry
first time watching the NBA Is seth curry the best player in the league
Seth Curry 5/5 from three in just 10 minutes? Oh my
seth 'the real curry' curry
Seth curry on pace for 72
"Yea, I am at a loss of why they offered Harris full max and not jimmy butler when they let go of convingtonw for him!  Outside of that these guys seem totally committed to bringing a ring.  Goes to show that these often faceless unaccountable guys can quietly dismantle a cities hopes while taking max profit from us. They are far more replaceable then the star talent and I‚Äôm on the team of #tradetillmaninstead in Houston thus so   Paying Daryl more then rockets right after and telling China and Tillman you can go eat rocks out em over the top and love Seth curry add on!"
Watching Seth Curry feels like watching Steph Curry when your baseline comparison is last season lol
Not even talking specifically about Jaylen but Boston fans seem so sensitive about it. Guards in general just aren't getting that high FG% especially not on high volume.   Tobias Harris and Seth Curry aren't going to be shooting 47% and 54% from 3 either.
"Lowry is 100% not as good a shooter as Seth Curry, who has the second best career three-point shooting percentage of all time. Agreed on the other points, but I think Lowry‚Äôs next contract would be too expensive for the Sixers."
I'm also not sure that a 33 year old Danny Green and Seth Curry are two players every team would love to have as starters. At least not title contending teams.
"I mean, the Sixers have  3 max players but also have a very solid supporting cast. Seth Curry, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, all of those are players any fan would love to have on their team."
"I still find it pretty funny just how much basketball there is in the Curry family and their relations.  Steph and Seth playing in the league, Dell used to play, Lee married to Sydel, and Seth married to Doc Rivers' daughter.  There's NBA connections everywhere with that family."
here comes seth curry
The Hawks are just raining threes here but imagine your second best player taking fewer shots than Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey in a playoff game lmao
Trae &gt; Curry and it isn't close!  Seth hasn't made a single 3
At some point doc has to trust thybulle enough to play more mins. He's ideal for this series. Defend quick guards and shoot 3s. Especially if you have guys like Seth curry who are great shooters but defensive liability or when DG is getting exploited or on a shooting slum
Seth curry can‚Äôt hit open threes right now.
steph curry should step in for seth curry
"Almost had dell curry/Seth and Steph. And Greg Anthony/coke Anthony, but off by a year"
Just got a preview of how Seth Curry would shoot if on the Lakers
"Seth Curry is ""We have Trae Young at home."""
The consensus on this sub was that Hawks got way better with their signings. The mavs trading away Seth curry hurt their team which everyone on this sub saw as a bad trade. Many posts here had the hawks as the 4-6 seed.
All bench lineup with Seth Curry lol doc is wylin
"I said it in the Hawks gdt but we're gonna fight over screens on Seth Curry and double Embiid and make Matisse thybulle, Ben Simmons, and Danny green beat us if we can"
Seth Curry look like a light skin Ludacris or am I trippin
"Shows how long Vince Carter been in the league, he played against Gary Trent Sr/Jr, Kenyon Martin Sr/Jr, Dell/Steph/Seth Curry, Arvydas/Domantas Sabonis and Tim Hardaway Sr/Jr."
"@OP, you should put Seth Curry on the list. He's more likely to score the highest points than is Lou Will"
Seth Curry and 34 year old Danny Green? I suppose one is 3 and D
"Because his defensive capabilities were partially (at least) dependent on his athleticism. His shooting probably won't be impacted as much (will probably be rusty but thats diff), but he *may* see a dip in defense, and thats honestly what made him one of the best wings in the league. Plenty of players can shoot and have weak defense (seth curry for example).  Compare him with Danny Green, who played under the coach obsessed with fundamentals and ""good"" basketball for almost a decade during many of their championship runs, and was a very good 3nD wing (much like Klay). His defense comes from relatively high defensive IQ and less so athleticism, which is why he was still a player who could get minutes towards the end of his career (or so).   Not to say that Klay is low IQ, but he was way more of an athletic defender."
Yeah but I was already terrified last season. I‚Äôm just stoked he doesn‚Äôt also have Seth curry this time
Plus if you keep Danny Green Seth Curry and Tobias you have awesome spacing.  Like thats a top 3 offense and Danny plus Embiid and whomever else can make you a top 10 defense easy.  That's a team that Brooklyn can't beat and everyone struggles with.
This is also the dude that shits on seth curry. Why do I even open shit like this lmao
Aggressive Simmons is better for the defense when you have Danny green and Seth Curry in the corners
"This. Scoring guards that can shoot all flourish under Stotts because he gives them the green light to get shots in various ways.  Shabazz Napier had a career resurgence with Portland. Allen Crabbe had success with Portland, and has struggled outside of Portland. Gary Trent Jr developed in Portland. Jake Layman, Seth Curry,   It hasn't worked out every time though with guys like Mario Hezonja and Nik Stauskas."
&gt; not a fan of PG because I‚Äôve been a fan of Seth Curry  you're seriously mad at a guy for cheating on a girl that a guy you like ended up marrying?  wtf?
"Probably should've held on to Seth Curry. Not sure what they got out of not keeping him though, maybe it was worth letting him go"
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
"The roster overall isn't built to win a ship. Definitely some nice pieces but overall it's lacking. Nurkic needs to step it up to the next level, and it sucks he broke his leg a few seasons ago because it really seemed like he was ascending to another level. CJ is good, but he seems like a better version of Seth Curry, and just doesn't do enough to warrant being a #2 option. I think he would be better suited as a #3."
Member Seth Curry
JRich smh. Sixers won that Seth Curry trade
Imagine if they replaced Richardson with Seth Curry
"If they can get past the nets then definitely but I dont see that happening. The sixers are a good team and their roster works, it's all just up to if people like Ben simmons danny green and Seth curry come through. They don't have to be dropping 20 every night but If they are inconsistent then sixers are gonna get dropped"
I have the hawks taking y'all out in 6. Without Embiid this team can't win. Unless tobias harris or seth curry step up in scoring and ben simmons locks down trae I don't see them winning.
seth curry
Seth curry
Seth Curry will continue the trend
Seth Curry slander not tolerated
Curry will be this year trust Seth
Maybe Seth Curry can make it in his brother's place.
Seth Curry ain‚Äôt out of it yet
Oh they'll be a Curry. Seth.
Umm.. Seth Curry would like a word.
"I could be wrong but Rondo or Seth Curry could‚Äôve been a better fit right?  I just saw Schroder‚Äôs post game interview where he literally tears up and his voice breaks like he‚Äôs about to cry. Damn, it actually does seem like he wants to be with LBJ/AD as a Laker.  He said he took down LA PG because of all the hate he and his family got from some Fans.   He also said he turned down $84Mill contract not because of the money BUT because he wanted to avoid getting traded and not having a day of where he‚Äôll end up.  As much as we hate his performance vs Suns gotta give him Kudos for fighting hard &amp; showing love for the team.   I don‚Äôt know if his statement is true but it seems legit. He seems dejected and broken at the realization he might be done in LA.   https://youtu.be/16VnCZz5P5g"

"I'm trying to imagine what the team would look like. I would expect blazers would also want Thybulle / Maxey / Reed / Joe and picks.  Starters: Simmons / CJ / Cov / Nurk / Powell  Bench: Jones jr/ Simons / Little / Thybulle / Maxey / Reed / Joe.  Maybe to sweeten the pot they trade Jones Jr for Seth Curry too. Possibly CJ for tobias, just to mix things up more. I dunno. It'd have to be a big big trade. Dame is a beast."
Seth curry if the sixers make it
Seth Curry still exist
C‚Äômon Seth curry
Might have Seth Curry (higher career 3pt% than his brother) or Mike James (way better than Lebron) tbh
Seth Curry just dripped 30
Seth Curry?
"I think looking at averages is more valuable than considering a single game. Corey Brewer dropped 51 points once.  Off the top of my head, Joe Harris and Seth Curry are probably better from deep."
Seth Curry boutta keep the streak going ü§ß
BRO that's what I was saying. Seth Curry isn't half his brother BUT he's better than Schroder and he can at least hit 3s which we desperately needed.  &amp;#x200B;  The sad thing is we could've had Seth.
"For who? I think we should get rid of Drummond and Kuz for Seth curry, and a second rounder and then sign two experienced wings from Europe"
"It‚Äôs hard thinking about the talent we were willing to give up over the years. Wes left, then CJ came off the bench. CJ broke out, then we let will Barton go. We let Connaughton go. We had Seth Curry off the bench. He‚Äôs got greener pastures. Then we lose Hood and Trent Jr for some help on the wings. But damn. Simmons will break out as a SG in the absence of CJ, but damnit if we didn‚Äôt have enough talent to sell high."
seth curry
seth curry will be there
Facts. He would've been a key veteran asset that could've helped with AD out.   &amp;#x200B;  We could've also had Seth Curry but didn't want to trade KCP for him.
"Getting rid of Gary Trent Jr and Seth Curry were pretty awful moves, both of those guys could‚Äôve had a huge impact in this series"
"SETH CURRY, DAME TRADE STRAIGHT UP. GO PHILLY!"
In my opinion it has got to be Tatum. Or Jokic. Ok it‚Äôs absolutely for sure Doncic because Lebron James is the greatest of all time. Steph/Seth Curry cant miss and thats why he is the best player on the planet right now. Campazzo is the best player under 6ft tall for sure. And if we really think hard about it... nobody has ever come close to Leonard.
Upvoted for your confidence but I have faith in Mavs legend Seth Curry
seth curry
Dude are you actually arguing 5 minutes os JRich making a couple free throws at the end of the game is more valuable than Seth curry
"PELINKA ARE YOU WATCHING THE TEAM YOU BUILT HOMIE? Make sure you keep watching, don't look away. You totally F'd up by letting Rondo/McGee/Dwight walk and by not brining any shooters.  &amp;#x200B;  Pelinka settled for KCP... could've had Seth Curry."
"Jae ""Seth ""Steph Curry"" Curry"" Crowder"
"Sixers just because of the injury problems Embiid has.  Defenders like Simmons, Thybelle, Green and Howard are enough to beat any team led by Luka on offense while he is surrounded by shooters like Seth Curry, Green, Korkmaz and a 2nd option in Tobias Harris."
"Michael ""Seth ""Steph Curry"" Curry"" Porter Jr in da house."
"Seth ""The Real Curry"" Curry need to be on this lakers team"
Seth and Dennis don‚Äôt have the same game though. The Lakers wanted a ball handler who could create his own offense so LeBron didn‚Äôt have to playmake every single possession. It‚Äôs why Rondo was so important last offseason. Imagine something like Kyrie in Cleveland (although Lakers are trying to get the Walmart brand version).   Schroder is just inconsistent and his efficiency dropped being a starter vs the 6th man. Schroder sometimes fills the role when he can his shot is falling and he just runs past his defender for a layup but he doesn‚Äôt do it night to night. And he‚Äôs not a good enough playmaker to keep getting touches if he isn‚Äôt scoring.  Seth Curry would have been a great addition I just don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve been in the same role Dennis is in. Curry would have been used pretty close to KCP I imagine.
Seth Curry is definitely the Evil Curry
They barely ever got Neto or Ish the ball to attack. So maybe it's Beal and Westbrook fault for not giving them the chance.  Neto and Ish could've done anything they wanted with Seth Curry guarding him. Wiz just played 4v5.
I always thought he was a pretty good signing but as a 6th man not starter. He's way too inconsistent and has tunnel vision. Honestly the Lakers should've gone after Seth Curry cause he seems like an ideal LeBron teammate.
"Yeah I mean Hardaway got pretty hot towards the end of this year and played well this series, but it‚Äôs just criminal that he‚Äôs the second scoring option on this team right now. And even he was in and out of the starting lineup throughout the year. Getting rid of Seth Curry was stupid. I know what we were looking for but Josh Richardson has not been it. Kleber is pretty tough to watch at times. I do love Brunson and DFS though.  KP is obviously the elephant in the room. Some people have said the Clippers are a bad matchup for him so all I can really do for now is hope that we advance and he can find a groove in the next series because he just has to do more given his contract and what he‚Äôs supposed to be for this team. He was still solid through the regular season and even for the limited time he played in the bubble series last year he was playing really fierce. I just have to think he‚Äôs worried about injuries. I so badly want to believe in him and for it to work but it‚Äôs just not grooving right now and he and Luka have zero chemistry."
"We don't really have any other lead guard playmakers on this team (besides Tyrese Maxey who is a rookie and still pretty rough around the edges). Seth curry, Tobias, Shake, korkmaz are all secondary playmaker types. I mean, we had Danny Green bringing the ball up the floor at one point this season with Ben and a handful of other players in the COVID protocol. George Hill should help with that but he is not the player he used to be. In a way we still have a Markelle Fultz / Jimmy Butler sized hole in our roster from a perimeter offensive initiator perspective"
"30 point games have become increasingly normal. Even role players have done it fairly oftenly lately and if you‚Äôre a star, scoring 30 is actually stupid common   Back in the day, a role player scoring 30 would be rare as hell. Someone like Seth Curry dropping 30 points in a playoff game would be an insanely huge deal.   You definitely haven‚Äôt watched ball for very long. Cause you‚Äôd know this isn‚Äôt how things used to go"
"KP has just not stepped up this series. I think he‚Äôs really afraid of getting hurt again because he got hot last year and started the playoff series in the bubble pretty fierce.  We shouldn‚Äôt have traded Seth Curry. Hardaway is a solid contributor but just can‚Äôt be relied on the create. The roster overall is pretty solid but there‚Äôs just not another player that is a true offensive threat that can create like Luka, so he has to do it all."

$80 million Bertans.  $32 million Seth Curry.   Ayy lmao
Lol because Seth Curry or Tobias Harris or Danny Green gonna pull dirty shit. You don‚Äôt believe that yourself.
"Seth Curry, duh"
Did you know Seth Curry is married to his coach's daughter?
I think really just the Mavs in general got destroyed on defense last year. You're definitely right that Seth didn't help but the Clippers were just as good on offense when Seth was on the bench.  [Curry On/Off](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryse01/on-off/2020)
We traded Seth curry for a guy who's useless at everything besides free throw shooting
I kinda miss Seth Curry
I read it as Seth Curry and was wondering why you even asked this.
I‚Äôm still mad they gave away Seth curry
Imagine if the Mavs had Seth Curry instead of Richardson.
Lol my posts ranting on Seth Curry defense. I am saying Doc replaced Seth with Raul Neto. Exploit Raul Neto.
Seth Curry would‚Äôve been nice on the Mavs tonight.
Meanwhile Seth curry just dropped 30 lol
Luka vs Clippers is so frustrating to watch. I would kill for a Seth Curry rn
"The more posts you make about Seth curry, the more his power grows"
Man if Mavs can get shooters like Seth Curry instead of Richardson on th bench it would be good In this situation.
Josh Richardson is awful. Can't believe they gave up Seth Curry for him.
"Especially after tonight, I think Seth (the better curry) wants to stay long term."
Could really use Seth Curry right now.
Mavs should have kept Seth Curry.
Seth curry would have been great for this moment
Imagine trading Seth curry thinking trey Burke is the solution
Well they did trade Seth curry for josh Richardson which was a terrible trade at the time and now even worse
The Sixers wont survive when Russell Westbrook runs down the tunnel in the 3rd of the next game and puts Seth Curry in a DDP Diamond Cutter
100% agree minus Seth Curry
"I hate when people downvote the shit out of posts like this.  The dude tried.  Don't downvote because you disagree.  Learn to use reddit before you start downvoting stuff.  That said, I don't think we'd be keeping green as a starter.  Unless Seth got traded, he's definately above Green.  I'd love Green as a bench piece next year... but no way he'd be starting over Seth Curry."
who can forget his son-in-law seth curry
YOU LEAVE SETH CURRY ALONE!  Edit: damn where‚Äôs my Sixers flair? Lol
Seth Curry is not a point guard.
That just means Schroeder isn‚Äôt worth $84m/4 years. Rather get a Covington or Korver at that price or a Seth Curry or Marcus Smart at that price.
No. Would get played off the floor defensively.  Release would be too slow combined with height to ever get a shot off.  Seth Curry on a bad day is borderline unplayable.
She married Seth Curry‚Ä¶  &amp; minding your business isn‚Äôt about knowing it‚Äôs about not hating someone for what happens in their home.
Seth Curry.
"In my opinion, point guards are probably the most saturated position when it comes to talent. There are so many talented point guards around the league and unless you think your guard is a star or superstar, the drop off in the middle of the pack guys is not much.  For non-stars, I think you can get serviceable guards for under $15mil/year but even then, there's so many good guards that you can probably pick one up for less than that.  Derrick Rose, Cam Payne, Forbes, Seth Curry, Dragic, George Hill, and many others can probably give you similar or slightly less production than Schroeder and for half the price."
Do you not know about Seth Curry? Or are you just saying he‚Äôs not a ‚Äústar‚Äù?
"The Embiid/Harris duo is nasty! They definitely have a shot against KD/Irving. It'll come down to the role players like Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons and Seth Curry and of course whether or not James Harden comes back"
Dude you‚Äôve played Washington and Atlanta neither of those are good defenses lol and Atlanta doesn‚Äôt have its two best perimeter defenders in reddish and Deandre hunter.   Also the biggest difference will be that guys like Seth curry and kork are gonna get ran over on defense when kyrie and harden take turns beating up on them. If you wanna go thybulle then you make our job easier on defense because we can ignore him and Simmons and pack the paint.   Yeah the sizers are gonna score a lot but so are the nets.  Also Deandre doesn‚Äôt help us he still can‚Äôt guard Embiid one on one and he kills our offense. It‚Äôs possible we try him if we‚Äôre getting hurt but he probably won‚Äôt be our first adjustment
"beautiful basketball play, seth curry setting the unexpected pick from behind, tobi running in the counter direction as a distraction and furkan on the three point line as a B option"
"Somebody askewd for my reasons, so here it is:   &amp;#x200B;  1. Derrick Rose - His pure love and respect of the game is just visible.  2. Chris Paul - It's the only thing that's missing in his HOF career.   3. Seth Curry - He's worked hard and made his own path. Same the Gasols for me.  4. Joe Ingles - He's quite a character, foreign impact, a sportsman.  5. Jordan Clarkson - He's an inspiration to aspiring Filipinos (A little bias cause I am), and him embracing the second squad roles is something young guys can learn from."
I‚Äôm being obtuse? The guys you listed are all thoroughly outplaying the guys i referenced. MPJ is in the same role as Seth Curry because he can‚Äôt create anything for himself and relies purely on outside shooting. Tobias is a solid three level scorer and a  fringe all star and you‚Äôre comparing him to jamychal green and monte Morris who are both bench players. The start of this argument is you saying Embiid has had a better fg% and then saying he has no offensive help. Regular season has no bearing on how a player performs in the postseason. This postseason Embiid has had objectively better teammates and has faced markedly worse teams than Jokic has. So address the argument or just admit you‚Äôre a moron who hasn‚Äôt watched a nuggets game
I am still surprised after all these years that seth curry is a legit nba player. I thought it was a gimmick after all the steph hype like the Giannis brothes.
Seth Curry makes the difference
"Its not a huge difference, Simmons is a complete non-factor offensively, he has no jump shot. Curry is ok but not enough to change the argument, I'd certainly pick MPJ, Rivers, Morris over Seth Curry. The sixers are a very 1 dimensional team offensively and that entire dimension is Embiid. But you can also look at the fg% of Giannis or AD and compare it to jokic' this series. Or look at their games against the suns. How come its so much higher?"
"Tobias is averaging 23 ppg and Seth curry is averaging 17 ppg, both of them on phenomenal efficiency. Embiid also has the luxury of having 2 excellent wing defender take the load off defensively so they can‚Äôt spam high PnR. So jokic is being put in every defensive action because no denver wing player is shutting down on the outside and he‚Äôs the entire offense on the other side. So, are you being willfully stupid or are you just ignorant? Not to mention Phoenix is a MUCH better team than Atlanta."
That Seth curry pick is dope
"When people don't think coaching and scheme doesn't matter, remind them that we lost Richardson and Horford and replaced them with Seth Curry and Danny Green and became a top two defense somehow."
Maybe Seth Curry too as I think about it.  The chin strap beard is basically dead around where I live and was kinda curious.
Amazing oop but can we also acknowledge Seth Curry setting a high quality screen on a center to set it up
"This is impressive, but not as impressive as Ben Simmons somehow convincing a Hawks player to double him in the post and leave Seth Curry wide open in the corner for some reason."
Damn I miss Seth curry
cheating off seth curry to help on ben simmons. Hawks with 0 iq defense
"Seth Curry 1-4 FG so far, this could be a long game"
Seth Curry.
"Bro Steph Curry hard as fuck. He literally killed my child in cold blood in the summer of 2015 and dared me to report it to the police.   I was staying at a nice beachside resort in Oakland, CA with my beautiful wife (F 24) and my immaculate daughter (F 73 months). We had been spending the days lounging on pool chairs and drinking bottomless mimosas. The television above the bar had been playing highlights of the local Warriors team (I'm not sure if you've heard of them but every TV in Oakland is actually required by law to play highlights at all times. Kinda crazy for such a small team). I've never been a big fan of the Warriors, and remarked so to my wife in passing. Little did I know that would be the moment my life changed forever.   The man behind the bar laughed at me after this comment and smirked to himself. ""The warriors are actually pretty good,"" he said, ""the kind of team that would never need super stars to join.""  I told him this was an outrageous claim and that their best player, Andre Iguodala, would never be enough to carry the team, especially with the worse of the Curry Brothers riding his coattails. My wife agreed and said that even our 73 month old daughter could see that.  The man laughed again and stepped out from behind the bar, drawing a gun. Point blank he shot three times into my darling daughter. I couldn't hear anything over my wife's screams. My blood was rushing in my ears and I felt like the world had fallen apart. The man stood over us and pushed back his hat to reveal that he was actually Stephen Curry (M 27) himself!   ""Listen chump, I'm gonna have to disagree with that assessment,"" he sneered, ""I'm definitely better than my brother Seth. And to prove that, I'm gonna go on to win 73 games this season in honor of your dumb daughter. And just when you think that nobody can stop me, I'm going to throw the finals to let you know that you lost the light of your life to a coattail riding loser. And one day, I'll come back for your wife's feet...""  Ever since that day, I've lived in constant fear of Steph Curry. I've moved out of California to Cleveland, but Lebron's move to LA, I'm not sure where I'm safe anymore and I don't know where to go. I fear for the day that Steph follows through on his promise to steal my wife's feet from under my nose.  So for those that think Steph Curry is soft or a loser, let this be a warning."
"Teams aren‚Äôt rebuilding forever. If you are the Cavs, Bulls etc and if you are looking for 3-4 contracts you should be thinking that you might be playoff team in 1-2 years, so it technically won‚Äôt be a rebuilding team far into future.  And yes you are right on that second point. It‚Äôs really up to the GM to do due diligence on the player. Role player contracts can also win you championship as well as lose them. I can think of 20+ role player signings that were immediately thought as overpaid and then worked out to be undervalued even in year one.  Some examples in the past 3-4 years: Terry Rozier, Kyle Anderson, Julius Randle, Jae Crowder (3-4 times lol), Seth Curry, PJ Tucker etc"
Didn‚Äôt he also try to pay her $1M to try to get her to get an abortion? But it‚Äôs moot now that they‚Äôre together.   Callie Rivers is now married to Seth Curry
"Dude, we are talking playoffs. Where rotations shrink, and coaching mistakes will be exploited ruthlessly. Seth Curry is taking his game to new highs, and Richardson's impact in the playoffs was about half of what it was a year ago."
Seth Curry and Josh Richardson.
"That's what the Sixers are often doing with Ben and Korkmaz, who's the only one on the team who can shoot on the move.  You need the right personnel for it, not every good shooter has that skill. Seth Curry, for example, is virtually automatic when spotting up, but worse than Kork at this particular thing."
I mean a Sixers vs Jazz finals would be lit too   Ben vs Donovan   Embiid vs Gobert   Tobias vs Bogey  Clarkson vs Seth Curry
Unless Dame becomes available there's no point.  If you trade for someone like Lavine/Beal the scoring will improve but the defense and playmaking will take a hit. The only reason the Sixers can start Seth Curry on a playoff team is because Simmons can cover for him.   Curry/Lavine or Beal backcourt will be absolutely eaten alive.
"Agreed, he is certainly not better than Seth Curry.  Good call."
"Seth Curry makes \~$8 mil per year and is an absolutely elite 3pt shooter... CJ makes \~$30 mil per year and is an above avg 3 pt shooter who can also create for himself, but doesn't really elevate the players around him. Defensively they are both below avg to avg and are essentially the same size. I would argue that having seth curry and $22 mil to sign another player would be better for both POR and PHI than having CJ."
"Yeah that whole sixers team/composition was wierd that year.   And then Morey comes in and fixes everything in like 5 minutes lol(trades Horford, and gets Danny Green/Seth Curry to fix spacing issues)"
Joe Harris and Seth Curry are up there too but I think Mikal is better cause of his defense
Yeah maybe Jingles and Seth Curry - but still Mikal by a good distance imo.
I stand by my statement and will repeat it one more time... Seth curry is 75-80% of CJ
"Seth Curry is legally allowed to come off the bench. His contract allows it.  Tobias is replaceable by a random wing making 10 million a year.   Kemba - wing X (Richardson, Warren, whatever) -Danny Green - Simmoms - Embiid is a lineup that can win, assuming Kemba is healthy.  Shake/Maxey - wing X -Danny Green - Simmons - Embiid is not much of a step down from Tobias  Very much worth the risk because Tobias very much isn't that good."
"By Kemba???  LMAO.  We already start Seth Curry, who shoots the 3 at 10% higher percent than Kemba on a contract that is $25 million cheaper per year.  You starting both Kemba and Seth at 6' and 6'2""?  I'm surprised you aren't the GM.  You got this all figured out."
"Agreed! Nets got lucky that 2 superstars wanted to team up and Brooklyn was the only big market city with the cap space. And then other players wanted to be traded there.   With the Suns, Jones traded draft picks for key players. Got the Suns one of the deepest teams in the last decade (statistically true about 2 months ago, not sure what the stats are now).  The 76ers case is that their GM hired a coach who knew how to use his players and more specifically Tobias Harris. Traded away Horfords contract and brought in Seth Curry and Danny Green.  Both Suns and 76ers GM‚Äôs deserve it more than Brooklyn‚Äôs GM."
"Lol, didn't this sub shit on my boy u/MITWestbrook for telling the Hawks to do that to Seth Curry?"
"Agree it's not worth Ben or Tobias.   Kemba is hunted? So are Steph and Trae and maybe Morant. So is Seth Curry.  He couldn't be healthy in one season.  If he has a degerative condition that's one thing. If it's  ""he couldn't stay healthy for the playoffs"", we might want to look at our own roster before dismissing players like that out of hand.  Kemba has the exact skillset we need and last year was a killer through the conference finals.  So yeah, Morey should consider it and should find out what that knee do"
"Splitting hairs, but a better blue print is the sixers. They disappointed a season ago and offloaded Horford's contract, surrounded their young homegrown core of Embiid and simmons with some solid role players and drafted quite well. Jury is still out on the Celtics most recent draft picks though but they mainly need some steady surrounding role players for the Jays. If they keep Fournier, he could be like what Harris has been for the Sixers. If the celtics could find a Seth Curry type of veteran role player that would be immense for them. BIG ifs all around obviously but seeing the sixers turn around this year with a new coach gives me hope."
Philly has 80% of CJ in Seth Curry... I don't think CJ moves the needle much for them
"might be a crazy trade, what about jrich and a 2nd for seth curry?"
"Using CBS rankings only taking American players ranked 75 or after could field a team of   PG: Derick White, Pat Bev  SG: Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry  SF: Joe Ingles, Mikel Bridges, Otto Porter  PF: PJ Tucker, Jerami Grant  C: Kevin Love  &amp;#x200B;  Team would get wrecked by the American # 1 Team, but its not bad"
But wait how big is this player? If you give Seth curry matisse thybulles body while keeping all of his offensive ability that damn near might be klay Thompson
‚ÄúReplace Ben with one of the best point guards of all time and we would be better.‚Äù  Wow. Yeah I agree with you lol.   Ben irritates the fuck out of me. But he‚Äôs not close to being one of the more overpaid players in the league and he‚Äôs not merely an elite perimeter defender.   He‚Äôs a top three defender in the league and certainly the most versatile. He‚Äôs arguably now the premier break leader in the league. And frankly he‚Äôs capable of making passes few others can at the three point line.   See the bullet to Seth Curry last night on the break.
Bucks would get swept by the 76ers    imagine performing drop coverage on Seth Curry in the playoffs
if he's poor on D he just needs complementary defenders around him. like what we did with seth curry
(Pre-injury) Klay is a much better offensive player than Seth Curry and a much worse defensive player than Thybulle.
I think he meant the other Curry. Seth.
Seth Curry been on a tear these past 3 games
"Even more context is that only like 1-2 plays before that, on a Seth Curry made 3, Gallo straight yanked Embiid to the floor under the basket and nothing was called. So Joel was still probably upset about that play, and then also upset about getting called for an offensive foul, then Gallinari also threw the shoulder a bit.  I still think this should have been a single tech for Embiid, but the tension there was building for a bit and Gallinari probably should have had a tech (or some kinda foul) on the other play anyways."
Sixers second best player is Seth Curry then? Cuz Ben Simmons sure as hell can‚Äôt play in the playoffs
Seth curry
Chuck was talking about how Seth Curry couldn't score 21 points like he did tonight again. Although he scored exactly 21 the first game.
"Seth curry getting no love, my boy is cookin !"
This guy really hates Seth Curry
Seth Curry stole his ex girlfriend or something  He writes a lot of words with a lot of numbers so everybody just pretends that he knows what he's talking about.
"Man I know they're not there for their analysis, but Chuck said the same thing. Dude said the series isn't about Embiid because he's gonna get his but made absolutely zero mention of Trae going 1-7 from deep and shooting terribly. Then he says the Sixers are in trouble because Shake can't score 14 every night. Our starters are killing them in this series. It's more likely that the rest of the bench can score some freaking points for once than we need Shake to do that again.   He also said Seth Curry scoring 21 was not something we could rely on. He literally scored 21 last game and has been killing it for weeks.   Bottom line we were able to slow Trae down, force turnovers and misses and make others knock down shots, not all of which were open (unlike when we trapped in game one). Meanwhile the Hawks have not slowed down Embiid one iota. They have not shown one ray of hope or strategy that even kind of sorts worked for a while. They are just kind of hoping he misses."
This clueless dude is still crying about Seth Curry?
Also Clippers vs Sixers:  Doc vs pg13 Seth curry vs pg13  Kawhi vs Ben joel and tobi (revenge for shot)
What the fuck did Seth Curry do to you
"love seeing some Seth love on here, man. i know he's a Curry so he's already kinda born into good graces, but he's more widely known as 'Steph's brother who isn't as good'. he's a solid NBA player. and even though he's spent some time bouncing around the league, he's always been a consummate professional. just comes into the game, plays smart, knows his role, hits threes at an exceptional % kind of guy."
"I think we need to re-evaluate giving all stars to people who can't shoot outside 3 feet from the basket in general. How many times do we need to see them implode in the playoffs before we realize they aren't as good as their stats make them seem. Ben simmons, gobert, giannis, all these guys. As soon as teams hit the playoffs and decide to actually try, they all get outplayed by guys like Seth Curry. Every. Single. Year."
Which is why you need Seth curry also in that lineup
Seth Curry is better than Roy Rogers
That why tobias Harris is averaging all star numbers and with Danny Green leading the league in corner 3s and seth curry having a great offensive year yeah?  Nevermind embiid scoring at a unve rate and constantly getting their centers in foul trouble  I've never in my life seen joel played off the floor  I've seen it happen to jokic in the playoffs
[Seth Curry has the second-highest 3PT% in NBA history.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html)
Seth Curry has the second highest 3P% of all time
seth curry scares me. getting no shots tho
Seth Curry is really outplaying Simmons this series.
Bruh how can ppl call Trae the ugliest player in the league when Seth Curry is in the league
Seth Curry finally missed. Can Huerter keep the magic?
"76ers, I‚Äôll give you Jrich for seth curry and a second, who says no??"
Doc Rivers offensive notes  1) Pass to Embiid  2) give it to Seth Curry if he‚Äôs open  3) Tobias Harris??
Goddamn Seth Curry is so bad at defense.
"I'm not gay, but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Seth Curry. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him hitting 3's on the driveway hoop and running cone drills shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Daddy Seth. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry and sexually frustrated. Sometimes we will look across the table at dinner and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
I'm surprised Seth Curry wasn't more highly sought after. Every team could use him
"We really needed Seth curry, can't believe the mavs let him go"
I just want a conference finals that features a matchup of Seth Curry vs Meth Curry!
We lose 4-0 if Mavs had Seth Curry this year.
Hell yeah Seth Curry gonna be a star in a few years
Seth Curry is such a reliable bench piece he even draws double teams sometimes.
Mavs are not my friends for trading Seth Curry
Seth 'literally better than Steph' Curry
"Seth ""Steph"" Curry"
seth curry
Watching Seth Curry get buckets brings me so much joy yet so much pain.
Seth Curry outplaying Trae
Someone needs to make Curry take that headband off to make sure it's actually Seth
If you have an historically elite 3 point shooter like Seth Curry--keep him!!!
"The thing with MVPbiid is that he opens up the offense for everyone else. Tobias Harris can cook, Seth Curry can cook, Ben with all his issues can cook.  That's the issue with Doc Rivers. His teams are so dependent on being absolutely dominant, the second they are not, they flounder and don't know what to do. As soon as MVPbiid shows cracks and can't do a million post moves, they are fucked.  For as much as Capella was flamed, he is absolutely right. A tired Embiid is a vulnerable Sixers team"
"Yeah i‚Äôve never heard a Klay comparison. I heard bigger JJ Reddick, White Seth Curry etc."
"Well you failed to mention that you posted this when we were struggling with covid and had players out. Looks like most of the reaction is related to that.    Literally nobody was saying we had ‚Äúarrived‚Äù yet, just that we would be a good team in the West. We ended up finishing 5th seed and took the Clippers to 7 so I would say we pretty much played up to expectations.   Other than Seth Curry, I still don‚Äôt really see what you were ‚Äúright‚Äù about here."
"Not really? That‚Äôs such a false comparison. Jack Easterby is a preacher and team chaplain who rose to highest ranks of a professional sports organization in a couple years by becoming a close advisor to the owner. He is in no way qualified in any way for his job.  Haralabob is a guy who made millions with his analytics models and was hired by Cuban to build an analytics department for the team. So I would say he was hired into a top FO job he was highly qualified for. On top of that, they‚Äôve fired a GM who failed to build a talented roster around star players for years. So the GM seems to just suck at his job and probably deserved to be fired given that KP contract which was unnecessary and poor decision alone, let alone josh Richardson/Seth curry and plenty of other straight up bad decisions. Carlisle is gone now too, but read his statement. It doesn‚Äôt bitch about Haralabob, but it also doesn‚Äôt mention luka which is strange and there‚Äôs a ton of reporting that luka is unhappy with Carlisle. So it is likely Carlisle was fired because of luka.  Finally, haralabob is not the one that‚Äôs been reported to be the next gm. So I think you guys are just latching on to a juicy story based in misinterpretation of reporting. The one thing I know for sure reading these reports is that luka is not very mature, very whiny, and does not like figures of authority in his professional life. So I would say there‚Äôs smoke there but I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs the mavs fault. He‚Äôs just spoiled."
"i thought their front office was looking good after getting THJ, as well as Seth Curry on a 4y / 32m deal. Even Tingus was a good deal on paper.   But then I got Magic Johnson level incompetency vibes after the Seth trade. That deal never made sense to me."
"Even on a disappointing series this year, he is averaging 21/6/4. Lol on people saying that they can get Seth curry for his production. Seth curry used to play backup for dame and cj. Yes Seth is maybe a better 3 point shooter. But if you want someone who can beat his man at clutch times while being able to shoot the mid range or 3, not a lot of people can be better than cj."
till they trade seth curry xd
You already have CJ on the team. His name is Seth Curry
"Idk, seems reasonable to me, for people with eyes.  It's even more magnified Bucks situation.  People shouldn't be satisfied when the team looks like dogshit just because it's being carried by a superstar. The Bucks still having Bud this year is a joke.  Good for the Mavs moving forward.  Luka had a fucking absurd performance, but the team around him was straight up trash, including trading away Seth Curry (36 pts last night?) for someone that couldn't get get playoff minutes with his defense let alone be a 2-way player.  Fuckup after fuckup lead to a disaster of a roster.  Don't be duped into thinking of it as success just because Luka carried them to ""almost winning 1st round of the playoffs"".  Would hate to see Luka be wasted. We're not waiting for him to develop. He's already a superstar."
And they had a top 5 bench in terms of net rating. Also their offense was top 5 in the league even when Luka was on the bench. They miss Seth Curry but also the narrative that Luka is with a bunch of bums is overblown. Even this year their bench had 11th best net rating for benches in the league.
Seth Curry is busy smashing Doc Rivers daugther
Did Seth Curry sleep with his wife?
"Seth Curry wasn't even in the NBA in 2011. You must've had quite the happy hour before this post, I'm actually a little jealous"
"Well, the Wolves would have to include more because the money doesn't match up, but if the Sixers can get a decent PG and save some cash on the deal, they should probably do it. At this point though, they're probably going to double down and move Danny Green and Seth Curry for another player with zero range."
"You had a 6MOTY candidate in Brunson.   Josh Richardson was strangely booty all season, just like Porzingis was. Hmm kinda strange all these solid players just underperforming on a team that doesn‚Äôt bother to make defined roles for them.   You had THJ as well who is clearly better than expected, and you HAD Seth Curry who you gave up because you didn‚Äôt need any offensive weapons outside Luka.   All these dudes could run a play just as well as Kevin fucking Huerter, it‚Äôs just that the team only gives a shit about Luka.  Once Luka cares about making the team around him feel involved outside of occasional kickouts you‚Äôre gonna see better performances.  (Using the royal you here lol)"
"People always say NBA players hit the genetic lottery and while it‚Äôs true there are levels, random people people like Trae Young, Jordan Clarkson, Seth Curry, Brook Lopez even are all really athletic but you can tell they‚Äôve worked at their game and basketball skill is out of this world. Ben Simmons is the other spectrum, still relying on his size and speed and that‚Äôs it. If he was 6 foot 2 with this work ethic and skill he would‚Äôve never sniffed the NBA"
The thought of a CJ McCollum-Seth Curry back court defensively makes me queasy
&gt;Embiid is too good for his second best player to not attempt shots.  What does Seth curry have to do with anything?
"Thank you for not putting all the blame on Ben Simons' free throws, it seems like every popular post is purely a Simmons hate post in spite of the entire team sucking outside of Seth Curry."
‚ÄúThey should have traded Jrue for Seth Curry‚Äù is your position?
Damn I just realized Seth is being coached by his father in law. I don't know why I didn't think about it before. The Rivers and Curry families are like the fucking Starks and Lannisters of the league.
"They get the true best guard in the league, Seth Curry."
"&gt;Ben is NOT a scorer.  There is not being a scorer, and there is being unable to score.   &gt;i believe that if Ben had the opportunity (i think Houston would have been perfect) to have a team built around him  Why would anyone want to expend the resources to trade for him, eat his massive contract, and then some more resources on top of that for ""the team around him""  &gt;rather than Joel Embiid  Won't a team with Simmons on it always be built around someone else since he can't be the primary star?  &gt; whatever team Ben Simmons goes to will need to build a lineup full of shooters that can hide Ben‚Äôs lack of a jumpshot  You mean like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, George Hill, Joel Embiid, Furkan Korkmaz, Isiah Joe, and Shake Milton... all of whom are 35%+ plus 3PT shooters, most of whom are ~40%+ shooters....  &gt;hich would open up the lane for Ben **to drive and then either finish** or kick it out to a shooter.  They can already do this and Ben doesn't because he knows he's gonna get hacked at miss more FTs."
Straight up they played a backcourt of Lou and Trae at one point in the 4th quarter and did very well. It‚Äôs partly bad coaching but it feels like Simmons being afraid to get hacked is a huge part of this too. I feel like he‚Äôs so hesitant to attack these mismatches because of his FT shooting. Besides that Tobias hasn‚Äôt taken advantage of mismatches enough the whole series and Seth curry isn‚Äôt really the kind of guy you use to attack these guys. I feel like a part of this  rn is personnel.
"Simmons makes it bad   But Tobias and Embiid play inside, they just shoot when needed.  You can just watch the offense and see how much they rely on Seth Curry. Curry is good, but it‚Äôs too much for a player of his caliber   Guys like Korkmaz are being overused to compensate for this as well. Especially as they feel like Thybulle‚Äôs defense is important to have on the floor. And of course Danny‚Äôs injury doesn‚Äôt help   But this is definitely a real problem for their offense, especially as defense tightens in 4th quarters. Their offense becomes an Embiid high post up where he has 2 guys on him, or they look for a Curry as Tobias can‚Äôt get enough room to operate"
Ya he got rid of Horford and brought in shooting like Danny Green and Seth Curry. He actually built a team that makes sense around Embiid. Unlike whatever they were doing earlier.
Turns out that Joel Embiid and Seth Curry can't win a playoff series by themselves.
The Seth Curry trade is nice but they don't have a Jimmy Butler on the team and got to a 1-seed with Embiid being 2nd in MVP. How much can the coach be blamed if only Embiid and Curry made shots in the 2nd half. It was mostly a player casualty last night.
"I think the Nets can beat Sixers/Hawks, although i dont know who's their answer for Trae, who's an elite scorer and playmaker. Sixers dont have any shooting except Seth Curry so i just can't give them a chance. They have atleast bodies to throw at KD but Harden might get better by then."
In my Opinion Seth I understand the whole thing of stars taking the last shot no matter what but the same way I don't want Curry Driving into the paint against Capela to win the game is the same way I don't want Embid coming off a screen shooting 30+ feet to win the game although it depends on circumstances ofcourse do teams care more about the consistent sniper or the SuperStar
Seth Curry?
Is Seth Curry not a shot making guard? He had 36 last game while Embiid had 37.
Seth Curry is a better shooter than anyone the Nuggets had.
It kind of highlights the problem with their overall roster construction (which is much improved; Seth Curry almost saved them last night). But they‚Äôre spending big money on three guys and Simmons just isn‚Äôt a crunch time playoff option so they need Harris to be a 20+ a game guy and he‚Äôs not that every night. Very good player but probably short of ‚Äúreliable second option on a title team.‚Äù
And it was a Seth curry shot at the end that didn‚Äôt even matter anymore
"I'd love for the Curry bros to make a run for greatest NBA sibling duo of all time. Gasol bros are in the lead still but if Seth makes a nice run in the latter half of his career it could be interesting. Seth would have to become a top 50 player (#2 option on competing team or #3 behind all stars) and win a chip at least imo.  GS would be perfect for that if he can elevate to that level. The shooting would be ludicrous lmao. Steph, Klay, Seth."
"Or maybe teams should be more realistic about win now. I agree with the clippers, he messed up a ton not playing jamychal green more minutes in that series. But I don't buy that this team in Philly is a ""win now team"", they've always had postseason question marks with Ben simmons existing as a liability, regardless of whether they improve their spacing with Seth curry or not. Even if they do end up coming back and winning the title in this injury laced year I still won't believe in the true strength of this roster due to the limitations from the talent standpoint."
"[Awkward: Paul George Once Dated And Cheated On His New Coach, Doc River‚Äôs Daughter](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/awkward-paul-george-once-dated-and-cheated-on-his-new-coach-doc-rivers-daughter/)  &gt;In 2014, there were rumors about Paul George getting (then) stripper Daniela Rajic pregnant, trying to then pay her $1 million to not have the baby, and have an abortion. Rajic declined and gave birth to a baby-girl.  &gt;Back then,¬†Paul George was in a relationship with Callie Rivers, Doc Rivers‚Äô daughter. As you know, George was just traded to the Los Angeles Clippers to team up with Kawhi Leonard. Doc Rivers will be his coach.  &gt;Even though Callie now is engaged to Seth Curry, this still may cause for some awkward moments, as PG13 did cheat on the coach‚Äôs daughter.   PG married the woman he cheated with, mind you, but yes, some awkwardness."
"seth curry made more points,  seth will save the 76ers"
"I think this series is showing up the real problems with Embiid.  He arrived 2nd for MVP an some people consider him better than Jokic because defense. In reality Embiid is almost a liability at this level on D. Always dropping the p&amp;r, completely useless against Young and more mobile big men (like Collins or Capela). He could score 40 a game but down the stretch in the clutch all his game disappear as he continues to take bad shots and have to rely on someone else setting the plays up for him.  Meanwhile Simmons has still zero efficiency on offense, and the spacing with him is really terrible.  Ps: the trade for Seth Curry is one of the biggest steal of last off season, shame on Dallas to trade for a useless player like Richardson for Seth..."
A lot of people have been floating CJ. I'd do that if I was Philly. Philly is trying to win in a way no team has since the Hakeem Rockets. I can't think of a team that has been a contender with such weak perimeter play. They are trying to win a title with George Hill or Seth Curry as their best perimeter creators.
Seth Curry‚Ä¶ he had a hell of a game just to get that L
A major issue is the entitlement created by players and agencies such as LeBron and Rich Paul. LeBron advocating players to join the D league instead of getting a college education supports degradation in society. Klutch sports is one of the reasons the NBA is becoming a terrible situation.  Players getting hyped from both sides so they get max contracts is eccentially inside trading. Adam Silver's greed is also ruining the league.   Ben Simmons inability to shoot is a mental developmental disorder as he was maxed and hyped as a super star before being able to even shoot a jumper. Any real coach would have benched him a while ago until he was willing to develop one. Also is a poor reflection of the shooting coaches around them. I do not understand how he can play on the same team as Seth Curry and Danny Green and still hasn't developed a jump shot yet alone free throws. Ben has shown that he can shoot I believe it may just be a rhythm thing as shooting in motion is more natural than a static shot as it causes him to overthink it. An example of this is KD's shimmy before shooting a free throw. It allows KD to get loose and shoot in rhythm instead of overthinking it.  They should be running more sets for Seth as his ball handling has developed a great deal and is a highly efficient shooter. Running some more pick and roll with Seth and Embiid would work nicely. This will allow Simmons to cut off ball and get his offense going.  Shake was benched for a bit and then when he had the oppertunity was playing lights out.   The Simmons/Thybulle zone defense seemed to work well and can help cover space while conserving energy on the close outs. Thybulle has also been showing improvements offensively.  Maxey has a lot of potential and wants to put up shots/drive.
"Watched the whole entire game.   Philly was actually right, I mean give propr to Coach Rivers on this one, he put in the starters around the 10 minute mark in the fourth. He knew that the comeback was on.  Philly in the first made like every shot, while Coach Nate was pissed about that, he motivated and energized our guys in the 4th quarter. As behind a dark cloud there is a silver lining, Bogy and Huerter were trash, so that meant that Lou and Gallo had to step up and they did. They relied on each other, Trae still had trust on them, while they had trust on Trae. 57 seconds left, Gallo hit that fade away, Trae trusted in him, when I watched that live, I was really scared. But in the end he made it, because that was his game.  And that basically was the reason why they won, they kept playing their game, while Philly just looked gas. Seth Curry was tremendous, but would you really rely on him, to stop a comeback from happening. He was actually the reason why the Sixers lost the comeback on the defensive side atleast. He always gets tricked by Lou Williams, and always got to defend Gallo. He gotta up his hustle, but yeah he did hit his shots, so he still contributed a lot. I mean 36 points by Seth shouldn't happen, but it was just his night,  &amp;#x200B;  We also outsmarted them on both the offensive end and defensive end in the fourth.  On another note, Tobias Harris was not himself this game. On game 4, he was that aggresive beast who wanted to score, or drive. But in the fourth, he was like scared of the ball, in the out of bounds call around the minute mark, he was just touching the ball, in hopes of a miracle, couldn't he have dove, or atleast played with more heart and grit? Exhaustion isn't an excuse, as Collins has played a lot for the Hawks team as well.  &amp;#x200B;  So TL;DR: Hawks still had more energy and grit, and just continued to play the game, while the Sixers did the opposite.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, it's just simply because of Simmons and Harris not showing up"
Embiid was lights out the first quarter. I think it was a career high playoff quarter. Seth curry had the best game of his career. The sixers were shooting 80% from the field for the first 3rd of the game. Korkmaz is shooting the best hes ever played. Everyone makes excuses for the 76ers like they're just playing bad.  I can do the same thing. If shake Milton didn't have the best moment of his career going on a solo 15 run itd be 4-1.
"What was the point of this comment? No matter what I reply, will be refuted - you‚Äôre denying that I even watched the game LOL.  Big sadge. It‚Äôs always the one with dirty hands, pointing the finger.  Seth Curry and Embiid were the only 2 players to score a FG in the entire second half.  Definitely Doc Rivers fault."
they‚Äôre probably vegas favored but not sure how you can have faith in a team that basically relies on Seth curry and an injured center to bail them out with a shitty bench
"Embiid and Seth Curry were the only players to score a FG in the entire second half.  Blame that on the coach all you want, but you‚Äôre wrong."
Seth Curry had 36pts
&gt; Tobias Harris for Jamal Murray straight up.  LMAO  Markus Howard for Seth Curry straight up.
"Lol, I kept yelling at the TV. The sixers ran the same play for the entire second half - Ben dribble to the 3pt line, Embiid picks for Curry, Ben passes to Seth and then runs to the opposite side of the court that Seth goes to and hangs out near the baseline, Embiid takes top of the key as an outlet for Seth, Seth dribbles in and misses or passes to Joel who focuses too hard on getting the foul to have a few seconds of rest for his injured knees and huge balls whilst Tobi and Ben and &lt;INSERT 5TH BODY HERE&gt; give no assistance or threaten to score/cut to the hoop for a bucket, turnover to Atlanta.     It's as if Doc doesn't realize that any NBA team can see how to counter a play if you give them enough time to gameplan.   Package Ben for Dame or Steph or for that one guy begging on the corner by the Wawa near the Philly Convention Center. You know, whoever you can get. Harden on one leg was more effective than Ben's athleticism. Yeah he had some defensive plays, but they came when the sixers were in a drought offensively, so what do they fucking matter?"
"Morey shook the roster up a lot though, added starters like Danny Green and Seth Curry, drafted Maxey etc. This isn‚Äôt the horribly built roster that for some reason added another big in Horford beside Embiid. Someone competent is building the team now"
"4 fga attempts from Simmons in a playoff game is a joke. No way will there ever be another all star point guard who doesn't even *attempt* shots from outside the paint.   If he had attempted a shot outside the paint this series( he hasn't), Seth curry will still have attempted 52 times more non paint shots than him this series."
I‚Äôm so ashamed as a 76ers fan. Embarrassing 4th quarter. Sixers never showed up except for Seth Curry. Figures he would light it up in a losing effort. HackaBen kinda worked for ATL. Both Simmons and Embiid choked on the FT line down the stretch.  Kudos to Lou Will and Ice Trae for pulling out a Reggie Miller against the Knicks.
"The Sixers only had 19 points in the 4th quarter, and 11 of those are from Seth Curry. It's not Curry's fault dude."
I‚Äôd rather have Tobias Harris or Seth Curry in the playoffs than Ben
The Hawks started targeting Seth Curry on defense in the third. He was abysmal on that end. Embiid also seems to be falling apart in the second half of games now. Tobias Harris and Simmons were unspectacular. Bench didn't give them much either.
Seth Curry had 7 rebounds. And Simmons had 4.  Seems telling.
"Imagine if we had Seth Curry, which was great vs Clippers last years playoffs, instead of JRich which was unusable vs them this year."
Why is everyone overlooking the fact that Seth Curry and Embiid were the only Sixers to score in the 2nd half?
"Seth Curry as your supposed 4th option cannot be putting up 36 points and you lose, simply cannot happen"
"I don't know what's more ridiculous, him being on a minimum contract or the Mavs giving the 76ers Seth Curry for Josh Richardson"
I still argue that Ray Allen or Seth Curry is the best spot up 3 point shooter the league has ever seen but Steph is the best overall.
Seth Curry scored more points this game than Josh Richardson did in all seven games against the Clippers combined.
Seth Curry needs to change his name
Seth Curry the new Steph Curry

still can't believe the mavs let seth curry go
Been in a coma for ten years. So this is the two time mvp Steph... err.. seth curry? I may be spelling his name wrong.
Having been right about the Seth Curry trade from day 1 against huge backlash from Mavs fans doesn't make it easier to see Seth ball out for someone else.   Good for him.
every seth curry bucket is just a kick in the nuts to me.
If Haralabob had anything to do with trading Seth Curry he should be fired already
Seth Curry outperforming everyone on the court right now

I mean the Sixers may still need to blow up this team with how Ben Simmons is playing on offense.   If they can cover the offense responsibility with Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry and force Ben to improve his FT I'm talking 100 FT a day during the off-season. Maybe they can make Ben Simmons into a Draymond green role.
"I'm going to say Hawks.  Embiid is hurt, Simmons is bad, so even though Embiid is the best player in the series, and Seth Curry has been very good, I think the Hawks take this."
"Or hes a shooter and 30 shots in an extremely small sample size prone to volatility. Just like Seth Curry shooting 60+% from 3 right now, its a product of randomness"
"depends lol, he's absolutely top 40 in the regular season but in the playoffs id rather have seth curry and even tyrese maxey over him"
Seth Curry is so much better and the Sixers got him for Josh Richardson.   I still can‚Äôt believe the Mavs traded away Seth for Josh Richardson.   For Josh Richardson.   Josh Richardson.
Seth Curry has a brother?!?!
Seth Curry became a free agent at the wrong time.  Curry signed a 4 year $32 million contract in 2019.  Joe Harris 4 year $75 million in 2020  Davis Bertain 5 years $80 million in 2020  Imagine what Curry could have gotten if he became a free agent in 2020 or 2021.
Are you bfs with Seth? I feel like I constantly see you posting about or defending Curry on here lol.
"For a second, I was like 'What? Seth Curry has been killing it' then i remembered that Ben Simmons is a player"
"And Seth Curry is making $10, criminal underpayment."
Seth Curry you mean
"the Sixers have Seth Curry; unless he leaves, they don‚Äôt need to go after Harris"
It's actually Seth Curry this year and um...... Damion Lee next year
seth is shooting like that because it‚Äôs steph curry disguised as him üò§
"4 3PA per 36 is low volume for a shooting specialist  for reference, seth curry shot 6.3, kennard shot 6.5, harris 7.5, ant simons shot 9.3 and bryn forbes shot 10 (per 36)  he‚Äôs not comparable with other shooters in the league idk why you are hyping him that much, but im glad the man has fans lol, i actually like him as a player"
This dude is a killer.   I worry more about him holding the ball than Ben Simmons or even tbh Joel Embiid.  If the Sixers win game 7 it's gonna be because of Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry
Seth Curry is a prime example
"Dear God please give Seth Curry whatever Joe Harris is having, amen üôè"
*Seth* Curry?!? Lol
Should be a good trade to seth curry.
Seth Curry is no longer a role player in my eyes. Mans a bonafide star sniper.
Meanwhile seth curry is cheap and balling out. I miss the best S.Curry
Wym Seth curry has been great!
I think Joel Embiid Trae Young Chris Paul Ben Simmons Paul GeorgeDevin Booker and Seth Curry are on that echelon of popularity. In that order.
"To all the Nets haters. There ain‚Äôt no reason to hate on that team. Two guys deserve the blame. Joe Harris and Nash. KD left it all out there and no one can say otherwise. Dude put up two, not one, TWO all time career playoff games to keep his team in it. Harden gave it all he could too. Everyone‚Äôs going to talk about his shooting percentage and how he shouldn‚Äôt have been out there. Man, if Harden says he wants to play there is no way you wouldn‚Äôt want him on the floor, bad leg or not. Dude played 52 minutes with a leg that‚Äôs not even 50% and still put 22. Donovan played on a bad leg the other night with a lesser injury and basically put up the same kind of performance and everyone was proud of him and said ‚Äúhe played it heart out‚Äù but since it‚Äôs Harden everyone wants to give him a hard time. Joe Harris and Nash lost this game in my eyes. Joe not only missed the game winning 3 with quite literally no one even near him; the dude shot 3-10 (3-9 from 3pt) and yet he still played 46 minutes. Why?!? Jeff Green just put up huge numbers the other night and he sat the damn bench the whole game. He had 12 minutes and this game went to OT. Nash didn‚Äôt pull him. Bruce Brown played well early on but I don‚Äôt understand why you play him over Shamet. Bruce Brown gets the Ben Simmons treatment when he‚Äôs on offense. No one even guards him bc he‚Äôs got nothing but floaters in his game. Not to mention the play calling by the Nets down there at the end. It was just pass it to KD and see what happens.   To the Bucks fans, congrats. I don‚Äôt know how long it will last to be honest. Some will argue the 76ers might not even beat the Hawks but if they do y‚Äôall better be ready. Embiid is a whole other animal. Brook is going to have his hands full. Not to mention Seth Curry has been lighting it up from deep. I think you matchup a little bit better against the 76ers (especially with Hack a Ben still in the lineup). Otherwise if the Hawks win, we might see y‚Äôall in the finals. Suns/Clippers will be waiting on y‚Äôall and man will it be a fun Finals this year."
Seth Curry finals MVP before Steph will be wild
Have a take on Seth Curry?
Seth Curry &gt; Harris
This dude makes more than Seth Curry
meanwhile your team blowing leads over and over even with Seth curry dropping nearly 35 every game
He should give his contract to Seth curry and get Seth's contract instead ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Dawg, if Robert Covington, Marco Bellinelli, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, JJ Reddick, George Hill, and a whole other handful of tweener 3pt chuckers like Mike Scott and Ilyasova can't help this man with his jump shot, Lu Dort ain't doing shit for him lol"
Seth averaged 21 points on 79% TS. Those are elite offensive numbers. Embiid had a great series but still had 25 turnovers in the last four games and 16 in the last two. Seth Curry and Ben Simmons didn‚Äôt make him cause multiple live ball turnovers in the half court that instantly led to dunks on the other end. He has a career negative AST/TO ratio in his regular season and playoff career. It‚Äôs a glaring flaw in his game and it always has been.
"Embiid is the only one the defense cared about. The turnover at the end against gallo eas brutal I'm not gonna criticize the guy who put up 30/12 and 2nd best player was seth curry.      FWIW, embiid also did put blame on himself in the presser and said he needs to be better and he the loss falls on him. Those quotes dont get the headlines though"
"Ok? They offloaded Horford, drafted Maxey, traded for Seth curry and Danny green. Seth curry and green being here massively helped with spacing, and Maxey has been a good piece of the bench. Brand also needed to be fired because he gave max contracts to Horford, Tobias, and Simmons. While people thought Simmons was worth it, paying that much to Horford was absolutely moronic, and overpay for Tobias."
"I know Seth curry had a fantastic playoffs, but considering him the second option seems a bit enthusiastic doesn‚Äôt it? Granted, he was probably their second best player this playoffs, but Seth seems like a 4th/5th option on a normal basis."
"I'd not think Simmons is better than Seth Curry right now. It is debateable at least, I'd say."
"How does CJ differ from Seth Curry? Both undersized, both are defensive liabilities"
I don‚Äôt know why Doc didn‚Äôt stick Thybulle or Simmons on Huerter. Seth already struggles on that end but Huerter was just too tall. He should‚Äôve had one on Young and one on Huerter.  Curry kept them in that game and constantly hit huge shots
They definitely do but not to the level of an actual star level ball handler lol  I shouldn't have to explain why Seth Curry as your number 2 option is not gonna cut it for a contender
"Because as bad as he was, there was a 2 minute stretch in game 3 to open the 2nd half where Simmons just took the game over and the Hawks pretty much never came back from that. Everyone still believed he was capable of it (physically he still is) but we didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôd completely break. There‚Äôs a difference in deferring to Seth Curry and deferring to Matisse Thybulle"
Dude looked like Kobe out there. Headhunted Seth Curry
"Simmons has seth curry and Joel embiid, both can knock down long range shots, and can‚Äôt get past trae young. You give him less shooting, and you think magically they‚Äôll be better? Team A for sure."
I mean they had 3 all nba defense guys on the floor and still couldn't hid Seth Curry so I don't see how they could hide him and CJ after taking away Simmons
Then what they pick up Seth Curry for?
"Seth was unbelievable. But a big reason why he was able to do that was because hes seth curry. The defense gives him those shots and says we'll live with that. He was guarded by huerter and never saw any level of real defensive pressure besides being top locked on pindowns. Hes not some versatile player who collapses defenses, puts pressure on them, creates for others, none of that. He either hits his shots or he doesnt, and he did which is incredible. But didnt change what the hawks were doing. They tipped their caps and said good series we'll keep all our focus on embiid"
Cj is better at defense than Seth Curry just FYI
"The 2nd best player was seth curry. Unfair to joel to pretend that's on him, guy gets completely hounded because no one else puts any pressure on the defense. I mean they put freaking bogdon bogdanovic on tobias"
"Bro I am glad to have Trae, but this is just a silly take. If you have a chance to draft a player who you think can single-handedly make you a playoff team with a garbage roster, you are an idiot not to do it. There is no way Schlenk passed up on luka because he thought he was ""too good"", he just thought that Trae + another lottery pick would be worth more. If it was Schlenk's job to build around Luka, they would be a contender with him. Schlenk is an excellent GM and did a waaaaaay better job building around Trae than the Mavs did with Luka. He has made nothing but positive deals  and picks, where the Mavs have pretty much struck out with KP, trading away Seth Curry, etc."
The way Seth Curry looks AS SOON as he passes it. Jesus
Turnovers bound to happen when his second best player is Seth Curry.
Seth Curry balled out
"At a minimum Philly needs a replacement for Simmons at the 1, which we know and they know otherwise the reporter wouldn‚Äôt have asked Rivers is Simmons a championship-caliber *point guard*.   My take is they already have that 1 guard. His name is Seth Curry. At the price tag on Simmons, what do you even trade him hoping to get?! You can‚Äôt, at least not from my purview.  Simmons needs to play the 4 and 5 all next season and if he blows there too, then Morey, Brand and Rivers should all host an auction for Simmons."
"Simmons is not a play maker, he is a passer. His half court offense is giving the ball to Seth Curry and then running to the dunker spot"
"For Lowry and Hield tho, can find another bench shooter. If you are missing on Lowry to hold onto Seth Curry you are doomed to lose to Trae Young shooting 20% from the field again"
"Imo the real moment the process went sideways was trading for Butler. Philly traded RoCo and Saric, both process guys, for Butler. Who they traded for Josh Richardson who they then packaged with a pick to trade for Seth Curry.   Not saying that it isn't more complicated than that or that Curry isn't a good player but losing homegrown assets in a series of trades goes against what the process was all about."
I‚Äôm down to trade KP for Simmons if they throw Seth in. It‚Äôll be known as the Seth Curry trade.
Seth Curry should tell Doc to fuck off if he tried that
Dude had Seth guarding him. Curry got cooked.
Seth Curry also got hunted by the Hawks and was the main defender on Huerter who had a career night.   Also Thybulle had that awful foul on the 3 that was a backbreaker and turned a one point deficit to 4 with a minute left.   So agreed pretty much everyone shit the bed in some fashion
Idk the whole Hawks Late game offense was targetting Seth Curry and the whole Hawks Late game defense was targetting Ben Simmons lol
What about ben Simmons Seth curry and some picks?
"&gt;He's wrong, but it's not like he said that Simmons was a worse player than Seth Curry or some hilariously bad take, he said that a top 25 player was overrated and not better than a top 40 player  Lmaooo"
We now know Simmons is without a doubt a worse player than Seth Curry lol
Yes because Atlanta does their best to hide Trae Yount on defense. If he was a capable defender he would have guarded Seth Curry and prevented him from shooting 60% 3PT on 7 attempts per game.
What? Luka is a decent defender bro sure he‚Äôs no Jrue Holiday but he‚Äôs not a negative on that end like Trae or Seth Curry.
"Prioritizing defense over shooters is what got Dallas Josh Richardson for Seth Curry. They need spacing and shooters. Gimme CJ and Roco for Porzingus, JR and a 2nd. Next go after a starting G, Lonzo is my first choice but if you‚Äôre willing to go into the Luxury I‚Äôd say make a run at CP or Conley, blow one of them away."
"Counterpoint: Atlanta became one of the better defense teams when Nate took over. They don't have a lot of individual talent, save Capela, Hunter, and Huerter (at least as a bench leader), but they've schemed their way out of shortcomings. Young and Collins used to be trashed for their suspect defense, and now they're both part of a working machine.  I think 1v1 defense is overrated, there are so many ways to scheme a good defender out of an offensive drive or make a bad defensive player basically close down a passing lane. 1v1 is great, of course, but look at Rudy Gobert: no one is doubting his ability, but just like offense, 'iso defense' is not desirable.   Really good case in point: Seth Curry was cooking in Game 7, similar to Game 6, so Nate decided to put Huerter on him on both offense and defense. Huerter is not an elite defender (unless he clamps down Middleton in the ECF lol), but athletic and a size mismatch on both ends, plus a smart, disciplined player. More importantly, Huerter driving at Curry through the fourth quarter would have pissed me off as a Philly fan: how do you not find a way to switch the defender? Trae is rarely asked to defend a dude 6"" taller than him, and Curry was in that position for far too long.  Lastly, counterpoint to Simmons at the 5: he was afraid to dunk over Trae 'with Gallo behind him', dude does not want to attempt going for FTs. Bench guys can afford to play Hack-a-Ben, so it would have totally stalled Philly's already limited offense. Plus, you'd then start Milton or Maxey as PG/SG with Curry--Trae made short work of a good defender in Danny Green, no way these young guys can keep up with a dude looking to attack every possession."
Seth curry is so underrated
Dude just averaged 30/13/4 against the Hawks and played 37 mpg with a torn meniscus. The second best player on his team was Seth Curry.
Seth Curry was the Sixers best player.
Seth curry is better
"Doc is still to blame, he needs to create a system that puts Simmons in a position to succeed. Simmons has to play with an empty lane to be effective on offense, he has to play with four shooters. Sixers ran so many Isos for Embiid and Tobi with Simmons just standing there. Zero cutting, zero actions. That's on the coach. Seth ran a quick PnR and got looks in the half court. There were zero hlf court plays that utilized Simmons to get a good look. Doc could have run a Simmons/Curry PnR with Simmons as the screen/roller. He could have played Simmons at the five. There are ways to utilize Simmons. He's flawed for sure, but he can succeed in the right conditions."
Cap Seth Curry was op
Seth Curry finally comin up tho
Trae is still one of the worst defenders in the NBA.   Seth Curry averaged 21 PPG on 60% FG and 60% 3PT during this series.   If Atlanta loses game 7 we're having a very different conversation right now. Trae Young shot the ball terribly all series and played some of the worst defense I've ever seen in a playoff series.
"Huh, did they bench Seth Curry in the end??!!"
Seth Curry has one of the best contracts in the league and the Mavs just gave him away
"Defending the 6ers would still be too easy. Defenses tighten in late games and you double Embiid and then cover Curry, the offense falls apart   If they want a championship, they need a guy who can create an efficient look by himself from the perimeter   Tobias/Seth/Embiid need to be spoonfed. And though Russ will create, it won‚Äôt be efficient.   That is still not a championship team."
"&gt; Giving him a max deal before he made any progress was a mistake.  $68.9 mil tied up on two guys who dogged hard in key moments throughout the Hawks series (one of whom was a dog through just about all of it).  When Seth Curry was the team's second best player in the Hawks' series, that's not a good return on investing that level of bank in the other two players."
Seth Curry got exploited by Red Velvet so hard though. What we need is Thybulle to hit 37% from 3 on decent usage. Get a real point guard and you got a stew going
"Hey look someone else who thinks ""getting his own shot"" makes someone a ""playmaker"" or that Seth Curry passing it back to Luka to pad his shot % makes him a passer.  Don't say shit about a team you obviously didn't watch. If Seth became a more well rounded player in Philly that's awesome. Doesn't mean he was a secondary playmaker when he was on the Mavs, because he wasn't."
"Embiid was fine even with the meniscus, honestly.  Not absolute peak Embiid, but he still did his thing.   Needing Seth Curry to be your second best player is pretty bad though. That's on Ben and Tobias."
Seth Curry is 30 my guy
"Maybe this shows my lack of understanding of defense, but I feel like Gallinari is a pretty decent defender. He can hold his own against most 4s, not perfect but acceptable. He can make plays when he‚Äôs undersized against a big like Embiid. And he at least tries on the perimeter with guys that are much faster than him.  Like yeah, dude‚Äôs not gonna be locking up Seth Curry. But he always steps up to the plate defensively and I feel like, more often than not, has an impact.  This is based on 1 year of me watching him in OKC and me paying attention to him in ATL this year and in the playoffs."
Seth Curry is a monster but I don't think he is the #5 guy on a multi-time championship team.
Seth Curry can't win with these cats
Y‚Äôall have THJ who can get his own shot. Y‚Äôall had Seth Curry last year who proved to be more than a spot up shooter. But y‚Äôall refuse to run anything through them.
Because embiid and Seth curry are the only dudes who can create shots for themselves. Simmons and embiid will always be a logjam because both are most effective around the basket
Letting Seth Curry get continually torched by Kevin Huerter and not doing a thing about it is a legit doc problem.
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
Perfect scenario  Ben Simmons goes to Toronto   Lowry goes to sixers   CJ goes to sixers   76ers give two firsts Seth Curry and hill to Portland and raptors give OG
I think CJ is def in play. CJ would fit in. Would they trade Seth Curry for a PG at that point?
"George hill, seth curry and a pick"
No.  He got him Seth Curry and Danny Green.   Harris was also over 39% from 3.    You gotta give them a try together.
Morey made the right moves bringing in Seth Curry and Danny Green.
"because doc might be liked by the players and i thought he got a lot of value out of guys like seth curry, thybulle etc. the problem is that simmons is just a huge fucking joke of cap space against a really good atlanta hawks team.  simmons hasnt changed under doc since switching from brett brown. you think that's still a coaching issue here?"
"What? Dame and Mcollum have peaked because they are a horrible pairing defensively. Simmons would be huge for them defensively and tbf Dame can pass but he‚Äôs a scorer first so having the extra playmaker would be great.   But Sixers will then have a starting backcourt of Seth Curry and Mcollum, so no defense"
"Sign and trade for Kyle Lowry, trade Ben for CJ, roll out an Embiid, Harris, McCollum, Lowry starting five plus somebody (Danny Green?). With that backcourt honestly Seth Curry needs to go, he is just too bad defensively and you can get something decent for him."
He might not be streaming but he is playing a lot. Think recently he played CoD with Seth Curry and told him he needs him to get 30 points which is hilarious to me now.
"because Doc enjoyed seeing the his son-in-law, Seth Curry, get punked"
Some scrubs named Wardell Curry and Seth Curry
Seth won me a couple of playoff performance props. Salute to him for balling out in the playoffs although his FT shooting percentage is unbecoming of a Curry
Seth Curry brought it every game
"Seth Curry was the 76ers second or at worst third best player in this series, weak defense and all. He was not the problem in this series."
"On a side note, now that Philly is doomed, can you please take back Josh Richardson and give us back Seth Curry?"
"If Frank was getting paid what Ben is getting paid we would have sent him to JFK airport a long time ago though.    Like if Ben wanted to be an elite defender that's cool, but he needs to be making between Seth Curry and Danny Green money"
"First of all, if Embiid, Harris and Seth Curry are taking the majority of the shots, how many shots is Ben going to take? And if you have a team where the only legit competent passer is the ""unplayable one"" how many is he going to score unless he's like, Fuck it. Let me put up a bunch of shots so I can prove that I'm a StArrrr!   I don't like how he struggled with FTs but not for the reason you think. We have no other trustworthy ball handler facilitator than Ben on the Sixers. I would have rather had Ben miss a couple of free throws especially since he's important on the defensive end than have Maxey(a rookie) and Shake Milton who's not a natural PG. Doc panicked and even Larry Brown who is a Hall of Famer said that he would have never took Ben out for missing FTs and used Ben Wallace as an example. So um yeah, it's not as simple as ""score PoINtZzzzzz and we WiNNNzzzzz!"
Seth Curry and Shake Milton played pretty decent roles didn‚Äôt they?
Wear it ironically.  Nothing stunts on your sister‚Äôs wedding like wearing a motherfucking Ben Simmons jersey. You think imma whip out the Seth Curry for this shit? It‚Äôs not even open bar.
"As an avid Hawks fan I will say that Curry was ice cold, in a good way, throughout that entire series.   Every time Seth Curry went for a shot I **knew it was going in** and I ended up being right just about every time. That guy can shoot the lights out. Possibly better than his brother. He definitely has better form."
"He is bad at making adjustments. Last season for example he played Montell Harrell way too damn much against the Nuggets. In that series, Zubac was a much better option at Center but Harrell played way too long no matter how badly he got cooked. A lot of people say Doc Rivers is a great motivator but I don't think it has any truth. If he did he wouldn't be constantly blowing leads. So one of his best qualities are his words and he sucks at it. In the Sixers he didn't know how to adjust with Simmons. For example you can put him at the four and bring in someone else for ball handling duties like Seth Curry or that other guy. Now, this is a radical of a change for almost any coach and to his defense is if Simmons at point got you to a best record in the NBA then why make a major change like that? It's a tricky situation but I think you have to go for the change if it's not working out. Look at the Clippers for example. Ty Loo went through like 50 different lineups in the post season until he found one that works. It's a difference maker to being open to adjustments."
"i do not under any circumstance want to see a philly squad with joel embiid, seth curry, cj mcollum, tobias harris, and danny green. so help me god i will fly to america and burn down philadelphia myself to stop that dominance from rising."
I think Simmons is buns and I agree offence in a vacuum is more valuable. Just pointing out the Hawks haven't played a team that matchup hunts. You guys had Kevin Huerter pretty much wreck Seth Curry and Gallo go right at Geroge Hill when he was on him.   The ultimate fuck you was playing Lou Will and Trea at the same time. It was like we can play anyone and the Sixers don't have the personel to do anything about it.
"Honest question ‚Äî Sixers fans, what are your thoughts on the Seth Curry trade now?"
"IMO Draymond Green for Ben Simmons makes sense. They are both equally ass at shooting, but contribute in every other way. Warriors get youth (to pair w/ Wiseman) and a primary ball handler, and the 76ers get leadership. Between Simmons and JTA, I think the Warriors could manage w/o Green.  If Draymond Green was in Philly, he would be the captain on day 1 and if he was given the team's support to shoot the ball - I think he would improve his 3pt percentage. Also, I'm sure Seth Curry would learn to play w/ him very quickly.  For the Warriors, Simmons would be the primary ball handler and could also run point for the 2nd unit. Draymond and Steph typically split PG duties, but Steph is an overrated passer who turns the ball over too often trying to do cute shit.   I think it would have to be a 3 team deal where the Warriors are receiving a lot of expiring contracts or 1 year players. Their cap is fucked.  Steph would probably be upset, but that's basketball.  As a Bay Area transplant, I'm kind of tired of Draymond Green showing up fat every season. This season he had an excuse because he had COVID around the beginning of the season."
"The big knock on Trae Young is that he's an abysmal defender and in the playoffs teams will be able to gameplan and hunt him.   In the first two rounds of the playoffs, he's gotten lucky, going against the Knicks, who don't really have a great point guard to go at Trae with, and the 76ers have...Ben Simmons. That being said, Derrick Rose and Seth Curry each both had really great series against the Hawks.   The Bucks are going to go at Trae hard with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton, and I think the Hawks, especially without DeAndre Hunter, are going to have a really hard time defending the Bucks in this series.   tldr -- Trae's biggest weakness, his defense, hasn't really gotten exposed yet this playoffs, but probably will against the Bucks."
The process was a success in the sense that they got a star MVP level player in Embiid but they had horrible management such as trading up to draft Fultz 1 overall. Then used all their assets in Harris and rental butler. Then the proceeded to let butler go and max Harris and Simmons. Don‚Äôt forget how they also drafted okafur #3 overall. That sixers team that lost to the raptors was so close to making the finals but horrible decisions with what to do with all the assets caused the team to flop. Haven‚Äôt even mentioned the idiotic reasoning behind getting Horford then turning down a harden trade since it included Maxe and Thybull. With a more competent management they would have been stacked with high level players instead they have Seth curry as their second best player in the playoffs.
"Seth Curry is incredibly underrated man  19 ppg on 73%TS out of a jump shooting role player, what an incredible waste of what probably would have been an all time great 3pt shooting run."
"Ben Simmons, you played the like the Flyers post-COVID season; no effort. Your rebound and assists looks nice, but no one cares. You didn‚Äôt care, which is the fucking bare minimum you have to do.   Sixers fans shouldn‚Äôt have thrown debris, but anyone getting on Sixers fans for booing needs to shut up! I would boo, too!   Tobias didn‚Äôt have a good game, but at least he tried!   Seth Curry and Joel Embiid should punch Ben‚Äôs ass until he finally gives a care."
Watch Seth curry at the three point line when he passes it. Says all you need to say.
Simmons and Seth curry for dame?
"Washington would jump on this. WB on the 76ers might not work out so well unless Westbrook becomes more of a passing guard than a stat-hoarding-guard.  The way Ben played, Wizards could probably ask for a few picks and/or Seth Curry also, lol. And that would be a deal breaker for the 76ers."
"Simmons + someone else + picks for Trae Young. At least try that. Or if Doncic wants out, Simmons and anyone and anything besides Embiid and Seth Curry. Give them Harris if they want him."
Embiid was great all series. Simmons sucked and Harris was inconsistent the sixers second best player for a lot of the series was Seth curry
Seth Curry. Anytime he got the ball I stopped breathing. Dude is smooth.
Wall and Seth Curry on the floor at the same time‚Ä¶
"This sub sometimes man  He didn't play his best game ever and I'm not exactly a Sixers apologist as a Celtics fan, but honestly, I just felt bad for him tonight. I wanted the Sixers to lose and I *still* felt bad for him. His alleged co-star has had a nuclear meltdown. His best help on offense is apparently Seth Curry when shit is getting real. It felt like a fraction of what KD was dealing with last night as the defense completely focused on him and Joe Harris bricked everything."
Already have Seth curry. Cj is worse at running an offense than Ben. He‚Äôs a true 2 guard and is not good at defense
"Theyll realize what they had when hes gone and theyre left with tobias, seth curry and embiids playmaking. Ben took less shots than Capela. Thats not really on Ben when he gets doubled every time he drives, hes making the right play in those situations. Its not like atlantas playing 1 on 1 defence, I noticed so many times where a player drove in and couldve just sold the layup and dropped it to ben but instead got blocked or missed the layup due to the contest. Seth Curry did it once this game, did a drop off pass and he was WIDE open under the rim, in the dunker spot. That was the only time he got a drop off pass this series that I remember"
Nah Seth Curry was visible.
"Trade idea:   Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Marcus Smart   * Tyrese Maxey  * Two Sixers 1sts  Celtics get:   * Ben Simmons  * Norman Powell  * Seth Curry  * One Sixers 1st  Sixers get their guy, run Dame/Milton/Green/Harris/Embiid  Blazers reset and remain competitive by running Smart/McCollum/Brown/RoCo/Nurkic   Celtics revamp and remain competitive by running Curry/Powell/Simmons/Tatum/Williams"
"The only players averaging 15+ pts a game with a higher eFG% then melo right now are,  &amp;#x200B;  Seth Curry - 16.4ppg on 54% 3pt and a mind blowing 75% eFG%   Nikola Jokic - 24ppg on 40% 3pt and 66% eFG%  Kemba Walker - 15ppg on 57% 3pt and 67% eFG%"
I disagree.  Seth Curry is shooting 54% from 3 and Danny Green is shooting 44%.  Those are role players who shoot 3's to justify their existence.

"Seth Curry is a candidate, 8 mil per year for 2 more years."
"There is strong correlation though because it is harder to get good shots than it is to get ok or bad shots. If a guy took ten threes then chances are they were not all good shots.   However some teams *need* those players to take those shots. Last night for instance, Seth Curry took ten threes against the Blazers, making three of them. Going into the game he was shooting 63% from three, a ridiculously high number that obviously was gonna go down at some point. Still for someone who had a good game it's surprising that he shot 30% from three. Reason being he usually takes open threes with more time and space than he took tonight. But without Ben, Joel, Harris, and for a large part of the game, Green, he had to take more shots for the good of the team.   With at least Joel in the lineup he can afford to be more judicious with his shot selection. Thus he will take more open shots, and his percentages will go up."
Seth Curry begs to differ
"Exactly. Embiid has never been this open. Curry has never been this open. Tobias has never been this open. The drastic upgrades in spacing made everything easier for everyone. You have to double Embiid or he‚Äôll score 40, but you double and now Seth is wide open. So Embiid gets way more 1v1s than ever and the shooters (save Danny) get way more wide open shots than ever."
Right behind Seth Curry.
*Seth Curry previously played for the Blazers
"no, it shows seth curry is their batman and joel their robin"
"Seth Curry wasn‚Äôt a sixer before last year. His career may have something to do with playing next to an MVP caliber center. Tobias moved from the 3 back to his natural position at the 4. And we swappedAl Horford for an outside threat. Jo‚Äôs progression had everything to do with his own work, not the coach or the scheme. The team made a jump because of better roster construction and Embiid taking a big step."
Seth Curry is fucking good
Seth Curry go brrr
Danny Green went out mid way through with hamstring tightness sooo  Portland vs Seth Curry and the bench.
Seth Curry getting 17 FGA and 10 3PA he deserves as the team's best shooter
"Seth Curry for Dame, who says no?"
Imagine giving away Seth Curry for Josh Richardson... ... ...
Seth fucking Curry
Seth Curry nearly blocked Nurkic earlier lol
Get these refs some Gatorade. Damn.   These guys sweating buckets trying to keep the Blazers in the game against our bench and Seth Curry.
"2, Seth Curry and Danny Green. The two worst out of the five lmao"
"Warriors have always done a great job cycling talent through Santa Cruz. Bazemore, Desmond, Seth Curry, Toscano-Anderson and more. And then they had assholes like Jeremy Tyler.  Source: was a former primary statistician for the SC Dubs"
Seth curry heard we wanted Dame and now can‚Äôt physically miss from 3
Seth Curry is so fucking good
If Portland loses to a team whose best player is Seth Curry
"So by that logic is Seth Curry a better shooter than Steph? Because Steph shoots at a lower percentage?  LeBron shot it at 40% on 3 attempts a game, dude. I'll take 35% on 8 attempts vs 40% on 3 attempts."
"Or at least traded down for Smith. Dallas wanted that Suns pick bad to take Haliburton, so you likely could've at least wound up with Seth Curry (who was traded to Philly after Dallas was unable to trade up), pick 18 and some additional seconds or a guy like DFS."
"Not taking Haliburton was obviously puzzling at the time, but the Suns unwillingness to trade down for Smith, who would've been available later, is baffling.  Dallas was aggressively trying to trade up to that spot for Haliburton (based on the results of the night I'd imagine Seth Curry + 18 was the offer) and they wouldn't budge."
"If Seth joins the Warriors, Golden State need to hook up Dell Curry with a piece of the team.  Both of his sons play for Golden State &amp; his only daughter married one of Steph‚Äôs teammates."
"He doesn't get that kind of love but everyone knows he's not going to have a bad game and the ball is safe in his hands, what more can you ask for, the same with the Seth Curry, amazing player and a sure shot but... He's just not that guy, feels bad to even type it but we know they lack that special something."
Seth Curry should make NC's bench
"Even so, when expected eFG is calculated, it's supposing the player is a league average player. So even if Seth Curry is shooting his averages, he's still going to inflate the eFG over the expected eFG. This applies for any player that's very good at a specific shot.   expected eFG is just not a very good stat."
I'm pretty sure this is almost entirely explained by Seth Curry shooting 65% from 3
"Defense is usually effort but people tend to ignore the limitations of small guards. Players like Seth Curry and JJ Redick aren't bad defenders just because of a lack of effort or BBIQ, it's mostly because they simply are physically unable to stop the opposing player from scoring. It's gonna be even more apparent when players hunt matchups in the playoffs. Hiding one player in the scheme is doable, but hiding 2 or 3? That's just asking too much."
"The real question is should the Nets have traded Joe Harris and kept either Dinwiddie or LeVert.   I‚Äôve always been a big fan of Harris especially since his Harris #12 can be used as a throwback Lucious Harris jersey since they‚Äôre both #12. But if he isn‚Äôt hitting 3pt shots he‚Äôs become pretty useless.   He‚Äôs not a great defender and for whatever reason it seems like he‚Äôs regressed a bit. He used to be able to get to the rim fairly consistently and hit his midrange even when he didn‚Äôt have Durant, Kyrie, and Harden creating space with their gravity.   Maybe it‚Äôs just the scheme w/ how the offense is being run now vs the past. Could easily be a case of the Nets needing Harris to do too much with Kyrie out.   With Dinwiddie or LeVert at least they were able to initiate the offense and handle the ball as well as shoot it fairly well. Harris offers so much less than someone like Seth Curry who makes $9m less than him."
Yep.   When did Brown have COVID?   It took Seth Curry like 3-4 months to get back to full strength last year. I'm not an elite athlete and had pneumonia (possibly COVID) last year and it took f'ing 10 months to clear. Long haul conditions from pneumonia suck.
"We also missed Nurk and CJ for half of last year, in what world is having to start Kanter and use Melo for bench minutes not going to create a bad defense regardless of the coach?  Also last year Terry wanted an actual backup PG and Neil refused to bring one in wanting Ant to get those minutes, this year, we have DSJ in that role and it is allowing Ant to flourish along with the team  Neil gutted the roster after he WCF finals run and then hyped the team up like it was somehow a title contending roster and that turned a lot of the fans on Terry but it was absolutely Neils shit roster  After that WCF season the team lost Seth Curry, Mo Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard (and then ten games into the next season Rodney Hood went down for the year)  and replaced those guys with: Hassan Whiteside, Mario Herzonjia, Anthony Tolliver, Nik Staukas, Kent Bazemore, Wenyen Garbiel and eventually Melo  and fans wanted to act like it was all on Terry and not on Neil, like c'mon"
Seth Curry is literally Jesus Christ reincarnated
So Seth curry is the difference between ‚Äúbest offense ever‚Äù and this? So can we conclude that luka is overrated and Seth is severely underpaid? Interesting.
He‚Äôs not but neither is Reggie Jackson yet u had no problem making that comparison. The point I‚Äôm making is neither team has a real dependable pg. You literally bitch and complain about team construction and then try to hype up Eric Bledsoe. You wanna swap Seth curry for bledsoe so you can have a ‚Äútrue pg‚Äù? You‚Äôre gassing up random clippers scrubs to make it seem like embiid is doing some hard carry job. Just give it a rest and accept you got called out on some bs.
You think Seth Curry is a point guard?  Maxey and Korkmaz are the only ones playing point guard this season. Shake a little in the last game off an injury.
Funny you don‚Äôt mention Seth curry. Dude just give me a break. Fucking Reggie Jackson? Lmao. Go to the sixers sub if you wanna circle jerk about Embiid. The clippers don‚Äôt have any real talented pgs just like the sixers don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd take Seth curry over Reggie and bledsoe. Bledsoe has been passed around the league cause nobody wants his bum ass. Maxey and curry are better than either Reggie or bledsoe now that I consider it. So yeah real nice argument there. Good job not including Seth but including korkmaz to hype up your boy too.
"And seth curry.  Two moves that really baffled me, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt at the time.  Looks kind of bad now."
Well they had guys like Seth curry who they traded away for a guy they got rid of immediately
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
"So just to be clear. You think the Mavs went from    ‚ÄúThe greatest offense of all time‚Äù to how terrible they look now, because of Seth Curry?"
I knew when they let Seth Curry walk there were questionable decisions being made. Didn't mind taking a flyer on Kristaps cause that moved DSJ away from fighting Luka. But how you don't give him reliable scorers is wild. Should've just overpaid for Fournier or tried everything to get Clarkson
"So you‚Äôre theory is, they went from the so called greatest offense ever to this because of Seth curry huh?"
Seth Curry is very good for spacing
"I mean Seth Curry is undoubtedly a major cog. in 3 of his past 4 seasons, he's been part of a team thats top 5 in offense. KP was also still a 20/game scorer and even shot 53% from 3pt in the playoffs, regularly several feet behind the 3pt line"
I‚Äôm confused how much has this team changed since they were ‚Äúthe greatest offense ever‚Äù? You‚Äôre telling me Seth curry made that big of a difference?
we got curry at home  curry at home: seth
Kinda like get scored on by Seth Curry or Thanasis.
"If they didn't have Seth curry, I'd say it'd be at least equal as with Ben, but they already have a great SG"
I can't believe he made it on people's top 100 lists because he popped off one game against Seth Curry.
"&gt;THT wanted to stay and the Lakers wanted the same.   lmaoooooo  If someone else wanted to sign THT they would sign him. The fear was that the Lakers would get poison-pilled. But no, crickets.  Let's see who else is earning around THT's range (9.5). I've put in bold text the ones who signed in the same FA year as THT.  **- Richaun Holmes (10.3)**  **- Devonte Graham (11)**  **- Shmurda (10.3)**  \- Jae Crowder (9.7)  **- Danny Green (10)**  **- Reggie Bullock (9.5)**  \- Seth Curry (8.2)  \- Monte Morris (8.4)  \- **Caruso (8.6)**  Source: [https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/)  THT is the NBA version of ""it doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know""  I mean it's just the price of dealing with LeBron/Klutch. That's just the way it is. At least you already got a ring out of it."
Sixers NEED curry more than they need CJ or Roco lol. No way in hell they trade Seth - he is their second best player
Seth Curry just adds 15HP to any team
Seth Curry's worst 3pt shooting season in the last five years was 0.425. What they hell was Mom Curry putting in their milk.
For what reason did the Cavs get rid of Seth Curry? Dude is a flame-thrower
stlil don't understand why the mavs trade seth curry
"Seth Curry has been on damn near every team in the league  why the fuck, what the fuck, how the fuck, where the fuck"
Seth Curry getting traded: and I took that personally
seth curry &gt; steph curry
why did Huerter help like 30 feet away off Seth Curry
Seth curry is a beast!
Mark Cuban woke up one day and said let‚Äôs trade Seth Curry hahaha man what a dumb thing to do
Mavericks idiots for trading Seth Curry lmao
Seth curry is really good damn
i miss seth curry a lot
"Seth Curry for 2.75m was likely his best FA acquisition, and that was in the last 3 years.  Not to mention getting Nurkic to re-sign for 4/48.  Got GTJ for 2 2nd round picks.       Honestly, the biggest mistake he's made was the Evan Turner contract.       That said, here's the deal.  This is Portland we are talking about.  Most impactful free agents aren't going there.  This is a GM that took the job, drafted Dame, and CJ, and that currently has the longest playoff streak.  Yes, he's not done amazing with the draft since.  Look at most teams and their draft records.  He's not alone.     Aldridge, Matthews, and R Lopez all walked away back in 2015, I believe, during free agency. It's hard to replace talent, especially that of an Aldridge.  In general, it's hard to keep talent in Portland.  But acting like he's going to score awesome free agents is not understanding free agency or markets. This is a franchise that needs to build through the draft (which they have failed at recently), win trades on the margins (which they have done), and pick up cheap deals (like Melo).      Once again, what are they supposed to do?  They've been the 8th most successful franchise in the past 8 years.  Yeah, you haven't won a title.  Sure, 4 of the past 5 years you've lost in the first round.  Most teams would kill for the level of success Portland has had, or to be in their situation."
"Honest mistake, Daryl Morey once saw Seth Curry in a tweet..."
Imagine trading away Seth Curry on that contract for Josh Richardson.
crazy to me that seth curry has moved around so much. he‚Äôs not his brother but he‚Äôs a player every playoff team would love to have
"Tobias Harris, Danny Green, Seth Curry on the same team is just a illegal 3 pointer team.  Ben doesn't even need to learn how to shoot with these guys on the team."
And I mean what they did in game 1 against the Hawks wasn't impressive at all outside of Embiid and Seth Curry
"But that is my point, it isn't really a spectrum, it's either a good shot or a bad shot.  All of Giannis' threes will be bad shots even if they go in during the playoffs, the other teams want him to shoot them as its not a worthwhile possession.  If Ben shot 25% on 1-2 3s a game during the playoffs that's an awful possession, instead he can try to use his movements to get better shots for his teammates.   Regarding the easily make shots in practice I don't believe that is really true, maybe 70% tops of their 3s they'd be making and I don't think that's really good enough when you see the legit shooters be able to make 90% of their practice 3s.     My point is that defenses will NEVER respect these dudes from 3 unless they are 37%+ for a long time.  That just isn't realistic and that is the reality of the game now.   Why waste a possession when you can have Seth curry shoot or Danny green on 39%+?"
"There‚Äôs a similarity between Seth Curry, Finney-Smith, and Barnes that I can‚Äôt seem to recognize hmmm."
"Absolutely!  I'm not at all arguing that Trez sucks by any means, but him being a ""niche player"" is very accurate, and that niche absolutely will suffer in the playoffs.  Trez is *great* as a regular season player, because he's an iron man player who can be highly efficient against bench rotations.  When rotations cut down, game plans become more pointed at finding the weakest link, and targeting players becomes the name of the game, he'll suffer--on both ends.    The gameplan against Trez is pretty simple: put a singular big dude in the paint to alter his shots and then absolutely hunt him on defense by forcing switches or relentlessly attacking the paint.  Both of those are possible from bench players on *most* playoff teams.  Against Dallas, Carlisle parked Boban in the paint (who destroyed Trez on both sides) and also had Trey Burke/Seth Curry switch and iso onto him.  Against Denver, Malone packed the paint with Plumlee and had guards like Monte Morris switch onto him or Jokic simply take him to the perimeter OR the post.  The Suns would have absolutely done the same shit, but admittedly, Vogel could have tried to use him a bit more due to the lack of big depth the Suns have to defend Harrell.  The issue is more on the defensive end where they have Booker/Cp3/Payne who could easily blow by him or just launch shots on him.  He's useful, but when you really look at the potential playoff matchups, he'll have a hard time.  Frankly, the best matchup he possibly could have had this year was against the Clippers, but even that changed once they got Boogie."
"&gt;he‚Äôs worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
"""I guarantee you when the Sixers play the Hawks or Knicks that Seth Curry won't see more than 20 MPG""  Plays 36 minutes in game 1"
Should have kept Seth Curry now they have Josh Richardson
Mavs shouldn't have traded Seth Curry smh
Westbrook is so hard to watch and he needs to be taking 7-9 less shots per game. Where are his triple doubles at in the post season? How did Seth Curry out play him?   People in this sub hype him up but I sure don't see the winning potential.
"Yeah, but it's not like Seth Curry would have solved any of their problems against the Clippers for example. The problem isn't offense."
"Seth Curry has always been a baller, I remember being wowed by his shots for the Mavericks last year"
Wizards got out executed and out coached. Congrats to the sixers.  Seth Curry still a defensive liability.
"People just hate the Sixers.  Love to dump on Embiid for getting injured, on Ben because he doesn‚Äôt play the way they want, on Tobias because he COSTS TOO MUCH... DANNY GREEN IS TOO OLD.  MATISSE CAN‚ÄôT SHOOT.  SETH IS THE WRONG CURRY.  ITS THE WHOLE TEAM"
Unironically if you got like a 50-60 win squad already you never want Westbrook over Seth Curry in that position.
Seth Curry is better than Russell Westbrook. Tell me I'm wrong.
"Seth ""Stephen"" Curry"
Seth Curry is great at offense. Defense still terrible.
I never said Seth Curry offense sucks. His defense is terrible with 5 percentile.
"u/MITWestbrook ""I dont hate Curry, he just sucks.""      Seth Curry: 30pts | 10-17 | 3-6 | 7-7"
Who rode Seth Curry harder tonight? Doc Rivers during the game or Callie after the game?
Seth Curry: ‚ÄúI am the Stephen now‚Äù
Look on the bright side of getting your season ended by Seth Curry at least it wasnt Kelly Olynyk
I miss Seth Curry on the Mavericks.
Seth Curry
Imagine trading Seth Curry for JRich lol
Seth curry. 30 points tn. Josh Richardson. 26 in the series‚Ä¶
Seth fucking Curry man look at this inspirational shit
Seth Curry saw all the MITWestbrook threads and decided to torch the Wizards. People really fooled themselves thinking the Wizards had a chance even without Embiid.
seth has 30 and steph is sitting in the bleachers. Please tell me who the better curry is again?
Seth. Curry.
How tf did Seth curry go off LMAO
"People have always wanted Seth to get more attention and the answer lies in his name. Seth. Too bland, and far too close to Steph, his more famous brother.   Behold.   Sethrick. Sethrick Curry. Say it aloud to yourselves right now, relish how smoothly it rolls off the tongue. That‚Äôs the name. That‚Äôs how we represent."
Imagine trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson lmaooo
We really got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson üíÄ
"Seth curry with the hardest shot in 2k, the 4 ft jumper"
"All I‚Äôm saying is if that is a Offensive foul by Seth Curry, then Beal would‚Äôve been out of this game in the first damn quarter lol"
Seth ‚ÄúSteph‚Äù Curry
"Seth said, look at me, I‚Äôm the most valuable Curry now"
SETH STEPH CURRY CURRY
The Wizards can't guard a Seth Curry iso what are they doing in the playoffs man
Seth Curry is ascending
Seth Curry is the superior Curry
They should've gone after Seth Curry
Seth Curry seems to be playing hero ball. Taking a lot of shots hes missing instead of getting it to someone who has an easier shot.
"We give Seth way too much space, he turns into Curry smh"
"Royce O'Neale, Saric, RoCo, Brooks, JV, Cam Payne, Seth Curry, DFS, Dort, Brogdon, Robert Williams, others"
And by that logic says Seth Curry is C
"I guess it depends what you mean by ""good"". Scoring 18 points in 51 minutes when you're a second option SG isn't what I would call ""good"". Especially considering he doesn't ever really ""play up"" when Dame ""plays down"". CJ is good for 18 points on any night, but you can't really count on him for more (even if you really badly need it). He reminds me a lot of a less-efficient Seth Curry."
[Just look at that smile](https://sportstar.thehindu.com/third-party/opta/article28253970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1200/seth-curry-032317-getty-ftr-usjpg11bvqtmnp0wft1x7moxzj7e530jpg)
"I guess I get what you're saying but Doc, Jojo, and Tobias especially have benefitted from Al Horford and Josh Richardson being replaced by Seth Curry and Danny green more than Doc standing on the sidelines. Both Jo and Tobi play in the lane, which was ridiculously clogged last year.   I think Doc has certainly been an upgrade over Brett but it's less of a factor than having a lineup that actually fits has been."
"Seth Curry.  He's been quiet pretty much his whole career while being brothers with one of the most popular players in NBA history. I always wanted him for his shooting on the Knicks. I'll never forget the 2013 draft I said something like ""Can you imagine if the Knicks drafted Seth Curry and were able to keep Jordan Hill?!?"" My Uncle snatched my testicles so fast while my brother laughed and ran outside."
The contract read Curry. However it is Seth Curry
"They gotta revamp the roster. This past year, they tried to revolve around AD being center (lost DH12 and JAVAAALE MCGEE), but while he‚Äôs great at it, his health is an issue and ultimately he doesn‚Äôt wanna be a center. Get backup bigs.   They also have never had a fantastic 3pt shooter come in since Bron joined, come on. They need to get 2, so even if one sucks, the other will probably be okay. They missed out on Seth Curry cause of Kawhi watch, but then Seth was traded away, so they coulda kept him. No chance in hell Morey would let him go for any Laker asset now.   Get bigs and 3pt shooters, let Bron and AD fit in wherever they can. Shoulda sold high on guys like Kuz and THT, and maybe even Caruso for maximizing their value."
green curry and jeff seth
"Then what about jae crowder, and Seth curry being above doncic? Jokic has been lighting you guys up and he's not even in the top 20 for the playoffs.   In the regular season Thadeus young and Jakob poetl was above booker, Lavine, young, Simmons, and mitchell.  Find another stat to back lillard cause this one ain't it."
"We‚Äôve had good defences under Stotts so that‚Äôs not true at all  His offensive scheme fits the players we have. It‚Äôs been wildly different in the past  We‚Äôve only gone to an 8 man rotation recently and it‚Äôs worked.   We‚Äôve developed a ton of dudes. GTJ, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton,Allen Crabbe, Simons. Basically everyone who comes to Portland has their best year(s) and fall off when they leave, Seth Curry is maybe the only player over the last 5+ years that has maintained or improved their production since leaving   Stop making shit up to fit your agenda"
"I'm not saying he's been awful on that end. My issue is that he hasn't been a top 7 defender and never will be.   Like you can't use these stats they're so wack. Like why is giannis a negative on offense, or how is jae crowder double giannis war. Crowder is a top 5 playoff performer if you see war. Simmons apparently is doing better on offense than Tatum, and Seth curry is doing more than Luka."
"By your logic, all the players in the league (Steph, Bron, CP3, etc) aren't getting better or even regressing if their numbers dip. You really read that dude's comment about Simmons role in the offense and gleaned nothing from it. The roster composition between the past 4 seasons is night and day. It went from mostly shooters who needed someone to assist them to scorers who went were able to score in isolation. Of course his assist numbers would have to be up if he's playing with JJ, Dario, RoCo, Belinelli. Tobi is an excellent iso scorer with JoJo scoring more in iso than at any point ever in his career. Even Seth Curry can put the ball on the floor and score at times. His value can't be purely measured by his assists anymore. Sixers exploit size mismatches with Ben feasting on smaller guards and deferring to Tobi or Embiid if they switch longer defenders on to him. Just by being on the court he is providing offensive threat and creating opportunities for his teammates. The reason why so many people say he has not improved offensively is because they look at stats and go oh he's literally been the same player. But watching him regularly for 4 years, you could tell how much more comfortable he is on offense, especially in the half court. He can easily get those numbers up by improving his FT% and his touch around the rim and that's valid criticism. It's also hard to noticeably improve when he was already very good at everything when coming into the league. At that point his improvements are more subtle and require you to watch games. You can come back and quote more spectrum stats but it is pointless in Ben's case and if you can't get that, I understand. Some people only understand stats."
"Could you imagine if they got Seth Curry instead of anybody and then Seth(LA) goes on to beat the warriors in the play in game, plays adequately for the Lakers when the Lakers make a title run. That would be insane to see Seth in the finals and no Steph in the postseason"
Seth Curry would average 28% on the Lakers. I‚Äôm done believing in shooters that SHOULD be good...
"CP3/Green/Harris/Giannis/Vucevic probably could win a title   You might say ""oh man thats so stacked though""  But is it really compared to Curry/Klay/Iggy/Barnes/Draymond?   Or is Seth/Green/RoCo/Giannis/Joel crazy compared to Rondo/Green/LBJ/AD/Dwight?"
"Out of all players to trigger you, you choose Seth Curry?"
They really needed to trade for Seth Curry in the offseason.
"seemed pretty obvious, i dont think seth curry or jeff green are the solutions to the lakers issues"
oh seth curry and jeff green please save me  give me a fucking break
KCP is hurt but I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt pick up Seth Curry or Jeff green
I think if you're the Sixers you'd rather have Harris tbh. He is so dynamic on both ends of the court and CJ doesn't give you much more than Seth does imo. You're basically giving up size and defensive versatility for a 2 guard who has a lot of skills that overlap with players like Maxey and Curry.
"I'll take Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and a few 1sts  Dame and Embiid win a title"
"Generally I like rooting for Eastern teams rather than Western. I like the Bucks, Raptors, Nets and I really liked Philly's moves this off-season (trading for Danny Green, drafting Maxey, trading for Seth Curry). But I'm also rooting for the Jazz and Suns to at least make it to the WCF."
"The Warriors second option (Klay) is arguably the 2nd best shooter of all time who averages 22PPG on great efficiency with the ability to score 37 points in a single quarter. The Sixers options behind Embiid are Tobias Harris, Danny Green, and Seth Curry. Asking Draymond to be better than Klay is a lot different than asking Simmons to try to be as good as Harris, Danny Green, or Seth Curry."
Can‚Äôt believe the lakers didn‚Äôt pick up Seth Curry or Jeff Green. Lebron knows what Jeff provides
"Dame, CJ, Barton, LMA, Nurkic with Roy, Melo, Robin Lopez, and Seth Curry off the bench.  That's my usual lineup with 2k My league, a place where our trailblazers dreams still can come true."
Doc put Seth Curry to guard him since Bertans doesn't really use his size to his advantage
can you count on danny and seth to do that for a full series night in and night out deeper in the playoffs when the pressures on? No they are role players just like how trash danny green was in the finals or when curry was struggling to hit shots vs the clippers last year you cant count on them to be clutch down the stretch thats why you need your two best players to be 20+ pt scorers to win games when it matters most everyone knows thats a fact. one player cannot carry a team to win the finals in today's nba
"sure he can. the sixers just need someone besides him who knows how to dribble penetrate in the half court.   put Dragic from last year on the roster instead of Seth Curry. is Dragic the 2nd star on the team or just the 2nd option in half-court offense? no - he'd still be considered the team's overall 3rd or 4th best player behind Ben, Embiid, and possibly Tobias."
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"By that logic, who does MIL have that is considered a better shooter than Danny Green, Seth Curry and Tobias Harris?"
"He's absolutely pathetic in the half court? So I'm assuming you don't mean in this series because he's shooting 60+% from the field so maybe you mean he will be next series against the Hawks? Or maybe against good defenses like the Jazz and Lakers? Both of which we've beaten at full strength this year?  Ben isn't a scorer he also isn't being used like one. Idk how many times the Sixers have to line up and play basketball games to get people to understand what his role is. If we beat the Nets or Bucks it'll be playing the same way we've played all season long, if we lose to them it'll be playing the same way we've played all season long. So no, him not being a scoring guard will not cost us shit, just like Embiid not being a primary ball handler won't cost us shit, or Seth Curry not getting ten rebounds a game. Everyone is going to play their role not be something they aren't because it's the playoffs."
"We have the 10th highest 3pt percentage in the league and the 4th highest over the last 3 games. People seem to think because Ben doesn't shoot we are some below average shooting team despite having players like Danny Green, Tobias and Seth Curry or even bench players like Furk and Shake who are all great shooters. Even Embiid is shooting 37%"
"Wiz fan here that doesn't like any type of hacking strategy cuz it's wack (like playing zone) but it worked.  And the reason it works is because it absolutely messes up your offense.  We can talk numbers and analytics all day. The game was tied, then we won by 7 employing the strategy.  That's because aside from the missed shots, Ben can no longer be your ball handler.   Under the 2 minute mark Ben touched the ball twice. Once to make a quick touch pass so he couldn't get fouled and one on that layup he got fouled hard on and once again went 1/2.  It takes away rhythm. Your best playmaker can't set up plays any more. Seth Curry tried to carry cuz he can create his own shot there and he did well.   But without Embiid and without Ben doing it all (don't forget he also had 5 fouls) the game got mucked up for the Sixers thanks to the strategy.  Doc can keep him on the floor all he wants, but he just lost an elimination game cuz of hack a Ben."
Maxey has big potential. George Hill is way better than Seth Curry and surprised he didn't play more.
"I don't think that's quite right. The wording is ""away from the play"" fouls are deemed to be intentional in the last 2 minutes of a quarter and turn into one free throw and possession. So there is some level of subjectivity there.   For instance if Simmons and another player are vying for a rebound in the last 2 minutes, and Simmons got fouled in the process, he would just be getting 2 free throws like normal, even though he wasn't the ball handler.  What if Simmons sets a pick for Seth Curry and Curry's defender ends up fouling Simmons while trying to go over the pick? Simmons would still just get the 2 free throws because he was involved in the play even if he wasn't the ball handler."
"As long as Simmons refuses to shoot I just don't see how the Sixers are a real threat. You can't put everything on Embiid, Harris and I guess Seth Curry."
"First of all, the Nets got beat by a very depleted Celtics team missing 3 starters with KD and Harden combining for 80 just because Kyrie had a subpar game (Yes, Tatum scored 50, but when the opposing 7th seed team is missing its 7th best player, you better win with 3 superstars, no excuses AT ALL).   Second, you‚Äôre looking too far ahead when there‚Äôs a good chance you won‚Äôt even get there. The Bucks are a much better team than the Celtics. Way better defensively and better offensively too. They are not the same team they were last year. Jrue is a much better fit than Bled. Don‚Äôt get too ahead of yourself because the Bucks are a real threat to the Nets.  Lastly, you‚Äôre underrating the Sixers a lot. Tobias is playing at an all star level this year. They massively improved the spacing around Embiid by replacing Horford with Danny Green and Seth Curry. They also have elite defenders in Ben, Matisse, and Joel and a good defender in DG to slow the Nets down.   KD and Harden will get their‚Äôs no doubt, but the only way Brooklyn has any chance is if Kyrie and Joe Harris can consistently show up. I promise you that the shitty defense of this depleted Celtics team is making the Nets look better than they really are. Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt competing with the Bucks and Sixers physically. Kyrie has a history of shitting the bed against Giannis in the playoffs."
"I agree, there's absolutely no reason for the coach to say anything negative about it publicly. Its not an effort or hustle part of the game that Simmons can improve upon quickly by making better on-court decisions or something to that effect.   Would be like if he called out Tobias Harris for shooting poorly from the field in this game or Seth Curry for missing his 3s."
"hearing kevin harlan say curry without steph on the floor is so weird. gotta get used to seth, i like him a lot"
"Teams are built differently now a days but he was basically Derick Fisher or Ron Harper...  A modern day comp for current title contenders:   Nets: Joe Harris   Bucks: Brook Lopez   Sixers: Seth Curry   Lakers: Schroeder   Clippers: Morris or Ibaka   Jazz: Bogdanovic   Basically, he was a key contributor on a championship caliber team. Not a superstar, not an all star but a key contributor."
&gt; He should maybe figure out who to attack  *Seth Curry has entered the chat*
Seth Curry single handedly
A 3 pt shooter who also has hops.   I thought of Seth Curry but he doesn't get up like that.  Danny Green? Terrence Ross has bounce and can shoot.
Seth Curry stinks
Seth Curry and Ben Simmons is like the super homeless version of a dream Steph/Lebron duo. One can dream...
76ers are such a flawed team with Simmons who can't make free throws and Seth Curry who can't defend anyone.  Nets will definitely destroy the 76ers in a sweep IMO.
"Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, RoCo, JJ Redick, Saric, Richardson, Thybulle, Dwight.......and also some guy named Joel Embiid  Like, I'm sure Dallas has had some nice pieces but it's not comparable"
MITWestbrook: SETH CURRY NEED BE ABUSED
You either said Steph twice or think Seth Curry is severely underrated.
Or Seth Curry
If your team relies this heavily on Seth Curry you are a mess
Seth Curry + Philly bench vs Hawks...
Somehow the Sixers are gonna keep Simmons and lose Seth Curry
maxey and seth curry
I agreeüòÇüòÇüòÇI would probably keep Seth Curry tho. They won that trade
Seth Curry is the leading scorer for the Sixers. Nate needs to adjust and give him more focus. Simmons is playing like himself and honestly you can live with him taking three‚Äôs. As for Embiid...well he will get 30 if he doesn‚Äôt give up. Honestly just gotta stop Seth from going off. He‚Äôs their real 3rd star right now.   Also...Maxey has 6. Need to slow him down.
It tells me a lot that Seth Curry is basically Philly‚Äôs de facto second option
seth curry cant win with these cats
Thank god for Seth Curry
GIVE SETH CURRY 30% OF EMBID TOBIAS AND BEN SIMMONS MONEY EACH. HE DESERVES IT
You guys what if Seth Curry went back in time and played with Glen Rice  And they called them Curry and Rice  What if that was a thing
why do I not trust anyone on the sixers besides seth curry
"I just learned that seth curry has a brother who's in the league too, crazy"
Seth Curry vs. Atlanta Hawks
feed curry  let him be Seth tonight
looking forward to seth curry going game 6 klay tonight
man i‚Äôve been watching seth curry and if joe harris could play HALF as good as seth against the bucks we would‚Äôve won the series already ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"""They don't run any plays for [Seth Curry]""  yeah that might be a mistake"
Seth Curry is better than Simmons.
No it's Seth Curry
Save Us Seth Curry
Seth Curry for KCP?
The McCollum one probably works but they should probably also be trading Seth Curry in a separate trade if they are doing that.
Totally unrelated but what if Seth Curry had played with Glen Rice.  üëÅüëÑüëÅ
I‚Äôll remember people constantly saying they should trade one of them and 76ers fan base always saying ‚Äúfuck that‚Äù and no look where we are. Simmons trade value at an all time low. Embiid‚Äôs best teammate is Seth Curry. This isn‚Äôt what I expected from the Process
"We will lose, there is no hope, I am not reverse jinxing.  Seriously though, after 5 games it comes down to what adjustments coaches will make. Last game Nate surprised us by closing out the game with 3 bigs (Capela, Collins, and Gallo) and Trae and Williams, who was shooting hot. Those last two aren't great at 1 on 1 defense (but are good at executing a scheme that masks their deficiencies), plus three bigs, none of which are excellent on the perimeter. Philly's games 2-4 showcased some real bench talent, on the wing, and Game 5 was stellar from Seth, though strangely Maxey, Milton, and Korkmaz didn't get going. The lineup was forced because of Bogi being in foul trouble, but Nate still decided on that lineup even with Huerter available, who's likely the best perimeter defender with Hunted out. In a way, Doc played into the strengths of the Hawks lineup by not forcing more wing play and instead relying on two people that the Hawks started to nullify (Curry and Embiid). Plus, both started to become liabilities on defense either through mismatch (Gallo on Curry specifically) and Embiid getting tired.  I'm totally prepared for us to lose, for us to come back, or for covid-2021 to cause mass casualties."
"Donnie is a fucking terrible GM, Rick isnt a great coach, Harlabob is probably right, Cuban is right for firing all of them. Donnie traded seth curry for josh richardson... cmon now."
"Yeah but Ben and Embiid together isn't worth it. Embiid doesn't need defensive help he needs guys around him that can shoot like Seth Curry. Way more useful to specifically play Ben when Embiid is on the bench, which would be much easier if Ben didn't start.  They are also dominating starters +- because of Embiid, editing the starters won't change much as long as Embiid stays there they have a better starting lineup. Putting Ben on the bench could improve the bench offense, allow Curry to play more with Embiid and get plenty of open catch threes, and would always give them a DPOY candidate on the floor. Ben should be a 6th man on a championship team, or maybe small ball 5 as the 4th or 5th offensive option."
"&gt;Simmons is bad for the playoffs  Hm, that seems pretty important. If my favorite team traded a superstar for a package centered around a player who we all know is bad in the playoffs I would probably stop watching.   &gt;a team built to his strengths he is still a valuable top 35 player in the league.  The Sixers' starting lineup around him:   Seth Curry - shooting 48% from 3, on 7 attempts per game in the playoffs  Danny Green - 38% from 3, on 5 attempts per game in the playoffs (Korkmaz 35% from 3 on 3 attempts per game)  Tobias - 36% from 3, on 3 attempts per game in the playoffs  Embiid - 41% from 3, on 4 attempts per game in the playoffs  He is surrounded by 4 players who are all good to great 3 point shooters. He has the team ""built to his strengths"" right now and has single handedly lost the sixers multiple games in the playoffs. He sucks."
"I will do simmons and 2 firsts for him absolutely  we cant afford to also lose seth curry though, if you want shake milton you can have him  but absolutely the sixers should be willing to try to make something like that work"
Right. So Seth Curry was more effective than those dudes that had zero.
Ok now do Seth Curry
"&gt; let Jimmy walk away for nothing  We got fleeced by S&amp;Ting him for Josh Richardson but then we re-fleeced the Mavs by swapping him and a 2nd for Seth Curry, whose under contract for 2 more years for *checks notes* ~$24 mil less than Horford.  &gt; trades Horford for pennies on the dollar  Danny Green for Horford and a 2025 1st is a pretty good get all things considered especially since his contract can be similarly used as filler for a better player.  Just an FYI too it‚Äôs would ‚Äúhave‚Äù not would ‚Äúof‚Äù"
"Some people really focus too much on the importance of shooting....shooting ain't everything. If shooting really was the leading factor to winning teams, players like Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris, and Seth Curry would be the top paid players in the league."
"Lmaooo reading must be hard for you too Bc I didn‚Äôt say you ever discredited us, I said you didn‚Äôt give us the credit we deserve either. ‚ÄúThe sixers collapse is the reason they lost the game‚Äù is revisionist history. Philly collapsing is not the sole reason they lost. We also played a near perfect half quarter of basketball. We hacked a Ben to success, we hit clutch shot after shot, and we took advantage of Seth curry by playing Lou and trae to create a Gallo mismatch which was an beautiful tactic. Aaaaand we gassed Embiid by forcing him to play 40 min a night on a gimp knee bc we won earlier games which made it so he missed clutch free throws. Trae may not have won the game by himself to your original point, but the hawks won that game almost as much as philly collapsed and I stand by that"
"So did LeBron. Seth Curry &gt; LeBron confirmed. While we‚Äôre at it, Seth Curry &gt; Luka, Seth Curry &gt; Jokic, Seth Curry &gt; Lillard, Seth Curry &gt; Kyrie, Seth Curry &gt; Kawhi. You know, since they all had 0."
"Are we gonna act like the Sixers didn‚Äôt improve a ton going from like the six seed or whatever to the one seed? Seth curry and Danny Green are good but the roster changes don‚Äôt explain all of the huge jump. Doc isn‚Äôt perfect and he‚Äôs definitely no longer a top five coach, but he is still a legitimately good defensive coach."
Dude Seth Curry is like the 3rd or 4th option most nights. That would be like saying Brook Lopez is a better player than LeBron James this year because he got further in the playoffs.
Probably him and Paul George tbh. Tbh most players get shit on here. Only player I‚Äôve seen mostly positive stuff about is Seth Curry maybe
Seth Curry pls
I'd rather have Seth Curry than Joe Harris.
"Ayton, Paul George, Seth Curry"
I know but let us see what Morey has in mind. He turned Al Horford  and josh richardson into seth curry and Danny Green after all.
Seth Curry got abused all night tonight. Atlanta did well to find him on defense. Same story with JJ Redick few seasons back. Well coached teams in the playoffs will seek out good 3pt shooters with abysmal defense and make them pay.
Seth Curry and Trae Young are on opposite teams
"Seth Curry with that ""what the fuck"" arm gesture."
"Seriously. Seth Curry was a legit breakout star in this series. Simmons was ass. If I‚Äôm a coach and one of my players refuses to be coached and it‚Äôs my job is on the line or his, you better believe I‚Äôm looking out for #1."
Package with Seth Curry and we get a sometimes aggressive Ben. That could work for the lakers.
Seth Curry was the actual Superman in this game tbh
But Seth Curry...
Huerter targeted Seth Curry though
Seth Curry balled out most of this series
I say this as a Sixers fan but our roster is overrated as fuck. Embiid is on a torn meniscus and our second option is Seth Curry. Get a real point guard on this team that can score &amp; handle the ball. I bet Embiid's stupid mistakes go away very quickly since he won't have to force a post play through a double team every possession
"I'm in my 30s, so young compared to many Americans. Maybe you misunderstood my comment? I understand the strategy. I just don't think it would be a valid strategy if we had a good ruleset.  What I think the NBA should do is change the rules. If you change the rules, then the teams will change their strategy. For example, they could add a rule that says ""Free throws can now be shot by any player on the floor, not just the person fouled"". Then all of sudden intentionally fouling Simmons is a bad idea because Seth Curry could go to the line.  The way the rules are written right now just rewards teams who are good at intentionally fouling bad free throw shooters. Which is dumb. I want to watch real defense, not hack-a-Ben-Simmons. That would be so much more fun to watch. Instead the coach takes out one of the All Star players who is fun to watch at the end of the game."
"Ben and Seth Curry for Draymond and Kelly Oubre, who says no?  Other than Draymond"
I for one am just glad we don't have the play Seth Curry anymore
Dumb trade idea: Colin Sexton and Kevin Love and a first round pick to the Sixers in exchange for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry
"I am a Ben Simmons hater to the tenth degree but I feel like he could do *something* on another team. He's never gonna be the true star that he was projected to be but his strengths are still there and he's a legit perennial DPOTY candidate.  I'm trying to think of a team that could utilize him correctly, maybe Minnesota to run point behind Towns, DLo and Edwards? His offensive game is extremely limited, nobody could deny that at this point but if he goes to the right team and they surround him with lots of shooting (real shooting, not Seth Curry and Tobias Harris) it might just work.   I could also see a small market or habitual lottery team taking a chance on building something around him depending on his trade value. Regardless he's done in Philly unless his trade value or albatross of a contract prevents Morey from moving him."
"He's a first-team all defense candidate, the return probably won't be very good but I'm sure Morey will be able to find a buyer, just look at the Seth Curry / Josh Richardson trade."
"Kemba is just another seth curry,  good offense but a defensive liability"
"...so you think Kevin Durant would agree to play in Philadelphia right now? With who? I'm assuming you mean Simmons would stay and Embiid would go instead based on how you worded your question. So Kevin Durant is going to play with Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris and Seth Curry at 32 years old?"
Iso post ball only works for so long. It's embiid's fault he didn't just pass out of bad shots. Instead he took fadeaway after fadeaway instead of getting the ball to Seth Curry who has lit us up all series with clutch shots
Seth Curry too
"If tingus pingus is code for bogdonivic then yeah he‚Äôs hard to watch, he‚Äôll make Seth curry look like steph when he‚Äôs not throwing bricks at the backboard."
"are you serious lmao. let's ignore ben, 6ers top players are the mvp runnernup joel embiid, a pure scorer in tobias harris, flamethrower seth curry, all nba defender matisse thybulle, a veteran george hill, shake milton and a pretty good rookie imo tyrese. you wanna do a side by side against the hawks' best players?  even by your argument that the hawks are at the nare minimum very close to philly, philly got outcoached"
Seth Curry and his two testicles
"Curry made himself some major future money this series. There were times where it seemed like he was the only one that could score with any consistency. If he bulks up a bit and improves his finishing down low similar to how his brother did, Seth curry is going to be a problem very soon."
"Bogdanovic is trash, he made Seth curry look like steph."
"He needs to be in a Rondo Celtics situation. 3 all-star scoring options ahead of you and he's just the guy facilitating it all. Embiid fits the Garnett role well enough, but Tobias Harris ain't no Paul Pierce and Seth Curry can't quite fit Ray Allen's shoes."
Why even bother with Dinwiddle? Just send a box of Crackerjacks and some Big League Chew. Maybe you can even ask for Seth Curry too while you're at it.
"I had a really good weekend for predictions and just want to brag: won money on seth curry making at least four threes in game, won money on bucks winning, didn't bet but said Booker would make 40 points today (bailed out by the needless endgame free throws), said Sixers would fold. I'm on cloud nine."
"Ben Simmons couldn't even build a brick house since he just didn't want the ball on offense. Seth Curry on an island on defense. Sixers falling asleep on defense, Capela had so many lob dunks. Wild."
Simmons has had JJ Redick and Seth Curry on his teams and his career stats are still absurdly consistent across the board. He's not learning to shoot.  That said I do think CJ for Simmons makes sense.
"Look at Seth Curry on the left side of the screen, he puts his hands up in confusion and frustration as soon as Ben passes it.   He literally has to be traded at this point, his teammates have lost faith in him."
I wasn't aware that Seth Curry had any mental challenges.
"Maybe I'm crazy but I like Harris and think you can make his game work in an offensive scheme with the sixers He's not a spot up shooter though, he's a slasher, and you can't just plant him in a corner. Seth curry + Embiid + Harris and two other competent bodies, ideally people who can pass and shoot, and you're probably golden. Simmons can't score, and the rest of their bench isn't really consistent enough for buckets"
Your best player played on a torn meniscus and you telling me he put up no effort.  Seth Curry is your best perimeter player.  You lost because your team made no sense and your best player was injured and Ben Simmons passed up open dunks.
"lmfaoo that would be hilarious. but for real, you replace Simmons with Kemba and the 6ers are definitely better in the playoffs. shit, if you replace ben simmons with a clone of seth curry, they‚Äôre better in the playoffs"
TOBIAS WAS GREAT LMFAOOOOOüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ curry was great fr tho but if Seth Curry is your only reliable teammate something is wrong  edit: Okay Tobi was okay a few games but also Today 24 points on 24 shots and the 4 points in the must win game 5 is inexcusable
"Everyone saying get rid of Ben and that Ben won‚Äôt be on the team next year but literally who tf is trading for that contract. The Process was a long, drawn out failure. It took Seth fucking Curry for the Sixers to even look like a playoff team."
Not his fault Thybulle isn‚Äôt good enough on offense to play Curry to the bench. Sixers lose game 6 for sure without Seth.
"Kevin ""Seth Curry"" Huerter"
"Who would‚Äôve thought that Philly‚Äôs big 3 this post-season would be Embiid, Harris and Not Steph, but Seth Curry."
Simmons had 18 points total the last 3 games paid 35mm didn‚Äôt play the final minutes‚Ä¶ a guy who gets 7mm did that in game 7 and carried us in the series Seth Curry. Trade em.
"Hope Seth Curry wishes his dad, Kevin Huerter, a Happy Father's Day. Dude got torched on defense. Shout out Ben Simmons for doing nothing this whole series. He took more FTs than FGs. Truly amazing."
"Honestly just feel like they're the most predictable group of players in the NBA. It's too obvious what they're going to do and what their weak points are.   Also can't believe the HAWKS were smart enough to hunt Seth Curry every possession down the court, and the Sixers had no answer defensively. Meanwhile, they have a defensive liability in Trae Young just allowed to float on the Sixers' worst shooter, and the Sixers never try to get a switch. How have they never orchestrated Young on Embiid?"
curry is underrated as fuck. people who think he‚Äôs better than steph are absurd obviously but seth is about as good of a role player as you can get
The face of a man realizing seth curry is his running mate
"He was basically KD lite tonight, the sixers fucked up putting Seth curry on him."
"&gt;So you get to Keep Matisse, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Embid and all you gotta do is trade Ben Simmons and 3 first round picks?!?!? PHILLY IF YOU DON'T PULL THE TRIGGER I SWEAR TO GOD  This comment got downvoted to -12. Speaks to how delusional the /r/sixers sub was about Simmons lmao."
Philly gotta shake that roster up with some big trades. Just spitballing here but...maybe Seth curry for josh Richardson? I hear Dallas is looking for a shooter
They got Seth Curry on a steal contract for 2 more years and hopefully the FO realizes they absolutely need to move on from Ben and Tobi and take whatever they can get for them.   Honestly its probably too soon to tell but I think Philly could build something around Seth/Embiid duo if they can figure out how to hide seth on defense and get another ball handler that can actually run half court sets and get ball movement going unlike Ben
I call it the ghost. You just fade away nobody can possibly notice you amongst the stars around you and guess what you can shoot. Huerter has great all around game from his time as a number 1 option at Maryland. You add seth curry trying to check him and well I'm amazed he didn't go off more once he got hot
styling over seth curry every shot
Where's that Seth Curry hater lol. Got the last laugh
I feel so bad for Embiid and Seth Curry  I will never forget the look on Ben's face as the clock was winding down as he was trying to process his last game as a sixer
"In a game 7, the Sixers wing rotation for the final set play was Seth Curry, Shake Milton and George Hill. Ben Simmons not even playable.  Meanwhile Kyle Lowry somehow improving his value without even playing. The list of ""Wish we traded for Kyle Lowry"" teams is now at 3!"
"Atlanta played great defense but Philly's offense was atrocious, no ball movement and just forcing iso shots.  Also Seth Curry is a defensive liability, but their offense was so ass, and Doc had to put him back and Huerter continued to cook him."
It's stupid. Not gonna waste time with a Seth Curry Lowlights. It was obvious.
Seth Curry deserves better
Dell Curry must be so sad that Seth got a new daddy on Fathers Day.
"Kevin Huerter vs Seth Curry, the duel we all wanted."
There's 0 coming back for this for him in Philly.  That unit can comeback. Seth Curry for J-Rich was a god-tier trade for them. But Simmons needs to be up outta there.
Must feel really fucking bad when you have 3 maxed players and your 2nd best player is Seth fucking Curry
Seth Curry has made his name.      The idea of Simmons is even more cemented
Shout out Nate McMillan for going at Seth Curry all game.
Seth Curry balled out this series
"Seth Curry looking at Ben like... ""you make how much more than me?!"""
Why is Seth curry just standing in the opposite corner when they need to chuck 3s. Go get the ball
"Get seth curry to a real contender please, not this fradulent team"
Feels bad when you have 3 essentially maxed out players and your second best player is Seth fucking Curry
"It‚Äôs got to be a Seth curry three to save it, right?"
Damn Philly played like absolute trash. Everyone except Joel Embiid and Seth Curry should be imprisoned for life and Ben Simmons should probably be executed
Seth Curry is their only hope.
Seth Curry is a bucket getter no one man is ‚Äòstopping him‚Äô the way the game is played now. It ain‚Äôt like their ISO‚Äôs all game he just lost him
Doc Rivers do not deserve this win lmao. 7 games and u cant adjust against a PnR? They got cooked for all 7 games with it and no adjustment. As well as the Hawks trying to hunt Curry. The Warriors employed a strat to prevent Harden or CP3 hunting Curry. It's called a pre-switch. Doc took out Seth to replace him with defensive players but for two straight possessions they fuck up on defense lmao.
I Hope RDCWorld roasts the shit out of Ben Simmons and Doc Rivers. He either acts as Embiid or Seth Curry.
Exploiting the Seth Curry matchup? Somewhere MITwestbrook is smiling
Seth Curry looks like a cartoon dog that's about to cry.
Does Seth Curry have a giant bald spot on his chin or does he actually intentionally shave that way?
**Smart play by Doc to take out Seth Curry on defense. Bring back Seth for offense.**
Poor Seth Curry needs more help
Hilarious that a healthy #1 seed has to rely on Seth curry for offensive creation
No Seth Curry is terrible at defense.
holy shit seth curry is horrid on defense
/u/MITWestbrook would be so proud of Heurter cooking on Seth Curry
"If Seth Curry and Ben Simmons could fuse, it would be one incredible complete player."
Everyone in mavs FO should get fired for doing the Seth curry Jrich trade alone
No team should ever rely on Seth Curry as much as the Sixers do
Huerter and Seth Curry battling to get their teams into the ECF seems like a headline from Earth-47.  I guess we just assume we're prime Earth.
You already know the dude that hates Seth Curry with a passion is now writing his thesis on his play this game right now.
"If Curry is wide-open, Hawks should just foul someone before the shot.  How can you continue to leave Seth wide-open? He and Embiid have literally killed you every game this series."
Seth Curry was probably the best offseason pickup by anyone. Hes a key player for the Sixers and has a lot to do with their success.
"Seth curry gets a finals MVP while steph doesn't have one, I would like to see it just for the memes"
**just easy buckets over Seth Curry**
u/MITWestbrook must be nutting on Huerter for exploiting Seth Curry every time
Seth Curry deserves more money than what he's earning right now. Mavs got robbed no question.
"If Seth Curry can continue to be a legitimate #3 option, then Ben Simmons not being able to shoot isn't as big of a deal IMO."
**stick with defense. Bench Seth Curry.**
"If the Sixers win the title this year, Seth curry is getting a statue right next to Nick Foles‚Äô."
Seth curry is the second best player on this team
seth curry has been a star this series. Talk about stepping up. Watch and maybe you'll fucking learn something joe harris
I WANT SETH CURRY
That Westbrook guy bout to have a field day criticising Seth curry defence
"Alright, i‚Äôm convinced Mavs is one Seth Curry away from WCF."
Seth curry &gt; steph curry
What are you doing leaving Seth curry wide open to help on Embiid at the 3 point line...
"So before when I said I think Embiid is the best 3 point shooter in the world, I actually think Seth Curry is."
seth with that off ball movement was a almost a curry family patented play
yea maybe play seth curry a little more..
Seth curry &gt; Steph Curry
"The cavalry, I mean Seth Curry, is here"
Did Seth curry die?? Where is he?
Seth Curry let‚Äôs go
surely they can bring in seth curry in now right
i dont think shake milton is really provide more benefit than seth curry out there.
why arent the sixers putting in seth curry????
Tobias Harris having 35m and Seth Curry having 23m when he's probably the sixers 2nd best player in this series is a classic Doc
"Rest of the team outside of Seth ""Literally Steph"" Curry*"
Your boy Seth curry
Seth Curry should be getting more shots.
Sixers look different when Seth Curry isn't dropping 25
Trae young and Seth curry just goofy and shit but thybulle looks like an ogre
is seth curry hurt or something?
imagine saying this in a game with trae young and seth curry‚Ä¶
Seth Curry is really consistent.
"Feed Seth curry, your only hope"
Seth Curry got kneed in the face earlier and they didn't even look in the direction of the monitor
Collins also literally kneed Seth Curry in the head
Every time i see the following i think:   Joel Embiid = Treebeard  Tobias Harris = The Weeknd  Seth Curry = the Geico caveman
Huerter v Seth Curry shootout is the making of legends
Seth curry looking true to Phil-A with his Benjamin Franklin ass mutton chops
The Huerter and Seth Curry game. Wasn‚Äôt expecting it but I‚Äôm here for it
"If Mavs didn't trade Seth Curry for Josh Richardson who barely played, they'd probably go through Clippers."
Huerter vs Seth Curry superstar game 7 matchup basically KD vs Giannis
I take your trae young and raise you a Seth curry
"Seth Curry reminds me of another famous Curry, former Charlotte Hornet Dell Curry"
"Simmons being Draymond works a lot better if they have the other Curry brother, imo. Though Seth is trying his best."
Seth Curry being the guy Embiid needs as his Robin speaks poorly of the process and most of the moves the 6ers have made since...
"Simmons, a $200 million player, spent more time setting screens for Seth Curry than looking to be aggressive"
I dont think there's much to argue there. Hawks fans knew it was a win win trade from the start. The hawks front office just did a better job surrounding trae. We traded seth curry for jrich.
"I want Philly to win, but I don‚Äôt think they will. 2 points a half from Ben Simmons isn‚Äôt going to make this easy.  Basically they‚Äôre relying on Tobias Harris to have an above average game, and Seth Curry helping Embiid backpack them."
Ben Simmons should forfeit his salary to Seth Curry this year
Seth curry makes 8m. They should not be this reliant on him to score and create with the ball in his hands.
"So the superstars are basically absent this game...it's Kevin Huerter vs Seth Curry, the matchup we all wanted to see"
Seth curry makes less than Ben Simmons btw
One of the worst players in the league?ü§îü§îü§î ...he had the same or better overall stats than seth curry this year
Why is Seth curry the second best sixer
Seth Curry makes less than Markelle Fultz
"Has Seth Curry always been this good? If not, what happened? lmao"
Sixers whole offense:   Simmons hand off to Seth Curry and find a shot
Seth curry is making my ass itch.
We went from a KD vs Giannis battle to a Seth curry vs huerter battle wtf is this
Seth Curry really needs to trim that patchy beard or just shave it off. It's very bad.
We can‚Äôt all have Seth curry carry our stars all series.
seth curry vs huerter like we all expected
Seth Curry is my favorite storyline from this series!
Seth Curry really the #2 option on this team lol
Seth wants to make sure the streak of having either ‚ÄúCurry or LeBron in 10 consecutive finals‚Äù stays true.
Seth Curry is the real splash bro
"Seth ""Dell Curry's son"" Curry"
If the Mavs kept Seth Curry they beat the Clippers.
Seth Curry legacy game
Seth curry transforms into steph
I love Seth Curry.
Seth Curry is a fucking g
I am terrified of Seth curry
"Because it was a basketball play, Seth caught him with a nasty pumpfake, he jumped to contest, Curry ducked at the wrong time and caught an unlucky shot to the face. It was just an accident, he didn't do it intentionally."
"Holy shit are we watching football? Seth Curry gets sacked like a QB, and then dwight comes and trucks trae."
Seth Curry was such a slam dunk trade for the 76ers
Seth ‚ÄúMemphis depay‚Äù curry
That Seth Curry guy is pretty good I wonder if he has any brothers
Superstar Seth Curry
Seth Curry is the only mentally strong Sixers player
"Seth ""Steph Curry's brother"" Curry"
Shoutout to Blazers legend Seth Curry
He moved into him after he jumped.  Seth Curry created the contact.  Big collision though.
Seth Curry is the most likable vet on the Sixers
John Collins fucking shinsuke nakamura‚Äôd Seth curry
Lmao what was Collins going for there? Teabag Seth Curry from a standing position? Lmfao
Him and Embiid are gonna have a flop party while Seth Curry and Danilo Gallinari care their teams to a tie game
Will Seth curry go super nova again?
idk which will cause a bigger meltdown on the Mavs sub; Hawks winning and all the national media Trae&gt;Luka narratives.  Or Seth Curry dropping 30 in a Sixers win.  &amp;#x200B;  But I do know both will be hilarious
imagine if Ben Simmons and Seth Curry were combined into 1 person
Seth Curry is apart of the big 3 not Ben Simmons.  Ben has been so good at hiding this game I‚Äôve barely noticed he was on the court.
"Seth Curry is good. Makes me wonder if Mychel Thompson is actually good, too."
Seth Curry is a first ballot entrant into the pube beard HoF
Feels like Seth curry aged 70 years in like two
"Seth Curry for me so far, but role players have been at a premium with stars falling to injury left and right."
