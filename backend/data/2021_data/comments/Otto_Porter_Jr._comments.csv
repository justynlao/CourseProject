"teams have half a BILLION in cap space this summer  idk how you are just ignoring its a player’s market, Oubre, Otto Porter Jr, Wil Barton, these guys aren’t signing $10m/yr contracts, a lot more than that"
"Coby White, Garrett Temple, Patrick Williams or Otto Porter Jr, Thaddeus Young, Wendell Carter Jr. Not the worst pretty good."
I think it's funny that Otto Porter Jr and Michael Porter Jr are both from Missouri but aren't related.
Otto Porter Jr.
Warriors send Oubre to Houston for PJ Tucker. Bulls give them Otto Porter jr for Eric Gordon
"Honestly Chicago Bulls. This team lacks of primary playmaker and also Ben should play point forward he can defend all 5 positions can switch to everybody. Chicago Bulls starting 5 is full of shooting specialists.   He can play 4 with Markkanen at the 5 and can cover Markkanen's lack of post defending and also he can play point guard for them and they can let White to be microwave scorer.  Garrett Temple, Zach Lavine, Patrick Williams/Otto Porter Jr, Ben Simmons, Lauri Markkanen five is balanced can be effective on both sides."
"Celtics fans are collectively losing their shit over the prospect of trading for Harrison Barnes.    I personally am pretty intrigued by Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Harrison Barnes, Garrett Temple, and Otto Porter Jr."

"It's always a gamble.  Norman Powell, Otto Porter Jr,, will Barton, Ben McLemore...etc  Of course, players that are fairly consistent like Drummond will always show up and show up even better in contract years.  Everyone kind of already drafts them already."
Lol same and Otto Porter Jr came to mind first before Kevin Porter lol
What about Otto Porter jr?
Must be a Porter Jr. thing. Someone ought to check on Otto
"No, early on in his tenure, Sean Marks did this with Tyler Johnson, Allen Crabbe, and Otto Porter Jr.  The incumbent team doesn't need to match, meaning the team who offered the contract gets the player and his contract.  Also, Marks didn't do this in a nefarious way. He genuinely wanted those players so he offered a crazy contract hoping that the incumbent team wouldn't match, and that the Nets could develop the player to the point where the contract isn't a huge overpay."
Isnt that Otto Porter Jr??
"This whole time, I was like... ""Whose #4 and why is Otto Porter Jr. picture not on here.""... re reads and realizes its Kevin..."
Otto Michael and Kevin Porter Jr are all fools!
_Pray that Otto Porter Jr or Michael Porter Jr get traded to the cavs and wants to have the same number_
Pray that Otto Porter Jr. becomes a Cav
Can he come to the Nuggets so you can have the Porter Jr^2  + Bol^2 aesthetic? Fuck it let's get the Bulls in this and add Otto to this vibe.
"And Some Mock Drafts had players like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Ben McLemore going 1st"
Otto Porter Jr
Otto Porter Jr is on his last year of the contract
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Junior, Denzel Valentine, Tomas Satoransky, Patrick William, Gafford (idk his first name)"
"AD isn’t the 2nd best player in the NBA lmao. My point is if you’re not gonna enough to be the 2nd option next to the best player in the world, you clearly are t a true 2nd option for a contender. Why are the Bulls one of the worst teams in the league if Lavine is as good as you think he is? They’re a very talented team. They’re playing Otto Porter Jr off the bench. Coby White is for real, Carter and Markannen are having bounce back seasons. Williams is going to make an all rookie team. Young and Temple are real NBA vets."

"Only Harden, I don’t think Lavine nor Otto Porter Jr. are good enough to make a meaningful difference for the title."
"I'm not at all familiar with Otto Porter Jr., but he's making $28.4m which is just a hair less than some of the biggest names in the league. And his stats give me no explanation for this. Frequently not a starter, too."
"To improve on the team that made the ECF last season we really just need Kemba healthy. The Jays have stepped up in a big way. Tatum, Brown and (healthy) Kemba is looking like a really strong top 3.   To take the next step, we're one starting level wing short and it means we're asking for a lot from everyone. We're relying on our top-end talent having huge nights every night and we play a lot of bad lineups that end up costing us games.    All of our main bench players are individually good when they're playing with the starters. The issue is when we play our bench players with other bench players.   Grant Williams is a great example, he looks good playing next to Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum. He looks pretty bad when he's playing next to 2-3 other Grant Williams.    We could chase a secondary star, but even just 1 decent wing would take a lot of pressure off our guys.   Eg:  * Robert Covington * Otto Porter Jr * Jae Crowder * Harrison Barnes * Terrence Ross * etc etc  Our bench players are good fill-ins but 1 more starting wing would mean we don't have to play so many lineups that have a bench majority."
Honestly they'd probably have a chance in the East; the Bulls have been missing a true lead guard and SGA would do wonders there. Thunder also flush out the depth chart.

Don't forget he offered otto porter jr 106M. You're lucky the wizards matched that offer and saved his reputation.
"I agree. Embiid is just too fat and lazy. With that said I think the Sixers should trade him for Lauri Markannan, Otto Porter Jr. and 2 first round picks."
"Wizards.  We finally thought we’d get a top 3 pick again with our start to this season (last one was Otto Porter Jr. in 2013)  Since 2013 pick, we’ve hung around 5th-10th spot in the East.  Never actually legit, never bad enough to get superstar talent in the draft again with Wall/Beal combo.  We finally, FINALLY start to really suck and think #FadeForCade and of course we turn it around and are 6-1 going for 7-1 against T-Wolves in recent Western Conference killer streak.  Because OF COURSE a DC Sports team couldn’t even tank properly lol"
"I was gonna say Washington, KD-Wall-Beal would have had some real nice ECF matchups with Bron.  Instead they maxed Otto Porter Jr"
"Otto Porter Jr., Lauri Markkanen and Chandler Hutchison for the Bulls."
"Thad Young's been their second best player this season, sadly.  Also, the team is incredibly young. Outside of Thad (13 years in the league), Temple (10), Otto Porter Jr. (7, and injured), Lavine (5), and Satoransky (4), everyone else has 3 years of NBA experience of fewer, including starters/rotation players Markannen, WCJ, Coby White, Patrick Williams, Denzel Valentine, and Gafford. On top of that, of the young players, it seems like only LaVine (if he still counts as being young) and maybe Markannen have borderline all-star potential. (The jury is out on Patrick Williams.)"
"It's gonna be a bad class. The only reason teams were clearing space was for Giannis but now that he got his supermax the best available players are Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr and DeMar DeRozan"
"That's not entirely accurate. They could make a ladder trade to get Drummond using the TPE. For example trading TT for Otto Porter Jr, then flipping Otto Porter Jr for Drummond. I still don't think they're going to go after him"
I think Al Horford's contract is awful but he's rehabbing his trade value silently in OKC and some desperate contender will try to go for him.  Most supermax contracts are ass (Russ and John Wall). Kevin Love's is also particularly bad. At least Otto Porter Jr is an expiring.
Otto Porter Jr. I thought he would be twice the player he ended up being.
"Healthy Bulls bench has Otto Porter Jr, Thad Young, Satoransky, G Temple. That's pretty decent for a playoff contender"
"The scoring isn't empty, he's efficient. He's not a good defender, despite his improvements, and neither is most of the starting lineup so his net rating is often poor. Coby and Lauri play terrible defense so it's on Wendell Carter Jr. and Pat Williams to hold down the fort which is a precarious situation at best.      We have a deep roster so we've got guys like Thad Young, Garret Temple, Otto Porter Jr., and Tomas Satoransky coming off the bench as  second stringers and they often have much better +/- than Zach.      Our best lineups seem to be when we mix those 2nd unit vets with Zach and one of our other starters (not named Coby). However, the FO is focused on seeing the young core get minutes to evaluate who stays and who goes. Which means we're giving up more points and scoring less consistently, and taking a few more L's than we would if we were dead set on winning."
"It's not his fault that the team isn't performing. He's putting in effort on D and trying to create for others. His teammates are letting him down. Coby hit a horrible slump, Lauri Wendell and Otto porter jr decided to take their annual 30 game vacation to the hospital. He basically is all alone but is still keeping the bulls in the game.    The only guards I see better than him in the east are Kyrie, Harden, Beal and Brown. It'll be a shame if he doesn't get through the wildcard spot. And mentioning the bulls record is dumb because the bulls are 2.5 games behind the 4 seed and have lost 7 games this season within 4 points ( Not an excuse but we are better than our record)"
Yeah upcoming Free agent Otto Porter Jr that if we let go we can save tons of money as well as not have to worry about a guy who would be the 4th best forward (at best) on the team at this point
upcoming free agent Otto Porter Jr you mean?
Not better than Otto Porter Jr
"Ross is on the Nuggets.  Wonder how many people would have guessed &gt;!Otto Porter Jr.!&lt; . Remember when he was a part of Washington's upcoming ""Big 3""?"
"They don’t need a superstar. They need quality starters and depth. Vucevic, Gordon, Powell, Gary Trent jr, Wendell Carter jr, Theis, Otto Porter jr, Olynyk, and Gary Harris all got flipped at the deadline. Not to mention all the players that were traded at the last deadline or in the offseason.  At some point you have to pull the trigger. All of those guys are high quality NBA players unlike the everyone on the Warriors bench. If the Warriors don’t trade their own pick this offseason, then it’s clear they’re not trying to win. There is zero argument for drafting another project."
"Nobody you can class a role player is making more than 20mill apart from Otto Porter Jr I think. Apart from the stars, the only people making that money rn are people who were important pieces when they signed the contract and have now regressed."
You have got to be kidding me... per Shams Charania via Twitter:  “Otto Porter Jr. has reached a buyout agreement with the @OrlandoMagic. The @BrooklynNets have already contacted Porter’s agent and are expected to sign him by Sunday.”  [link to tweet](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/606567277f74040c8274517f/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;cropX2=2848&amp;cropY1=413&amp;cropY2=2549)
"What about the Porter Jr. Bros? MPJ, KPJ, and Otto"
"For fun I looked at some contracts on Spotrac.  Wiggins is 29 mil this year, that's CJ money (CJ due for a new contract, so watch that number rise).  Surprisingly, that's also 4 million less than Middleton. Ok, so those are better players than him, who are also both 3 years older than him (I don't know why, but I keep thinking of Middleton as a breakout player-to-be, rather than established star).  Now, let's look at who's paid less.  In the 28 mil range there's Otto Porter Jr, Gordon Hayward, Beal and D'Lo (ok that one we knew).  Other than Beal are any of them clearly better contracts than Wiggins?  Also, again he's younger than all of them except D'Lo.  If you go down to 27 million, then you see Ingram and DeRozen.  One guy paid for promise and one guy paid for past performance."
Otto Porter Jr
"Lol I'm with the pelicans front office... you don't get to choose where you go, this ain't fantasy land. This is a business and i feel like cutting you I cut you, if i feel like sending you to Minnesota for a bag of chips then so be it. You signed the contract, go ahead and retire. Vise versa, give me a big contract that you regret like the wizards gave Otto Porter Jr/John wall and the wizards didn't complain about money not well spent. Keep it pushing end of story."
I'm sitting here hoping we can get Otto Porter Jr. in a buyout situation so
"Build a team?  What roster was ever built around him?  A wolves team that wasn’t doing anything, traded him for JimmyB for like a season of relevance, then came back to doing nothing?  A rebuilding Bulls team that had three straight 7th overall picks then one 4th overall pick? A rebuilding Bulls team who had Jim fucking Boylen as a coach for a season and half — that Bulls team? That egg head had Thad play spot up beyond the arc.   Jfc, before Vuc, Zach’s only team mate to have a max contract was otto porter jr. You think a team with OPJ as a max contract player is a “built” team that’s gonna go anywhere? This season, two of his best team mates — Thad and Sato — literally came off the bench most of the season.   The rosters that Zach has played with for most of his tenure with the Bulls was quite frankly terrible. Your favorite player wouldn’t be able to do much with Zach’s rosters. Those rosters were young af and often injured. They weren’t built for anything."
Tyreke Evans  Jabari Parker  Otto Porter Jr  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlens Noel
I wanted Otto Porter jr to make that shot just to send the game to overtime just to fuck with everyone else's time
tross isn’t playing. chuma okeke/otto porter jr probably idk khem birch maybe. depends on the day lol
Probably dreaming about a situation where Otto Porter Jr is possibly bought out. More realistic option would be getting Avery Bradley back or Moe Harkless.
"Come be the second best Porter Jr on the Nuggets, Otto"
Otto Porter Jr would be great on the Spurs
I think Otto Porter jr was bought out as well? Though I can’t see anything that says that
Yeah if Otto Porter Jr. is bought out they'll make a push for him
Now announce Otto Porter Jr to Lakers
"Yeah I agree, it definitely doesn't hurt. My main point is that this isn't really a blockbuster move, neither was the Griffin signing. It's just that they're big names.   I'd even say that rather than having both LMA and Blake it'd be better to have one and Otto Porter Jr (if he's bought out). That's just not as sexy of a headline because OPJ has never been a star."
"Realistic targets would be guys Avery Bradley, Wayne Ellington and Gorgui Dieng. Unrealistic would be guys like Drummond and Otto Porter jr, but still being targeted."
Otto Porter Jr. Idk if hes a center but he is the MVP right now.
"Otto Porter Jr.  Sean Marks is the one who offered him that big fat contract, the same year he tried getting Allen Crabbe and Tyler Johnson. Marks ended up getting the other Two, even though the teams matched the deal.   If he becomes available, I can see him choosing the nets for that reason. We can also offer 5 mil too."
"Wilt slept with 20,000 women and all he got was Otto Porter Jr.  Michael Jordan, far less promiscuous, got Jimmy Butler.  GOAT."
Trade some of the younger talent (aside from Coby White) and picks to SA for Derozan and to Indiana for Turner.  Let Otto Porter Jr.‘a contract ride out and extend Derozan on a max deal.   Move forward with White/Lavine/Derozan/Young/Turner in a chase to become a playoff team/establish a winning culture around Lavine as he enters his prime.
"Does hoping a player gets bought out count? If so, we can hope George Hill and Otto Porter Jr get bought out and we could sign him. Obviously we might need to trade Hood away to make space."
"Lowry, Hill, Fournier, Tucker     But I would also LOVE to have Ryan Arcidiacano on the 76ers. If counting buyouts - Otto Porter Jr. would be the dream"
KPJ is the best player in the NBA   So prolly Otto Porter Jr
lol Rockets trying to have MPJ and Otto Porter Jr. join to have a bunch of PJ’s on their jerseys although they are trading away thy PJ soon.
"Kevin Porter Jr. and Otto Porter Jr.  Also, Wendell Carter jr, Jaren Jackson jr, and for some reason, Miles Bridges."
"It depends on the head coach.  Sometimes the coach will name a captain or co-captains, sometimes he'll appoint them.  Sometimes he won't do either.   I remember when Michael Jordan and Bill Cartwright were co-captains under Phil Jackson.  Sometimes the captain is the best player on the team, other times it's the veteran who is past his prime but acts like a coach on the floor.  Otto Porter Jr. and Thaddeus Young were co-captains under Boylen but apparently there aren't any designated captains under Donovan."
Otto Porter jr.
"Hes training in miami with drummond actually. Amar'e stoudemire was just down there scouting him on behalf of the nets last week.   If a player like otto porter jr doesn't get bought out, I expect him to be on the nets.  If you follow the gyms ig, hardens addidas rep and durants bro left some sly comments lol."
"Other than Otto Porter Jr., I don’t see another contract worth trading for Drummond."
PG: Russell Westbrook SG: Bradley Beal PF: Nene Hilario SF: Otto Porter Jr. C: Marcin Gortat
"Is he even really that overpaid in a league with Conley, Wall, Walker, Love, and Adams getting paid more than him?  I mean Tobias Harris, McCollum, Russell, Hayward, Otto Porter Jr, Hayward, and Murray are all players in the $27-35 million range that between availability and production are comparable to Wiggins.   Maybe other people see it differently though"
"He definately is, but he is still overpaid.  I don't think this sub fully appreciates that he's the 14th highest paid player in the league. He's the only guy in the top 20 that hasn't made All NBA. Him, Wiggins, Steven Adams, and Otto Porter Jr are the only  ones in the top *40* that have never made an All-Star game.  He's been a very good player this year, and is a very positive asset on the floor for the Sixers and could help them win a chip this year. But he is still grossly overpaid"
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
otto porter jr
The Otto porter Jr conspiracy was good.
Add in Otto porter jr and Marcus Morris sr and you got the suffix squad
Otto Porter Jr crying in the corner rn
"I mean, I guess Otto Porter Jr is alright. Contract is a bit hefty tho."
"Otto also on suicide watch, now the worst Porter Jr. in the league."
"@joshuabrobbins: The Magic will start Cole Anthony, Gary Harris, Dwayne Bacon, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba tonight against the Pelicans in Orlando. Wendell Carter Jr., Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis, Otto Porter Jr. and Terrence Ross will not play."
Otto porter jr
"Laughs in Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, MCW, James Ennis, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, Otto Porter JR (I don’t even remember when he got hurt), and pretty much anyone not named Dwayne freaking Bacon.  Dwayne Bacon can survive a nuclear catastrophe unscathed.  That man will not get hurt or sick,  he’s the true iron man of the NBA."
otto porter jr. he's on the magic atm i think. he was part of the vucevic trade
Otto porter jr was the consensus ceiling iirc
"Is it not because the significant increase in players salary over the years. Rookie deals now are comparable to “max” money from 1998. The Salary cap was $26 Million in 1998. That’s Otto Porter Jr’s average annual salary. Magic Johnson’s 25 year, $25 million dollar contract ($1 Mil/year for 25 years) was the largest contract in SPORTS history when it was signed in 1981. Adjusted for inflation that’s $71 Million in today’s dollars. $71mil/25yrs. To put it into perspective, Tim Hardaway Jr contract was $71 million over like 4 years."
Yea it ended up being huge that they didn’t get any of those guys tho. Imagine if Otto Porter Jr was the reason they hadn’t been able to assemble a super team.
"No give coach bud another year, they are just missing one final good role player like Otto Porter Jr. That’s why Giannis has been off"
"There have been some high risk high reward plays Marks has made that haven’t panned out like giving offer sheets to Tyler Johnson, Allen Crabbe and Otto Porter Jr. he also got criticized for trading the pick that became Sadie Bey for Landry Shamet but I think he’s done a great job filling out this roster. I also think that if he had known what the June roster would look like he would’ve tried to add another big in addition to Lopez and Clax (not gonna mention DeAndre)"
Superstar Otto Porter Jr.
"I know - I believe the rumor was Boston offered two firsts and Detroit shut it down. There's something to be said about retaining loyalty to a guy who willingly chose to sign for your team.  On the flip side, Grant's value probably isn't going to be higher and he just doesn't fit the timeline of what Detroit is going for. If you can get two first rounders and the chance to take a flier on Zac Collins, I think you go for.  I write this though from a biased perspective as a Blazers fan though - there just isn't another big defensive wing available (they swung and missed on Gordon). If it means paying a handsome price for a proper 3, go for it. The other option is overpaying any of the following: Fournier, Oubre, Otto Porter Jr."
Send  Micheal and Otto Porter JR then play them all at the same time.
"No, that would be his son Terry Porter Jr. You wouldn't add the Jr if they had different first names.   Those guys are brothers because their last name is Porter Jr. Otto, Kevin, and Michael."
Otto Porter Jr to the Jazz
"Is every Porter in the league a Porter Jr?   Kevin, Michael, Otto"
"I thought it was the other brother, Otto Porter Jr.  He threw the soup on their cousin, Jontay Porter."
"Kennard, Wall, Love, Horford, Wiggins, Hayward, Green, Gobert, Harris, Hield, Kemba, Otto Porter Jr, Luol Deng, Iguodala. Reddick, Hood, Conley, Baynes. I can keep going..."
&gt;Otto Porter Jr  &gt;&gt;main guy  &gt;&gt;&gt;*swaggy p face*
"TJ, Crabbe, Otto Porter Jr  cant wait for Nets to get Otto"
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
Is he worth the ~the same amount as Otto Porter Jr? Yes.
Only guys (from the 40 highly-paid players this season) that might be in the conversation for that title are Otto Porter Jr and Kevin Love.
"Did you see what Chicago gave up? It was 2 first round picks Wendell Carter Jr and Otto Porter Jr.  Warriors had Wiseman,Oubre (who is on an expiring contract),their own picks and Minnesota's pick,which is more than enough to make an offer that matched Chicago's."
I think he’s a good player but I don’t want him on the Mavs. We have too much money tied to big men.  Our targets should be Lonzo and Otto Porter Jr
I can't connect Wilt Chamberlain to Otto Porter Jr.
Only 3 between Wilt Chamberlain and Otto Porter Jr.
"Otto Porter Jr is probably gone, and most of the random injury fill-ins we signed, so Chasson Randle, Ignas Brazdeikis, Donta Hall, Sindarius Thornwell. Strictly speaking, Mo Wagner is in that category, but I think we'll keep him.   I think we also probably will trade one of Gary Harris or Terrence Ross at some point."
"Otto Porter Jr is the player I'm most interested in. In Chicago, before his injuries, he was looking like an all-star. I'm very interested in how his injuries affect his ability to get another contract...he could be a gold mine if you get him for cheap and he's able to stay on the court."
Otto porter Jr for sure!
"Don't expansion teams automatically get the top pick in the draft? Like Seattle gets #1, Vegas gets #2, then Vegas picks first from the player pool?   If you're Seattle and you go in knowing you have Cade, that changes things dramatically. I also think you focus on free agency (you have crazy money to work with, starting from scratch) and use the expansion draft to round it out.   I'd get Cade, then pursue solid guys in free agency who I know are probably going to go for the bag, or young guys you could overpay and gamble on. Guys like Otto Porter Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Cody Zeller, Doug McDermott, Lauri Markkanen, Malik Monk.   Then in the expansion draft add Winslow, Thompson, Okogie, Okpala, Holiday, Arcidiacono  Cade/Payton/Arcidiacono  Monk/A. Holiday/Okogie  Hardaway/Porter/Winslow  Markkanen/McDermott/Melli  Zeller/Thompson/Okpala  I think this team has a good balance of young guys and vets, it makes up for a lack of star power with depth, it'll be about as competitive as an expansion team can be.  Good spacing, good size, nobody too old."
why is otto porter jr known as the poon slayer  wilt reference?
"We traded up for one of the best bigs in the NBA, and shuffled off the pointlessly expensive Otto Porter Jr. and a slew of underperforming players that were given 1.5 to 3 seasons in a row of chances to improve(though I still see a lot of potential in Gafford.) Theis is a stud, and an underrated stretch big. Troy Brown Jr. is still kinda raw, but his upside is very high. And Moe Wagner and Javonte Green could come in handy when Donovan wants to play big on shorter forwards, or play short &amp; boxy on taller forwards. The last two aren’t total studs, but they’re no slouches either. Losing picks sucks, but the Bulls have 6 guys under the age of 25, and getting younger hasn’t turned into winning for Chicago.  I’m very hopeful for 21-22, but because injuries are random, I’m trying to not set myself up for disappointment. We’ll see how it all plays out!"
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
Oh for fucks’ sake. You want to overpay Lonzo and have him turn out to be the new Gary Harris/Otto Porter Jr. ? Don’t double down on an obviously bad move.
Otto Porter Jr has entered the chat
"A lot of reports that came out after said that the Bulls players took Bobby's side after the altercation and that Niko was kind of metaphorically isolated from the team. Then shortly after we traded Niko away and eventually offered Bobby a contract extension of something like 4 years 40 million dollars. He bet on himself and turned it down so we then traded him to Washington as part of the package to get Otto Porter jr.  Obviously punching a teammate isn't a good look but all the context that we have about the situation points to Bobby not really being in the wrong that much, and actually being a good teammate when he was here."
"Kings fan here and actually thinking about writing a post.   Context  It’s important to remember that the Kings are in the Pacific Division (Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, and Kings) plus also in the Western Conference (TrailBlazers, Jazz, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Thunder, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavericks, Spurs, and Rockets), so they have to be GOOD. Like 4th through 7th seed good in the East (Atlanta, NY, Boston, Miami GOOD).  Plan  Advanced Stats wise Fox is low level all star good, but no Trae Young/Jimmy Butler/Tatum and while his shooting has improved he’s more of a 1 3PT made a game guy than 5. So we HAVE to win with Defense and Playmaking, as long as Fox is our main guy.  Maybe a hot take but I think Halliburton makes an all star team before Fox and usurps him by his 3rd year, but either way the game plan has to be let Halliburton run the offense and use Fox as a Wide Receiver with his speed while they share the court. Delon Wright/Buddy/Justin James/Terrance Davis off the bench for the 3rd guard spot.  Forward-wise older Harrison Barnes, promising Robert Woodard, and our likely SF draft pick (Franz Wagner) give us enough coverage at 3 to not get crushed by better Small Forwards. But we really fall apart at the big man spots (PF/C) with only Marvin Bagley as our only under contract player.  This is where it looks hopeless. Even Bagley believers think that his only value is returning a late 1st and getting his $11M salary off the books. In Monty’s shoes I move him via waive if we can’t get a 2nd rounder and free up his cap space. Once we have that $11M back, we can sign one off Holmes back/Daniel Thesis/Otto Porter Jr. to fill a PF or C spot, bring back Metu/Jones to give back up C minutes, and use our Midlevel to sign Bismack Biyambo or Dwight Howard.  From there it’s all about the entire 9 man rotation committing to running down the opposing teams shot clock every possession and using Fox’s athleticism to get in front of every fast break."
"I like the idea of Theis on the Wolves. There might be some mobility concerns with two bigs, but Theis can help a ton with rim protection and having the best shooting big man in the league would allievate any spacing concerns that were present in Boston.  Also like the idea of taking a (reasonable) flier on Otto Porter Jr.   Finally, I'm interested in what returns that Beasley and Rubio could get. I like the idea of Rubio on teams like Boston and LAC, but he's making a bit too much money to easily salary match IMO. Beasley's also making a lot for a guy that's essentially a superpowered sixth man."
"&gt;Along with Oubre, only Tim Hardaway Jr., Otto Porter Jr., Evan Fournier and Georges Niang check the same boxes          Please continue snoozing on Powell - all tree y'all ♥♥♥"
You watch them play a lot. Is he a quality starting-caliber Wing player?  I feel like he's just salty seeing guys like Otto Porter Jr got huge bags and he's worried he won't get overpaid like a lot of other guys.
"He's talking about what they ""gave up"" as in included in the trade. Not ""gave up"" as in quit.  The Bulls gave up Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr and 2 first-round picks to get Vucevic and Aminu."
Not as much as Otto Porter Jr
"Others also projected Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Ben McLemore at Number 1"
This happens like every off season I'm just getting ready for otto porter jr
Why not just get Otto Porter Jr?
Kawhi - superstar obviously but I feel like he'll just stay home  DeMar - definitely had a career resurgence but I think a huge part of that has been him moving to the 4. If this is a point you'd want to debate though I'd be happy to listen because there definitely is an argument.  Doug McDermott - see above   Otto Porter Jr - high on the guy but extremely injury prone   Norman Powell / Will Barton / Josh Hart - undersized for the 3  Batum - Potentially an option but he's getting up there in years and I think he'll only be motivated on a true contender   Oubre / Fournier - solid players but flawed and really don't get teams like the Blazers over the hump  Iggy / Ariza - Old
I hear you but that repeat tax bill may have Lacobs thinking differently especially when you could be in position to draft a wing with the Wolves pick and I dont think you still want Wiggins contract in Year 1 of Currys Supermax. I think there are cheap veteran wings you can find on the market that can fill the Wiggins role like A Batum or Otto Porter Jr. I wouldn't be suprised if yall moved Wiggins +#14
Hoping we can land Otto Porter/Reggie Bullock/Mo Harkless alongside Nic Batum in free agency. Should be able to land a good wing like Duarte or Boston Jr. with our draft pick.
Otto Porter Jr and a conditional second rounder for Ben Simmons. Who says no?
"Think how many max contract slots there are in the league homie lol. Also he’s paid 39th most in the league this year   Paid less than Kristaps, Dlo, Drummond, and Otto Porter jr. I’ll take Rudy over all those dudes put together lol"
"Otto Porter Jr, Landry Shamet, Royce O’Neal, Cam Payne, Dwight Howard is your best case scenario for a starting lineup"
Mmm false:  https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/otto-porter-jr-20210806  https://www.nba.com/amp/warriors/news/nemanja-bjelica-20210806  https://www.nba.com/news/andre-iguodala-returns-to-warriors-on-1-year-deal?amp=1
"you forgot to mention Otto Porter Jr., who i think was the sleeper signing of the offseason. When healthy, he is one of the best 3 and D players out there."
shouldn’t Curry be working out with Otto porter jr not Michael porter jr?
"&gt;I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is pretentious.  If you are taking that from a pure text comment on the internet, then that says more about you than me.  But, I already said in my first message that I couldn't think of a comparative trade being close to the same value, so if you just put a response about what you think, without backing it up with anything, yeah, you should expect people to call you on it.  &gt;He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then.  His statline this past year was a rounding error off from the previous year, despite COVID and displacement craziness. The only stat that dropped considerably was his three point percentage, but his other shooting stats all improved, most importantly his midrange stats (he was up about 10% from 10-16 and about the same from 16-3p, on increased volume) and his free throw rate (a classic indicator of shooting ability, which jumped above 80% for the first time in his career).  He also improved his playmaking this past year, up a full assist over the previous year, with turnovers going down.  I used the ""has made an All-NBA team"" thing so I didn't have to deal with the ""but he's not an All-NBA player just because he made one"" argument. I'm sure there are plenty of players who made an All-NBA team that you disagree with, but the fact that none of them got traded for a package the size you are talking about is the point.  &gt;Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing  This is probably the closest comp out there for a deal the level you are talking. It was considered a steal of a deal at the time, but Cousins was a notoriously problematic personality (which had been a concern going right back to College, and the reason why he dropped to the Kings in the draft). He was a dominant player, but he was also suspended several times by both the team and league for unprofessional behaviour. He also was traded with a year and a half left on his deal, and Sacramento was going to lose him in free agency if they didn't deal him.  He never actually even led the Kings to the playoffs, either, but he did make All-NBA, so there is some similarity. Still, it does represent the bottom of the market on that type of player (before even considering the context), and I like to think of Masai as being better than Vlade Divac at his job.  &gt;Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  This one isn't comparable, though. Vucevic was 30 at the time of the trade and had never been anything more than a borderline all star player. He has never gotten a single All-NBA vote, let alone made a team. It's a package comparable to the one you are talking about, but for a much lesser and older player, with less team control."
"I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is incredibly pretentious. You request information as if you’re talking to your secretary or you’re a teacher requesting homework from a student. It’s obnoxious and something you should work on.  For the record, Siakam’s value is not “all nba level player”. I personally don’t give a shit that he’s made a single all nba team. He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then. He’s a fringe all star and not a top 15/20 player in the league. He’s closer to top 30-40. Players as good as Siakam get traded every single year. I’ll give you some examples, but I guarantee you that your response is going to either be “this player isn’t as good as Siakam” or “that package is better than the one we’re discussing now”. There is no example that will cause you to actually change your opinion, but I’ll give it a try.  1. Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing   2. Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  Are two trades off the top of my head that roughly fit what you’re asking for"
I thought Otto Porter Jr was a future MVP candidate when he got drafted
I refuse to believe anyone ever saw Otto Porter Jr and thought he really had too 5 player in the league potential
Otto Porter Jr and Lauri Markannan
"I mean, I think you have to incorporate the alternatives. Oladipo’s had a few good seasons, but it’s not like Cody Zeller or Otto Porter Jr. have been blowing the league out of the water. The next three selections after Darko are all automatic HOFers."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

They’re adding Klay and Iggy. Otto Porter jr. can be as good as Barnes.   They could be a 60-something win team
"I agree. But not many centers will be good shooters. Ben ain’t gonna be much worse than Wiseman or Looney, for example.   The question, then, is whether Ben and Otto Porter Jr (or one of the rookies) as starters is better than Wiggins and Wiseman."
"well, they signed 3 other forwards on mins (otto porter jr, nemanja bjelica, andre iguodala) and are already out of roster spots...."
Mr. 27 million Otto Porter Jr.
They also signed Otto Porter Jr. who not too long ago was starting on a very good Wizards team shooting well over 40% from 3.
"&gt;  and looking at our 2015/16 squads, we had Barbosa/Livingston/Iguodala/Speights/Ezeli coming off the bench with some David Lee, Ian Clark etc.  &gt; The only player who could be on that level next year is Poole, if he keeps developing. JTA is a good piece but he's more of a Draymond and needs people to work with. We also don't have a big as talented or important as Bogut  Poole? Are you fucking serious? You also have Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr., Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga, Bjelica, and Looney. That’s very comparable to what you had then."
Just another KP in the mix I mean. Maybe Otto Porter Jr.? Kevin Huerter? None of them are actually that close but between all the overlapping acronyms and suffixes imagine trying to call a game with that team.
"I though Austin Daye was going to be so good, Anthony Randolph too. I'm obviously shit at evaluating NBA talent lol got entirely too hyped when Glenn Rice Jr won MVP with Otto ""Poonslayer"" Porter Jr runner-up. Wizards fans rarely have reasons to celebrate good things, it's always good-bad things like Ernie Grunfeld getting fired, or Randy Wittman getting fired, or Scott Brooks getting fired. It's usually just us celebrating firing someone who should never have been hired in the first place. Hopefully it's Drew Gooden and Justin Kutcher next, if God's real- it will be them 🤞🙏"
So are the faces of Otto Porter Jr and Otto Porter Sr.
Otto Porter Jr
We will give you one Otto Porter Jr
I just want to say I really love the Otto Porter Jr. pickup by the Warriors. Might we see a new Steph-Klay-Wiggins-Iguodala-Porter Death Lineup?
I ain’t gone lie you got me with saying just “Porter Jr” like 5 dudes popped in my head and I was confused as to when GS either signed or traded for them…. Then I remembered it was Otto 🤦🏾‍♂️
Otto Porter Jr. vibes going here lol
I’ve been here trying to figure out when they got Kevin or Michael Porter Jr and completely forgot about Otto
"Klay Thompson injures opposing teams confidence in practice by scoring 69 points in 1 quarter. He shot 21/21 from 3 on 8 dribbles.   He had a noticeable limp that we asked him about after the game. He said: “slipped on my boat the other day, it’s the only thing I know that’s wetter than me… then again I did meet your mother the other day.”  In other, supposedly unrelated news, Otto porter Jr has retired from basketball. He shot 0/7 during practice and tore his acl guarding klay during his tsunami of 3s."
"Regardless of the team he chooses I don't think he is going to contribute a lot and is not going to have a lot of minutes. Not a good shooter and he is old, the only way he can help is on defense and thinking about the teams he can sign with: - Warriors should focus on getting offense players for their bench and they already have Otto Porter Jr. Who is a 3 and D wing ( Iggy would technically be the same position). - Nets could definitely use a defensive wing coming of the bench. Right now they have Carter and Brown who are good defenders but are guards. They also have James Johnson and Blake who should get PF minutes or small Ball 5 minutes. - Lakers biggest problem is their defense, got a lot of shooters and scorers but lost their best defenders, Kent Bazemore and Ariza might be their best options coming of the bench and still are not as good as KCP and Caruso were. So maybe he could help with that 🤷."
Otto Porter JR is actually Wilt Chamberlain Jr
don't forget otto porter Jr. Dude went from max to min real quick.
Otto Porter Jr. is Wilt's son
"Wiggins homecoming? Raptors get Wiggs and Paschall. Warriors get Dragic, Baynes and second round pick(s)  Warriors depth chart:  |[](/GSW)|Starters|Reserves|3rd string| |:-:|:-|:-|:-| |**C**|James Wiseman|Kevon Looney|Aron Baynes |**F**|Draymond Green|Nemanja Bjelica| |**F**|Otto Porter Jr.|Jonathan Kuminga|Juan Toscano-Anderson| |**G**|Klay Thompson|Modey Moosy|Jordan Poole| |**G**|Stephen Curry|Goran Dragic|  edit: Raptors just waived Baynes. Nevermind"
"No I shouldn’t have said he did nothing, that was a major exaggeration on my part. I just don’t think he moves the needle at all. All the moves they are making now reminds me of the moves to get guys like Otto Porter Jr or Pau Gasol or the other “big names” that amounted to nothing for a rebuilding Chicago team. Like, they aren’t appreciably better with their homegrown core so why are they going in on those players? It just reeks too much of “we are smarter than everyone else, so we will grab all those undervalued assets and make a playoff team out of this” and I am just not seeing a whole lot of cohesion in those moves. But if they excite the fanbase then hey, I will pipe down."
Otto Porter Jr could be the steal of the off-season if he’s healthy and returns to form.
"I mean a starting lineup of Curry - Klay - Wiggins - Draymond - Looney will work very well together. And I think Jordan Poole has shown enough to be considered a good bench player. I also believe that Wiseman coming off the bench as an energy big could be promising for them next year. Kuminga is the biggest wildcard, but I think Moody will be a great role player from day 1. He’s the best 3 and D in the draft and imo will force his way into the starting lineup. Now with Bjelica as a floor spacing big I think they have a promising 10 man rotation with high upside.   Edit: I almost forgot Otto Porter Jr who is a fringe starter and an amazing bench piece to have. The Warriors will be a great team next year."

Otto Porter Jr was a good signing too
Otto Porter Jr notwithstanding
You could say the same for Rudy Gay who went to the Jazz  or Otto Porter Jr who went to the Warriors.  This is like the first signing Nets have done all offseason. They lost Jeff Green to the Nuggets  I haven’t seen any moves this offseason where you can say there’s a market advantage (outside of maybe Tucker)  Lowry is close to Butler  Ariza/Dwight are both laker guys  NY only got Fournier. They struck out on all the star.  Let’s calm down
"Dude, we just signed Otto Porter Jr. We’re as unbeatable as it gets."
"I don't think he means literally robbed, I don't think there was a gun involved. He means that Otto Porter Jr. didn't perform close to the level they expected out of him for the contract they offered."
"Great pick-up for them. Warriors FO seems to finally realize they desperately need some shooters around Steph, and Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr. fit that very nicely.    If they can get Mills as a backup PG this will have been their best off-season since adding KD, probably"
Warriors signed Otto Porter Jr for a Minimum
"Bazemore left so we'd have room to sign Otto Porter Jr, what a selfless man"
They haven’t done anything except sign Otto Porter Jr to a minimum.
"I would have given you my free Hugz award, but I used it on the Otto Porter Jr. post on r/warriors that said he used a Vet Min slot instead of the MLE."
Many are mentioning picking up someone with a MLE (name that keeps coming up is Otto Porter Jr) and leveraging that into a 3-way trade where we give up CJ and land Pascal Siakam. I don't know the specifics lol so hopefully someone can elaborate more. But hopefully we figure out a way to make it work in a way where no team gets screwed.
Otto Porter JR is a solid wing when healthy. Watch some of his highlights from a couple years back and you’ll see why.  Dude is injury prone like a mf though
Otto Porter Jr to the Warriors on a vet min deal
I wonder if any of these players feel like they didn't deserve the money they've made in their career. Otto Porter Jr. signed a 4/110 contract then immediately began to suck ass.  Maybe he feels like he's made enough and now is just going where he wants to play.
Otto Porter Jr. can ring chase after the Wizards max. He's set for life

"They weren't going to stick LBJ w/ a ballhandler of Wright's stature. Westbrook is far from ideal, but he definitely takes a ton of pressure off Lebron, which at his age, he needs. Lakers are in salary hell anyways, if they somehow pull off some combination of Patty Mills, Otto Porter Jr, rudy gay Malik Monk, etc, this could work well, but right now I would bet this is going to be a mess. Lakers shouldve trusted what they had was enough w/ minor tweaks, injuries contributed more to their downfall than anything (w/ shooting probably 2nd &amp; they sure haven't addressed that yet)."
Price tag among other things. It's like people don't remember Gary Harris. Or Andrew Wiggins. Or Otto Porter Jr.
It's like some people don't remember Gary Harris. Or Andrew Wiggins. Or Otto Porter Jr. An overpaid Lonzo just hamstrings us.
"Otto Porter Jr was last good on both offense and defense 3 years ago in his last healthy season. He's had 3 seasons where he's been constantly injured and played poorly when on the court (probably correlated with injuries and injury recovery), so really he's a big question mark right now.   Where did you get that 97th percentile stat from?"
"&gt;they had depth and team chemistry   You clearly didn’t watch the lakers. Depth was the one thing they lacked in 2020, in particular wing depth and point guard depth, one of the biggest talking point of the season was the lakers don’t really have the depth to win it all. It’s why everyone trashed the 2020 lakers off season.   Also Westbrook is one of the best chemistry players in the league. Every single team sings his praises and loves what he brings to the locker room. Chemistry will not be an issue this year.    &gt;rondo came off the bench so the lakers could have spacing   The lakers were also starting javale. Not exactly an elite floor spacer huh?   Also rondo couldn’t score, rebound, or run in transition as well as Westbrook. Westrbook has flaws but he is far superior than 2020 rondo and capable of scoring 20+ a game. Something the lakers desperately need.    &gt;how the hell do the lakers find spacing and defense   Patty mills. Rudy gay. Otto porter jr. melo. Dwight. All dudes at the top of my head reportedly looking to take a vet min or the mle to join the lakers. Finding shooters who can hit open corner threes is not that hard. Getting the third star made the lakers a far more appealing free agent destination by all reports. There are tons of shooters on the market and the lakers can still sign and trade schoder for someone. Why write off the team before it even built?   Spacing is just the new casual buzz word. The 2020 lakers and 2021 bucks were hardly spacing juggernauts. It turns out there’s more ways to score than just chucking up three pointers and praying you hit enough by law of averages."
Any chance you're thinking of Michael Porter Jr.? Or is Otto Porter Jr. anti-vax too?
"1. It hasn’t died completely yet. I admit it’s not probable but still definitely possible. Tomorrow when free agency opens, they are legally allowed to add Schroder to the deal, he signs and trades to Washington where they keep KCP and the pick, Kuzma and Harrell go along with the two second round picks from Washington to Sacramento, Lakers get Westbrook and Buddy. Kuzma and Harrell were already linked to Buddy, they get 2 second rounders in addition so it’s something they would want. Wizards have already admitted they are shopping those two and they want to keep KCP. They need a point guard as well after losing Westbrook. Everything actually does make sense, and there’s a lot of talk around the league about they’re already being a deal in place before the Westbrook trade was announced, but they need to make it look like there wasn’t, so what happened to the Bucks last year doesn’t happen to them. Definitely a conspiracy but it makes sense so once tomorrow passes we shall see, but like I said unlikely, but not dead like you said.  2. I doubt Batum stays, I’m honestly expecting him to go to the Warriors and not the Lakers but it’s still a possibility. But if he doesn’t come, maybe someone like Otto Porter Jr., Rudy Gay, Danny Green, someone like that would replace him at the 3&amp;D spot for the MMLE.  3. I can’t agree about Bradley, still think he is a great defender and can hit a shot, but if not him, maybe replace them with another three point shooter like Matthews.   So Westbrook | Matthews | Gay | LeBron | AD"
Otto Porter JR
"It depends on how much the offer is. That's the problem. Hell, I'm willing to go 4/80. But I'd rather give up Lonzo than make him the new Gary Harris or Otto Porter Jr. or Andrew Wiggins."
"This guy boutta be the next Otto Porter Jr, ridiculously overpaid wing."
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanović - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
Aminu was sent in as salary filler since Vucevic's salary was lower than Otto Porter Jr + Wendel Carter JR salaries.Ofc the picks were there I was mostly talking about making it so the salary fits
Oubre was an expiring contract which is valuable to a rebuilding team like Magic.He is better than Otto Porter JR who was the salary filler Chicago sent to Orlando
He can’t even stay healthy. They are gonna get Otto porter jr tho
"Of course they are not getting \*all\* those players. The hope is that they could get 1-2 of them. Or other shooters available, like Otto Porter Jr.   Let's put it this way. I'm confident that Pelinka is going to try to fill out the roster with 2-3 guys who are good 3-point shooters, and that they will find some."
"Honestly if they can sign someone like Danny Green, Otto Porter Jr to start, and then sign guys like Wayne Ellington, Batum, Mathews, along with THT and Caruso.  Maybe try to entice Dwight to come back or even possibly Noel."
"There's no way the Lakers spend their mini MLE on Drummond.  If reports are correct, AD will be moving to the 5 and Lebron to the 4.  They probably go after Batum or Otto Porter Jr for the taxpayer MLE.  The Kings have no interest in THT honestly, we have too many guards as is."
"Wiggins because he didn't care early on (though I feel his handle was something most people overlook as his weakness and is actually a big reason why he is not aggressive).   Jaylen Brown actually overachieved  Otto Porter Jr was good enough for a massive overpay but not really good at all    Oladipo maybe? Took a while to develop (but more of a PG/SG)   Barnes could shoot better but general archetype is the same. He has had a good career despite 2016 finals.   PG was ok but a much better free throw shooter (even from the field too and he wasn't that great)    Hayward in college was much more athletic and his long range shooting was quite bad but he developed in that front.   Evan Turner looked quite good in college (more so than Kuminga now) but his skills didn't translate    I would wager in the top 10 as a whole, most wings develop pretty good success, even when raw, but there are a decent few that are at best role players. Much harder for a wing to bust completely though given their defensive advantages"
"They really need Otto Porter Jr. That shooting is a nightmare, especially if AD still insists on playing PF and they start a center who can’t shoot at all lol"
Hield makes Westbrook a lot more playable. You also need to put AD at center and sign someone like Otto Porter Jr. with the non-taxpayer MLE.  That lineup would actually have good spacing.
It’s not the matter of keeping Lonzo. It’s the potential price tag (and maybe Rich Paul). Andrew Wiggins. Otto Porter Jr. Gary Harris. Sound familiar?
"So sad we got rid of him. Traded him for Otto Porter Jr., the most GarPax move of all time  And I mean don't get me wrong there was a chance that trade could've worked out well in our favor if Otto could stay healthy and also wasn't a huge fucking idiot. I was a fan of the move at the time, and it got Jabari Parker off our books, but still, I miss Bobby"
"I lowkey disagree it was ok, Rudy Gobert, McCollum, Olidipo when he was healthy, Otto Porter had his moments then fell off, Tim Hardaway Jr, Adams, now it's definitely one of the worst drafts in 2010s but I wouldn't say it's horrible. But the top 10 was atrocious   P.S. in 3+ years we all will be calling 2018 draft top 5 all time"
"Anthony Bennet, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlins Noel, Ben McLemore for Luka. You still game? You would need the top 27 picks of the 13 draft to have a playoff team."
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
"How about the Porter Jr brothers? Otto, Kevin, and Michael"
"Okay, so who do you buy low on?   DeMar DeRozan? - Alright that's something I guess  I don't really see Oubre or Fournier moving the needle for either of those guys - not a lot of defense going around there.  Reggie Bullock? Honestly I might like him more than the former two but not a needle mover.  A welcome-home show for Nic Batum or Will Barton? Both decent players but may end up commanding a bag bigger than Portland could offer. Also have a hunch Batum wants to end up on a stronger contender.  I like the upside of Otto Porter Jr a lot and that's why I'd ""buy low"" on him. The other guys sans DeRozan don't have a huge ceiling in my opinion or may just not be available for Portland.  I'm also a huge stan of Harrison Barnes to Portland if they can pull off a CJ trade - not a star obviously but makes for a cohesive lineup."
If that's the case - they should just outright sign Otto Porter Jr
nah they can still sign like otto porter jr os something with the mle and then keep kcp and bring back drummond with bird rights sign like 2 ring chasers resign caruso thats like a 9 man rotation with gasol
Michael Porter Jr  Kevin Porter Jr  Otto Porter Jr
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
"&gt;bulls couldn't keep him when he did that to nikola mirotic.  This is a false narrative. Our org held Niko just as responsible for that fight as Bobby, and all the players at the time pretty heavily took Bobby's side. We even ended up trading Niko that year and offered Bobby an extension. We offered him 4 years 40 million even though we had just drafted Lauri Markkanen, but he turned it down so we traded him as part of the package for Otto Porter Jr because we were going to lose him for nothing to free agency."
"Giannis went 15th and Gobert 27th in 2013. The top 5 picks that year were Anthony Bennet, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller and Alex Len. The FO is doing proper due diligence."
"His value won’t change as long as he doesn’t play, but GM’s have different opinions on him. I’m sure some small market teams see superstar potential in him but they don’t want to pay over his current value. It’s more so teams going into tank mode that want to give away their stars. Vucevic got traded for two picks, Wendell Carter Jr and Otto Porter Jr. Aaron Gordon got traded for Gary Harris and RJ Hampton. Other players will lose value and deals will become available."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwfh_6TG0A  Otto Porter Jr. would get one here.
"Monte Morris, Josh Hart, Otto Porter Jr, Larry Nance, Robin Lopez"
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
"I still agreed it was a bad pick and even I at the time scoffed at it but tbf I was keen on Otto Porter Jr and he didn’t really pan out either, my point is it was a bad pick but its a bit overblown due to him being 1st overall, he was still projected 5-8 iirc so wasn’t completely left field. Only Oladipo made it to allstar from the lottery"
"It was a horrible draft pick obviously but that draft was notoriously bad. There was no clear number 1, if I recall before the draft most had Nerlens Noel going 1st but he tore his acl so his stock dropped. People like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Cody Zeller were in the top 5.   To me, what’s worse is when you have a strong draft and you passed on an obvious option to take a guy you thought had more potential, like Bagley or Flynn"
"I don't.  I think this will have been the best MPJ we'll see.   His percentage was a fluke and in two years, everyone will wonder how he got a max and it will be regarded the worst since Otto Porter Jr.  Curious who will get clowned out of us."
"My favorite ""we have to pay him"" guys, who demonstrate with one exception that no, you don't have to pay them:  * Andris Biedrins, GSW, 2008 * Gordon Hayward, UTA, 2014 (Was a terrible contract at the time. Look at the footage and it confirms the numbers. Don't let Utahns gaslight you because he suddenly learned how to dribble and pull up a year and a half later. Also, Derrick Favors that same offseason.) * Allen Crabbe, POR, 2016, Cap explosion GOAT * Otto Porter, Jr., WAS, 2017, Cap explosion active GOAT, he's making $30+M, get that bag, ToPo * Derrick Coleman, PHI, 1996 * Paul George after this contract is up * Special mention: Evan Turner managed to get paid twice"
"Why stop there, send Eric Gordon to GSW for Otto Porter JR. I want all 3 Porter Jrs"
Feels like Otto Porter Jr. hit corner 3s for a few weeks and then got a 100 million dollar contract.
"John Wall when healthy was a top 3 PG  Fans and sometimes teams overrate the hell out of assets.   Example if you’re a middling or average team that can trade for an allstar or allstar level player that will more than likely make you way better you should do it. That random 1st round pick you’re holding so dearly onto will likely never be as good as the player you’re trading for, and if you’re trading for a GOOD player you shouldn’t have to worry about the pick being incredibly high. For example the bulls basically trade Wendell Carter, Otto Porter Jr, a first round pick that will likely never be an allstar,  and Franz Wagner who will likely never be an allstar for Vucevic and they should and would do it again.   Another example could be that Heat pick from a few years ago. Teams thought they hit a gold mine with that one Heat pick and what did that turn into? 18th pick Tre Mann right?"
"One angle i've seen is that if Kerr is going to have Draymond + Looney start anyway, then why not get a massive upgrade over Looney and then just use your other wing options (Otto Porter Jr, Damion Lee) in Wiggins' place. But it sort of ignores the Draymond + Simmons side of things by looking at Simmons vs Wiggins and Simmons vs Looney in a vacuum. (Simmons is definitely better than both in general, but not necessarily for the Warriors current roster situation)  Could argue it's a defensive upgrade since Draymond/Simmons would be a very elite 4/5 defensive combo, but Wiggins also did a nice job guarding the other teams' best players last year in some games. With Klay out for at least 2 months it's a really tough call to take the better overall player for a questionable fit while losing your 2nd scoring option."
And we all know how maxing Otto Porter Jr went for the Wizards.
I think he was always getting injured once the playoffs came around. Derozan shitting the bed in the playoffs also made things worse for Lowry. Raptors were failing year after year in the playoffs because demar was getting locked down by guys like Otto porter and Jr smith lol. Also Lebronto.
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
"Absolutely they are. Granted a lot depends on what Klay looks like when he comes back and if Otto Porter jr can stay healthy, but the combination of shooting and defense they now have is super enticing when coupled with young athletic guys like Wiseman Kuminga and Moody. We saw last season that health can’t be assumed, especially with guys like Anthony Davis, Harden, Kyrie, and an aging Lebron being the focal points of the league’s two front runners. The NBA playoffs have always been a war of attrition and the Dubs are rested and reliant on health like the rest of the league. Favorites-Not at all. Contenders-Yes."
"&gt; With iguodala back for more vets prescence, and 2 40% deep shooters signing in Bjelica and otto porter jr.   Iggy is beyond washed and only there for a retirement tour. Bjelica and Porter are decent when healthy, but don't count on that happening lol.  &gt; great role players/stars developing in JTA and poole.  Poole is great and will probably contend for 6moty, but JTA is 28, he's not gonna get a whole lot better.  &gt; let's not forget the 2 steals of the draft-kuminga and moses moody  I like these guys as prospects, but they're just rookies. And Kuminga will likely see time in the G-League and not be an immediate contributor."
"It's not just klay. I think warriors will be dangerous with or without klay next year. With iguodala back for more vets prescence, and 2 40% deep shooters signing in Bjelica and otto porter jr. that steph desperately needed for the floor spacing, great role players/stars developing in JTA and poole. This team will surprise people for sure imo  let's not forget the 2 steals of the draft-kuminga and moses moody, which warriors just so happens to pick up both."
"I’m not sure I agree with the first claim. How is Dray and Simmons that much worse for spacing than Dray and Looney? Especially if Simmons can get back to scoring inside with some regularity.   The problem, of course, is that this leaves them a bit small and struggling with teams with legit banging bigs. But it isn’t about spacing. Steph, Klay, Porter Jr, Simmons, and Dray is just fine offensively.  The lineup shift is Wiggins and Looney for Simmons and Otto. And the latter is at least as good spacing wise with better ball movement"
Klay and Otto Porter jr
Porter  PG: Terry Porter  SG: Kevin Porter Jr  SF: Michael Porter Jr  PF: Otto Porter Jr  C: Jontay Porter
Wtf. Did you watch Warrior games last season? Otto porter jr and bjelcia weren’t even on the team last season. Poole spent a decent amount of time in the g league before being added to the rotation near the end of the season
Otto Porter Jr and Lionel Ritchie
Otto Porter Jr kinda looks like Wilt. That's the rumor.
Wilt Chamberlain and Otto Porter Jr
"Otto Porter Jr. is rejuvenated as much as Batum was for the Clippers, enough to be a member of a bargain bin Death Lineup.   John Wall will be an incredible tank commander and greatly benefit the development of the Rockets young guys. His inevitable injury will let the front office let out a sigh of relief as they were winning just a couple more games than they really were comfortable with."
Giannis is the closest that we’ve seen a player come to the size and athleticism of Wilt since maybe Kareem (excluding Otto Porter Jr.)
I’m pretty sure Otto Porter Jr got a max contract right before Wiggins so I think he would have.
"&gt; bench = supporting cast  No, bench specifically refers to…the bench.   &gt; And what exactly did the Warriors do this offseason? Get back 38yo Iggy? Sign Otto Porter while losing Oubre?  Drafted Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody. Signed Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and Andre Iguodala.   &gt;  No one seriously thinks Warriors got better if we don't factor in Klay yet.  They improved significantly. You can’t seriously think Oubre, Bazemore, Paschall, and Wanamaker contribute more to winning than OPJ, Moody, Kuminga, Bjelica, and Iguodala…"
I think you meant star free agent acquisition Otto Porter Jr actually
[Grand Theft Otto Porter Jr](https://i.imgur.com/KgToZyH.png)
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
"Everytime I see Otto Porter Jr, all I see is Wilt"
"I wouldn't have it any other way. Defenses still load up on him, but this season he's got guys who can punish them for it.  OKC did a great job putting a physical defender on Steph at the point of attack and showing him lots of bodies off his screens. He swung the ball around and guys like Damion Lee and Otto Porter Jr made them pay. Wiggins threw in a few isolation baskets as well.   I really enjoyed the game despite the poor shooting by the Warriors early in the game."
"Exactly. At one point Otto Porter Jr (got a max RFA offer sheet) was being paid a higher salary than John Wall and Bradley Beal while on the same team. But somehow the ""others"" are being screwed over in this system... lol  Giannis is only making about $5-10mil more per year than Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. He is drastically underpaid bc his salary is capped by the CBA"

How about Otto Porter Jr (3-0) and all other secret Wilt's sons?
All thanks to the powers of Wil- I mean Otto Porter Jr playing on the bench
"&gt; Especially since he didn’t crack the rotation much last year  And last year's roster was super top heavy. After Curry/Dray/Wiggins, the roster was Looney/Wiseman, Oubre, Bazemore, Damion Lee, Poole, and JTA. If Paschall couldn't consistently crack that 10 man rotation in spite of all the injuries, there was no way he would crack this year's rotation, especially seeing as he'd end up behind Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr. and probably also behind Moody and Kuminga."
Otto is the real Porter Jr. All these other Porter Jrs are just imitating
"Well Otto Porter Jr had +13, and Kennard with a +19, so clearly the most valuable players today.    21 turnovers though.  Looking at the stats, Warriors should have won by more if they could hold the ball better."
"I always thought KD shoulda signed there in 2016.  Hometown team where he gets all the credit and they already had Wall, Beal, Otto Porter Jr, markieff Morris, gortat, bogdanovic, oubre, mahinmi, and the iron balls of Brandon Jennings &amp; Marcus thornton"
"I mean it is a pretty clear explanation for the contracts of players like Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter Jr, etc. Even guys like Murray who look worth it now, it was not nearly seen so at the time of his deal.  But the mentality is that if a player on a rookie deal is even/only close to a star, everyone expects them to want a max deal."
"Otto Porter Jr, if he stays healthy, will definitely play a big bench role for the Warriors this season."
"I did not know who the guy was before this game and pre-season, I think the warriors sub was a little skeptical because Otto Porter Jr is usually injured and this guy is a relative unknown if you weren't watching Kings games so while not having Oubre, Wanamaker, and Bazemore can feel like addition by subtraction, I don't think anyone expected them to pick up the warriors system so quickly."
Here's hoping Otto Porter Jr will be the 2nd
"&gt; Why wouldn’t they if they have the space. You’re probably not getting a big name anyway so you might as well shoot your shot.  I don't know the answer to this question, but when was the last time a team signed another team's RFA to a max contract?  There's been a few non-maxes (Allen Crabbe comes to mind), and some instances where the original team matched (Otto Porter Jr., lol) but I don't think it's happened in the last five years at least.  If it's indeed never happened, I don't think anyone's gonna take that kind of bet and risk coming up empty.  Even the small market teams end up with free agents that they love and overpay for (Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward).  You can't do that if you're locked up for days 1 and 2 of FA."
You should be more worried about your own team:  * Steph Curry has missed 115 games in the last five years due to various injuries  * Klay Thompson has missed each of the last two years and won't be back until December or January  * Wiseman missed half of last season and is at least going to miss the first couple months of this season with an injury  * Otto Porter Jr. has missed 120 games over the last three seasons with injuries  * Kevon Looney has missed 56 games in the last two years with injuries  * Andre Iguodala is older than anyone on the Lakers (which is saying something)  * Draymond Green has missed 47 games over the last 3 years with injuries
"Otto Porter Jr., Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr., Kris Dunn. You see a pattern there?"
Otto Porter Jr.  +16000 6 Man of the year looks tasty  throw 50 at that and you could win 8 grand lol
"As a bulls fan who's seen enough  Rose, Markkanen, WCJ and Otto porter jr are High injury prone"
"Definitely could win a championship, although beating Milwaukee or Brooklyn in the finals will be a tall task. Even Miami is a bitch to beat. I'm much bullish on them getting out of a weaker Western Conference to make the finals than winning the whole thing.  There is reason for optimism though. They have a top defense, and Steve Kerr has them all pulling in the same direction on offense. They really figured out how to optimally run their offense at the end of last season, and with an improved Poole, getting Klay back, and getting Otto Porter Jr., their offense should have much more kick to it than it did at the end of last season.  With Westbrick in LA to sabotage the Lakers, I think the Warriors have to be seen as a real threat to come out of the West, and then once you're in the finals, anything is possible."
pretty hilarious that the Bulls then traded him for Otto Porter Jr. who got a much bigger contract than Parker because of being elite on D
Warriors probably don’t give a fuck about Wiggins tbh. They’re probably planning on packaging Wiggins with Kuminga and Moody sometime during the season for a star.   With Poole and Otto Porter Jr. They have pretty good depth in the backcourt / wings once Klay comes back (and even without him) and can really afford to be aggressive in the trade market for a star.
Otto Porter Jr staying healthy would be huge for the Warriors.  He's a lethal shooter and a big body the Warriors desperately need.
I’m telling you everyone is sleeping on how important that Otto Porter Jr. pick-up is.
If Otto Porter Jr is Wilt’s long lost son then OG must be Tim Duncan’s clone
Jordan Poole Andrew Wiggins Otto Porter Jr Nemanja Bjelica Kevon Looney
"Maybe. It's all about how everything turns out. Does Otto Porter Jr stay healthy all season? Does Klay look like Klay by the end of the regular season? Is Belli's defense going to be good enough to justify his offense. Is Poole's improved play for real? Will Wiseman take a second year leap?  Those questions and more can break in many different ways, those ways will determine how far they go."
"Otto Porter Jr is Wilt’s grandson, their resemblance is too close for it to not be true"
Otto Porter Jr is wilt Chamberlain's grandson. Incredible how similar they look
Otto porter jr is deifnetly related to wilt chamberlain
We did not trade decent players. WCJ and Otto Porter Jr are both meh players with injury issues.

"I love your content and agree! I’ve long tinkered with the idea that the real value of All-Star Players is how many unconventional (tweener, strech bigs, etc.) they allow you to play in the lineup. Lebron is famous for taking one dimensional players and allowing them to play at a starter level (Mario Chalmers, JR Smith, etc.).   I thought this was most evident when John Wall - Otto Porter Jr. played together, since it was clear that John’s creation was single-handily creating the opportunity for OPJ when Beal was hurt and OPJ’s shooting converted those opportunities. On top of that, Wall and OPJ’s top tier defense allowed the Wizards to play lesser defenders at other spots that traditionally anchor the defense (PF &amp; C)."

that article about otto porter jr giving the warriors their best shooting trio was indeed correct
Otto Porter Jr shaking his head
If Otto Porter Jr can stay healthy I'm going to cry tears of joy man. Still crazy he's on this team since I've put him on the Warriors in 2K every single year. Crazy.
"Remember all those posts about how historically awful his shooting was his rookie year? The Warriors had a billion injuries that year, that was when Curry went down in like game 4 of the season, the Warriors literally were without half their roster for a good stretch to start the year. So Poole was forced into playing way more minutes than he was ready for but he did his best. But you could tell he wasn't having fun out there and it was tough for him.   But he's put in work and gotten so much better and you can literally see the confidence he plays with now. He knows his moves and counters, he knows the reads to make, he feels like whatever way you defend him he's going to make the right response and convert the play.   It's just preseason and I always remind people not to take anything from preseason too seriously one way or the other, but I think Poole and Otto Porter Jr looked like they could have big positive impacts on the Warriors this year."
"otto porter jr, bjelica are the notable spacers"
"Otto Porter Jr, Nemanja Bjelica, and (Return of) Andre Igoudala. Also the massive leap of growth by Jordan Poole"
"That's all true. On the other hand, Wiggins had basically never played with Curry and now has the benefit of a year's experience plus training camp, and they've exchanged Kelly Oubre for Otto Porter Jr. who, if at all healthy, will at least be a much better fit; Eric Paschall for Bjelica, who likewise; and 2020 Jordan Poole for 2021 Jordan Poole, a significant upgrade. We'll see, but Curry's supporting cast is much improved."
"Yours, I think 2 is the lie to you. DM me if I'm right.  My turn:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Harden is just as important to the Nets as KD was, it's just injuries ruined that so public perception shifted. 2. Otto Porter Jr will be the Reggie Jackson ""Playoff Shocker"" of these playoffs. 3. Giannis slightly edges KG all time for PFs and is now a top 2 PF of all time with his FMVP and historic finals, plus extra MVP."

"I’m like Kevin Porter Jr?  Michael Porter Jr. oh no, Otto Porter Jr"
"If you have a 3 point shot, would you rather have KD shoot it or Otto Porter Jr. shoot it.   I do not give AF about numbers. Do the stats account the other team game planning to stop KD? How about the quality of the shot? Do you think KD would be as equally wide open as OPJ?"
Otto porter jr better shooter than kd 😂
&gt; Probably was Otto Porter Jr  lol no Otto is so not that guy either
Lmao Steph seems like the kinda dude to soft punch and shimmy away.   Probably was Otto Porter Jr
Otto porter jr. and Wilt
"I don’t understand why Harris was considered a franchise cornerstone. If you are going to use him, literally Otto Porter Jr. has had the same thing happen to him recently. Went from a max deal to now a vet min. I don’t really see a difference between Porter and Harris in the context of your question."
Jordan Poole and Otto Porter Jr were unconscious in that 1st half
"Guys like Wiggins, Otto porter jr, Poole all prove that Klay is a glorified role player   Probably the greatest role player of all time tho"
Hold up....Bulls legend Otto Porter Jr.?!
"Is Otto Porter, Jr. the 6th Man of the Year?"
"They are sacrificing depth but with Wiseman and Klay coming back their 8-9 man playoff rotation would be:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Wood, Jordan Poole, Iguodala, Wiseman, Gary Payton Jr, Otto Porter Jr., Moody(?)  I just listed 11 guys, which seems like more than enough"
"Couldn't tell you from past players, but look at Dennis Schroeder and Otto Porter Jr who are both trying to do this right now."
"Just like how Otto Porter jr and Nemanja Bjelica help the Warriors Nunn and Ariza can help the Lakers, and if anything I’m underselling the impact that those 2 would have on the team. They are both guys who will command 18+ minutes a game and furthermore it will push guys who aren’t rotation level out of the lineup."
"Otto Porter Jr has quietly been a stellar presence on this team. Consistently good/great defense, all hustle, great shooting with a terrific shooting stroke. 18 points &amp; 10 rebounds last night as well. If we can keep him healthy until the playoffs arrive, he’s gonna be a serious contributor."

Just wait till he meets Otto Porter Jr
"&gt;Andrew Wiggins on Otto Porter Jr: ""I call him Lionel Richie sometimes. He just be looking like him for no reason"""
"Andrew Wiggins on Otto Porter Jr: ""I call him Wilt Chamberlain sometimes. He just be looking like him for no reason"""
I got downvote to oblivion by Denver fans for saying it's the worst max since Otto Porter Jr and I stand by that.
"The Warriors like to collect former MVPs:  * Kevin Durant, 2014 NBA MVP * JaVale McGee, 2012 &amp; 2013 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Juan Toscano-Anderson, 2018 LNBP MVP * Otto Porter Jr., 2015 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Nemanja Bjelica, 2015 EuroLeague MVP"
Imagine a wilt chamberlain with a 3 pointer. That's Otto Porter Jr.
Otto Porter Jr the 'Splash Uncle'
"NBA rigged the 1985 draft lottery to get Ewing to the Knicks, also Otto Porter Jr is related to Wilt Chamberlain."
"More continuity with between key players. New role players that are better fitting for the offense (Otto Porter JR, Bjelica, GP2). Jordan Poole elevating another step above. And the whole team is bought in on defense and plays aggressively on defense. The new rule change has benefitted them on defense as well."
I was cracking up when the warriors announcer was saying that Otto Porter Jr looks like Lionel Ritchie.
"1) Poole, JTA, and GP2 have more experience under their belt.  They have a better idea of what they should be doing on the floor both with and without the ball.   2) Addition by subtraction.  Oubre and Bazemore leaving eliminated our two lowest BBIQ players.  Both of them would frequently make terrible decisions, both of them were black holes on offense, and both of them often lost focus on the defensive end.  They were the worst type of players for the offense we try to run, but they both got big minutes.   3) adding veteran leadership in Iguodala.    4) adding capable decision makers and scorers in Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr.    Between all of this, you end up with a roster with 10 players who can pass well, defend actively and intelligently, and can hit open shots.  That’s as good a base to build off of in the NBA as you can ask for.  Furthermore, considering Kerr’s offense is all about off-ball movement and making the extra pass, having intelligent players willingly moving the ball opens up everyone.  Add an MVP candidate in Steph Curry and a DPOY candidate in Draymond Green and good things happen."
Bespoke: Birthday Chiozza and Otto Porter Jr.
Otto Porter Jr been playing bro
"&gt; Get Rudy Gay/Otto Porter Jr instead of Nunn.  I think they tried, OPJ didn't want to play for them or preferred the Warriors. OPJ was offered the MLE by other teams but took the Warrior's minumum offer instead.  &gt;Sources: Otto Porter Jr. turned down the midlevel exception elsewhere to play for the Warriors at the minimum.  https://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/1422410903954235399?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"
"Trade Dennis, KCP, and THT for Lowry at the deadline last year, extend.  Kuzma, Harrell for Buddy Hield if they both preform badly, I actually thought Harrell was nice for the regular season and Kuzma is an underrated defender, maybe Lowry would’ve helped out his offensive woes in the playoffs.  Get Rudy Gay/Otto Porter Jr instead of Nunn.  Bing back the 🐐 Alex Caruso."
"No one said Otto Porter Jr or Nemanja Bjelica? Both are playing at the minimum and are also playing way above how much they are making. Bjelica can playmake, spread the floor by making 3s, and can also get boards for the Warriors. Otto Porter is elite from the corner, and he has been great at setting screens for steph. Both can be starters on other teams on any given day!"
"Injury list: Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Andre  Iguodala, Otto Porter Jr, Klay, Wiseman.  That's why.  It's good to get him reps right now."
"Not ""easily"" but more likely than not they'd win.  A good point you could make tho is that if not kd, than another serviceable forward would take his place, around the level of Harrison Barnes / Otto Porter Jr.  Which would still make them pretty damn good, I agree.  But furthermore, I don't think the rockets assemble as such if kd doesn't go to the warriors"
"How is Otto Porter JR. +24 on 20 min 0pt 2rb 1ast 1stl  I have no idea how +- is calculated but that seems to me anything above 0 woulda been good for those stats, much less a +24.   Curry goes nuclear and gets a +8"
"DRAYMOMD hit more threes tonight than Otto Porter Jr, Bjelica, Jordan Poole, Kuminga, Moody, and Damian Lee COMBINED"
MEET AT THE RIM AND DON'T BE LATE - otto porter jr
This is the hardest I've seen Otto Porter Jr play on this team.   Love to see it. We'll need this energy in the playoffs.
"Ernie Grunfeld was responsible for the Wall , Arenas , and Allan Houston contracts....  He has to go down in the history of the nba as one of the worst GMs  edit: and the Otto Porter Jr max"
Otto Porter Jr. and it’s not even close!
Otto Porter Jr
Oh shit it's Otto Porter Jr
"Ironically, Otto Porter Jr is now on this team and he was THE “bullshit three” guy in 2k17. Made basically every shot."
"You can make an argument that Draymonds regressed (that argument would mainly be centered on his shooting numbers), but I think the comparison shows how good this team is when you look at the bench.   Iguodala seems to have turned back the clock and is back to being as consistently available and useful as that season.   Bjelica is arguably the best free agent we've had in the past ten years excluding KD and Iggy (other contenders I'm thinking of would be Livingston and Barbosa). Especially at his position, the skills he offers (playmaking, shooting) more than make up for his downsides (defense).  Otto Porter Jr. hasn't even looked like the player that I think he can be for us. I honestly think there's only room for him to get better (assuming he stays healthy), but so far it's just nice to have a vet that knows his role and understands what needs to get done.  Then you add improvements from JTA, Damion Lee, and GPII and our team is at least as deep as the pre-KD ""strength in numbers"" days, if not deeper."
"It's not easy to maintain a roster that's smart enough to run this offense though. Warriors are lucky that apart from their main big-money guys, they have developed some in-house role players in Looney, JTA, Lee and Poole. It's not every season that you can pick up Iguodala, Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr. for a minimum contract. GP2 is a great find as well. Next season will be a challenge with only Poole still under contract.  The way they're using GP2 on offense is pretty inspired and he's delivering. In the last game, Kuminga's been given the ball at the top of the key with Steph being the screener. Just let him attack downhill and keep it relatively simple. If Wiseman, Kuminga and Moody develop, Warriors will continue to be a top team for a while."
"It’s not his fault, Wilt was asked by the government to use his DNA to create a clone army  Otto Porter Jr is his Boba Fett"
How did the Warriors go from non playoff team to best team in the league? Otto Porter Jr and Nemanja Bjelica ain't doing that shit. TEACH ME YOUR WAYS
"For Chicago, he's worth 20 M. For New Orleans, he'd be the next Andrew Wiggins/Otto Porter Jr/Gary Harris. It comes down to fit."
He’s everything we drafted Otto Porter Jr. to be
Otto Porter Jr turning the clock back

"And possibly Otto ""this guy really looks like Wilt"" Porter Jr."
"Anyone who thinks Wilt couldn't dominate in today's league, I just show them Otto Porter Jr"
I love how it took the Warriors a miraculous run by Otto Porter Jr to finally pull away from a borderline G League team filled with 19 year olds.
"Otto ""prime melo"" Porter jr"
Otto Porter Jr has turned into Kevin Durant
"If Wiseman takes a second year leap and Klay comes back looking like Klay then the Warriors could actually be a title threat.  Dudes like Poole, GPII, and JTA have been great finds over the last couple of rebuild seasons, Otto Porter Jr. looks like a good fit and so does Belli, I know the schedule has been very kind to them early in the season but this team feels like it's for real to me."
Is Otto porter Jr. your dad or something?
"speculation that he could be CLE's guy had leaked earlier in the week.  overall the CLE fans were OK with it.  the thinking was Oladipo looked good but wasn't for us and Otto Porter Jr. didn't have the athleticism to start.  If Noel was healthy he would have been the consensus pick  - and even he's been pretty mediocre.  I was hoping for Len, which says a little something about how empty that draft class really was."
Otto is the original Porter Jr
otto porter jr is doing just _fine_ thank you and he will absolutely not be injured at any point this season!!!!!
He’ll make a ton of improvements by playing with Andre Iguoudala and Otto Porter Jr. instead of Brad Wannamaker and Kelly Oubre.   Our team is begging for Wiseman’s skill set.
Nice haha. What scheme of Jersey?  I have a white Otto Porter Jr Wizards jersey for some freaking reason lol. Probably my most random in my collection ha
"DJJ’s contract, blazers 1st, Coby white are the assets they have.   Also If you can trade Otto Porter, Wendell cart jr and 2 first for an all star you do it, we saw what middle of the pack lottery picks have done for them up to this point"
Max contract Otto Porter Jr tonight
