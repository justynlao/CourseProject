"in 08 taking Dwight over Bron or Kobe is dumb, the team was still broken up lol Matt Barnes, Vince Carter n Rashad Lewis weren't there the next year."
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
"As I remember, he was mostly guarded by the opposing team's small forward, shooting guard or athletic bigs like:   Peja, Turkoglu, Al Harrington, Marion, Rashard Lewis, Rasheed Wallace, Artest, Keon Clark, Horry, Bonzi Wells,  Kenyon Martin, Stephen Jackson, James Posey, etc.   Most centers can't guard him (Shaq, Divac, Brad Miller, Jermaine O'Neal, Ben Wallace, Ilgauskas, Mutombo, etc.) as he always beat them off the dribble.   And surprisingly, Duncan never guarded him that much. It's mostly Matt Bonner, Bruce Bowen, Horry, Ginobili, or some other capable wing.   During the Nash/Fin/Dirk era, I mostly remembered teams sticking just one guy on him.    They don't double-team him as he's not really the primary option back then -- it was either Finley or Nash.    He's also an intelligent passer so, you can't really double him on the perimeter. And he's constantly in motion.  But when Nash and Finley left, teams started doubling him with an athletic wing/forward (see: 2006 finals and 2007 first-round).   To counter this, they usually put him on the nail -- just above the free-throw line where he has an option to either drive, pull up, or pass.   His post-game is already developed, but it's not as good as around 2008 onwards.    If you want to see how his post-game developed go back to the 2009 playoffs vs the Nuggets. He's cooking Kenyon Martin, Carmelo Anthony, and Nene during that series. Sadly they didn't win."

"It seems as if   - ('Emoni Bates', 'Matt Bewley', 'Josh Giddey', 'Jalen Lewis', 'Kanaan Carlyle') ~ 549 (and counting)  have blown all of them out of the water then"
