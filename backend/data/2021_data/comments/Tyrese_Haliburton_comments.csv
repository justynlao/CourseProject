"In no particular order it's probably Quickley, the top 3 picks, Haliburton, Desmond Bane has been shooting super well, Pritchard had some great games and should be getting back from his injury soon, Tyrese Maxey was kinda balling when the sixers needed him to step up, Patrick Williams seems solid, and then Precious Achiuwa seems good whenever I see him? Idk I'm probably missing someone, but sure is 10 good rookies"

I mean Wiseman isn't even performing as the best rookie atm either. It's either Tyrese Haliburton or Quickley.
"Then that should be about all players who get their stats posted with no substance. LaMelo, Wiseman,  Tyrese Haliburton,  etc"
"That's scorching hot. 12 points on league average effeciency, with 2 assists and 2 rebounds. Tyrese Haliburton is my pick."
"2020 was the supposed ""quiet"" draft but it's really produced a ton of great rookies  the top 3 all look solid Tyrese Maxey  Immanuel Quickly  Tyrese Haliburton  Payton Pritchard  That's at least 7 solid NBA players with some of them showing star potential. Then there are still dudes like Cole Anthony, Deni Avidja, Desmond Bane. Like 10 players that might make a career is a pretty good draft. It's definitely no 2018 but the potential still has yet to fully reveal itself."
"ugliest shooting form nominees: Tyrese haliburton, Lamelo ball, ja morant"
"I'm not saying he is or will become a bust but there's a lot of rookies who come into the league and aren't shooting sub 40% out the gate. One of the biggest criticisms coming in was that he was a really mediocre shooter and inefficient scorer in college and people who liked him said to not worry. Then it got worse when he came into the league. I hope he turns it around since he seems like a fun player but people take the ""we shouldn't give rookies a hard time"" thing way too far. Tyrese Haliburton was taken 12th and he's been amazing across the board. So clearly it's possible to at least not be disastrously inefficient as a rookie."
"Haliburton plays both sides of the ball way better than Melo. His defense isn’t even comparable. The game is a lot more than just counting stats and Tyrese playing more minutes shouldn’t be a slant on him. He’s literally playing so well Luke can’t afford NOT to play him in the end of games, even though he’s not starting."
"You should watch more of Haliburton then. His game is much more than the stats show, and while Edwards and Wisemen have both stepped it up, Tyrese has been gunning since game 1."
Betting odds as of earlier this week   https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/nba-rookie-of-the-year-odds-update-lamelo-ball-tyrese-haliburton-james-wiseman-01ex0a09qq18
"The top 3 guys look like they could be all stars. Anthony Edwards has been unsurprisingly inefficient from long distance but he's a great finisher that has the tools to also be a good defender. James Wiseman is already one of the most fluid 7 footers I've seen. Lamelo is a great passer already and seems to be gaining confidence as a scorer.  Tyrese Haliburton is great, too. The guy has so much poise for a rookie.  Okoro looks like a good defensive player already. Not the type of guy who gives you flashy defensive highlights but the guy who can contain scorers for long stretches.  PWill was definitely a project coming into the draft but he looks already like an NBA starter Sometimes he goes a little mental, though, and shoots ill advised contested middies. Quickley and Maxey deserve a shout out too because of surpassing expectations."

Why you bringing up the current rookie of the year Tyrese Haliburton in a thread about the Minnesota Timber..... uh...the... uh...Wolves! The Timberwolves man?
"You can spew numbers all you want but I’ve been keeping up with both of these guys heavily and I can tell you via my own two eyes that Tyrese definitely has the edge right now. Not saying IQ can’t pass him up, he’s the hottest rookie at the moment &amp; if he keeps this up he will pass Haliburton, but Tyrese hit the ground running &amp; has been better from the get-go."
"What happened was, Haliburton just happened to be walking between Fred and Lowry, as soon as Lowry turned back to Fred to yell something at him. Unfortunately, Haliburton walked between them that very split second, and I'm assuming the ref thought that Kyle was talking shit to Tyrese. Bad call."
"Tyrese Haliburton. I still don’t know why he is third in ROTY run, especially how good he has been."
"Just FYI, most mocks had Hali around 5-8, but prior to the draft [he asked other teams to pass on him so that he could go to the kings](https://kingsherald.com/draft-news/2020-nba-draft-tyrese-haliburton-sacramento-kings-lowe-post/).   So still an upset, but it's a bit of an odd scenario. I think had he been picked at 5 it wouldn't be a big surprise to see him get ROTY."

It is within the realm of possibility that Tyrese Haliburton is Tall Jason Kidd.
It is not inconceivable that Tyrese Haliburton is Tall Jason Kidd.
"The NBA isn’t paying them, we as fans are paying them. What we all spend on the game determines how much salaries are.  Your comment about being born in tough neighborhoods without education or guidance is very ignorant and might I add a racist dog whistle. You’re implying that any player born in a tough neighborhood (which statistically means mostly the black players) is uneducated and unable to receive guidance from people around them. And they don’t get “any sort of education”, wtf man. That’s fucked up. Education isn’t just the school you went to, it’s the people you grew up around. Look at KD’s mom, she’s a fucking saint and clearly educated Kevin and he turned out to be a nice, humble young man with a good head on his shoulders. Or Tyrese Haliburton. Or 98% of all players in the NBA. They mostly all had good role models and support systems, because it’s damn near impossible to get to the NBA without people close to you making sacrifices in order to enrich your life. That is the opposite of no guidance.  The problem has nothing to do with where they were born or whom they had for guidance. It’s the fact that you’re giving a 19 year old a ton of money. And to them 1 million seems the same as 100 million, like it could never, ever run out. A million is “only” a thousand thousand, which saying it like that is laughable, but it’s actually pretty easy to spend if you aren’t smart about it, and kids are generally not smart about money. It’s the fact that they’re rich kids, not uneducated idiots that got no guidance or education."

Tyrese Haliburton is coming for Tyler Herro's spot
"I love BI so I hope we can just shove as many good shooters around Zion/BI as possible. BI needs space to slash too.  So maybe some Devin Booker types, a Tyrese Haliburton-type (who can shot create for others and hit shots,) etc."
Feel like that's even more of a thing with Tyrese Haliburton lol
Tyrese Haliburton is the same way
"Tyrese Haliburton on the Kings reminds me more of Brogdon: taller combo guards, good shooters and playmakers, who can also take it to the hoop. Good all-round floor generals."
Excited to introduce Clippers fans to Tyrese Haliburton.
"relative to expectations yes but in the grade scheme of things no. Lots of these guys are high floor/low ceiling types. So like Tyrese Haliburton, LaMelo Ball, and even James Wiseman are all guys who will realistically peak at a sub-all star level."
COTY - Nate Bjorkgren  MIP - Christian Wood  6MOTY - Chris Boucher   ROTY - Tyrese Haliburton   DPOY - Joel Embiid   MVP - I have no clue rn  Philly trades for Kyle Lowry and make it to the Finals but lose to the Lakers in 6 games.

Tyrese Haliburton is the better player

"tf no. Tyrese will pan out to be a top 5 or so player from this draft, assuming health. And even if Tyrese had the FULL green light he wouldn’t beat Tyrese Haliburton in Sacramento."
Won't it be Tyrese in the lead? Tyrese Haliburton has had a hell of a season so far.
"Surprise: Tyrese Haliburton. League ready on day 1, makes whole team better, maybe best player on the team so far.  Disappointing: Hassan Whiteside. Nice having a real shot locker, but he's otherwise a complete liability."
"Most Surprising: Tyrese Haliburton. I knew he was good, I didn't know he was ""carrying this team on his back"" good.   Most disappointing: Buddy Hield. He's been in a very long shooting slump, only cracked the 20+ pts once this season so far. Hoping he turns it around soon."
Tyrese Haliburton having a great start to his rookie year.
The guy I'm playing this week also has them. Luckily I drafted basically the entire Suns starting lineup and Tyrese Haliburton so I'm justttt squeeking out a win thanks to KD missing games.

"James Wiseman has freakish athleticism, length, and Size.  Anthony Edwards has size and explode with great athleticism to get buckets  Lamelo Ball has the height with good lead ball handling, and his passing is elite level  Tyrese Haliburton is just good at everything, and she showed drastic improvement from freshman to sophomore year. He is older than James Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, and Lamelo Ball with extra time to improve his skills against good competition.  Tyrese Haliburton talented but those 3 have potential to be top 10 player in the league be the main guy on the team, but they have a lot of work to do to get there. I am not sure if they are going to reach that level. Whatever happen from his freshman to sophomore year Tyrese Haliburton gets it, and know what to do on the court with his abilities with almost any situation. To me his potential is Malcolm Brogden."
A1 steal of the draft. He can play any sport he wants if there's money on the line. I'd like to see Tyrese Haliburton beat him at cooked food smh 😤 😤 😤
"He was just too much money for the role we would be giving him, unless we are still trading Buddy. Having kept both Bogi and Buddy would’ve made it a lot harder to get solid minutes for Tyrese, and Rese has looked amazing.   Bogi leaving was basically addition by subtraction. Our team got cheaper and we ended up better, IMO. Obviously I would’ve loved the Bucks trade to go through since we still could’ve used DD, but then again having DD would’ve also made it a bit harder to get minutes for Rese. (Luke would’ve likely played DD over Haliburton until Haliburton got to prove himself, which ended up happening way quicker now)."

"A lot of us wanted Patrick Williams and thought he would still be on the board at 12 while Haliburton would be long gone. Then Patrick's stock went through the roof, and Tyrese fell. Funny how that happens. You won't find a single Kings fan that's disappointed with Tyrese though."
The Haliburton thing is going to look rough for a lot of teams imo. Tyrese was projected to go as high as top 6 for a reason.
"Wood has been very good, but I’m not really surprised by it after his post-Drummond-trade play. Nor am I surprised by Sabonis - he’s an excellent player and was an All-Star last year for a reason.  I’m surprised by Aquaman’s on/off numbers. And I’m surprised by just how great Tyrese Haliburton has looked early on."
"I'm genuinely curious what they do with Fox, Haliburton, Hield and HB. Who's the odd man out? Do they move HB and run Hield at the 3 so Tyrese can can play the 2. Or trade Hield and run HB. Or trade Fox (least likely thing to happen, I know)    It's going to be interesting what happens in Sacramento this season"

"Tyrese Haliburton, Jordan Clarkson, Norman Powell, Montrezl Harrell, Enes Kanter"
"True! And look at how bad the picks were. Tyrese Haliburton, who would have gone No. 1 if he had played another collegiate year, was only picked at No. 12 by the Sacramento Kings. And yet he is the only real threat to LaMelo's RoY run.   What happened to Anthony Edwards? The greatest offensive rookie, except he lacks one factor: teamwork. Any teamwork at all. A star forward should average more than two assists in thirty minutes. Especially when working with other offensive players that also lack cohesiveness."

"Eh, we got lots of dudes to watch in the NBA (so we don't have to watch the Flyin' Pr0-16hms this year). Monte Morris, Georges Niang, THT, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Haliburton. All having solid years, and all but Tyrese on good-ish teams."
Listen to JJ Reddick talk about his ejection with Tyrese Haliburton. It absolutely sounds like profanity at a ref is an automatic punishment. He doesn't dispute at all that he deserved his first tech for swearing.
"I know r/nba doesn't like it but there are a lot of things you can't say to the official. Reddick was just talking about it with Tyrese Haliburton, and JJ said he agreed with the first tech he got for swearing. Tyrese said he'd never heard anyone swear at an official until the NBA. Booker probably crossed the line twice."

(Positions could be debated)  PG: De'Aaron Fox | Tyrese Haliburton | Jahmi'us Ramsey  SG: Buddy Hield | Cory Joseph | Kyle Guy | Justin James  SF: Harrison Barnes | DaQuan Jeffries  PF: Marvin Bagley III | Jabari Parker | Nemanja Bjelica  C: Richaun Holmes | Hassan Whiteside (Out) | Norvel Pelle  Whiteside's out for Health and Safety Protocols. Luke Walton's not a good coach, but how the heck is he supposed to win games with that roster? Fox is good, Hield will get his, Barnes is solid, and Bagley/Holmes are not terrible but they're below-average starters. Somehow though, their bench is even more dire. How many of these guys would even start on a good team? I think it's a bit extreme, but only Fox and Hield/Barnes could start for certain teams. I don't think anyone past Bagley/Holmes/Haliburton would crack a rotation, and some of those (like Bagley) would even be questionable."

Tyrese Haliburton esque
Tyrese Haliburton mentioned something similar on JJ Reddick pod this week. Basically the NBA allows a lot more to be said by players than any other league hes been in

"&gt; is luke walton a fucking idiot?   yes  &gt;Tyrese is probably already better than Buddy  I said on draft night that Buddy Hield was not good enough to hold Tyrese Haliburton back, and got told off for it."
My three biggest takeaways:   1) Marvin Bagley is a disaster out there. Dude just has no idea how to play basketball.  2) Tyrese Haliburton is the only guy on that team that wants to keep the ball moving.  3) Luke Walton is a shitty coach.
Tyrese Haliburton in the #1 spot to be Rookie of the Year?

"Andre Drummonds rebounding numbers are an obvious example. Blake Griffin this season is putting up empty stats this season as well (sorry blake), just look at someone like tyrese haliburton who’s putting up basically the exact same numbers but watching the game his stats are clearly more impactful. Anthony Edwards is another example, as much as I love his game the timberwolves are a team desperate for scoring and as a rookie he’s been tasked to help with a lot of that load. The flashes are there but his scoring numbers are not to the point where they are representing a positive impact on the team yet, but he’ll get there soon.   If we want to talk about inflated stats that’s a separate conversation but there is some overlap in some cases."
Knicks missed hard on Tyrese Haliburton but getting IQ made it so much less disastrous.
He’s overrated just like Lamelo and Luka. The face of the league is Tyrese Haliburton
So is Tyrese Haliburton and Lamelo Ball!
He's starting to look like Tyrese Haliburton lite. He could be really good in a few years if he keeps it up

"&gt; May I remind you that you drafted Hayes over Halliburton, which was considered an awful move at the time  Hayes got injured, and Haliburton and his agent tanked his draft stock so he would fall to the Kings: https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/did-tyrese-haliburton-agent-engineer-nba-draft-day-tumble-kings  &gt;According to ESPN’s Jonathan Givony, Tyrese Haliburton, whom the Kings selected Wednesday with the No. 12 overall pick, might have made the same determination and with the help from his agent, he made it happen.  Also it wasn't considered an 'awful move' lol. You had Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer calling him the best pick in the draft."
I thought this said Tyrese Haliburton
Shades of Tyrese Haliburton
Tyrese Haliburton apparently 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Kings fans, I will never forget that Tyler Johnson dropped Tyrese Haliburton"
I feel bad about not drafting Fox instead of Josh Jackson or Tyrese Haliburton instead of Jalen Smith. Ayton is an excellent player and Luka is overrated.

Tyrese Haliburton is one of my favourite players in the entire league. I would be elated if he was on the Raptors.
"&gt; He's still developing but is a solid contributor.  No, this is the problem...he's not.   He's a bad NBA player and he's not getting better.  This is like last year when I was on the ""Bryn Forbes is terrible"" train and nobody would fucking agree.   Just because somebody wears our jersey doesn't mean he's good and we have to talk ourselves into him.   You watch a guy like Tyrese Haliburton or SGA and it's just immediately clear that they understand the game of basketball and can play above-average minutes in this league.   We know what guys who start out like this look like long-term.  Here is 538's player projection for Lonnie...  Notice the WAR value they projected for this year? So far, his actual WAR is -1.1   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/lonnie-walker-iv/  In reality, if this level of play continues, he's more similar to Emmanuel Mudiay or Dennis Smith Jr or Ish Smith.  The track record of guys who play this poorly in year three is bad."
"Faried played 12 games for the Nets and they waived him three months before the playoffs started. How are you this bad at googling? In 2019 Ed Davis averaged 18 minutes a night and put up 6 pts and 8 rebounds. A backup energy big is not a major contributor.   If I didn’t know better than Thibs about playing your high-performing rookies, then other coaches on rebuilding my teams would do the old school hardass routine with their rookies. Tyrese Haliburton is averaging 31 minutes a night and he’s never played less than 20 minutes in a game. Quick scores 13 points in 12 minutes then gets sat for the rest of the game because he misses one PnR assignment. It’s stupid.   Plenty of analysts say we have a chance? Fuck the analysts, their primary job is entertainment. Most of them still use per game stats.  Every statistic that proves you wrong is bad faith, apparently. You’re saying that because you haven’t cited a single one. Maybe you don’t understand them enough to use them to make a point, I don’t know what your situation is."
"Jazz, Hornets, Tyrese Haliburton"
"Love Tyrese Haliburton.  Think about how interesting it would've been for the Cavs to take him and run him at SF with Garland and Sexton. Probably wouldn't have worked out, and I really like Okoro, but I think it would've been cool to watch."
Luke Walton decided to fix our team by benching Tyrese Haliburton in favor of Moe Harkless. I don't ever want to hear anything about how Scott Brooks or anyone else is the worst coach in the league as long as this dumb fuck is our coach.

Keep sleeping on Tyrese Haliburton...
Right.. I'd take Tyrese Haliburton over him.
"I agree, but I still think it largely comes back to scouting.  Could Dion Waiters have been something more if he came up with like the Spurs? Sure .  But the Spurs are smart enough go know which guys are worth putting their resources into , and thats ultimately what separates them (and other good organziations) from the basement dwellers.    Theres not many guys who I think wouldve been stars but were held back by whoever drafted them.  And when it does happen, its usually when the team who drafted them simply wasn't giving them enough of an opportunity to shine .    Going back to the Spurs, I feel like Kawhi was going to be a star no matter where he went.  Maybe not the superstar he became, but when a guy is has the tools and self-motivation to improve his game, there is really nothing that can hold him down from rising towards the top one way or another.  A kawhi Leonard drafted by the Kings still wouldve been a star still .  Look at Tyrese Haliburton .  You draft a high IQ player who has a great feel for the game and the ""player development"" becomes less of a talking point,  not even the Kings can screw that up"
Bill Simmons and the rest of the staff at TheRinger.com hasn't stopped doing victory laps on Tyrese Haliburton for the last four months but they conveniently ignore that Hayes was #1 on their big board.  Wonder if they'll get back on the bandwagon or if they're off for good.  Also Hayes is bigger than I realized.
"You can do hindsight draft picks with most teams.  I do agree though that the FO could have done a lot better even during the Golden Era and got lucky that they landed KD and are located in San Fran.  Picking Jacob Evans at #28 in 2018 is pretty awful in retrospect. In most drafts, you don't typically expect a late 1st rounder to become a major contributor, but that draft was deep with as you say, a bunch of players picked later than #28 being major rotational pieces right now.  Jordan Poole is a weird pick and the Warriors would be better today with Keldon Johnson, KPJ or Nic Claxton but this is more on Kerr not playing Poole earlier and now playing him in awful line-ups.  Wiseman at #2 made a lot of sense so I can't entirely fault the front office but damn Lamelo Ball or Tyrese Haliburton would have made the Warriors so much more competitive right now, next season, and Lamelo to me projects to be a way better player."

"Edwards is by far the more popular player for his dunks, outspoken with media, and he has directly impacted every recent Wolves win he single handedly won the Knicks game.   I'm a Knicks fan with no dog in the fight and obviously i wish we drafted Tyrese.   But for ROTY i cannot see Ant not winning unless Tyrese can get to 16 ppg OR Kings make the play in. Ant has some huge rookie records with 43 points in a game and best dunk of the year in NBA. His stats post all star are unreal.   You can say low efficiency but for example LeBron was 41/29/75 shooting line as a rookie before jumping to 47/35/75 sophomore year rookies are cut slack on efficiency.  Ant is 39/31/78 so very similar to LeBron rookie line.   I am NOT saying he is LeBron who had a huge impact on winning right away for Cavs and was in the LaMelo PG type role.   If Ant was doing that it's be over. It's not over but I give him 90 percent chance to win right now. Either Haliburton must jump or Kings must win."
"Does he have a larger role than most rookies? Yes. But LaMelo and Tyrese Haliburton also have large roles, and are much more efficient offensive players."
On what planet is Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton on a level well below Patrick Williams
"Record should hurt Ant, but I think it’s totally fair that record (many wins of which he’s clearly contributed massively to) SHOULD benefit Tyrese. Edwards clearly isn’t the reason the wolves are terrible so it shouldn’t be blamed on him, but Haliburton IS a huge part of why the Kings are winning so that should boost him."
"My likely projection for Haliburton is something along the lines of a better version of Malcolm Brogdon. They've similar players, but Tyrese is better at 20 years old than Brogdon was at 25.  Another comp I really like was Mike Conley combined with Doug Christie"

"My senior year of high school in October, 2007, I visited my cousins who played soccer at ISU. I had never been to Ames before, but because I just turned 18, I was allowed to go visit.  I was taken to a frat party where there was a beer pong tourney which had about a dozen people watching. My cousin pointed to a guy about my stature (6'5, 185 lbs at the time) and said ""he's the best player for the Cyclones and it's not even close."" As he was pointing him out, Mr. Tyrese Haliburton was draining shots while doing the Supaman dat hoe dance. Little did I know I was watching the greatest shooter of all time"

"Another great game for Tyrese ""ROTY"" Haliburton. 15pts, 10ast, 4reb, 2stl, +20"
Please tell me you don't mean tyrese haliburton.
"I just singled out Vlade because that was the example used. Big fan of DeAaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton, think they can be a great backcourt one day. There's some talent there, but talent alone is not enough. That's what the ""non-tankers"" argue and I agree. I just don't think it applies to the Raptors. Sorry the Kings caught a stray in our in-fighting LOL"
"Marcus Smart, Steph Curry, Tyrese Haliburton, Zion Williamson, Nikola Jokic  A lot of great passers lol. No idea how good it would be but any team with Curry and Jokic would be insane."
"If there's one person I could see an argument that he should've been picked behind, it's Tyrese Haliburton, not Vassell"
"Is it wrong to think Tyrese Haliburton is the X factor, and that’s why team B wins"
Don't forget Tyrese Haliburton and Immanuel Quickley. Seems to be quite a strong class
Well we have a different front office so that’s irrelevant. Their first pick of Tyrese Haliburton looking like a pretty solid steal
"If LaMelo were a regular rookie (even putting up good stats), I could see an argument for Lonzo as he's becoming a very good role player.  Regular rookies make tons of mistakes that don't show up on the box score.  But LaMelo isn't a regular rookie.  Lonzo is a better defender but isolation defense on 1s and 2s isn't that impactful.  You're going to get switched off of a lot and you're not providing the help defense that bigs and wings provide.    LaMelo is like 2 tiers better as a playmaker than Lonzo.  Lonzo is much more conservative in half court sets and he's not an engine that can drive the offense.  LaMelo can be your offense, and their outside shooting is nearly identical (only LaMelo's shots are much harder).    Compare Lonzo to Tyrese Haliburton. They offer many of the same things, only Haliburton is a smidge smaller but is also a much better 3pt shooter.    How close do you think LaMelo and Haliburton are right now?"
I still have faith Tyrell Terry (#8 on KOC's board) can be better than Tyrese Haliburton (#9)!
"G: Monte Morris G: Tyrese Haliburton G/F: THT F: Abdel Nader F: George Niang  Yeah, probably not going to win many too many games, but all solid role players."
Tyrese Haliburton
Tyrese Haliburton
I really can't think of many from Milwaukee or even Wisconsin. Tyler Herro or Wes Matthews? Tyrese Haliburton?  EDIT: It's gotta be Latrell Sprewell
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."
De'aron Fox/  Tyrese Haliburton/  Luka Doncic/  Harrison Barnes/  Richaun Holmes/   Sheesh that line-up could compete with anyone in the league. Legitimately one BPA away in 2018.  If you're going to pick Bagley at least trade back to pick-up an asset to compensate for your dumb ass pick.

Zion Williamson and Allen Iverson  Lamelo Ball and Shaquille O'Neal  Tyrese Haliburton and Amare Stoudamire
"* Zion Williamson and **Chris Paul**. CP3's playmaking can help open the floor for Zion, and he won't be taking shots away from him like other ball-dominant guards. Also, the lobs would be fun. Bam Adebayo is another good option, a solid secondary playmaker who can cover for Zion's defensive limitations thanks to his versatility.  * LaMelo Ball and **Nikola Jokic**. LaMelo has thrived this year thanks to Hornets' ball-sharing system, which lets him function as a playmaker and an off-ball threat. Jokic is the perfect fit for that, even if Melo/Jokic would be serviceable at best on defense. Of course, if Melo-Jokic pick and pops aren't your speed, Melo-Zion would also be fun, again because of lobs.  * Tyrese Haliburton and **Damian Lillard**. Hali doesn't iso a lot, usually having others set up his shots for him, but is a great playmaker. Dame can create his own shot with ease, but isn't a spectacular playmaker, and can be worn down if he has to have the ball in his hands on every possession. The strengths perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Hali and Steph would also be a really fun pairing, or Hali and Jimmy Butler."
**tyrese haliburton**
It was LaMelo for the majority of the season then he got hurt and Edwards became the front runner and then I don't think he will win over the two of them but I do want to mention Tyrese Haliburton has been pretty good and out of the three of them the most consistent.  Edwards has been erratic and his play has improved but it's happened to be when the Timberwolves have gone into tank mode and let him start chucking.  And I see all of the LaMelo Ball talk and I've been watching all season and I recognize the talent and creativity but I also see a kid who has a decent amount of holes in his game and I remember when they were taking him out of games in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line.  Both Edwards and Ball have the potential to be really great players in this league but I have to point out that right now both have quite a few wart's in their game.  While Haliburton doesn't have the long term potential as them he's been really good all season and steady. I don't think he's going to win but I do want to point out that for the duration of the season he's been the most consistent rookie this year.
&gt;	Tyrese Haliburton has been ruled out for the rest of the game due to a left knee injury.  https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1389036488285818882?s=21
"probably no one right now but there are guys coming in to the league who will absolutely get opportunities to chuck a lot in their first 2 years. ANT is gets 7 3PA a game and he's not even a good shooter. if tyrese haliburton had found himself on the rockets or wolves or something instead of the kings he might be getting a ton of attempts too. cade might end up on either of those teams and he's a guy who could get a lot of run his rookie year, and be in a ball dominant position."

"Had LAL ML as part of 2 separate 3-leg parlays with other 2 legs locked up (PHO ML, MIL ML and PHO double result, MIL double result).  Also had 2-leg parlay with AD 24+ points and Schroder 8+ assists.  Almost had all those locked up.  AD ended with 22 points and Schroder 7 assists.  Fucking trash LAL, can't even beat a horrible SAC team that is dead last in DRTG and gives up the most ppg in the league.  Oh yeah they were also missing Fox and Barnes, two of their top scores.    Lebron, AD, and company really just lost @ home vs. Tyrese Haliburton, Richaun Holmes, and company.  While up 10 to start the 4th.  LAL managed a measley 18 points in the 4th.  AD is subbed out to start the 4th, doesn't enter back until 6:44 left and lead cut to 3.  LAL scored only 8 points in that 5 minutes and 16 seconds.    In the last 6:44 of the game, Richaun Holmes scores 8 points, 4 of which came via free throws.  Terrence Davis scored 7 points.  Haliburton sealed the game w 2 FT's.  During that same 6:44 remaining, AD scored 4 points, Lebron scored 5 points, and Drummond scored 1 point.  4 turnovers by LAL (2 by Lebron, and those occured within 24 seconds of one another).  4-9 on fg attempts (they only managed two attempts from 6:44 left to 3:11 left, over 3 and a half minutes of game time, and only 2 fg attempts?!?).  Committed 5 fouls which led to 8 SAC points.  Had 5 rebounds which led to a whopping 1 point for LAL.  Had possession for roughly 3:16 in that stretch and managed to only make 4 fg's.  Had 2 blocks which resulted in a whopping 0 points.    I know Lebron just came back tonight and AD is still getting back into rhythm, but my god, what a horrible stretch of the last half of the 4th quarter to lose to the worst defense in the league.  LAL has 3rd best DRTG in the league and SAC had 7 players in double digits.  LAL 7-28 from 3pt!  LAL got outscored by 5 in FT's.  They let a SAC team averaging 79.3% from FT go 90.9% tonight.    4 of the SAC players who scored double digits average under 8 ppg each.  2 of them average 5.2 and 4.3 ppg.    LAL had 21 turnovers.  Their 5th leading scorer in Kuzma managed to score 2 points (!) in 22 minutes.  Only had one starter (Lebron) with a positive +/-.  Had 12 blocks compared to 3 for SAC.    That was a bit therapeutic to write all that.  Sure I'm upset about losing those bets, but it's not like I'm losing my house (say less!).  I know this has been probably one of the weirdest NBA seasons as well due to the shortened, compressed nature of it, and the empty stands and other impacts due to COVID.  I also know LAL is still a title contender, but man, what a loss today.  Vs. the worst defense in the league, a team that had lost 12 of their last 15, and who in their previous game gave up 154 points and lost by 49, a team missing two of their top scorers.    Obviously will take some time for Lebron and AD to get to 100%, but besides them, the team was fully healthy (besides Caruso).  I don't think the Lakers are a team most will want to face in the playoffs, but this game shows how much the injuries to AD and Lebron have affected this team.    Only 9 games left for LAL and 22 days till playoffs start.  I'd be a little bit concerned if I were a LAL fan."

"He wasn't the one who brought Quickley up lol. This is how the comment chain started:  &gt;There's only a handful of rookies that contributed to winning basketball games consistently in Ball, Haliburton, and Quickley  To which you replied  &gt;Ball is the only rookie that’s playing above avg if nba has an avg. Tyrese is about avg in the grand scheme of things. edwards isn’t playing winning basketball and is inefficient.  You left him off while saying Ball is the only rookie playing above-average, so the other guy was chiming in with the fact that Quickley has also been above-average (.125 WS/48, 83rd in the NBA for RPM)."
"Yeah he's definitely capitalising. Even now, it's still a hard sell trying to convince me Anthony Edwards or Tyrese Haliburton deserves it over LaMelo.  Secure your shit Melo!"
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."

"&gt;Just kidding, Ant is the truth. This draft is already looking much better than it was made out to be. I think there’ll be multiple perennial All Stars in LaMelo/Ant/Haliburton and some really strong starters.  I don't want to sound like I'm negative but I don't see Tyrese Haliburton as some kind of all star. He's that Malcolm Brogdon/FVV type of player (not to say he's bad (he's quite good) but just that's the ceiling for him)."
&gt; He didn’t start Tyrese Haliburton who has been the 2nd best player on the Kings this year   I don't watch a lot of Kings basketball but I thought it was 1. Fox 2. Holmes 3. Haliburton. Correct me if I'm wrong.
"Fox needs more help. Fox is 23. It really isn’t that deep. We have 3-4 years to build a winning team around him. We already had one chance with Luka and screwed it up, so that front office got replaced and in year 1 the new front office picked Tyrese Haliburton, who has been one of the best rookies in the league.   There’s no reason for Fox to demand a trade instead of seeing what the front office that he literally just signed a 5 year max deal with can do."

You know who would've been nice?   Tyrese Haliburton.    Still don't know what the Suns were thinking

Tyrese Haliburton
"Think they're closing their eyes and ears and yelling ""Tyrese Haliburton should have been Rookie of the Year"" repeatedly in response to this."
Same here. I wish the Suns drafted Haliburton but since they didn't I was happy they got Tyrese Haliburton instead to help ease the pain of not having Doncic as a guard even if it is only eases a little bit of it.
"It's not just positioning. Wiseman right now doesn't have a great feel for the game and the intuition you'd hope for in a top draft pick.  The Warriors front office were also surprised by how slowly he developed throughout the season.  Deandre Ayton for e.g. while bad in his rookie season was no where near as negatively impactful as Wiseman &amp; Ayton showed a lot more promise and development in his rookie campaign too.  Evan Mobley who tbf probably will end up playing PF also looks like he'd be a way, way better PF/C than Wiseman straight out of the gate.  Wiseman is an athletic freak no doubt, and a high character guy, and he was my preferred pick at 2 as well but damn GSW would be so, so much better with Lamelo/ Tyrese Haliburton"
"u convinced me right now, give me Haliburton for Killian Hayes, i wanted tyrese draft night anyways lmfao  Edit: sweet i glossed over the ending of three where you are already looking for hayes! I was looking for a Haliburton u genius"
"Tyrese Haliburton won't win it, but watching him close games in the 4th quarter for the Kings was like watching a 10 year vet.  He seemed so composed even though he was a rookie."
I think you make great points and I might be mistaken on the flexibility they would have in a trade. But would a team give up a 12th pick? Maybe? Tyrese Haliburton (Kings) is looking like that type of player and he was a 12th pick.
"Very much agreed about the cherry picked stats. I would have called it out myself if you hadn’t.   That said, this is what Ant fans have been seeing in reverse all year. There was an article from the Ringer a few weeks ago that used rookie stats to compare the top rookies from this class against historic rookies to “project” their ceiling. For Anthony, they chose his usage rate combined with his FG% and compared him to Dion Waiters, Coby White, and JR Smith. And then for Melo, they did some magic with his stats of like 15-5-5 to compare him to Luka, Trae, and Ja.

"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
There's actually a few nba players that shoot like that too. The one that comes to mind is Tyrese Haliburton.
Tyrese Haliburton is going to replace cp3 as the league point god within the next few years
Tyrese Haliburton.
Genuinely can’t wait for this. Pair him with Spencer Dinwiddie or Tyrese Haliburton and bring back Players Only
"So who's better? Jalen Green? In the FIBA final, playing om the same team against the same competition, Green put up 1/0/1, Cade put up 21/7/7 and was the unquestioned go to guy and leader on a team that had a good NBA player (Tyrese Haliburton). That means Cade is at least as good as Haliburton (probably)."
Luka Doncic and Jokic Tatum  Tyrese Haliburton Zion Shai-Gilgeous Alex
"Tyrese haliburton please, he was on the select team"
Tyrese Haliburton would be good for the team. This will never happen though. Also move Kevin out for an actual big that can defend the paint and set heavy screens.
"i'm not familiar with what he wants to do, article had him included   &gt;The Kings would be looking to put Simmons, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound point guard, in a frontcourt position in a lineup featuring Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and possibly Richaun Holmes, if they are able to keep him in free agency."
Tyler Herro/ Tyrese Haliburton/ Jordan Poole/ Deonte Burton/ Kevon Loney  You could add Wes Matthews/ Frank Kaminsky as starters/bench guys.  Man that team would be bad.

"I feel like a good coach could see the rotation of  de’aron fox, tyrese Haliburton, Ben Simmons and create a team that’d be a truly *unique* challenge for any team.  Perhaps even a team that’d go down as innovative.    I know literally nothing about coaching in the nba, but I can still confidently say that Luke Walton is not the coach for that."
"https://kingsherald.com/draft-news/2020-nba-draft-tyrese-haliburton-sacramento-kings-lowe-post/  &gt; But the franchises’ newest top draft pick, Tyrese Haliburton, reportedly not only wanted to come to Sacramento - he and his agent reportedly told teams not to select him because he wanted to end up with the Kings.  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/did-tyrese-haliburton-agent-engineer-nba-draft-day-tumble-kings  &gt;”He could have gone six, I think, had he wanted to,” Givony said on the latest edition of the Lowe Post podcast with Zach Lowe. “But he was open to, ‘Let me sacrifice 7-8 million dollars because I think it’s going to work out in the long run for me in Sacramento.’”  &gt;”A lot of this was by design,” Givony said. “The consistent theme that I kept hearing in the pre-draft process was, “I hate the teams that are drafting in the top 10. I don’t want my guy with any of those franchises.' ”"
"That’s very wrong. No GM is going to draft a player that actively doesn’t want to be on the team, that’s just bad for both the player and the locker room.

Weapon of Mass Destruction for Tyrese Haliburton
Tyrese Haliburton earlier this season. Somehow ended up okay.
Sacramento doesn’t develop guys? Woah wtf is DeAaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton then
"They fired Vlade and replaced him with a Daryl Morey protege who drafted Tyrese Haliburton, so at least it looks like they're getting on the right track. No idea if they'll stay there, though. There's always the chance that Vivek does something stupid and trades the team's young talent for Ben Simmons."
De’Aaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton seem to be doing just fine at our dogshit organization 🤷‍♂️
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."

"Agreed. Thought about Murray and Christian Wood myself  PG Tyrese Haliburton   SG Jrue Holiday   SF Khris Middleton   PF Ben Simmons   C  Myles Turner   The smart play is probably to put Murray at one of the guard spots but I like the kid and think he would flourish with these players. I envision Simmons running the offense and defense ala Draymond while having better coverage on D from Turner and the Junkyard Dog, Jrue Holiday."

"Lol even Sac wouldnt do that trade. Buddy Hield has a pretty shit contract too, taking that and a Simmons max would be too much. I think centering a trade around just Hield makes more sense. Tyrese Haliburton can grow too with Hield gone."

Also we played Buddy, Tyrese &amp; Fox more than 30 mpg so we would just be replacing Buddy’s perimeter shooting w/ a great defensive guard who can help facilitate and drive to the basket.

1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De’aron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I’m pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.

"Three-way trade is more likely. Who's the loser here:  Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Harrison Barnes  * Matisse Thybulle  * 3 Sixers 1sts  Kings get:   * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum  * Tyrese Maxey   Sixers get their all nba PG to pair with Embiid. Lillard/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid is filthy. Easy yes to go all in  Blazers actually improve, in my opinion. Fox/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk plus Thybulle as a young stud off the bench, plus future picks, is pretty damn good and isn't a three-undersized-guards lineup  Kings get players to make the playoffs with. Davion/Haliburton/McCollum/Simmons/Holmes with Maxey, Buddy, Bagley, TT off the bench is a playoff team  Point is, I think there's something here."
i remember watching last year's draft and they had tyrese haliburton as the best player after the top 3 and he fell to 12 and look how he's done so far
I'd be willing to add a pretty serious draft pick for Barnes+Tyrese+filler (presumably Bagley). I'm super high on Haliburton though
Tyrese Haliburton confirmed 2021-22 MVP
Forget a nickname for Tatum. All I know is this “Tyrese ‘The Reason’ Haliburton”
"Didn't realize you were going by RPM here.  In any case just going down that list I'm still seeing names like Tyrese Haliburton, Dinwiddie, Herro, Dragic, etc. who all are very clearly NBA caliber and would command some sort of contract from basically any team in the NBA..."
"Lol you can't honestly say that NAW or Kira is worth less than a guy selected 24 - 30 in next years draft, NAW and Kira are way more of a sure thing while those late round picks most likely aren't contributors to an NBA team. Tyrese Haliburton is more valuable then any guys drafted in the 6 - 14 range because he's more of a sure thing, you know what you're getting out of him while you do not know what you're getting out these draft picks most of the time. Look at any draft, the majority of draftees turn out to be not that good, teams are more comfortable trading for a sure thing rather than a late round draft picks which going off history, is probably not going to be a contributor to your team for a long period of time."

"Player needs to be better than Rui. Thinking someone more in the realm of like Tyrese Haliburton, RJ Barrett or John Collins."
"Davion Mitchell, Deaaron fox, Tyrese Halliburton all are basically point guards. Seems weird. I don’t know enough about Haliburton (big fan of his game though from what I’ve seen), but I don’t think davion or deaaron can shoot offball"

"LeBron was consistently fantastic and often played as a secondary ball handler setting up dimes for the rest of the team, kind of like a super athletic Tyrese Haliburton.

"A bigger problem is that people don't understand how math models work. It isn't there to play I hope Klay is all-star levels of good again. It takes the previous season and figures out what's the chances of them performing like that.   They have Tyrese Haliburton as up and comer and Davion Mitchell as OK prospect. Tyrese is looking like a longer CP3 and Davion is a top 5 on ball defender already.   These things do not coincide with people's projections because math models do not take into consideration, ""I feel like this dude is gonna be good."""

I heard the Kings aren't trading Tyrese Haliburton
"I think in general there's just a lot more behind-the-scenes jockeying as it comes to roster construction. For example, a couple writers really raked the Hawks over the coals for drafting Onyeka Okongwu instead of Tyrese Haliburton, then it came out that Haliburton/his team didn't want him in ATL. 98% of those stories don't reach the public, but we as fans still wonder why x trade didn't happen or y signing never occurred."
"Hypothetical trade and something to build off, and I'm sure a 3rd team would love to get in on something like this.  Kings receive: Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton (Maxey if Paul forces it) 76ers receive: Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes &amp; Bagley (or picks)   Kings DeAron Fox (showtime with Ben), Tyrese Haliburton, ?, Ben Simmons, Holmes   76ers Maxey, Hield, Thybulle (or Barnes), Harris, Embiid  Mitchell, Curry, Green, Barnes, Niang, Drummond"
"&gt;Nephews are screaming that Bagley and Hield match up salary-wise but there's no way in hell the 76ers are taking such a shit return.  Exactly.        &gt;My choice in a Kings trade is Ben Simmons + filler for Haliburton, Barnes and TT.     Kings have stated that Tyrese is untouchable."
"Tyrese Haliburton gets the ball on a handoff near the 3 point line, Kawhis guarding him and pushes him back to the logo. This was his ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, since he realised how strong NBA players are"

"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
Tyrese Haliburton
tyrese haliburton. he'll be good but not great i think
This year the Kings didn't play the Lakers in May but 1 day before on April 30th the Kings beat the Lakers with Tyrese Haliburton scoring the most points by either team.
"Simmons value has completely plummeted. He was gonna get James Harden and now he can’t even get Tyrese Haliburton. PG had a bad series but if he went on the trade block that season, tons of teams would’ve wanted him."
"I understand not wanting to pay the high price Morey's asking right now (which is exactly what he should be doing incase one of the lower tier GMs tries to ""meet us in the middle"" and still overpay), but we're also not giving hi away for nothing either.  I'm sorry, but if Sac isn't willing to part with Tyrese Haliburton and picks, then there's no way this happens.  I understand Fox, but you have to be willing to give up something of value.  This isn't the Philadelphia fucking fire sale."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"Um, yes you should absolutely trade Haliburton for Simmons. Is everyone in this thread insane?  I can't believe the comments in this thread. Tyrese Haliburton is not even close to the level of Ben Simmons, despite how badly Ben shits the bed in the playoffs, he's still runner up DPOY and is obviously going to come out of the off season somewhat improved. Insanity."
Monte Mcnair is not trading Tyrese Haliburton nor Davion Mitchell he is not Vlade Divac God Bless 🙏🙏
"I think *ideally* for Philly, and **this is a longshot to happen** is a trade to the Raptors for OG and FVV.  Ben has a lot of faults, but the two things he can provide are ball-handling and defending the opponent's best player. Having both of those duties for 1 player is huge and to realistic replace those duties it'd require 2 players back. FVV and OG provide that.  A shittier version of that would be one of Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton and Harrison Barnes.   That's always been my issue with a CJ trade - Philly is going to kick and scream to get Robert Covington back too because if Ben's gone - who's going to defend the 3 on the 76ers? Old-ass Danny Green?"

"&gt; The Kings have a logjam at guard with Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Davion Mitchell and Buddy Hield  if only they weren't forced at gunpoint to keep drafting guards even though there were good non-guard prospects on the board and they already had good guards"
"It’s a necessary question when looking how things behind the scenes factor into player development. A point Jerry makes is Tyrese Haliburton would not have developed if he was drafted when Cousins was here because of how Boogie feasted on rookies, especially ones as nice as Haliburton."

"eh, we got a lot of work to do. bagley is benched and we lost the rebounding battle and play small all game. that'll be a problem all season. our offense turned into 1 on 1 hot garbage at the end of the 4th quarter. tyrese haliburton is struggling in his new role. fox can't get any calls."
"I don't know, it's year 4 of the rebuild. Sexton has to get paid next season, or traded before that. Garland has one more year on a cheap deal.

You're paying two guys who can't both play next to Mobley. You've got this thread talking about whether Okoro is a fucking starter while they question whether or not Sexton is a real long-term piece...but they drafted Okoro over Tyrese Haliburton, who's really fucking good because they already had Sexland.

"I think the challenge is that the drama stuff is way more universal and easier to talk about than game content. As a Thunder fan, I want to read and discuss game content about Thunder games and players but haven't watched enough of Talen Horton-Tucker to be able to discuss his play. As a Lakers fan, you probably want to read and discuss game content about the Lakers but probably don't have much to say about Darius Bazely.  However, when Kyrie Irving says the earth is flat, that's an easy discussion point to all of us because everyone on this forum knows who Kyrie is and is generally familiar with accepted cosmology. There's no barrier to entry to discussion.  We'd all love to *read* other people's analysis of how the Kings' defensive schemes don't properly utilize the talents of Tyrese Haliburton or whatever, but this content takes a significant amount of effort (research, film study, analytics code/spreadsheets, visualizations, etc) to *produce*. Any OC on this forum with the slightest modicum of effort and insight is instantly upvoted to the top, but you can't upvote what isn't there. I tried to write up a film study thing for /r/cfb earlier this season, but my god it takes *so. much. time* to produce something worthwhile.

"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"Some interesting things in these tweets   On Bey vs Green &gt; Its too early to tell, this is not a knock on S Bey at all but the All Rookie teams historically have been roughly sorted by ""minutes played as a rookie""  What’s the main thing you’ve learnt being inside a team vs outside?

"Hi I’ve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I’m not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that’s assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs— and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I’m expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he’s at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it’s been in like 10 years. Yeah, it’s not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we’ll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we’re gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go “wow we had no idea they were gonna be so good” I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Tyrese Haliburton is 5 years old, his birthday is on 29th February."
"Anthony Edwards, Isaiah Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, Tyrese Maxey, Xavier Tillman, Isaac Okoro  I’m not sure if what to expect from Poku this season, but I’m really rooting for him and hoping he makes a jump this season"

"Mitchell fits our timeline pretty well, which is just, Fox’s contract. Fox and Mitchell are nearly the same age, and Fox just signed his Max, Tyrese is turning 21. We don’t have much young talent really, some second rounders that are on two-ways (Quetta, Ramsey, Woodard) and we are trying to win now. Moody would’ve been a bad pick for us cause he’s not a true three and needs development and we are NOT known as a good development team. Mitchell is perfect for us really. If we can go forward for the next 5 seasons with Fox, HALIBURTON, Mitchell and Holmes then fill in around all that, we finally have some fucking consistency. If Bagley rounds out a little and wants to stay at a decent deal, he’d be a solid other young player at almost 23 himself."

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star.

That lineup down the stretch... What the hell  PG: Davion Mitchell  SG: Buddy Hield  SF: Tyrese Haliburton  PF: Maurice Harkless  C: Damian Jones  &amp;#x200B;  The Alvin Gentry experience is changing things up
"I think he's untouchable because they're treating a Haliburton/Holmes pairing as core to the team. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I think this says as much about how they see Tyrese as it does Holmes."
"The actual text  &gt; The last thing we heard regarding the Kings’ interest in Simmons was that they weren’t willing to part ways with De’Aaron Fox or Tyrese Haliburton for Simmons, which is a reasonable line for Monte McNair to draw even in light of the two guards’ struggles. But beyond Fox, Haliburton and maybe Richaun Holmes, no one one should be off the table in negotiations for Simmons.  This is a misleading headline"
I’m a huge Warriors fan but consider myself a Kings fan on the side. It’s like rooting for NorCal’s little bro. I hope they pull it together. Tyrese Haliburton is a joy to watch. I hope they rebuild around him. The team has too many guards and lacks cohesion. A ton of talent though.

Every time I questioned one of his decisions I ended up being wrong and he ended up being right (except for drafting Deni over Tyrese Haliburton, that one I knew was a huge mistake on the day of the draft and was kinda salty he picked Deni cause I didn't like him at all and was a huge Tyrese fan)"

"The recent report out of Philly was a pretty good indicator of why nothing's going to happen until they lower their standards.  &gt;[Amick] A source with knowledge of the list said there are approx 30 players who would satisfy the 76ers in a Simmons swap, &amp; there’s an internal belief that a fair amount of them —let’s say 5 to 10— could become available in the next year or 2. “This is like a multi-year thing” a Sixers source said  That was released in a ""see we're not being unrealistic and actually have a very open mind"" sort of way.   When you actually think about what that means, it's a 30 team league so Philadelphia is essentially asking for the best or second-best player from a decent team, with bad teams not even having a player who qualifies.

We're not counting centers (Jokic, Towns, Davis, Bam) because of their fit next to Embiid.   We're not counting rookies because apparently the timeline of rookies like Cade Cunningham ""would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.""

"He is the emotional leader of the team, imo. He is underrated unless you have watched him. He doesn’t put up big numbers or highlight reel dunks very often, but he is so good for the team. Still quite young and learning, too. He is just so fun to watch.  It is no coincidence that Tyrese Haliburton spells Lottery Snub.  He is honestly the best thing that has happened to the Kings since their glory days."

"Just have to be careful with that one - it was against the Kings. The Kings defense improved a bit from last year, but it was one of the worst defenses in NBA history last year so it's hard not to go up. They're still not great. He was also getting switched onto by our guys at the 4 &amp; 5 all night, and otherwise being primarily defended not by Davion Mitchell, but by Tyrese Haliburton who's one of our worst on-ball defenders, or by Fox who has a proclivity to let guys do whatever they want on screens.  That said, he looked really damn good. He was cooking from 3, no matter how much our announcers wanted to speak bad shooting into existence by mentioning his poor career numbers. He made some great passes and drives against big &amp; small alike. He got some hops and good timing for boards.  The biggest issue I saw for him was actually when he had a small, quick defender up in his grill in iso. Fox picked him twice and Mitchell once I think, and generally any time he couldn't get a screen with Fox or Mitchell guarding him he just had to give it up to a teammate. Which is kinda surprising, but those dudes are pretty damn strong for their size."
tyrese? maxey or haliburton?
"Are you getting hate responses in DM or something? Lol nobody even responded aggressively or anything  To answer though yeah we have more talent this year than we have in a while, probably since we have cousins/gay/rondo  Fox (bad season so far), flamethrowa Buddy hield, advanced stat darling Richaun Holmes, smooth and steady Harrison Barnes, future inside the nba member Tyrese Haliburton, thicc boi Davion Mitchell, and seen flashes of talent from bench pieces like Terence Davis or Len  Nothing that’s gonna blow you away or anything but a couple potential All-stars on there, and some depth.

"I don't think aibwykat's comment was a straw man, though it may have been unclear.  Are the Kings' parts truly even a good product? Up until the last couple of drafts, they were really only riding on Fox, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy. They've had Richaun Holmes, Bjelica, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. They finally hit with Tyrese Haliburton and now Davion Mitchell. But tell me how a roster with those players as the core is supposed to keep up with the other Western juggernauts. Their incredibly lackluster drafting for more than a decade now (with pretty much only Fox and Cousins as hits) and their mishandling of draft assets (see the Stauskas trade) are out of Walton's hands. The best coaches in the NBA may have dragged these rosters to a low playoff seed a few times but they've been devoid of talent for a while.  That said, I agree that Luke should have been fired long ago."
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr.

"I mean outside of LaMelo (who is clearly the best) and Edwards (who is clearly the 2nd best), he could reasonably end up in 3rd.   Currently, he's competing for that 3rd place spot with Cole Anthony, Tyrese Haliburton, and Desmond Bane (Patrick Williams would be up there too but he's hurt)"

Sure would be nice to have Tyrese Haliburton rn....christ.
Tyrese Haliburton was right there. Can’t believe the Suns passed on him. Would’ve been able to move on from CP3 and sign another star.
Daily reminder that the Phoenix Suns drafted Jalen Smith over Tyrese Haliburton
"Why are you acting like you know what you’re talking about? Whiteside made the veteran minimum from us last year and this year he’s making the same from a team that had the best record in the league last season. We didn’t overpay him.   We also have multiple 3pt shooters in Tyrese Haliburton (41% last season) and Barnes (39% last season) to go with Buddy.   If you want to say “I’m not gonna bother paying attention to the Kings until they finally make the playoffs,” I can understand that. But you’re just making shit up because you know most /r/nba users also don’t pay attention to the Kings and won’t call out your bullshit."
