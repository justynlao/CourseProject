Jamorko Pickett. Nevada State.
"summer league is killing me lol. i just got into a heated argument with a guy who insisted we should wave hamidou diallo, who averaged double figures on good efficiency going into his 4th year, for a guy named jamorko pickett who scored 16 points in one SL game. he called me stupid. thanks for letting me vent lol"
He signed a guy named Jamorko Pickett to a one-year minimum deal. Underrated signing. Just because he's not a great basketball player doesn't mean his name isn't Jamorko Pickett.
"I’m not giving up on Killian. Think he’ll have enough shooting around him to let that passing shine this year. Could be a dog on defense too.  Deeper cut is Jamorko Pickett. Good size, decent shooter, been getting rave reviews as a communicator on defense. Might be tough for him to find consistent minutes with Grant and Bey ahead of him, presumably Lyles and potentially Olynyk getting some minutes at the 4. Not to mention Livers. Lots of potential roadblocks but if he gets a chance I think he can stick"
"OK, send them Grant, Isiah livers, Jamorko Pickett, and one of crap 2nd round picks and you got a deal."
Don’t sleep on the Armoni Brooks vs. Jamorko Pickett (yes this is an actual NBA player) matchup
"Nice list OP!  While not current NBA players, I found this interesting.  Only 10 players in the NBA played in high school in Maine.  All 10 were from the same high school, Maine Central Institute.  Sam Cassell, Caron Butler, Cutino Mobley, and Brad Miller came from that high school.  Since others asked, here's current players who played high school ball in D.C. (in alphabetical order):  Saddiq Bey  Luka Garza  Josh Hart  Jamorko Pickett"
