"Sorry man didn't mean to sound condescending . It's just I mentioned him in the previous post . I haven't been up on the high school prospects I usually try to stay on top on that . I should start reading slam again found that kept me in loop . Ya these next few drafts are stacked man . Interested to see how this year's plays out . I think Jalen green is being slept on cuz he went to the g league seems like that moves helped kumingas stock more than anyone. Late lottery guys like Scottie Barnes look solid. Wonder the next big deal is when LeBron hangs it up . Seems like doncic , it sounds like emoni  Bates is the next generational talent from north America."

I had him #1 on my board and he's surprised even me. Really want to see Scottie Barnes to the Bulls next.
They should go for Scottie Barnes in the draft
"If the Dubs start winning, they need to slow their roll a bit. See if they can get two top-15 picks. They can make the playoffs, then fine-tune their positioning a bit. Get a top-10 and a top-15 player, you have the foundation for the future (Wiseman, Wiggins, Pascall, two lottery picks in a great draft, or take both and package them to move up for their guy like Jalen Suggs if he slipped a bit or whatever).   If Minnesota can somehow manage a pick from 4-9 or so, this draft will be lit for the Dubs, they will have a solid block of young talent. The Athletic had GS with the 7th and 15th picks, seems about right, snagging a stud wing in Scottie Barnes and then arguably the best defensive player in the draft at 15 in Usman Garuba (6-8, F/C). Obviously who knows who they will get, but they are exceedingly well-positioned.  Oh, and I am forgetting Nico. IDK man, that kid was projected to be a top-10 pick, had a meh first season at Arizona, but that kid is a year younger than he was supposed to be when drafted (graduated HS early and reclassified), and playing with Steph, feel like he might learn enough to breakout like Draymond. Or maybe I just like how he plays, just watching him, I feel like he could definitely start in the league one day."
"You can’t go wrong with top 7 IMO. I’d take each of them over any of the top prospects in 2020.  Cade, jalen Suggs, jalen green, jalen Johnson, kuminga, mobley, Scottie barnes."

"Only doing that if we get a top 3 pick. Then I’d trade Pascal and go forward with one of Suggs/Cade/Green and pick up Scottie Barnes instead of Kuminga with the Warriors pick. Would consider also moving FVV to the Knicks for their FRP pick and Noel + filler and/or Lowry to LAL for their pick, Dennis and KCP/Harrell. THT has played too of a role to give up it seems   We would suck again next year but it would be all young players with upside."
"We'll see how it looks when we learn where the pick ends. up. Its a 50% to be either 7 or 8, and about 10% to finish in the top 5 and convey. The trade looks a lot less lopsided When ""top 3 protected pick"" becomes ""Warriors get Scottie Barnes out the deal"""
"I still do not see any comp to Dray in there, closes prospects to dray are Usman Garuba and Scottie Barnes."
Scottie Barnes
"Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, Evan Mobley.  Davion Mitchell, Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, Isaiah Jackson.  Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, Kai Jones."
It’s top 4 protected. Best your gonna get is Kuminga or Scottie Barnes. What you gonna do when we keep our pick?
"The Thunder planned this horribly; they're tanking in a season where there are multiple other teams tanking just as 'effectively' as they are.  Even with how dreadfully awful they have been for the last 25 games, they might end up with the 6th pick in the draft and miss out on both Cunningham and Green.  I don't think people are really going to be rising up out of their seats excitedly when Oklahoma City ends up with Scottie Barnes or Moses Moody."

If the Cavs draft a versatile defender like Scottie Barnes to pair with Sexton and Garland that could be a nasty perimeter D very soon.
Probably true. But a lot of guys play the poor man’s Magic role as big playmakers. I even saw a draft comp for Scottie Barnes (top 5-10 prospect) as a “poor man’s Magic” recently.
"The numbers may not say so, but Scottie Barnes is one of the most talented players in this year’s draft class and is definitely one of the more underrated players too."
I hear Scottie Barnes is a PF with defensive potential but can't shoot and I am beyond fearful.  We need the first pick because Cade is so undeniable that I fear we leap for the fences and pick a high upside high bust guy instead.  We already have 2 PFs we Chuma and Isaac.  A third might break me in unprecedented ways.
"I feel like the fact that he even has to guard guys like Ingles is more so a Spurs problem than a Murray problem ( though I do agree he is overrated on defense to an extent) . Y’all don’t have the same Wing and forward defenders that you had before with guys like Green, Leonard, Diaw, Anderson, Bowen etc. it’s leading to a lot of your guards playing up a position. But at the same time the Spurs have a top 10 defense this season which I feel doesn’t show the truth about their defense but the stats don’t lie.   I would say white is the best perimeter defender on that Spurs team instead of Murray just due to his ability to switch, be a help defender, and effectively guard iso and the PnR. Murray does have his moments but from the games I watch he does a lot of weird shit like; over pressuring dudes in the half court, going over on guys who predominantly want to drive and just gambling too much. If he stopped all the unnecessary stuff I think he’d still in consideration for all defense but I digress.  I’m going to go on a random tangent that you probably don’t care about but I think the Spurs should get Scottie barnes out of Florida state if they can. He can’t shoot for shit which is a big problem and his offense may not translate depending on what system he’s in, but his defensive versatility and impact on that side of the court is definitely something I could see Pop maximizing"
"This is pretty wild. I like Barnes, but the top 5 is pretty set. I’d go:  1. Cade  2. Mobley  3. Suggs  4. Green  5. Kuminga   6. Keon Johnson  7. Josh Giddey  8. Scottie Barnes  9. Franz Wagner  10. Kai Jones  I do like BJ Boston though."
"Scottie is the ace. He's different. What people don't like to be is Kenny Smith in convos like you a jag. Kenny Smith wasn't a JAG but when you up there with Chuck and Shaq, it seems like that in terms of your playing career. A lot of men don't want to be Kenny or Perk. It's an ego thing. Jalen is cool with it. Matt Barnes knows he's a role player but someone like S-Jax, he gotta feel like the man."

might as well and keep scottie barnes in florida
"I'm hoping Allen and Okoro can help get their defense up to par.   Maybe they could get a guy like Kuminga, Scottie Barnes, or Kai Jones in the draft to develop into a good defender at the 4 and let SexLand run the offense."
jalen johnson or Scottie Barnes
"if Steph and Klay are healthy they have a great chance. that's the two greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen. they always have a chance. James Wiseman and Jordan Poole should be much improved as well, not saying they're gonna be all-stars but they should be solid contributors. Andrew Wiggins is much better suited to being a third option, and Kelly Oubre is much better suited to a 6th man role if they decide to resign him. the Dubs 2nd round pick from this year Justinian Jessup is doing really well in the Australian league averaging 15 ppg and shooting 40% from 3 on high volume, he'll be coming over next season and could be a decent bench player.   all that said the Dubs can potentially have two lottery picks to add to the bench as well. if they added a backup wing and backup pg in the lotto like Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell they could have a deep bench."
Are we really gonna do this? Can’t we just get Scottie Barnes in peace and let Brodie tear up the play-ins
"Barring a direction change based on the new ownership, the team seems to be barreling forward with KAT + Russell as their foundation of the future. That is in part why they took Ant Man #1 over LaMelo--too much overlap between LaMelo and Russell.   With that in mind, the top picks in this draft mostly seem to present the same issue once you add Ant Man to the mix.   With all that said, wouldn't it behoove the Wolves to look at trading back to add some more immediate punch to their team? There's going to be a rebuilding team or two that desperately needs some foundational talent and is going to get unlucky in the lottery, if the Wolves could trade back to 5th-8th they could nab someone like Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, or Corey Kispert that would pair great with the core they already have.  Here's three potential deals I could see  A package involving Al Horford + #5  Larry Nance Jr. + #6  Marvin Bagley  + #7  These all help the Wolves get more veteran help to be more competitive in the next year (when they'll owe their pick unprotected) while still drafting a high level talent that better compliments the core they already have invested in."

If you guys get Cade I could see you guys making a huge jump.   Which is why the wolves will probably draft Scottie Barnes or some shit lol
"I wasn't aware of this. I personally find her figure flattering and pleasant to look at.  I know that isn't her intention as a sports journalist but it is also the reality of being on tv, that you'll be evaluated.  To be far I also prefer Shannon Sharpe's physique over someone like Skip Bayless or Stephen A.  Smith, or Matt Barnes over Paul Pierce.  Richard Jefferson is the most kissable.  I'd hold hands and talk with hours with Scottie Pippen."
"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
"If we get a Top 4 pick, I'd be ecstatic with any of the top 5 players in this draft (Cade/Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga).  If we end up more in the 6-10 range, I like Scottie Barnes, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody or even Jalen Johnson.  I like Kai Jones and Usman Garuba as projects, but I'd only take them if we're trading down into the 11-20 range."
Scottie Barnes going to make some GM look bad in 5 years.
Scottie Barnes is [projected](https://www.nbadraft.net/nba-mock-drafts/) as going 6th overall
"Alperen Sengun is a probable lotto pick no one has heard of, but he could a beast in this league. Usman Garuba could go in the lotto too, and he’s been amazing in Spain.    Daishen Nix, Jared Butler, Scottie Barnes and Chris Duarte will be the steals of this draft. But it’s filled with talent from top to bottom."
"3 yrs max, stretch 5 for Fox, no need overpay Holmes. Find wing defender like PWill in this draft and Kings have 4 young cores under 25yo. Kings around 10th pick, looks good replacing old Barnes with young (Scottie) Barnes"

Raptors fan checking in.  Ben has some offensive struggles from time to time.  But I would LOVE him on my team and I sit here watching Scottie Barnes highlights in my spare time wishing the Raptors draft him and he becomes like Ben Simmons.  So he’s not really overrated no.
Winning is bad. This team is devoid of top end talent outside of shai. Scottie Barnes here we go I guess
"They still are bad enough to be a lottery team, a guy like Scottie Barnes/ Kessler Edwards would be a good fit"

"Scottie Barnes. A 6'9 ""PG"" that can guard 4/5. He's gonna absolutely kill it if he can develop a shot."
Scottie Barnes is another lottery pick this upcoming draft
"Suggs too. Along with the guys you mentioned are seen as ""can't miss"" guys. Kuminga has lost a little shine recently, he struggled shooting in the bubble, but he will probably put up a strong showing in pre-draft combine/workouts. I'd be surprised if any of the guys in the Scottie Barnes, Moses Moody, Jalen Johnson tier jumped him."
"Suggs is in play top 5 two, and there are a couple more really good prospects in Jalen Johnson and Scottie Barnes, so things don't hit a sharp drop off until after the top 7 (in my opinion, obviously)."

"Just draft Scottie Barnes. Nickname him ""bucky"" and give him a robotic arm that can hit free throws and a few threes.  Trade Simmons to Disney for the money you need to get Harden next time he's a free agent."
"Kuminga is a super athlete with handles and All-NBA Defensive 1st team capabilities.  I like him more than most people, but Kuminga is way more valuable than Scottie Barnes.  Kuminga is probably going to guard the other team's best player 1-4.  I like to think that he will be a 6'8 Lu Dort.  Kuminga might have a questionable shot, but his ability to dribble and play D should make up for it. He might also be the best athlete in the draft."
"Sorry I just woke up. Keon Johnson is a guy at the very beginning of the college season were saying was flying high under the radar until mocks started catching up. He's the type where eye test &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his superficial stats. His upside is extremely high. Let me explain the love for Keon:  1) He's arguably the best defensive SG prospect in the draft (maybe only Moody is better) and even though he's 6'5, he has a 6'8 wingspan.  2) Although his shooting splits were bad, he has a very mechanically sound jumper and college shooting is notoriously small sample size for a variable that requires a very high sample size for confidence  3) He has a really strong IQ for off-ball movement, his off-ball cutting is elite.  4) He's amazing at drawing fouls and getting to the line - 40% FT/FA rate. Combined with a tight handle, elite athleticism, and a solid FG% at the rim makes him very projectable as a guy who will be able to get to the rim in the NBA.  5) Both him and Jaden Springer are both SGs - so play finishing wasn't really overly productive at Tennessee due to a lack of playmaking  So you have a guy who is a great defender, can handle well, is great at getting to the basket whether that's through FTs or getting around his man, and the only real flaw is he shot terribly in college which ruined his production numbers, but there's nothing real mechanically wrong or shot that needs to be re-worked. Additionally, pretty much all other alternatives are equally as flawed or moreso - Scottie Barnes doesnt have a jumper, Jalen Johnson terribly underperformed in pretty much all aspects, Davion Mitchell and Bouknight are already older and behind on the NBA development curve, etc."

"I think they will probably trade it.  If not, Franz Wagner, Josh Giddey, and Scottie Barnes are probably good fits in their offensive system, although Barnes may be redundant with Draymond - I'm not big on drafting for fit, but non-shooters genuinely have problems fitting together."
"When it comes to actual Basketball analysis and insight:  Overrated: Skip, Stephen A, Jay Williams, Perk, Max Kellerman, Nick Wright, Cowherd.   Underrated:  Broussard, Matt Barnes \[tide is turning on that one now though\], Scottie Pippen, T-Mac, Eddie House.   The above list though with the exception of Nick Wright are excellent speakers and entertainers though at the least which explains how they're in the gig.   How that Squidward-lite blowhard that sounds like a constipated Sealion gets any time on the air truly is a mystery though, fuck all insight/knowledge past lazy narratives and as entertaining to watch as paint dry."
"I can guarantee that if the Warriors get the 6th pick they will not pick Keon, Bouknight I could see as he could work as a secondary playmaker much like Jordan Poole and he’s more mature, Scottie Barnes would be a more realistic pick."
Scottie Barnes should go 6th

"They already have Wiseman.  Honestly, the Warriors did the righ thing tanking in 2019-2020 and trading D'Lo for Wiggins and the T'Wolves draft pick. They will likely get another highnpick in this deep 2021 draft class.  A Jalen Suggs or Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes."
"I agree with this but am also unnaturally high on Scottie Barnes. While having 3 non shooters on the court could be problematic (Okoro, Scottie, Jarrett Allen), the defensive potential of those 3 is insane and too good to pass up in my opinion"
"Mock Draft [Week #22](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n93uxd/mock_draft_monday_game_thread_index/gxlw0cg/) - Lottery simmed on tankathon based on current record, and flipped a coin for play-in games (I obviously don't expect these teams to all be lottery teams, the exercise is to track the changes week by week as records change)  1) Houston - Cade Cunningham - PG - OK St  2) Orlando (+1) - Jalen Green - SG - G-League  3) Oklahoma City (+2) - Evan Mobley - C - USC  4) New Orleans (+4) - Jalen Suggs - G - Gonzaga  5) Detroit (-3) - Jon Kuminga - F - G-League  6) Cleveland (-2) - Scottie Barnes - F - FSU  7) Golden State (from MIN) (-1) - Keon Johnson - SG - Tenn  8) Toronto - Moses Moody - G/F - Arkansas  9) Sacramento - Jalen Johnson - F - Duke  10) Orlando (from CHI) - Corey Kispert - SF - Gonzaga  11) Charlotte - Alperen Sengun - C - Turkey  12) San Antonio - Franz Wagner - F - Michigan  13) Indiana - Davion Mitchell - G - Baylor  14) Memphis - James Bouknight - SG - UConn  15) Washington - Jared Butler - G - Baylor  16) Boston - Kai Jones - PF/C - Texas  17) Golden State - Josh Giddey - PG - Australia  18) Oklahoma City (from MIA) - Ziaire Williams - SF - Stanford  19) New York - Jaden Springer - G - Tenn  20) Atlanta - Cam Thomas - SG - LSU  21) New York (from DAL) - Isaiah Jackson - C - Kentucky  22) Houston (from POR) - Greg Brown - PF - Texas  23) LA Lakers - Usman Garuba - PF/C - Spain  24) Houston (from MIL) - Chris Duarte - G/F - Oregon  25) LA Clippers - Tre Mann - PG - G-League  26) Denver - BJ Boston - G/F - Kentucky  27) Brooklyn - Ayo Dosunmu - G - Illinois  28) Philadelphia - Day'Ron Sharpe - C -  UNC  29) Phoenix - Sharife Cooper - PG - Auburn  30) Utah - Daishen Nix - PG - G-League"
"Some Warriors fans on the sub are pretty high on Scottie Barnes if the Minny pick conveys this year in the 6-8 range (which is pretty likely, since the Wolves kept winning).   And yeah, Jessup's name is kinda funny. It has a nice ring to it in a certain way. He's playing in the NBL, but I think we might bring him over for next season?"
Depends on who we draft in the top 5. If we get cade suggs Mobley or kuminga I would love to pair moody or bouknight with them. With jalen green pairing scottie barnes with him would be cool or maybe a shooter like krispert.
"Id have to say Shaq.  Its geuninely hard enough to just find a guy who can match his measurements without factoring the athleticism factor. At least with Lebron there are a number of guys who are around his height and weight and are even mobile and athletic, even guys like Jonathan Kuminga and Scottie Barnes in this draft are comparable if you just look at their bodies. They are just *nowhere* near as skilled and coordinated as Lebron, but if you were to put Luka Doncic's skills into one of their bodies you'd end up with a Lebron like player. While I think that should count as being a freak of nature, for the purpose of your comparision it doesn't count.  Same thing with Giannis. There are other near 7 foot lanky freaks in the league, the difference is he worked insanely hard on his body and improved his skillset massivley to become a player archetype that has never been seen before. But he didn't come into the league as a chiseled 7 footer.  Shaq is just so absurdly big and strong. Its unbelievable that a guy his height and weight posessed that much agility and coordination, the dude would dance like a 5'5 breakdancer despite being 7-1 and pushing 400 pounds. On top of that he avoided major injury and had an 18 year career playing 1421 games (regular season and playoffs) which is unheard of for players his size"
Scottie Barnes does?
"Reasoning:   1. Cunningham is the surefire guy of this draft. You could argue other guys have more upside, but nobody has a higher floor. Cade will be an NBA starter, it's just a question of whether he'd be a third option, second option, or first option on a contender.  2. Green is the type of hyperathletic scoring guard that teams crave. He's the most likely in this draft to become the first option on a contender, in my opinion. He fits well with the Rockets rebuild, forming a dynamic duo with KPJ in the backcourt.  3. Mobley is a fascinating prospect who brings great perimeter skills in a big man's body. His post offense is worrying, and his lack of a shot is too, but his perimeter defense and driving ability as a seven footer make him a unicorn, even if those other skills don't develop.  4. Suggs is the purest PG in the draft, a classic ball handler who projects to do everything right, even if he lacks any one exceptional gift. He's a sizable point guard with no holes in his game. A very safe pick with long term upside. This guy might be Toronto's starting point guard for the next fifteen years.  5. Barnes fits that Patrick Williams mold, and if Williams can go 4th off the Seminoles bench, Barnes can do it as their most important player. He's a big, high motor wing who can lock down guards and has shown potential at the other end. Even if he doesn't develop his shot, he'll be a valuable wing for years to come.  6. Kuminga has the body, he has the athleticism, but his basketball IQ is horrible. He showed flashes of ball handling, shot creation, passing, and mid-range shooting, but his only positive talent right now is getting to the rim from a midrange spot. He's the definition of a boom or bust project pick, but his boom is big enough that he's worth betting on by a rebuilding team, similar to Poku last year.  7. Wagner here is probably going to be controversial. In my defense, John Hollinger at The Athletic and Deanondraft both agree with me. He's a big wing who can guard 1-4 and projects to be very above average at it in the NBA, rebounds well, passes surprisingly well (&gt;2:1 AST:TO), slashes well, and shoots FTs at an elite level for a 19yo, let alone a 6'9 forward. He projects to be a Kelly Oubre type with less hops and finishing ability, but more shooting and passing. He'll be a valuable player from day 1 as a teenager at a premium position, and has all the tools to become an exceedingly solid wing, if probably not ever an all star due to his lack of elite quick twitch muscle. As a final point, if you want to bring up his last game (where he wasn't great), I'll remind you he also outplayed Scottie Barnes in their March Madness matchup.  8. Moody is the most likely guy in this draft to become a plus 3&amp;D wing for the next fifteen years. Lots of Warriors fans want him, but I simply don't see him having the upside of Wagner. He slides into the Orlando roster, providing needed spacing and defense.  9. Johnson has a lot of question marks, but when he has it all together, he puts up crazy numbers. He can do it all. His shot may be questionable but he shows promise. He's the second biggest boom or bust prospect after Kuminga, in my opinion, and Sacramento needs to swing for the fences to get out of their current purgatory.  10. Bouknight has been flying up mock drafts, and I think he's a good pick, but a little overrated at this point. He has some major flaws despite his highlight play athleticism. His ball handling, shooting, and defense all need more work than I think most people recognize.  11. Keon is similar to Bouknight: some very promising signs at the shooting guard position, but a whole bunch of question marks as well. Not too much to say here, just a guy drafted for his potential.  12. Sengun has promise - Hollinger would say I have him way too low - and I get it: he's putting up good numbers in a really good league as a teenager, and such guys rarely fail in the NBA. However, he's a tweener, neither a PF nor a C, and he lacks the shooting that would cover for his deficiencies at either position. He could put it together and be a valuable big man, but he might end up getting run off the floor, too.  13. Giddey is another boom or bust guy, a huge point guard who can pass like crazy, but lacks the shooting or defense requisite for the position. He's young as hell, so it all comes down to a team's deep scouting on him. Can they fix his obvious flaws? If he develops right, he could end up being an amazing player. But that seems to be a long way off. A team like the Pacers, in that 8th seed purgatory, needs to take a gamble to get out, similar to the Nuggets with MPJ.  14. Kispert projects to be the best shooter in this draft, and his defense is actually pretty good. Was in the 25th percentile for lateral movement at the combine, FYI - I definitely had some bias against his defensive skills, picturing him as a lumbering (white) player. But he has the size and strength and shooting skill to be an elite floor spacer, and can drive better than you might imagine. There are questions around his shooting stroke being effective against NBA defense, but in all likelihood he'll be a good-if-not-great 3&amp;D player right out of the gate.   No Davion Mitchell, you ask? Yeah. I'm incredibly low on him. His FT% has declined each season in college. His first two collegiate seasons he shot about 30% from deep, then happened to shoot 45% his last year, without a corresponding increase to 2pt% or FT% - that's the definition of an outlier. Yeah he plays good defense, but his 6'0 height limits him on that end. At best he'll be a smaller Marcus Smart, which is wonderful, but very limited. And I don't think he gets to that level."

But how else can I get people excited on Scottie Barnes?  (I love Scottie but I agree with OP's point)
"&gt; The very fact you have a 5 who is capable of playmaking out of the low post is a beauty in the modern nba.   It's really not that rare of a skill anymore, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson, Mobley, Prkacin, Wagner, pretty much all the bigs of note in this class can facilitate out of the post.   The notable value point is when you can use those guys as actual primary or secondary playmakers, which is where a guy like Scottie Barnes separates himself.   Even after the Barnes tier, I'd take Prkacin, Mobley, and Jalen Johnson as guys who could develop into 2ndary playmakers before Sengun."
"Scottie Barnes is gonna be a stud, he would be a good fit on the Magic."
I for one think they should take Kuminga.  Or Scottie Barnes.
"how many teams would want an entire stash of draft picks? coz if the goal is now, they're gonna send all future picks (like what Milwaukee did).  who are the tanking teams anyway? for starters, if they'll give the moon to Dame, they'll get him for sure.. who else are available? Only Shai and Dort are win-now players. Probably Kenny Hustle as well.  Kemba is their best trade asset to get a superstar to match salaries.  Bazley and Poku are their best young asset right now  6th pick/Scottie Barnes would be a great future as well.  Other assets are Roby, Theo, Ty, and Deck.  ------------------  First they should do is trade Kemba for a positive asset. The best one I can see is KAT but I don't think they'll trade KAT now that they have a chance to compete once healthy. Other teams to look out for are of course Rockets, Cavaliers, King, and Spurs"

I’m afraid Scottie Barnes is gonna be the next MKG. I hope to god he isn’t for whoever takes him
Why a Westbrook comp of all things?  Suggs is a lot closer to prime George Hill/Malcolm Brogdon/Marcus Smart athletically than Westbrook.  Idk I just don’t see Suggs being a top 7-8 player in the league but it’s not impossible.  Kuminga and Scottie Barnes could also be superstars eventually.
scottie barnes baby

"I love Scottie Barnes. But 3 is way too high for him  This mock is certainly bold, lol"
"Ufff, this is the smart answer, and you are right. Team would still get smashed for a year or two, and you luck into a good scorers in those drafts.   If you can identify a high IQ versatile defender and passer, you take them.   This is why Scottie Barnes is so high up the list this year."
"If Scottie Barnes goes #3 overall, I will delete my account. Not kidding."
He’s my Scottie Barnes projection
"SGA and Dort will be better, but you have to keep in mind who else will get heavy minutes next year.   -	The Thunder currently have 5 draft picks in this draft (likely consolidate to 3 or 4 by draft day). This will probably result in drafting 3 first rounders this year. Rookies VERY rarely play good defense/winning basketball. -	Poku, while hopefully improved, likely won’t contribute to winning basketball for another year or two.  -	Bazley is still a pretty big question mark.  -	There is currently no center on the roster.   So despite Shia and Dort being a little better next year, I think giving Bazley, Poku, Scottie Barnes, Kai Jones, and Ziaire Williams (just throwing out potential draft picks) all significant minutes will bring this team WAY down next year. I really don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility that this team is worse next year than they were this past year (when Shai was healthy) due to all the “developmental” minutes going around. As long as there’s no major shakeups to the roster, I think this team is back around the 5th or 6th worst record next year (even with Shai healthy all year)."
"Maybe not, Scottie Barnes is definitely a more attractive gamble than 3 years of Simmons on a max but who’s the other player? Kuminga?"
Sleeping on Scottie Barnes 💤
"&gt; Western Conference executive 1: He has it. He surveys the game for the first 15, 20 minutes, then says “what do we need?” And he does it. He’s Scottie Barnes (Florida State’s forward, expected to go high in the Lottery) with a jump shot. That’s my problem with Scottie. (Cunningham)’s Jayson Tatum. Same size. Can score from anywhere on the court.  Strong endorsement."
"Who are you talking about as 5, Kuminga? You think Scottie Barnes is that far below Kuminga? 5&amp;6 are just not further apart then 6&amp;16, that’s insane. And if you think we would even trade SGA for Cade straight up, you haven’t watched enough SGA lately.   Talk about screwing Cleveland, in the scenario I proposed OKC is giving up pick 6, 16, 4 future firsts, Theo Maledon , AND Darius Bazley for literally just the #1."
"So how do y’all view your team right now - like, do you not necessarily see a lineup of Sexton, Garland and Okoro at 1,2,&amp;3 as working long term? If those are a good starting three, would Cleveland not be interested in an immediate impact, long 4 in Scottie Barnes? Does an extra first thrown in mean anything?"
"Agreed; I think a lot of the top 6-10 teams in the draft are hoping they can get Scottie Barnes instead of Ben Simmons at a $33M price tag, but once that domino falls, their phones should be ringing off the hook. A lot of small markets with defensive woes and lack of playmaking (hi Sacramento) will be calling"

Scottie Barnes all the way. Kuminga was a let down in the G League. I won’t be surprised if Orlando passes on Kuminga despite all his physical upside.

Just need to know where they have Scottie Barnes
"Barnes and Siakam are def not similar coming into the league. Nobody really knows what Siakam can develop into or what his floor might be. If there’s a guy in this draft you wanna compare to Siakam as a raw prospect with high motor it’s JT Thor.  Scottie Barnes is not a raw prospect, he has a higher floor, is your modern 4 that can guard multiple position and actually has good handle to dribble drive and make plays for others with pretty good vision and high passing iq. There some Draymond Green and Giannis Antetokoumnpo to his game in that regard"
Scottie Barnes and Jonathan Kuminga both read to me as Raptors type forwards but they seem to be pretty top heavy at both positions as is. I think if he were to fall to them best case scenario is Suggs. I think they’ll just ride Lowry and Vanvleet out and eventually transition into a Suggs - Trent Jr backcourt when they’re ready.
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
"&gt; we don’t have to pick  Scottie Barnes will be great. That said, I wouldn't pick him at 4th either. But if he was still there at 7, he's a very obvious pickup."
True. At least we don’t have to pick Scottie Barnes.
"Probably Mobley, but Scottie Barnes has some real Dan Gilbert energy."
I’ll take what seems to be Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes over Nikola Vucevic
"The draft is a 4-5 player class with the best prospects being Cade, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs, and Jonathan Kuminga/Scottie Barnes.  I believe Cade is 1A, and Jalen Green is 1B. This draft has a lot of wings + premier role players in the back end of the draft, and surplus of vertastile bigs. But if you watch Beal/Lavine/Brandon Roy, you can see a lot of similarities in his game. Super advanced scoring feel, his athleticism also takes him over the top, dude just glides when he finishes.  The dude scoring is just effortless, and he averaged 17.9 PPG against grown professional G-League players at 19.      [The man is just money, look at him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8YWVkr8D6w&amp;ab_channel=CPH2K)"
"Well by that logic you could say Scottie Barnes is generational if he had KD’s scoring lol. I do get your point, I just don’t think Green is ever more than a pure scorer.  6’6 with 6’7 wingspan isn’t good at all btw."
"Zero depth if they have to give up the pick (probably a rotation player from the outset), Wiseman and Wiggins. They have $170 million committed without resigning Oubre. I'd rather have Wiggins + Wiseman + Davion Mitchell or Scottie Barnes than Siakam and some minimum guys filling out the top 8 rotation."
"Hali and 9 to trade up for Scottie Barnes, sounds just like a Vlade move"
Y’all should take Scottie Barnes
Just pick scottie barnes and be on your way if the best youre gonna get is pascal siakam in a trade
Yeah thanks a lot.  Just from the peak of Scottie Barnes I took his passing and ball handling are miles ahead of everything else he does.  His offensive game scoring wise scares me because he has some really bad touch when it’s not dunks and layups.

Scottie Barnes   /s
There's seems to be a definite top 6 in this draft.  Cade Cunningham - Evan Mobley - Jalen Green - Jalem Suggs - Jonathan Kuminga - Scottie Barnes
"If Scottie Barnes falls to the Warriors, he’ll be on this list."
"See I understand where you’re coming from, but I guess we just have different opinions on player development. To me, if you’ve been able to turn draft day scraps into the supporting cast of a championship team, I’d say you’re better gambling on multiple players with great upside.   With Suggs, it feels weird that they’re drafting Suggs to essentially take the keys of their franchise to a rookie. And you gotta remember that no matter how sure a thing they are, there’s still no guarantee they’re actually better in the  long or even short term. Get Kuminga and a Davion Mitchell or maybe a Scottie Barnes or a Keon Johnson."
Fair but Scottie Barnes seems to be viewed a tier above the guys after the top 5. All depends how much his value is seen as to both teams in this scenario.
"My feelings are that Bagley obv at a point where a trade should happen. Most likely a trade like this would happen or he would be involved in a package. I don't see his stand alone value being that high with the injuries, public drama, and his father. If a stand alone trade were to happen most likely, y'all would receive a couple rotation players on short deals. So I feel like a chance to draft a player like Scottie Barnes is a good get."
"It depends how much they value Scottie Barnes. If they got someone else in mind, they most likely can get them at 9 plus take a flyer on Bagley. He does have talent if (very big if) healthy."
"Kings and Thunder fans what do y'all think about this trade?   Thunder: 6th pick   Kings: 9th and Bagley   Idk how much you Thunder fans value the 6th pick but it could get you Bagley and have him at center and might be improved with a change of scenery. Then puts you in position to draft a Keon Johnson(Saw your thread was interested), a Davion Mitchell, Kispert, Moody, Giddey, etc.   For the Kings fans I feel like the Bagley breakup is obv a long time coming and i'm not sure how high his trade value is. This puts you in position to get Scottie Barnes. A very versatile player."
"If it was the 7th pick instead of the 14th I think it’s pretty solid. Build for the Suggs/green, OG, Trent era by getting wiseman and that 7th pick (maybe Scottie Barnes or kuminga?). But I was mostly just defending Siakam lol"
I've seen Davion Mitchell alot to the Warriors at 7. Seems Warrior fans prefer Moses over Davion.  Doubt Scottie Barnes lasts that long.
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"I really like Scottie Barnes and if he is there at 6, I think he would be a great fit as a point forward type. Or if magic pass on kuminga, I think okc can really develop him too. But yeah not getting top 5 or two picks in top 5 might be kind of gutting this morning."
"There is a high chance Moody is there at 7 for them. 1-5 are pretty decided, 6 looks like probably Scottie Barnes at this point. The draft starting at 7 imo is very undecided"
"Larry Hughes, Shaquille Harrisson, Stephen Jackson,  Charles Oakley, Moses Brown, Isaiah Thomas, Bill Walton, Nikola Vucevic, Bob Cousy, Scottie Barnes, Dennis Johnson, Reggie Jackson..."
I feel GSW already has what Scottie Barnes biggest ceiling is - Draymond. Do you yall really want another Draymond??
then pick someone else. scottie barnes?
Yall can literally draft scottie barnes and get a ben simmons for free without the albatross contract
"Except it's not that deep. Great top 4, steep drop off after that. Scottie Barnes and Moses Moody are not franchise changers."
"7th and 14th right?  monumental W imo. y’all will get two rotational players day 1 that have a high chance to play some real playoff minutes.  i’m guessing y’all take scottie barnes and davion mitchell, book it."
Tbf he was stunted by Vucevic alot but still Kuminga is better than nothing  Theres Davon or Scottie Barnes if you want a sure thing
"Nah this draft real deep   They could get Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Kuminga, all very high upside   Idk shit about Scottie Barnes who they are projected tho lol"
"&gt; it surely has put a giant wrench   We have a million more picks to go. Yeah it sucks but I’m not **too** bummed about it, I like Scottie Barnes a lot and maybe Presti will package those picks to get something else. He’s always looking for a deal. Okc fans should be disappointed but it’s not the end of the world"
Scottie Barnes
"I agree. I hope the Hornets consider Scottie Barnes, he would be a great addition for that lineup."
Get Scottie Barnes it’ll be okay 💙
Sheeeesh if GSW gets Scottie Barnes at 7 that would be unfair but SO EXCITING
Time to look up Scottie Barnes highlights
I have to watch scottie barnes and josh giddey now I hate this
It's a guard heavy draft but there are some forwards that have potential like Scottie Barnes and Kuminga
Don’t know much about Gray. I thought Scottie Barnes was FSU’s Draymond-esque player.

"Scottie Barnes is such a Warriors brand of player tho, he’s a switchable defender, 6’9, can make play and read the floor well.  But I guess your Team want more offensive talent?  Corey Kispert and Chris Duarte would be good Fit with NBA ready to contribute"
That’s fine I’ll just wait for Scottie Barnes for free
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
Why would OKC take Kuminga AND Scottie Barnes? Worst spacing in the league just got even worse.
The should try to move CJ for Scottie Barnes if Possible.
doubt he’ll be there at 9 but Scottie Barnes and Lu Dort on defense sounds amazing
"somebody I love is going to fall to 15 and I'm never going to be able to get over it. I'm sure it won't be Scottie Barnes, but man if it was I would need therapy."
"This year's draft is deep. A Kispert or Scottie Barnes might fall through the cracks, then Presti can trade Kispert or Barnes for another first round pick. 🧠"
He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
Give me Scottie Barnes 😏
Do Khem Birch (he could be a birch tree) and Scottie Barnes (he could be a barn).   Toronto also has a guy named Justin Champagnie (he could be just in champagne).
I come from the future and Scottie Barnes is the right answer
"I don’t understand your first point. It sounds like you agree with me. MJ and Curry were the best players on their team like you said. And MJ telling Scottie to leave isn’t the same as Green telling KD to leave. One joined the other team in free agency while the other was drafted and developed on the Bulls  I said Curry is unselfish to a fault. He let KD take the lead because the team wanted to keep him happy. They changed their offense to fit KD. Before KD joined the warriors had a lot of ball movement and didn’t rely on ISO’s. With KD they still moved the ball but the movement would slow down and they would go iso to please KD.   KD legit said he saw how much fun the warriors were having and he wanted to be a part of it. If you think Curry want a huge part in that then I don’t know what to tell you. And do you honestly think if the Warriors got another player to replace Barnes that they wouldn’t win a championship? If the warriors got any upgrade at all from Barnes they still win. KD was just an overkill addition.   No you seem to give credit to KD for winning when he joined the reigning MVP’s team, the best regular season team of all time, the same team that beat him from a 3-1 deficit in the WCF. I’m giving credit to Curry for winning it all and leading the greatest regular season team of all time. I’m giving Curry credit in beating someone so badly that they decided they couldn’t beat them so he joined them. You also take credit away from Curry because he was the leader of the team that lost in the Finals after having a 3-1 lead but won’t take credit away from KD even tho he did the same thing in the WCF. At least Curry did it against arguably the GOAT in LeBron."
I don’t see Scottie Barnes so this isn’t valid.
Having Scottie Barnes learn from OG is going to be incredible.  They’ll be the best defensive wing duo in the league in 3 years
"Don’t know much about high school basketball but it seems like Montverde is the most stacked basketball school. Cade Cunningham played with Scottie Barnes, Moses Moody, DayRon Sharpe (all R1 picks) and Houstan who will be a R1 pick next year."
"With Mills and Derozan gone from the team, I think KJ is the likeliest to have a breakout season. Not to mention he's got that Olympics experience, he's poised to have a year that he may average 20~24 ppg on great efficiency, and take a leap on the defensive side of the ball as well.  OG on the other hand, is already the most established of the 3, being one of the best 3&amp;D players in the league right now, and with Lowry gone, he may have to step up his scoring and playmaking, even though Siakam and FVV remain, and Scottie Barnes showing flashes of playmaking potential ad a big. May take a small leap in Ppg, Rpg and Apg, and hoping to see another defensive leap from him! Baby Kawhi may come sooner than expected, Toronto.   Last, but not least, Rui is someone with apparent scoring talent, but with the amount of wings the Wizards currently have, he'd have to do some really fantastic things to stand out among the rest. He's shown flashes of being a great scoring threat, if all things go well, I see that he can become a great 2nd option behind Beal, averaging maybe 17~21 ppg. Waiting to see if he takes that step on defense, seeing that sometimes he has these lapses where he looks lost on whom to switch onto and get blown by.  Overall, all 3 of them are poised to make massive improvements to their games, let's wait and see what they'll show us!"
"&gt; Draftexpress used to have this amazing database of height without shoes  [They've since put up combine measurements on the NBA site](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?SeasonYear=2008-09).   It's always funny seeing the guys with 2-3"" shoes according to their listed height. The apparently 6'9 Scottie Barnes who measured at 6'7 w/o shoes was one this year. Cade is apparently shorter as well but he didn't go to the combine so who knows."
"Scottie ""Bang B*TCH"" BARNES"
Holy shit I cannot believe this BREAKING NEWS that #4 pick Scottie Barnes of the Toronto Raptors signed a multi-year shoe deal with Nike
"Yeah, I got you. Maybe that’s what’s getting me. Raptors draft these guys and fans say they’re always the next Kawhi. OG Anunoby was/is supposed to be the next Kawhi. Scottie Barnes is supposed to be the next Kawhi. It seems like a cop out to suggest any NBA prospect with length and an unpolished offensive game is going to be Kawhi Leonard.  Before the draft analysts suggested if all went well for Kuminga he could have a game similar to Jaylen Brown and if they don’t go super well, Al Farouq Aminu. That tracks for me. Nothing in his game says Kawhi Leonard and no one was making that comparison until GSW drafted him."
"Nope... Canadian market is a joke.  At least in the eyes of Nike.  Tons of releases never come to Canada.  Canada's Nike stock is shared with Europe.  South Korea opens a new flagship Nike store, they make a limited AF1 and Dunk only released in Korea just for that event.  Canada opens a new flagship store in Yorkdale and nothing special for the Canadian market.    Also just because you sign with Nike, doesn't mean you automatically get a shoe.  Only the very rare few get one (and never in your rookie year).  They are the super popular and/or highly successful players only.  Unless Scottie Barnes' popularity shoots through the moon, he's not getting his own shoe.  He will likely get some PE sneakers made just for him.  But those are one off sneakers that only Scottie will get.  Realistically, the Canadian market can only hope that he gets his own CW of a LeBron, Durant, Kyrie, etc sneaker.  Like how Doncic and Tatum got their own CWs for the Jordan 36 that just came out."
BREAKING: Toronto Raptors #4 pick Scottie Barnes has signed a multi-year footwear &amp; apparel endorsement deal with Nike. ￼
"MJ and for me personally, it’s not close. Lebron and    Scottie Barnes are up there but it’s so clearly Jordan."
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
"To be fair if we’re talking about the draft, in that whole time he’s only had one top 10 pick (Poetl) + Scottie Barnes and that’s about it."
"True, and with FVV siakam OG and I'm willing to bet Scottie Barnes too, it's tough to have a bad defensive system no matter who you slot in"
"Absolutely not a better fit. Especially with Scottie Barnes lol. Worse, VERY Worse fit."
ben simmons and scottie barnes is redundant
"&gt;It was not obvious to fans at all that it was coming down to Scottie or Suggs btw  Did you not look at any of the mock drafts - SI, ESPN, Ringer, CBS sports? Sure, very few predicted Scottie being picked, but most if not all explicitly mentioned that that Suggs and Barnes were the likely target.   In fact if you read Grange's piece that I referenced to, he states ""...though six-foot-nine do-it-all defender Scottie Barnes of Florida State would be a more than welcome fallback option""."
Scottie Barnes
"FVV- very good defender, great at steals and deflections  GTJ- solid defender with good size  OG- great defender, with strength, quickness and discipline, ability to switch  Pascal- same as OG  Khem Birch- undersized but avg defender for centers  Scottie Barnes- projects to be elite defensively, basically a larger OG  Precious- very solid defender in drop coverage and can switch  They will struggle offensively at times but the defense will always be good. Can't say that about any of the other bad teams you mentioned"
"Houston will be awful defensively, Toronto will likely be good/elite on that end.  OG and Gary Trent Jr are better than KPJ, Tate or Gordon.  Scottie Barnes and Achiuwa are gonna be nice additions. If Dragic plays for them, they have a deep, versatile roster."
FVV but I can see both sides. Interested to see how Fred does with no Lowry; that Scottie Barnes pick was a big sign of confidence in him at point. Maybe he challenges for an All-Star spot this year?
"It's pretty bad, two undersized score first guards is not a recipe for success. It'd be worse than Garland + Sexton because Garland actually looks to make plays, FVV gets tunnel vision at times. We also have GTJ on the team who averages less than 2 assists PER 36 throughout his career lol. Our best playmaker would probably be Scottie Barnes at that point.   It's actually pretty sad now that I think about it."
Scottie Barnes and OG gonna stop yall by accident.
Scottie Barnes
"Masai on his first meeting with Scottie Barnes after draft night: His first word to me was ""winning"" my first word was ""you are mine now"""
"With picks that come out of nowhere in most cases people just gotta take it w a grain of salt because it just means that the FO saw something in that player that was worth bearing negative fan reaction and taking other talented player to pick, which is also similar to what Toronto just did with Scottie Barnes and how it was strange at first but now makes more sense."
"and as a sixers fan, i don't like it one bit.    \- the only rumored trade for ben simmons i would've seriously considered was lowry and #4, because i too love me some scottie barnes.  \- wanted dalano banton at #50 or as a udfa.  was surprised he went in the 40s.  but when i saw it was masai, it figured.  if the goal of modern offense is to create space, the goal of modern defense is to take it away."
Damn is that Scottie Barnes kid no good?
"Toronto is easy.  Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch  Everyone else is expiring or a project."
No scottie barnes ....
"You need to understand that even if the small guy is the better defender, he might not be as valuable defensively as a wing/big with switchability, the way the league is going Davion might struggle against those 6'7"" jumbo playmakers that play the 1. But hopefully he'll outspeed them and destroy them on the other end which i personally don't think will happen.  You takes Scottie Barnes over Davion no question asked if we're just talking defense because he brings an equal level of team defense and can potentially guard 1 throught 5, Davion at best can guard 1 &amp; 2 consistently.  They're not random names Barnes and Mobley were scouted for years before you stanned Mitchell."
u/scottie-barnes
Hahaha I remember you saying this about Scottie Barnes in another thread a few days ago. Didn’t know you were saying this about everyone’s team :(
"Kind of crazy how no one has said Cade yet, but there’s 2 answers for Scottie Barnes lol."
"Scottie Barnes  Highest potential to build around although I'm very biased. Forwards with his skills and intangibles are some of the most valuable pieces on any roster. 4 of the best 5-7 players at the moment are forwards who have all won championships. Freakish size, play making, ambidextrous full court passing, incredible defense, flashes of elite skills on offense, still getting stronger.  SGA is BPA but building around guards isn't as successful unless you're at Curry's level."
Scottie Barnes no bias
"Teams do overthink things, y’all just passed on Jalen Suggs lol and I like Scottie Barnes"
Garuba had a pretty nice block attempt on Scottie Barnes that everyone was hyping as a missed dunk Barnes highlight. It was actually a [Garuba highlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p3dwt8/highlight_scottie_barnes_almost_catches_a_body_on) smh.
"Yeah exactly, even Scottie Barnes I think was getting into engineering or something at fsu.. to be both in athletics and putting in that effort in class is a testament to having really high work ethic. They don’t take anything for granted"
If anybody has Scottie pippen's build its Scottie (Barnes)
"Top 3 have a lot of potential. I love what I’m seeing from Scottie Barnes so for. Also, watch out for Knicks’ Grimes"
"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
"Raptors Scottie Barnes was fun to watch, the hustle and heart he plays with really stands out. His offence could use some work but his defence is stellar. Definitely excited for him.  Dalano Banton was a nice surprise, very versatile doing a little bit of everything. I see him growing to be a great player after a few years of experience.  Outside of the raptors Cade looks like he'll be a fun guy to watch and I look forward to seeing what he will do in the future."
"Sure they lost Lowry, but they got rid of Aaron Baynes, added Scottie Barnes, and hopefully won’t be as covid-plagued as last year. It seems odd to make such a definite statement as “obviously a better defensive team”."
u/scottie-barnes
Shouldn't you be busy watching Scottie Barnes summer league highlights
"&gt; idk if it’s just Scottie and Pascal it’s the fact you also have OG playing essentially the same role right?  Huh? Yeah, all three guard the whole court, but they run very different offensive roles.  Siakam is a high post distributor + pick and roll threat + Iso, OG is a spot up 3pt shooter/slasher, and Barnes is a drive and dish PG."
u/scottie-barnes your Ben Simmons takes continuing to bear fruit. Ben averaging 40-25-20 next year and getting his 2nd ROTY 🔥💯
"So weird that basically after the DeRozan trade we became a defensive minded team, even drafting Scottie Barnes was a defensive minded move."
Because the top 5 weak except Scottie Barnes
Scottie playing Iggy's role with Draymond at the 5 could actually work. Wiggins the new Harrison Barnes
I think we’ve had some small beefs with the Magic over the years which might heat up this season with Barnes v. Suggs. TBH I’m not rly looking forward to it because I think Jalen’s gonna be better than Scottie for a few years and he might become a Raptors Killer with the chip on his shoulder over us passing on him

Scottie Barnes
"I would go:  1) Cade Cunningham  2) Jalen Green  3) Jalen Suggs  4) Evan Mobley  5) Jonathan Kuminga   6) Scottie Barnes  7) Josh Giddey (don’t think it’s fair to drop him since he pretty much hasn’t played)  Also, Scottie Barnes being two spots lower than where he was drafted isn’t meant to be a diss or anything. I still think he’s gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that’s where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Scottie Barnes 5. Jalen Suggs 6. Josh Giddey 7. Johnathan Kuminga 8. Franz Wagner
"I don't get why Pascal &amp; Scottie can't play on the court together. Many teams run two PGs or even two big men. Shit, now a three guard lineup is ""a thing"".   It'd be like if Barnes fell to the Warriors. You think Draymond getting traded just because they drafted the projected next Draymond??? They could play together!   It isn't a two QB situation like in the NFL where the center gotta snap it to only one guy."
Shaivonte Aician Gilgeous-Alexander &gt; moving up 2 spots in the draft to get Scottie Barnes
"Really interesting article, thanks for posting this.         The Raptors example is particularly interesting. We've known the Raptors to be one of the better (imo the best) team at developing prospects, so it's no surprise that they're using any advanced technique they can to get an edge in that realm. I was already very confident that they were the perfect fit for Scottie Barnes and can make him into one of the best players in the NBA. After reading this article, I'm even more curious if maybe they saw something in his shot data that told them they could get his shot to where they wanted.             The new forms of data that teams are collecting are just super fascinating. We get articles like this and we hear about the Second Spectrum data but I'm sure they have other systems for tracking things like energy expenditure, optimized movements to limit injury, off-ball movement, defensive positioning, passing, etc. Can't wait till more of that stuff becomes widely available so that fans can dive into the numbers too. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next CBA negotiations, the league tries to set standards to allow new wearables and other player tracking devices during games too.        I'm glad they mentioned Shoot360 at the end, I had never heard of them before. Sounds similar to Driveline for baseball. I do think that the next steps for the NBA is having these recent advances spread out to the lower levels both in terms of allowing more people to analyze the data but also allowing younger players to use it to improve their game. Basketball is trending towards asking every player, regardless of height, to shoot (and pick up other skills like passing), which we're already seeing in the upcoming recruiting classes. Between that and the NBA having higher and higher standards for efficiency (remains to be seen if that persists after fans are back but I think it will), it's clear that players at all levels are going to want access to this kind of stuff. Just a really exciting time for the game of basketball, looking forward to all this stuff becoming more accessible."
"If the Raptors are really able to get Simmons for just FVV and OG then I think it's a *plausible* (not great, *plausible*) trade.  For all of Ben's flaws, he provides two things for the 76ers in passing and great defense. It's hard to get a single player back that does both of those things in one package. FVV and OG replace both of those things.   Ben to CJ is talked about a lot but while CJ replaces the passing portion, the 76ers will have a giant hole at the 3 that needs to be replaced if he's gone and CJ isn't good enough to make up for that. Dame might be though.   I doubt that trade would happen though nowadays because I thought that a predecessor to that happening was drafting Jalen Suggs to replace FVV. But who knows, maybe the Raptors would have enough faith in Simmons + Scottie Barnes as a ball-handler to still go through with it?"
Raptors. Scottie Barnes is legit. See y'all in 3 years.
For the meme: Scottie Barnes since you said no top 3 picks and he was 4th :P
Why do you have a hate boner for Scottie Barnes?
"Dang OP, glad you were able to sneak in your 12th ""Scottie Barnes sucks"" post"
&gt;Why did Scottie Barnes take Kumingas place despite being a worse prospect?  Buddy i suggest you watch games and look at stats instead of highlights. Kuminga is a highlight machine. Overall Barnes has looked better.  Both have major potential to be stars.
u/scottie-barnes
"Maybe I'm a homer, but Scottie Barnes in 4-5 years."
Lol the Scottie Barnes statline thread gets more upvotes than a 20/20
"Was awesome seeing the commentators all hyped for liangelo vs the Raptors yesterday, just for Scottie Barnes to go beast mode and steal the game and the fame 😈"
Thats actually nuts - 17 people in a pool of hundreds over 30 years. Can’t believe Scottie Barnes is going to be one of them
"Some good points. I think we see a lot of guys in the league who can get buckets and can’t play the defensive side of the floor. And you’re right, these guys will be all stars because their game is entertaining. The issue is that these guys get paid a premium and I’m not sure that’s always translates to a winning franchise because it caps the team.  I don’t disagree on many of your points with Scottie but I think Barnes has a significantly higher offensive upside than Draymond. It feels like a bit of a lazy comparison. Draymond averaged 3pts a game in his first year of college and couldn’t shoot for shit.  Scottie won ACC Freshman of the Year, ACC Sixthman of the year, and Third Team all ACC. His length and size creates mismatches on every possession, he’s strong enough to get to his spots, and has a solid finishing package. As I said, his handle and his shot needs tightening up. Not saying he’ll get there, but this is the same mold as a Giannis or a Kawhi. Summer League doesn’t mean all that much but last night’s 23 points on 56% shooting is a show that his offensive woes were deeply overstated. Not to mention those 23 points came with 5 boards, 4 dimes, 2 steals.  I just think his offensive limitations are overstated and I think complete players are what win championships. I know it’s just Summer League but Kuminga is only averaging 2 more points than Scottie. I don’t know if I’d trade 2 points for someone who, to this point, has proven to be a sieve on defence. Anyway, time will tell. I’m sure they’ll both be good NBA players."
Scottie Barnes.
Every Toronto fan: Scottie Barnes.
"Yeah, the points you brought up are exactly what I felt as well. Kuminga definitely has some issues with his BBIQ but remember he’s over a calendar younger than the other top 5 picks, including Barnes. A lot of those struggles are to be expected. What I see with him though is a budding offensive skillset and excellent strength and body control, he really looks the part of a high level scorer even if the efficiency isn’t there yet the moves he’s making are already very advanced. Also consider, that those older draft picks at 20 years old are all shooting about as inefficiently at 19/20 as Kuminga was in the G league as 17/18.  He’s not a 3 and D guy that you have to slowly build up his skillset, he’s got skills at 18 that OG doesn’t have at 23. He’s more like a 6’8 Derozan or Jalen Brown than OG, and 6’8 Derozan could be a hell of a scorer in his prime. Personally, I’m more comfortable making the bet on offensive upside, because a great offensive player is almost always an All-star, and the best offensive player is always in the MVP conversation. The best defensive player is usually All NBA level, but rarely does he lead his team to a championship as the best player.  Scottie on the other hand has a clear floor as a high impact defensive player, and an extremely untapped ceiling as a playmaking point forward similar to a Green, Simmons, or even a Giannis type of player.  That sounds amazing, and it is, but it’s extremely untapped. He’s completely unproven as a shooter, shaky as a ball handler, not the greatest finisher, not the most creative with his footwork, he doesn’t have the best body control, and his shooting touch isn’t quite there. All he has for sure right now as an offensive player is playmaking and energy, and even if he does become one of the players I described as his ceiling it’s a long, *long* way out. There’s a non-zero chance he never scratches becoming a good offensive player, let along a great one.  TLDR; I think Kuminga has more potential to be a first option scorer than Scottie, and that was the bet I was more comfortable making pre-draft."

Scottie Barnes will win a MVP
Scottie Barnes at age 20 is taking shots with confidence we wanted OG to be taking last year.  I know it’s only summer league but he has some unbreakable confidence &amp; i’m so fucking excited for him to have even just a season under our coaching staff.
Scottie Barnes
"Brain as smooth as grocery store chicken breast here. Scottie Barnes, the new GROAT."
He's a combination of Harrison Barnes and Scottie Pippen.
"Andrei kirilenko had seasons averaging 15-6 with near 2 steals and over 3 blocks a game, I can’t say I’d be mad if that’s what Scottie Barnes turned into"
Scottie Lewis thought he was Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes &gt;&gt;&gt; Jalen Suggs?
In case anyone missed this:  Scottie Barnes = good  Hornets = really bad  All Raptors other than Precious and Barnes = bad but not as bad as Charlotte
scottie barnes&gt;scottie lewis. Cut his ass
Scottie Barnes
Vince Carter out here telling Scottie Barnes to pull up his bootstraps like he did when the Raptors struggled.
"I’m not predicting it by any means. Everything would need to go right and If the raps make the play-in it’s a successful season. That is more likely the upper band, but I could see a trajectory for everything to hit. Scottie Barnes is the ultimate x-factor too."
"&gt;-Miami still loses in round 1 even with Lowry  If they get past the 2nd round, I'll be very surprised.  &gt;-MPJ is an all star  This is doable, but he might fuck himself with his vaccination status.  &gt;-Ben Simmons doesn’t play a game this season  I think he'll play, but not until the new year at least.   Other than that:  the Bulls will be top 3 in the East,  Scottie Barnes will surprise everyone once he gets rolling halfway through the season, and will finish 2nd in ROTY voting after Jalen Green."
Warriors and Heat underperform (as in first-round exit at best underperform). Celtics top 2 seed in East. Raptors solid playoff team unless Masai decides to tank. Scottie Barnes looks like best rookie of the class.
Scottie Barnes. Starting at center in the close out game. Would be following in Magic Johnson’s footsteps.
"Star - Russell Westbrook - He's in a spot where he can do what he does best, but, without needing to be the first or second scoring option. Lebron tends not to miss when it comes to picking stars as teammates, and, Westbrook has a spirit that won't quit.  Emerging Star - Kevin Porter Jr. - he's got the keys as full time, starting PG for to the Rockets, and is equipped with young talent in Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, along with more seasoned players in Christian Wood and Daniel Theis. He put up a monstrous performance against the reigning champs (resulting in a rare victory  for the Rockets last season), to go along with some moments of promising play before the season's end  Unproven Star - Scottie Barnes - there were many skeptics who voiced their disapproval of the Raptors choosing Scottie Barnes so high, but, he showed out in the Summer League. I think Scottie Barnes may very well end up making an impactful statement for why the Raptors choose him, especially within an organization that has a strong reputation for developing young players"
Scottie Barnes is 100% that guy
"I wasn’t big on Scottie Barnes until I started looking into just how freakish his body/athleticism are.   The guy is 6’8 with a 7’3 wingspan (on a Raptors open gym I think they measured 7’4). His standing reach is at 9’0 and his standing vert is at 36 inches (max vert was 39.5) while being 230-ish lbs   This means that from just standing still Scottie can touch the top of the backboard, while also being insanely quick lateral movement (7th best lane agility and 2nd beat shuttle run at this years combine).   On top of that, the dude can somewhat handle the ball, seems to have great basketball IQ and defensive instincts, and has shown flashes of guard skills with his passing/playmaking.   Who knows what Barnes develops into, but the kids athleticism, body, IQ, and flashes of guard skills make it so he has an insanely high ceiling with his floor being an athletic switchable defender."
"People forget how much a player like Draymond changed the game of basketball. Having your 6’7 tweener not only be able to play PF,  but having him become the deadly center for their small ball line up really changed how the game was played in the NBA. Let alone his playmaking. Look at what happened with Houston and PJ. Point is, if you can find a player that has all of Draymonds intangibles, defense and playmaking, but with an actual offensive arsenal at his disposal, the league will be fucked. Maybe Scottie Barnes can become that guy."
I trust scottie Barnes will take a better path with his attitude ~~towards~~ ~~shooting~~
"Ben Simmons, OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Khem Birch"
Scottie Barnes plays with his heart on his sleeve... dude is ready to work.
"&gt;[Perry was teammates with Scottie Barnes on the gold-winning USA U-19 World Cup team in 2019. That team also featured Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs and Tyrese Haliburton... but it was Perry that came away with tournament MVP.](https://twitter.com/JLew1050/status/1440347658443374609)  👀"
"Look at all the players that have gone into the booth or become talking heads.  Do you think those players would make good coaches?  Barkley, Shaq, Kenny Smith, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Chauncey Billups, TMac, Paul Pierce, Stephen Jackson, Matt Barnes, Scottie Pippen, Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Jalen Rose.  Out of all those dudes the only people I would for sure want coaching a team would be Chauncey and Kenny, Chauncey is getting his chance and Kenny is currently looking iirc.  Others that I think could coach if they wanted would maybe be Jalen, Channing, and RJ mayyyybe TMac.  But there's also the question of are they even interested in coaching?  There's ~500 players in the League right now, I'd be willing to bet that a huge majority aren't even interested in coaching.   &gt;While the players who are black who remain involved in the sport are talking heads or in the booth almost exclusively.  Complete bullshit ""almost exclusively""  Out of all the big talking heads I named one is currently going to be a coach, and another has been interviewed.  Mark Jackson became a coach and sucked, Tyronn Lue and Doc Rivers have been out there for a good minute.  Jason Kidd is out running around even though he has a very questionable domestic + coaching past.  Nate McMillan, David Fizdale, Dwane Casey also.    If we look farther back we have Larry Drew, Lenny Wilkens, KC Jones, etc. etc. probably quite a few others I don't know"
"Mobley, but that’s because he’s undersized atm and there’s always more difficulties adjusting to the nba game when you’re a 5, but I think he’s going to be the 4 for Cleveland. If they develop him properly he can be generational though. He has the highest celling in the draft for me. After him, Scottie Barnes is the next big bet for bust because he can’t really shoot. But if he ends up developing a respectable shot then he can be scary. Kuminga is my bet to rise up the redraft rankings in a couple of years."
"I agree that we may not jump into the top 10 offensively, but I definitely see a pathway to getting a top 10 / top 5 defence. There’s addition by subtraction defensively by losing Baynes, you slide Boucher over from Center to power forward which lets him be more of a Giannis type roamer defensively and you get OG, Fred and Pascal all guarding 1 position smaller again.  If you start FVV/GTJ/OG/Siakam/Birch, you then have Flynn (who was already an average defender in his rookie season that has upside there), Watanabe and Boucher who were all solid defenders off the bench last year. There are question marks around the young guys but if Scottie Barnes can be RHJ from 2019-20 for us at minimum, that’s another plus bench defender. That’s 9 solid to plus defenders on that team (I’m higher on Wainright than most, I think he’ll be another pj Tucker-esque player but I’ll leave that alone until he proves it)."
Because Scottie Barnes turned his ankle in the Finals
"I think CLE or anyone in the top 3 valued their picks in a stacked draft too much that they would not have traded it for any amount of future firsts. If we asked for Cade, how many picks would you be ok to get in exchange for him?  We liked Scottie Barnes too but the Raptors must have too high of an asking price anyway."
Scottie Barnes
"&gt;  Suggs had a lot of limitation skill wise going into the draft, like can’t finishing left, suspect handling and footwork, shot poorly at the rim. Most draft Twitter projects him to be a Kevin Huerter type second option if he develops right.      Not sure where you're reading that but I don't think that's particularly accurate. Just because Suggs is not a pure PG doesn't mean he is a Huerter type.       &gt; And Scottie was projected to also be a secondary option in a Draymond/Pascal kind of way.       Barnes doesn't come close to the scoring ability that Siakam has. It would be extremely unexpected for him to get to that level.      I think he could be like Draymond offensively, but I really think with Draymond its important to remember that he has been in the best possible situation for his skillset playing with the 2 best shooters/off ball players of all time. I think if Draymond had ended up on another team he might have been putting up like 10/3.5"
"&gt; Scottie quite literally ranked 4th in wings in the last 20 or so years in terms of recordable athletecism metrics &amp; was in the 99.9th percentile in terms of athleticism.       In terms of what, combine metrics? Tbh I think one of the biggest misnomers about Barnes is that he's some great athlete (at least functionally on the court, not talking combine scores). He's not a bad athlete or anything, just pretty average."
Is this Matt Barnes and Scottie Pippens kid?
"Moses Moody, Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham, Caleb Houstan.  That’s a loaded HS team.  No wonder 6’8 Cade wanted to be PG"
Scottie Barnes is a Raptors legend already  Reminds me of Bruno
How dare you we would never ever let someone take our big smile boy scottie let alone banishing to the shadow realm  Scottie Barnes is Kawhi Giannish hybrid in the making Book it
"&gt; Basically another Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam type.   Except those guys were all high regarded high school and college players and Alex got on low D1 college offer.  Body type is something, but having high level skill and effort is another."
"""Raptors got their man"" jokes aside, Alex Antetokounmpo is a 6'8"" small forward with a 7'2"" wingspan. Basically another Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam type. We really are going all out on position-less basketball at this point aren't we?"
"&gt; we can build a team that suits Simmons skills better.   How? Name the players on that team. We have Khem Birch, Scottie Barnes, Ben Simmons. That’s 3 guys who can’t shoot. Plus Siakam. We are trading away our two best shooters in FVV+OG for Simmons.  The only way this works is if you trade essentially our entire team. Which won’t happen, it would ostracize the fan base."
"Raptors fan;  Lack of a go-to scoring option. Our best ball handler/shooter is FVV and he is too short to score in the paint consistently, and our primary scoring option has some issues with his dribbling and shooting consistency.  Also a relatively smaller team, where Siakam is a bit of an skinner/smaller 4 which is fine, but hurts your rebounding when you don’t have a true 5 either.    Hopefully Scottie Barnes and Precious can help that out some"
"Hard to say, I could see the Raptors bottoming out if they get midway through the season and are not where they want to be. I could also see them being a solid playoff team throughout the year, returning to pre-Tampa form. I think a lot of that depends on Scottie Barnes playing well, and Siakams health.  Wizards and Hornets are probably gonna have similar records unless LaMelo really takes the next step and Hayward stays healthy (lol). If that's the case, I would put Charlotte safely above Washington."
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes
"Toronto is going to surprise people.   Being back in Toronto with actual home-court-advantage instead of 72-road games and Floridians booing at every game will help to a degree. No more Covid craziness will also help seeing as Toronto probably had it worse than every other team except Boston. Then having a full year of Trent Jr and Birch will provide depth and the additions of Scottie Barnes, Goran Dragic and Precious should shore up what was a terribly shallow rotation last year. Look for OG to take the biggest leap, VanVleet will explore a larger role with Lowry gone and Siakam will look to bounce back after a down shooting year. Nick Nurse is still a top coach and the Raps pull random contributors out of their ass annually.   New York however, is going to regress.   I don’t see All-nba for Randle again. They should see some progression from their young players but overall I think they just got lucky in a weird season last year. Once fans were back in the stands for the playoffs they shrunk exponentially."
So the top guys don't play...so what? If Scottie Barnes is playing I'm watching that shit. Yal gotta stop hating on anything new.
The key takeaway here is that if you don’t get good separation going against Scottie Barnes- he’s going to block or deflect your shot.  The 2nd takeaway is that Barnes and Sexton would be one hell of a backcourt together.
"Things to take away:  \- Collin Sexton had a few nice drive &amp; dishes, look for him to improve his playmaking abilities this season. He's always been a tank but he looks even... tankier in this video? Not sure if it's just the tank top maybe Cavs fans can chip in.   \- Scottie Barnes' 1v1 defense is insane considering he was able to shut down THJ &amp; Mitchell on two isolation plays. Obviously the NBA is going to be much faster, but this is a good sign for Scottie/Raptors fans.   \- Andre Drummond is absolute garbage lmao"
No problem Scottie Barnes
"I will send you 1000 dollars if Scottie Barnes is still a relevant player after his rookie deal, well I wont have to cuz hes crap"
"As much as I want to throw up in my mouth for even suggesting it...   How about something structured around Fred VanVleet + Goron Dragic for Simmons? That's tons of savvy guard scoring and leadership for Philly and the Raptors can fully embrace their goal of gigantic, defensive focused, basketball. I love Fred as much as the next guy but I am just so damn intrigued at the idea of playing Simmons, Gary Trent Jr, Scottie Barnes, OG, and Siakam. That would be revolutionarily gross basketball and I'm all for it."
That's our guy.  Scottie Barnes is Canada's guy.
"He's putting up borderline All-Star numbers aside from assists and he's still really young so it's possible...provided he moves to a different team because Cleveland over the past few years has been where talent goes to die or move to another team, and i'm not just saying that because I think he'd be great alongside Scottie Barnes and Precious in the long-term."
"Him and Scottie Barnes had great chemistry in this 10 minute workout video so obviously Toronto, trade him for FVV @Cavs /s"
"Scottie ""528 MCAT"" Barnes"
Found the scottie barnes burner.
Scottie Barnes confirmed not to have Down’s!
Didn't know Scottie Barnes was a fan of Saul Kripke.
"Yeah exactly, we saw it this year with Scottie Barnes. I remember tweener use to be such a bad thing but now it’s viewed as versatile, draymond started that imo"
"I dont think they are in purgatory but their timeline is kind of weird. The young players they have that are 24 years old or younger are OG Anunoby,Gary Trent Jr,Scottie Barnes,Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn, OG and Gary are already starting level players,Scottie is a project who has star potential and both Flynn and Precious looked good in summer league and could develop well. Imo thats a fringe top 10 young core  Its just that on top of those guys they also have a bunch of win now players who dont really have time to develop like Siakam,Fred,Boucher,Dragic and Birch who would rather win now"
Maybe I mean Siakam is taller than Barnes by 1 inch with the same wingspan. Siakam is way more functional as a 5 though mainly because he is a much better vertical athlete for some reason Scottie can’t jump so he can’t rim protect (0.5 blocks in FSU). Also tbh honestly I don’t think Scottie has enough gravity/flexibility to be a 1-3 really. I think hes a forward but if he can shoot off the bounce maybe he can be a one
"I think the lockeroom stuff is overblown but in regards to Scottie/Ben, current Ben is a high end outcome for Barnes and you don’t have to wait for him to develop so you can actually compete with your current pieces namely Siakam and Fred"
Scottie Barnes with OGs shooting and defense would be insane.
Scottie Barnes FMVP this year  You heard it here first folks
If Scottie Barnes is the best defensive player in the NBA in a few seasons I owe you a coke. But this is an unhinged take for a guy who's never stepped onto an NBA floor.
"lol I would not trade OG for Ben. OG showed last year that his ceiling is higher than expected, because he flashed creation potential. He’s also on a great contract, and is a great shooter, and in my mind is an all defense type player on the defensive end. He’s not the dribbler and playmaker Ben is, but I think OGs shown some flashes of progression in that regard and i think Ben’s playmaking is diminished by his inability to shoot (same thing I think about Scottie Barnes)."
"Ah, the OG and Scottie Barnes work"
If you already have Scottie Barnes slotted as either the best defender in the NBA or close to it then yes you are wrong. That's an insane leap for a guy who's never played an NBA minute.
I don’t get why you’d want Simmons when you have Scottie Barnes. Am I wrong to think he’s practically gonna be the same thing in a few seasons except he’ll shoot more?
This is extremely pointless but I would 100% Scottie Barnes for Ben Simmons if I could straight up but that’s impossible
"I see Kawhi as a better comp for Barnes than Draymond - Draymond is stocky and can hold down the 5 against most lineups.  Barnes is high-waisted which means he's easier to move down low.  If he plays C, it'd be vs other small lineups - I would see the Raps use Precious or OG at the 5 sooner than Scottie."
"Which wing who can't shoot got drafted in the lottery this year? Just Scottie Barnes? I wouldn't say ""Kawhi has ruined the NBA draft"" because of 1 pick"
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
"The only person who Draymond has ever been a good comp for was Scottie Barnes, but even then it's a high outcome comp"
"Don’t worry about “1,2,3” positioning, that’s outdated.   He would be what we’re hoping Scottie Barnes will be, I don’t want him because Scottie could do what he does without the issues if developed properly"
Scottie Barnes is a god
"Honestly, probably not.   Bosh didn’t cause a huge scene when he left like Vince did, but we also accomplished basically nothing during Bosh’s tenure (zero playoff series wins.)  Scottie Barnes is also supposed to wear #4 so we haven’t phased his old jersey number out of active use."
"&gt; Ignoring the contradiction in calling the team ""talent-starved"" when they have OG, Siakam and VanVleet plus promising young players in Trent Jr., Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa, if it involves trading Fred along with Boucher, Dragic and a first, then I am absolutely not in favor of it.  They are 100% high end talent starved.   OG, Trent Jr. Scottie and precious are all good role players or show promise. FVV is a really good guard but not quite all star. Siakam with no injuries is an all star except he's coming off injury.   This team replaced Lowry, Kawhi, Ibaka/Gasol with noone of similar value. We completely lack high end talent. We have no first start, we have no leader like the way Lowry was. We have no quality centers like Ibaka/Gasol. Our Center rotation right now is just good backup centers being played as starters.   Pascal is coming off injury,  his ramp up to game shape will take a while and the jury is still out if he can ever become an all star again. He willl no doubt struggle on a team without a true point guard in the starting lineup. FVV is not a point guard. He's a shooting guard in a point guards body.   I won't argue how good of a shooter FVV is. but he isn't really a leader and he isn't a playmaker. and he's streaky prone to hero ball espeacilly with even less talent around him.   I see Ben brining playmaking, defense and scoring on this team. He has shown he can do that in the regular season and is only 24.   Do i want to trade the whole kitchen sink for him? No but you would be absolutely the biggest homer ever if you don't think he could bring value to this team if we didn't give up too much for him.  He would instantly help Siakam, and FVV if we could keep him in a trade.  Salary wise? cap space means nothing in Toronto since we will never attract a big FA. We need to find our stars in trades or drafting.  I want to stress, for the right price, Ben is a great get for this team."
"Ignoring the contradiction in calling the team ""talent-starved"" when they have OG, Siakam and VanVleet plus promising young players in Trent Jr., Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa, if it involves trading Fred along with Boucher, Dragic and a first, then I am absolutely not in favor of it.   Fred is our second-best shooter Pascal (arguably he's our most efficient shooter from the 3), an offensive threat and a natural leader.  With Lowry gone, that last factor is going to become more important, and I don't see Ben bringing that leadership to the Raptors, let alone being our first, second or even third option on offense unless Nick Nurse and our staff can work on his ""pass first"" apprehension to shooting.  And even then, I'm not optimistic about our chances of ""fixing"" Ben Simmons."
Fantastic logic here. You believe Siakam is a meh offensive player on a bad contract and trading him will open up minutes for Barnes. Yet you believe bringing in Simmons who is worse at everything on offense apart from playmaking who is on a bad contract and also plays the same position as Scottie Barnes as an even worse fit is the answer.
"Siakam might be one of your best offensive players but he's a ""meh"" offensive player on a bad contract. Plus you'd be getting more minutes for scottie barnes. You guys were one of the worst teams in the league last year, idk why you're thinking you have the answers on your roster already."
I've never seen a fanbase completely 180 their opinion on a player within 24 hours the way r/torontoraptors did with Scottie Barnes.  Could totally see the same thing happening with Simmons.
So you're telling me asking for half of the Raptors and the pick that became Scottie Barnes or Dejounte Murray and a ton of picks weren't reasonable?  Shocking.  And Morey told us our FO was in LaLaLand.
"I think we'll be fine given our draft history, but the upcoming season is going to suck because Suggs vs Barnes is going to get brought up every time Scottie has a bad game or when Suggs have a good game lol."
"Yeah, I’m not sure if it’s enough. I don’t think it’s a terrible offer though.   Trade value can plummet when a player threatens to sit out. For instance, Philadelphia traded Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler when he demanded a trade. This proposed offer from the Timberwolves is certainly better than that trade. Beasley is a 40%, high volume shooter, McDaniels has a lot of potential, Reid is a solid backup center, and Beverley has a ton of playoff experience. The 76ers also have a chance to package the first round picks for a Star later.   Honestly, I’m not really sure if a drastically better offer is out there:  -	The Raptors reportedly don’t want Simmons after drafting Scottie Barnes. Which makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Warriors don’t think that Simmons and Draymond fit. Which also makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Kings are unwilling to offer Fox or Haliburton, and an offer based around Buddy Hield seems similar to the Wolves current offer.  -	The Trailblazers aren’t trading Lillard. Maybe they’re willing to trade CJ? I’m not sure about that though, cause CJ and Lillard are best friends. There are also reports that the Trailblazers think Simmons is too ball dominant for Lillard. Plus, I don’t think Simmons can really coexist with Nurkic and Nance."
Raps fans are just very upset I took a jab at Scottie Barnes lmao.
Scottie Barnes sleeper draft pick
"Fischer has been right about a ton of stuff, didn't he predict Scottie Barnes too?"
Why wouldn’t they have tried Lowry for Simmons? They were shopping for Ben before they drafted Scottie Barnes.   Sorry I don let know well how the salary part of trades work.
Jalen Suggs.  Scottie Barnes will be better than him.
"&gt;Toronto has been out on Simmons since drafting Scottie Barnes.  thank you God, and also Masai &amp; Bobby"
Scottie Barnes will be better than simmons in a couple of years anyways.
Toronto just drafted Scottie Barnes
"They're my team but I'm gonna say Toronto  Despite what our front office has been saying, I can see this season as being Pascal's last chance to redeem himself and he knows there will be a lot of eyes on him and what he does  The good thing is they have Scottie Barnes as their insurance policy so they can wait until after the season to determine where to go from there"
"People forget dude is the same age as Cade,  and younger than Scottie Barnes and Mobley"
"Raptors: Ben Simmons  Detroit: Scottie Barnes   Sizers: Fred Van Vleet, Jerami Grant  Historically a 4th pick tends to land a borderline all-star average starter and Jerami Grant is that according to 538. Sixers get Depth, and Raptors get a young socialite that matches the age of their core"
Simmons kinda similar to Scottie Barnes. I doubt they are actually interested in him.  Sounds like they just want to pick up and rehabilitate an asset.
"Why would Masai want to give up FVV, OG, and Scottie Barnes for Ben Simmons?"
"Raptors will centre a package around This Pascal Siakam + fillers. Scottie Barnes and OG are off limits obviously.   Philly must realize, they killed Simmons’ trade value after they threw him under the bus after the playoffs. That’s why he won’t show up to training camp. Which will only degrade value further, not to mention will create a clown show in Philly.   Pascal Siakam is the best possible return from a team that is actually looking to trade for Simmons. Plus Pascal is a Great fit next to Embiid. Better than Simmons. No you are not getting Beal or Lilliard. Be realistic at this point"
"At this point, Ben leaving Philly before the season starts woukd be more shocking than Cam getting released or Messi leaving Barca. Not only have the Sixers bottled any chance of getting Dame but even getting rid of Ben by asking for king ransoms.    Like did Philly genuinely think they could get FVV, OG, and Scottie Barnes for Ben Simmons in 2021?"
"Oh no, Simmons lowered his trade value! Now Morey won't be able to get Siakam, Fred VanVleet, Scottie Barnes, 3 FRPs, the 2019 Larry O'Brien, Masai Ujiri, a Drake feature and a stake in MLSE in a trade! Truly tragic"
"I think there is 0 chance the Raptors trade OG for Ben, and they almost assuredly value him way higher than Ben. Plus they just drafted Scottie Barnes who is basically Ben but 20 (also a great dude)."
I think in the near term Id put money on Bam but in the longer term I think Scottie Barnes has the perfect skills and tools to get a quadruple double once he’s developed and settled into the nba
it's not a joke. scottie barnes is a bust
"They made an offer for Simmons after they drafted Scottie Barnes? Masai probably said goran, Boucher and a pick for Ben"
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"first time I've noticed young scottie barnes, jalen suggs and jalen green in the background"
i saw scottie barnes at the club in tallahassee thursday. man of the people
scottie barnes
Scottie Barnes
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
Scottie Barnes
"Barnes and Green (and Christopher) seem like good buddies... Come to Houston, Scottie! Weather is great (during the NBA season)!"
"It just bothers me seeing so many posts about Scottie Barnes. There's no logic to it. I could just scroll past it. I like complaining, though."
"barnes is my ROY pick because shooters can get cold, and opposing teams are going to pick up on tendencies and keep players like duarte and mobley from getting to their spots. scottie does so many different things that are not likely to fall off as the season progresses, and his offensive game is already better than expected. he’s gonna continue to get minutes, and his team is gonna be decent."
"Seriously. I'm on the verge of creating a Reddit filter to just hide all posts with ""Scottie Barnes"" in the title. We're only two weeks into his career and I'm already sick of hearing about him."
Scottie Barnes unironically. Man is beloved in his draft class.
Scottie Barnes
You mean u don’t like scottie barnes getting a permanent spot on the front page when he scores 10 points
"The Raptors are young though.  Siakam, FVV, Anunoby, Trent - they're all in their mid twenties or younger.  And they just drafted Scottie Barnes with a top pick.  Let's let them gel before rushing to a conclusion.  The Pacers are a little older, but I think all their guys are mid to late twenties.  They're a tougher nut to crack.  Sure they haven't seen their lineup of Brogdon/Levert/Duarte/Sabonis/Turner with Warren and Lamb off the bench yet, but that's an alright lineup if not spectacular.  But they may be satisfied with that.  Not every team is interested with tearing the whole thing down and doing a multi year rebuild.  I'd like to see them move on from either Sabonis or Turner and it seems like they've been considering it forever.  But some small market teams especially don't want to do a complete tear down."
I just hate seeing a post every time Scottie Barnes wipes his ass
"Today, the best players grow up playing with and against each other, hanging out at camps they're invited to, playing for national teams together... of course they're going to be friends!  I hope Suggs attains every ounce of his potential (and that Scottie Barnes convinces him to come to the North )"
"well, I hope you get used to it soon. you're gonna be good very soon for what looks like a while. just hope you don't get any more overbearing about Scottie Barnes"
"I feel like he’s a shorter Barnes lol..  Can defend and pass at a very high level already. Cant really shot just yet and because he’s smaller he can’t overwhelm guys in the paint the way Scottie has, which is why he’s shootings like 20 something percent"
*Scottie barnes*
Scottie Barnes Ignoring Jalen Suggs' Instagram Stories?
"Guys, I'm from Toronto and I love Scottie Barnes too and think he's the one true messiah, but can we calm it down? The rest of r/NBA already hates us and for preeeeeeeeeeety good reason, given the 90,000 Scottie Barnes posts every time he dribbles."
Shut the fuck up about Scottie Fucking Barnes jesus Fucking christ
"i been fighting this scottie barnes battle for a week now. the raps fans will come in masses and fill up the inbox but i gotta fight for what i believe in. and what I believe in? we don't need 5 posts every time he makes a layup or stops somebody from scoring. Thank you, Ontario."
"I’ve never gone into those threads, I blocked everything that has Scottie Barnes in the title on RES lol"
Scottie Barnes
"The day starts with the ""Scottie Barnes Report"" at 10:30am, followed by ""Who Did Mitchell Guard?"" At 11:00am, and then ""Russ Bad"" at Noon."
ESPN:   Scottie Barnes doesn’t care that he’s in Toronto??? What does this mean for LeBron and the Lakers? Kendrick Perkins will share his thoughts after the break
I am a Raptors fan who specifically searches r/nba for 'Scottie Barnes' and sorts by new all the time and this take is overblown.  He's represented on here about as much as any good rookie over the years.   We can go back to all posting about Ben Simmons though if you want.
Lmao I'm so happy someone mentioned this. I get it. They are excited about their new rookie. But seriously the raptors were getting blown out by 20 the other night and the top upvoted posts on the subreddit were scottie Barnes dunks lmao.
Raptors fans gonna downvote you for not having OG and/or Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes and Anunoby
Doncic fans are by far the worst. make all sorts of excuses and don't hold their star player to the same standard as other players. A close second right now are Scottie Barnes fans. his fans act like he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and its getting old.
Scottie Barnes. I have no problem with him personally but I have his name RES filtered because I'm sick of seeing 5-10 posts about him every morning.
Coming from a Scottie Barnes circle jerker? Least delusional r/nba user
"and scottie barnes good lord. theres literally 2 posts on the front page, literally just his statline. it's the same post. but both got upvoted. no clip, just his statline.  raps fans be making posts like ""[HIGHLIGHT] Scottie Barnes with a veteran play, makes a great pass to a teammate, who passes to a teammate, who passes to a teammate for the jam!"""
Scottie Barnes?
"OG Anonoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Fred VanVleet, etc…  Wouldn’t say ruined cause i like watching good hoopers, moreso ruined in NBA discussions"
The Scottie Barnes circle jerk aka the Raptors’ sub.
Did you mean Scottie Barnes?
Scottie. Fing. Barnes.
I think Scottie will get it because he’ll have a slight edge in scoring. The cavs move the ball around too much for Mobley to get close to a 30 point game this year. It also seems like Barnes has the ball in his hands more.
"What makes more sense, to fight for a play in spot and get bounced in the first round or tank for lottery odds and draft Scottie Barnes? Especially when you know Lowry wants to leave in the off-season. All Raptor fans knew it was time for him to move on and for the Raptors to embrace the young core."
"As a (not raptor) fan (unbiased), I think Scottie Barnes is better than Wilt already, and give it a few days and Jordan won’t stand a chance in the GOAT conversation"
"For those of you not watching the games, Scottie Barnes is doing all this simply being in the flow of the offense. Nothing more. They’re not designing plays for him. They’re not having him run point or initiate offense. He’s simply making the right decision when he gets his hand on the ball and creating opportunities for himself in transition and in cleanup on the offensive end.  Absolutely bonkers."

Didn't yall just say Scottie Barnes twice?
Scottie Barnes is a champ in the making
"I’m a Raptors fan I’ve watched every second of every Scottie Barnes play 20 times lol. I just am a bit more pessimistic about how many shots he will get with the full lineup back. The two guys we are missing are both wings, yuta doesn’t take many shots a game but he takes them, and pascal takes the most on the team. Those attempts gotta be taken from someone. A lot from FVV some from OG I’m sure, but Scottie isn’t gonna get to shoot 13-17 shots a game like he has at the start of this season, no matter how much I wish he could."
"Agreed &amp; from what I've seen, Barnes &amp; Mobley are well ahead of the other rookies (except perhaps Davion Mitchell).  Scottie can guard 5 positions &amp; from end to end though, which could be the difference in voting."
"OG AnuGOATby might not get MIP (Miles Bridges), but I think him and Scottie Barnes are the two most important players for the Raptors, both for the current season and the future"
Scottie Barnes is honestly a top-tier rookie.
"I wanted Scottie but not with the #4 pick. Masai and other FOs obviously know what is going on behind the scenes better than I did.  In my ideal world, we would've traded #4+lottery future protected 1st rounder to Orlando for #5 and #8 and picked Barnes at #5 and Kuminga at #8 (and if Kuminga wasn't available, I wanted Sengun at that spot)."
"As a fan of the game, I would have loved to have seen what Schlenk could've done with the Warriors roster post KD.   I'm imagining some masterpiece like Curry+Dray surrounded by future stars like LaMelo or Scottie Barnes, along with perfectly fitting savvy veterans all around."
Aron Baynes was the tank commander that brought us Scottie Barnes.  Number 46 stays goated.
"I was bummed about not getting Mobley, even though it was a long shot.  Wasn't that sad we passed on Suggs, and quickly got on board with Scottie, especially after hearing what Thorpe had to say - Mobley/Barnes were his 1-2.  Wish there was a way we could've gotten both.  Both guys are more well-rounded than a lot of stars so as good as they will be in any situation - it'll take good coaching to unlock their full potential and will be fun to watch."
Scottie Barnes is a taller MJ
"nah wtf is wrong with you, do you want Scottie Barnes to stay raptor? if you do please never post some shit like this again your writing self insert fanfic for a grown ass man"
Scottie Barnes is fucking here baby!
Raptors fans posting Scottie Barnes' stats every night is gonna get really annoying really fast
Hot Take: Scottie Barnes has improved more from Summer League + 5 NBA games than Ben Simmons in 4 years in the NBA
"He is a bit more polished than Giannis was as a youngster. I just think current Giannis relies too much on his freakiness and power to compare to Barnes, even as a lesser version of Giannis. Scottie Pippen is the best comp. High IQ players, good athletes, but not freakish. Barnes has potential to be more powerful, Pippen a better raw athlete."
"Nahh. He is literally like Scottie Pippen. Both around the same height with the same wingspan, both have huge hands. Both play the point forward role. Both versatile as defenders, good passers and decent footwork in the post. Both not great shooters. Although Pippen did develop that transition three and Barnes is already very physically developed, it took Pippen a couple of years to add some muscle mass and get stronger. Barnes already looks like a man and can only get bigger and stronger. If he develops a legit 12-15 jumper, he can become a monster on offense."
"I was really surprised by it because there was a lot of Suggs talk + seeing him during MM + the logic around what happens post-Lowry (and if FVV goes).  It was more disappointment cause you have that idea that Suggs is it, much less so about not believing in Barnes.  But after the draft, watched some analysis videos, particularly the David Thorpe videos (where he was really bullish on Scottie, and broke down the strengths, leadership, ability to energize his team, and upside), that got me excited about him.  Example - https://youtu.be/x4jNHC_n2YU"
And Raptors fans don't need to post 20 Scottie Barnes posts every day.  Yet here we are.
That’s not a photo of Scottie Barnes making the “BANG!!!” hand gesture…!
Scottie Barnes is the real deal.
Scottie Barnes.
Hot Take: Scottie Barnes as a rookie is already developed as much as year 3 or 4 Giannis
Scottie Barnes just blowing everyone's expectations out of the water

"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Scottie Barnes. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Scottie. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
I want Scottie Barnes to father my children.

Scottie Barnes bout to fuck around and win ROY. Crazy how much he makes this team go as a rookie. His impact is massive on both ends!

Raptors fans can't speak for 10 seconds without mentioning Scottie Barnes.
"As an honest Nuggets fan since birth, I speak for everyone when I say Scottie Barnes is LeBron, Magic Johnson, and Giannis combined. I am an unbiased Nuggets fan btw, I only post on the Raptors subreddit because their fans are so likeable."
Oh boy another Scottie Barnes post   Get out the lube it’s time to furiously masturbate
"GGWP Raps, you guys are always tough to play. Scottie Barnes is really good and he's only going to get better ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Desmond Bane is so good at basketball. JJJ is also good at basketball."
Is Desmond Bane someone that could be a solid 2nd option someday?  Looking forward to this Raptors squad once Gary Trent Jr and OG Anunoby are both back.. Scottie Barnes looks great
Apparently Scottie Barnes?
"Scottie ""Silver Lining"" Barnes"
Scottie Barnes 3/6 from 3 and that's the only thing I'm choosing to notice about this game
Big fucking W. That was a block party. JJJ was scary today especially. Bane was awesome. Jones' steals were great. Brooks went 2019 - 2020 mode quite a bit (yikes). Clarke was amazing. Mr.Do Something had a tale of 2 games.   Scottie Barnes was clutch af. Yuta was hurting us too but it's nice to see him do well. Siakam and VanVleet were struggling (thankfully).  GG WP.
I enjoyed watching Scottie Barnes at least

Is Scottie Barnes
"You'd have to give up a lot, probably Scottie Barnes. JV probably fits well with Zion and if they aren't committing to that then you need to give up a young player because that means they gave up on keeping Zion."
Scottie Barnes &gt; Lemickey
"Pulling trades to upgrade the roster is a pretty bad idea right now. This is a team that needs to be built through the draft. The starting 5 has been quite good this season but the depth is near non-existent, which is something that can be rectified by the draft. I think the team will see steady improvement over the next couple years from players developing+getting more talent into the team.   Aside from that, the team is insanely inexperienced. Most teams go through highs and lows (except the Spurs for like 20 years). It takes time to build back, especially if you’ve given up as much talent as the Raptors did to win the championship. We have a potential cornerstone in Scottie Barnes. The fanbase just has to be patient. The east is a bloodbath rn. Just sit back and enjoy the ride for now."
"I think Scottie Barnes makes Siakam expendable.  One trade I've been kicking around is Siakam for Sabonis + Jeremy Lamb. Raptors get a center, Pacers get off of the two-big experiment with a proper 4."
When Scottie Barnes shoots 7/16 in a loss and was a -22 🔥🔥🔥🔥
He had Scottie Barnes on him for a decent amount of the game as well.  Take that how you want to.
SCOTTIE FUCKING BARNES IDC WE LOST
those scottie barnes highlights really slowed down huh
Scottie Barnes 3-5 from three so far… he’s improving.
why does scottie barnes only have 5 shots.  i really hope they get him more aggressive by the end of the season
Scottie Barnes with the **electric** 5/1/2 on 2/4 shooting and a game worst -14 🔥🔥🔥  Put his name on the ROTY trophy already 🗣💯
Scottie Barnes is a future Hofer  Put some respect next to his name

"Potential Lineups:  Toronto – Fred VanVleet, Svi Mykhailiuk, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa  Boston – Dennis Schroder, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford  Not very promising for us"
he is Scottie fucking Barnes you know his name!!!!
"Well if you take out Cade, Scottie Barnes, and Mobley you can get a punchers chance for wins against the Cavs, Raptors, and probably a decent shot vs Pistons. Houston might be tanking. Orlando is in a slump. Probably split a series with the Spurs.   You would need to have faced the injurened / in a slump Lakers, Kings, Pelicans, and Dame in a slump Blazers to get some random split the series wins.   All this to barely make the play ins if you are lucky in the East"
"72 percent of Mobley's baskets are assisted (oops, quick passes, etc). Compared to Scottie where only 38 percent of his baskets are assisted. So while they both put up similar points, Barnes obviously is the better creator for himself."
Is Scottie Barnes I fear but Mobley is a stud
better than Scottie Barnes
"Barnes in a span of a few months overhauled his shot mechanics where he has a passable midrange and is shooting free throws at a much higher percentage than college. Most nights he is at least the second or third best player on the team. Even with a poor shooting game, Scottie can contribute with his passing and defense.  Physically, Barnes is likely to pack even more muscle over time and be able to use his post skills even more effectively and hopefully avoid injury. With Cade, Green and Mobley, I don't know if they can add much bulk, which will limit what they're capable of. I think Scottie will be the most physically dominant player from the top 5 and if he develops an average 3 and midrange, he will at minimum be MVP contender whereas the others likely will be all stars."
Scottie Barnes has a chance of being a Kawhi Leanord type player
"If Barnes' offense keeps developing like it looks like it might...he's got the highest ceiling. But if it doesn't, and he winds up as a phenomenal 2-way guy that's a 2nd or 3rd option? That is still a damn good outcome. I don't know what the average outcome is for Jalen Green. I think it's below Barnes'. That doesn't mean Scottie is guaranteed to have a better career, but I think on average, Green winds up worse. I could be wrong.   Cade's passing is going to make him have the highest offensive ceiling. IDK if he can ever be the defender Scottie is."
Scottie Barnes
"No, by a lot. I prefer Scottie and would rather have him going forward (he is on my team so the bias is strong) but their defense isn't close right now if ever. Scottie as it stands is not a great help defender as he gets lost in the scheme sometimes and has a tendency to ball watch. He also, despite being smaller, is not able to hold the perimeter the way Mobley can. TBF, though, Barnes is tasked with defending the point of attack way more often so Nurse shows supreme confidence in his ability. However, Mobley's rim protection alone puts him in an entirely different class as a defender right now"
&gt; physically dominant Scottie Barnes is. He's 20 years old and he's ragdolling grown ass men in the NBA.  I will never get over what he did to Jarrett Allen. That was fucking mental.
THIS. Scottie Barnes has been an absolute delight (did not expect him to be this good this fast). But Dalano has been amazing as a 46th pick. Plays with so much confidence and swagger. And him being a hometown talent is just the cherry on top.
"I've just been impressed by how physically dominant Scottie Barnes is. He's 20 years old and he's ragdolling grown ass men in the NBA. I can't imagine what he'll be like at 26. In terms of who's been disappointing, I think both Jalens have struggled but i that's due to playing being ball dominant guards. The modern NBA game takes a couple years to really learn especially for guards so no wonder they struggle with shooting."

Scottie Barnes is doing both for stretches already.
"1. Luka 2. Ja 3. Tatum 4. SGA 5. Trae 6. Zion 7. Ant 8. Melo 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Anunoby   Bias might’ve shown a little with those last two, but I don’t think either is completely unreasonable"
"Raptors drafting Scottie Barnes instead of Jalen Suggs. The media and a lot of fans were questioning the Raptors choice and it looks like they picked the right player. Scottie has cooled down a bit with Siakam and others coming back, but his stats are a bit better than Suggs so far, averaging 14.8/8.4/3.3. Suggs is averaging 12.1/3.4/3.6."
I bet a substantial amount on Scottie Barnes ROY because I'm a massive Homer. So far so good.
"Cade’s gonna be a nightly triple double threat (he already is). Once his shot is consistent it’s pretty easy to see multiple all stars &amp; all-NBA’s for the vegan man, just a well rounded player that’s good at everything even defence.   Mobley’s length, skill, defensive IQ, passing ability/court vision &amp; soft touch is every team’s wet dream in a big man. He’s also almost a lock for all stars &amp; all-NBAs, and will definitely contend for DPOYs.   Scottie Barnes has a ton of upside due to his monstrous frame - not to mention his skill. He’s a little too unselfish to a fault for me to consider him a future bonafide superstar, but his upside is certainly there, as a do-it-all forward that connects the offence and the defence by himself. He could play the Draymond role quite easily.    Jalen Green might not have as much upside cause of how one-dimensional he is - a pure scorer - but man can you see stardom when his shit works out right.   Then shoutout to Kuminga who got crazy potential - I see a world in which my man becomes a Jaylen Brown type, a true 2-way star - and also big shoutout to Franz Wagner, a less athletic Scottie Barnes but better on both ends.   Not to mention Sengun, such a talented big man workin down in that low block or operating in the short roll, his potential is sky high. It might be limited due to his height (only 6’9) but his passing skill is crazy, handling is nice, and IQ well beyond his years. Gotta work on his fouling tho, which will differentiate him from a starter to a backup."
"He sure did.   But I just don’t see that as Mobley carrying them as there is a good argument to be said that he wasn’t even the best player on his team that night.   Compare his best game to someone like Scottie Barnes against the Celtics. Barnes was in a matchup against Tatum, and Barnes was the best player on the court that night for either team. He played great defence and was the best offensive player on either team."
Precious Achuiwa plays like he has ball hog gloves on  Scottie Barnes is just zero calorie Ben Simmons with a personality  Chris Boucher being employed is just nepotism on a national scale
"Literally everyone on ops list. (Hero is close). Hell, I’ll take Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley over fox at this point even, I’ve seen enough."
"I claimed the warriors should’ve traded up to take Scottie Barnes, and that he should’ve been taken 4th by the raptors over Jalen Suggs. I got absolutely flamed for it due to him being “offensively inept”, but look where we are now haha"
2 weeks before the draft I opined that Scottie Barnes might actually be the best player in the draft.  After the draft my fellow Raptors fans were freaking out. I defended the pick saying the Raptors clearly have a type. They saw how long and athletic worked with Kawhi Leonard and just wanted a team full of that.
Poku  Bol  Scottie barnes
Scottie Barnes was the right choice
Scottie Barnes taking ROTY. I was stoked on him since draft night and he's so fun to watch.
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
Scottie Barnes being a potential Roty contender. A lot of Raps fans were furious they drafted him but man they had no idea.
"By the way, it's relatively simple to search it for whomever you'd like. Go to the link I posted above, then click ""Advanced Filters,"" click +Add Custom Filter, change the Field from Player to Team, and enter in TOR.  If you do that, you'll see   OG: 182 DFGA, -3.0% | Scottie Barnes: 232, +4.6% | Pascal Siakam: 94 DFGA, +5.1% (small sample size)  among others. Precious does well in this stat, while Svi and Birch do not."
Theres a crazy amount of active raptors fans on here. Every time scottie Barnes makes a top play it's instant front page
"Could you get those numbers for OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Pascal Siakam? All the numbers are gonna be not very representative I guess but still would be interested in seeing their impacts."
"Ja, Trae, Ant, Luka, Tatum, Miles Bridges, Ayton, SGA LaMelo, Scottie Barnes."
Yeah he’s actually got amazing physical gifts for the current nba but it’s only because he broke the mold. Prior to him that build was labelled a “tweener”. Scottie Barnes should thank Green
Damn i just made my list and its just scottie barnes. Didn’t expect that tbh
Scottie Barnes
I heard Scottie Barnes Impregnated Selena Gomez just by looking her in the eyes...
Bro it’s ok Scottie Barnes is rlly good the raptors don’t have to worry about Lebron anymore chillllll
Scottie Barnes would never let his team shoot sub-30 from three 😤😤

Gary Trent &amp; Scottie Barnes will have a word
Nobody’s stopping you to post highlights of your own team and players. Just look at the Raptors fanbase and Scottie Barnes
How many buzzer beaters today??  Scottie Barnes    Jordan Poole   PG13   Giddey
"I think Sam Vecenie called Scottie Barnes a no level scorer, never heard that about Giddey."
Scottie Barnes!!!
"Bro fuck what others say. We will post as many Barnes highlights as we want, the reddit engine up votes and down votes the vids that are worth it.  Just because some other fans cry there is too many Scottie posts, doesn't mean the 25 years of no coverage of Raps on TNT or ESPN will be erased. We getting our due."
Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes!!
Scottie Barnes!
Scottie Barnes!
Scottie barnes?
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes is a Toronto Raptor
Scottie Barnes’ hair makes him look like he runs faster than he actually is lol
Scottie Barnes
"Its actually quite the opposite for them Scottie Barnes IG BIO says ""6'9 PG"" and they have Vanvleet,Gary Trent and Malachi Flynn, their forwards outside of OG and Siakam are pretty weak and Boucher is actually 28 so not young at all"
"maxey.  if i'm nick nurse, i already have a solid youngish big in boucher AND scottie barnes coming in this season, whereas my guard situation is rough whether or not lowry stays."
Scottie Barnes
"All I see are people saying that he's legit and then can't provide any actual news he's broken outside of the Raptors taking Barnes of which he had to say:  ""And for the record, we have not reported the Raptors are definitively taking Scottie Barnes at No. 4"""
OG  GTJ  Scottie Barnes  Dalano Banton  Precious
"I'm not sure about the reliability of the sources, but we did hear it from a number of different sources (inlcuding u/kayembeee who gave a very in-depth description of what happened. This user also accurately predicted the Scottie Barnes pick so they do have some degree of credibilty)"
According to this sub Scottie Barnes already might be better than Ben Simmons so it's hard to say how he could be worse next season.
trade him for Scottie Barnes.
"&gt;Lowry has long been intrigued with joining Heat star Jimmy Butler and the Miami organization, and now Miami has maneuvered to have two key elements of a possible sign-and-trade package -- guard Goran Dragic and forward Precious Achiuwa -- to offer the Raptors once talks can ensue at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, sources said.  &gt;The Heat picked up the option on Dragic's $19.4 million contract for the 2021-2022 season, making him an ideal contractual fit to include in talks to make a deal possible with the Raptors. A market exists for the Raptors to move Dragic, 35, onto a new team, including the Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans, sources said.  &gt;Achiuwa, a well-regarded 2020 first-round pick out of the University of Memphis, showed significant promise in his rookie season and would serve as a sweetener to Toronto to facilitate a sign-and-trade deal, sources said. Miami could add draft assets to a package, too.  &gt;Dragic has been a longtime mentor to Mavericks star Luka Doncic, both natives of Slovenia. They also share an agent, Bill Duffy of BDA Sports. The Raptors have Fred Van Vleet returning at point guard, and drafted playmaker Scottie Barnes out of Florida State with the No. 4 pick in Thursday's NBA draft.  Some form of a 3 team deal looks most likely."
That makes sense then. However on an unrelated note I really doubt Scottie Barnes ever plays PG in the nba. I think he’ll be a great player but point guard just isn’t his skill set. Great passer but I don’t think the handle and jump shot will threaten an nba defense at all from the point guard position. He reminds me a lot of dray
Scottie Barnes without the length and defense
"Lakers are going to have a bounce back season. 2020 people didn't believe them as much, but they proved that, almost fully healthy, they are an absolute force on defense and a healthy LeBron can turn any roster into a competent offensive roster. I don't think Russ will be that bad of a fit and he'll adjust well into his role, and a lot of veterans are going to play an important role on a championship run. They're also trading for Hield or a certified marksman or 2 this offseason,  I also think Davion Mitchell will be ROTY, Scottie Barnes will end up being the best player in the draft and Neemias Queta was the steal of the draft"
"Impressions of Simmons' value are all over the place right now. Some people see a player with a poor attitude who is so flawed that teams have to be carefully constructed to hide his weaknesses and they still may cost you in clutch moments. And he's paid a huge amount of money. Others see a long list of achievements for a player of his age and a shitload of undeniable talent.  Personally I'm at the other end of the scale to Morey in how I value Simmons. I wouldn't give up anything of significant value for him and his contract, and that includes the potential of Scottie Barnes. Which is not to say that Barnes will necessarily ever be better than Simmons."
Scottie Barnes
"On my team specifically, Scottie Barnes"
"He said that it was looking like the Raptors were going to pick Scottie Barnes at 4th pick, everyone was so sure it was going to be Suggs and, well, you know the rest, lol."
Just here to say I’m a Scottie Barnes truther when this thread gets brought up again in !RemindMe 3 years
You okay bud. I see you're posting about the Bucks winning the Finals again. You've been doing that a lot lately. The /r/nba community is worried about you. It's not healthy obsessing over it. I'm sure Toronto will win again someday. That Scottie Barnes was a great pick yesterday. I'm sure he will have a bright future. It's going to be okay. Go Raptors.
It's clear to me now after watching this why the Raptors took Scottie Barnes over Jalen Suggs he has a relationship with Cade Cunningham so if the pistons can't win with Cunningham build a decent team around him he will want to exit why not play with a former team mate. Raptors playing the long game.
Hopefully he made the right call about Scottie Barnes too heh
Toronto drafted Scottie Barnes. It's getting crowded with with him and Og. Now would be the time to move on from Siakam and get value.
"Don’t forget the future MVP who I definitely didn’t root against in the draft, Scottie Barnes. He’s going to be a GOAT in 2 years."
"So since the 2016 draft there are a few candidates  * Raptors got: Siakam,Vanvleet,OG,Terence Davis,Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes * Heat got: Bam,Herro,Robinson,Precious and Nunn * Sixers: Simmons,Fultz,Thybulle and Maxey  But I think its the celtics: Brown,Tatum,Williams,Grant,Langford and Pritchard"
"I was against him at the start, but he was right about Toronto and Scottie Barnes (even though he was wrong about Ben Simmons). He seems credible enough."
So a person that’s been connected to Barnes as a player comp for almost 8 months has nothing to do with Scottie. Word
Draymond wishes he was as good as Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes would never 😤
Aron Baynes died so that Scottie Barnes could live
I'm looking forward to that 2019 u19 USA team who *dominated* everyone in their tournament:  Tyler Halliburton   Jalen Green   Cade Cunningham   Jalen Suggs   Evan Mobley   Scottie Barnes  Those Suggs/Green and Halliburton/Green lineups were lethal.
Scottie bang Barnes
not true. we leaked scottie barnes bc we knew you wanted him. didn’t want you to trade down to 6 and lose the chance at suggs.
He got the Scottie Barnes pick right so now he's just throwing darts at a wall.
that’s how i feel about the process of developing barnes. looking back at how raw og x pascal were and where the organization helped pushed those guys too.  scottie is already way ahead of those guys at this respective point. i’m excited for this kid.
That's the man who got the scottie barnes pick right. Put some respect on his name. Also didnt he do an ama that they double check their sources or some shit?
"&gt;it’s greatly exaggerated the impact of a workout performance leading up to the draft.  Utah and other teams had NO IDEA who Donovan Mitchell was. Utah GM is on record saying, if anyone drafts this kid before us, im firing the everyone present @ this workout cuz it was leaked to another team. Thats how impactful Mitchell's workout was for Utah.   I think you saying workout preformances greatly exaggerates the process is an exaggeration. Way too much of a blanket statement. Certainly outliers can exist. Bam is another pick that happened likely because of his workout preformance...and now we have Scottie Barnes on this list too. Obviously a great workout =/= stardom, but it is very clearly an important part of the scouting process"
"If that’s your point, Scottie Barnes is literally a 6’9” two way point guard. He projects to fit into that “QB” role better than Suggs."
The two people im high on: Josh giddey and scottie barnes  Guess we're thinking the same haha
I was always high on Giddey. He's such a great passer and he understands a lot about basketball at 18.   I'm also high on Scottie Barnes (and loved him going so early) and Sengun.
"I still remember when we were so disappointed in the lottery, the sub ""talked themselves into settling for"" Scottie Barnes. We would have imploded if we gave up extra assets to pick at #4 a projected #6 all along."
Scottie Effin Barnes. Let’s goooo!
Cade Cunningham for Scottie barnes
"SPICY HOT INCOMING  Cade has a relatively low ceiling and will likely end up as a nice role player, on the Wiggins tier of #1 picks. He's a nice player, but probably not someone teams will ever double or game plan around.  Scottie Barnes biggest bust risk of the top guys. It will take good coaching to develop him, not someone who will throw him to the wolves and expect 20/5/5 against grown men.  Kispert is a total dreamboat with an Amazon girlfriend, but will be lucky to hang around the league as a 3 and D guy playing &lt;20 mins/game.  Suggs is the best at actually playing basketball. 1 million BBIQ. Tragic that he wound up in fucking orlando instead of Toronto or OKC. My pick for ROY."
"You should never draft for need. First of all, Lowry is 36 years old. By the time Scottie Barnes is worthy of starting, if ever, Lowry will be retired. Secondly, Barnes certainly can* run point but that doesn’t mean TOR intends to let him. Still, it’s useful to have secondary playmakers in the NBA."
"I’m not offended at all,  I didn’t just say strong I mentioned his height and length as well. Do I  have to explain why Scottie Barnes is a good defender in general, (I thought we both agreed on that!) or just why he can guard bigs? He’s closer in size to most NBA centers than he is to most guards, why is that such a stretch for you?  Agree to disagree then, IMO OG and Scottie are true 1-5 defenders, and Siakam is more of a team defender that you can switch onto anyone without him being a huge target."
"Dude's honestly been right on quite a few things. Pels/Memphis trade, Westbrook Lakers, Scottie Barnes to the Raps, etc."
"Scottie Barnes will be in the league for 5 years tops.  I actually have no idea but so far the mold of players with his scouting profile (long and athletic with a bad shot) have often not worked out.  Everyone thinks they’re getting Jaylen Brown/Kawhi Leonard, but just as often you get Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson"
"yes but your statement was ""capping off these dudes potential...""  That's literally what scouting and drafting is. You look at what they've shown, their physical measurements and stats, their workouts and you predict their cap. That's what every single GM does.  Why do you think dudes get drafted in the second round ? Because their potential has been capped before they even play in training camp.   but if you want to talk Scottie Barnes specifically, the guy you replied to literally didn't say anything about height as the reason why one guy has superstar potential over the other. Granted he didn't list any reasons at all but i just wanted to reply to your obvious sarcastic comment.   Listen if you see some dumbass on this subreddit only listing height as why one is better than the other, then flame away. But i don't believe any front office in the league would take Scottie Barnes over Suggs solely because of height."
"&gt;  a complete project on the offensive side.  That's the point of drafting young guys with high potential  This isn't about drafting a win now come in and go player. Most lottery picks don't come in and become instant offensive players. It's literally like 2-3 players every year that have that kind of impact.   There have been lots of high drafted players that didn't show amazing offence in college and turned out to be very good offensive players in the NBA.   I honestly see nothing wrong with waiting a few years to develop this guy. It depends on what your opinion is about the team. IF you think this team just need to plug in some new players and it'll be a playoff team, then you probably want a ready for NBA player drafted. I believe we need a complete rebuild and im fine with waiting and developing players.   Being decent in college doesn't mean you're going to be good in the NBA. Your critics of Scottie Barnes is valid but you also can't just assume Suggs is a surefire bonafide star and point to his college production when this isn't a metric of whether someone will be good or not.   I don't really care who we got between the two, they both have the potential to be really good. If Scottie Barnes turns into Ben Simmons or Draymond Green like the guy below says, then that's honestly amazing. Im not going to sit here and pretend like Ben Simmons a perennial all star, all defense player is some sort of let down. A 3 DPOY of the year and one of the reasons a historic GSW Team (before KD) hummed is some sort of let down.   I would love it if Scottie Barnes turns into those guys."
Assuming he’s a Raptors fan they took Scottie Barnes
Scottie Too Hottie Barnes.
"*Scottie Barnes: ""I like to talk about a lot of different things. I love basketball to death but I know how to conversate with people. I like to get to know people. I'm very open to that. I like having conversations with new people and meeting new people.""*  He's like Bizarro OG. The ying to his yang"
Sources say Scottie Barnes will be joining Steph Curry on Holey Moley.
Maybe a factor but Raptors GM also said they have been watching Scottie Barnes since he was about 16 or 17. So I don't think this is based on the workout alone. I assume all teams send scouts to look for and evaluate younger players years before they are drafted
"I AIN'T NEVAH HEARD OF JALON SUGMA, SCOTTIE BARNES IS THE FUTURE!"
"The lean on his shot is the most correctable thing, though.  I feel like it would be more of a concern if he didn't have correctable issues with his shot.  But, yeah, the lack of size and elevation on his shot probably hurts.  I do think he is a more naturally talented shooter than Davion Mitchell, shot better pre-NCAA and better touch.  Like, he is a real ""if he shoots"" guy.  But he is an ""if he shoots"" guy that actually has some percentage chance of shooting.  This isn't a Scottie Barnes situation.  I do agree that the limitations scoring from the field hurt.  The terrible defense hurts.   But he has a clear NBA level talent for playmaking - getting to the rim and passing.  Josh Primo went 12th without a single plus NBA skill.  Many players that went ahead of Sharife are simultaneously worse and older."
"As someone with kids, I think Scottie Barnes is living the life"
Scottie Barnes is the next kawhi Leonard
"I would've been ok with the Warrior trade.   Honestly we could've traded Pascal and the 4th for the 7th and 10th, still picked up Scottie at the 7th pick.   Scottie/FVV/Malachi   GTJ/FVV   Wiggins/Ziaire or BPA   Boucher/Barnes   Wiseman   I'm high on Wiseman. I don't think a lot of Raptors fans understand how special of a specimen he is because of the amount of long athletic guys we've had come through the program, but he's special. His foot speed is absurd for a guy his size."
"Do the New York Knicks have a player development program &amp; coaching staff as good as Toronto's? Furthermore, another comparison is the work ethic &amp; coachability of a Kevin Knox compared to a Scottie Barnes."
" Scottie played point in college though, and was primarily defending other guards.  NBA guards aren't college guards, but then you could just make that argument for any good perimeter defender in college regardless of height.  Scottie's anthro is also off the charts. He has a 9 foot standing reach, and was among the fastest shuttle runs and lane agility times (like top 5 in each). Just by watching him in college, he absolutely can defend guards full time.  Siakam and OG aren't guys you would have chasing point guards around screens, but in a pick and roll switch situation they are perfectly fine, great even.   As for centers, we had OG guarding Embiid this year, which has to be the ultimate litmus test for being able to guard centers. He held him to 6/20, and the team as a whole shot 38% so its not like we sold out on Embiid either.   I know the term is overused, but I think its fair to say for at least OG and Barnes that they are 1-5 defenders, wheras Siakam is more of an elite team defender that can ""contain"" every position."
"I agree, but they now have 3 big wings in OG, Siakim, and Barnes.   On this current years roster, I don’t think Scottie Barnes would start. If Lowry leaves then maybe everyone gets shifted down a position (FVV, OG, Siakim, Barnes, Center), but it’s also possible that they get another PG in free agency to replace Lowry.   Most teams have 2 big forwards starting. You can do 3, but it’s just less common"
"Speculation here: I think they brought in Scottie and he measured 7'4 wingspan, huge hands, lock up defender and had Kawhi flashbacks. Then they made up their mind right then and there and expected Suggs to blow them away which he didn't and that solidified their choice.   Given that OKC and ORL were willing to take Barnes that confirmed to TOR that Barnes blew them away in workouts too made that choice easier."
They all had the same source: Scottie Barnes! The new Littlefinger
"if we trade siakam i think we should just tank tbh no other player on that team will be good enough to make our team competitive enough for more than the second round. you think FVV or OG are ready to take double teams as the first option? Scottie may be our future but hes still not going to be ready to be a first option for at least 1-2 years. If we trade siakam then we should just tank get a couple more good young guys, develop gtj barnes and og then compete"
"Yes last year he was our 5 for most of the season, and even took on guarding Embiid and did a reasonable job. He's got strong legs and hips where power comes from. OG also bulked up for the role - he was jacked last year. OG is 6'8"" but bulkier than Kawhi. After looking at Scottie Barnes he's got a big frame and broad shoulders. I think he can add another 10 lbs of muscle and be a really physical player like OG but we'll see what Raps' plans are for him."
"It's pretty joke, when you reserve that it becomes, Scottie Barnes....lol"
"I actually watched Florida state a ton. I love Scottie Barnes, like LOVE him as a prospect. But he’s not Ben Simmons level as an athlete. Ben is fluid, explosive and fast as hell and a much better ball handler to boot."
He’s not more athletic than Ben are you on crack? Ben is one of the best open court athletes in the league. Scottie Barnes is a good athlete but he does have a rigidity to him.
his games reminds me of a cross between Matt Barnes and Scottie Pippen
“The Raps never leak”  Yet we’ve been hearing rumours about them picking Scottie Barnes for weeks only to find out it’s true lol
&gt; No one’s saying he has to be a fulltime point guard   That’s literally what this argument is about…  Scottie Barnes is not the Raptor’s PG of the future as stated by the original comment. If you agree then why you getting mad?
Sounds like Siakam is regressing without Kawhi to carry him.   Probably why Masai drafted Scottie Barnes.
"Scottie Barnes made more 3s in his 1 year at FSU (11) than Simmons has made in college and the pros, combined (6)."
My point is 2 years ago scottie barnes was on arguably the most stacked HS team of all-time and was already recognized as a huge national prospect. Not like someone with his username at that point had to be him.
"This article has golden state as the loser and toronto as the winner.   scottie barnes is the epitome of a raptor, sure, but holy hell how do you pass up on the cowboy suggs? likewise, aside from his attitude, kuminga could have cracked top 4 and a lot of people mocked him 5 on average. Hes a prospect sure, but warriors took best player available on a player that fell almost solely on his attitude. kind of like when demarcus cousins fell to 5.   this article just seems ass backwards to me"
Scottie Barnes played pg in college
"You know, I’m something of a Scottie Barnes myself"
The Raptors core is a superstar away from being a contender again. Having a solid starter or a borderline all-star won't cut it. Masai must have seen superstar potential in Scottie Barnes. Scottie is clearly proud to play for Toronto and has a great mentality. I can't wait to see what he's got.
"I think it's a matter of ""absolute best-case scenario"" evaluation. In that evaluation, Scottie is the second-coming of Draymond Green (and hell, maybe he even learns to shoot!). That's an easy HoF player and defensive anchor small-ball center with high-playmaking upside.   The Raptors have a nice system in place and if anyone can get Barnes to reach his fullest potential, it's that system coached by Nurse surrounded by shooters.  I think Suggs has a better chance at being a multi-time all-star, while maybe Barnes has a better chance of superstardom?"
"Because if you’re committed to Scottie Barnes, you’ve made Siakam redundant as far as your long-term plans go. He still has value, but clearly he’s not apart of their future and expecting a huge package for him like Lillard or Beal would get is unrealistic"
&gt;Assuming Magic weren’t trading up from 5 to 4 (because why would you)  To pick Scottie Barnes?
"Yup. But hey, I'd bet if you guys picked Barnes instead of Mobley you'd be on full meltdown mode.  I hope the best for the incoming rookies, but Scottie is ROTY."
So basketball aside I’m Scottie Barnes?
As good as Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes combined
How good do you think Scottie Barnes can be?  Can he outperform Suggs?
Scottie Barnes :)
Scottie Barnes  Think he was slotted 6th but even then it wasn't set in stone or anything like the top 3 or what should have been the top 4
Scottie Barnes is local. They develop kids for the next level and have two number on picks coming out already. 7 of them out the lottery. Boyle gets them right.
Good times thinking back to Franz absolutely owning Scottie Barnes. People really sleeping still on all the tools in his bag and his overall game when combining that with his height/wingspan/IQ.
Scottie Barnes isn't a first team all defender though...
"I think we would have if Kuminga was off the board. If Scottie Barnes was still on, for example, or Giddey, I think we would have slid back to 10 and hoped for Mitchell (even though he did end up going 9 to SAC which feels early and unexpected)  We still could have had Krispert, Kyle Anderson/Bane, and Moody which would be nice.  Idk if that offer was still on the table when the 7 pick came up, and even if it was I don’t think we’d pass on Kuminga"
&gt; I’ve seen Scottie Barnes highlight reel   Perfect summary of this sub
Scottie Barnes will be Andre Iguodala  Jalen Suggs will be Jrue Holiday
I had Warriors taking Moody at 7 on my mock fwiw. Who would have thought fucking Raptors took Scottie fucking Barnes at 4 and Thunder took Giddey at 6!
"It's less about Scottie Barnes and more the fact that they didn't trade the pick. I just don't see a team with Siakam, FVV and OG being competitive in the east and the #4 pick was their only path to acquiring a star to make a push with the current roster  My guess is they're going to try to re-tool (not re-build) and focus on being competitive in 2-3 years."
"Siakam defended center and it wasnt that good, OG was better on centers though. Also Siakam is not an iso guy, our half court offense will be trash. I like scottie barnes tho, I want to see this team together before making final judgemetns"
"This is a fantastic pick. Raiquan Gray was the best player on FSU last year despite the #4 overall pick Scottie Barnes playing for us.   Gray is a thick point forward who has improved monumentally each year at FSU. He's improved his shot and should be able to hit at least 35% from NBA 3. He's a selfless playmaker who really improved his defense and athleticism this past year.   It'll be hard to earn a lot of minutes on this Nets team, but Gray can be a fantastic bench player. He reminds me a lot of a Boris Diaw type of player."
"Coach Hamilton is an excellent defensive coach. Scottie Barnes has a similar skill set to {{SYNTAX ERROR: EXPECTED ')' GOT '}' playerDB.selectRandom(height=81, skinColor=""medium""}}.     Both Barnes and Grant Hill have similar builds and intangibles."
"Source for what? His free throw shooting? His game logs are on [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/scottie-barnes-1.html). I did the math myself, but you are welcome to check me!  On his passing/defense/rebounding/personality? I watched every game he played myself, so I’d say I’m the source. But Sports Reference supports it. He had a 31.6% assist percent, which was higher than Suggs or Cunningham. He jumps a lot of passing lanes and his 3.4% steal rate supports that. His 3.6 Defensive BPM is nice and his Offensive BPM of 4.3 is better. FSU was much better when he was on the court."
Scottie Barnes is 6’9 Wilt Chamberlin so I think you know the answer
"As a Celtics fan, it pains me to say it but Scottie Barnes and Raptors might run the East again :("
Scottie barnes shooting 59% from 3
lmao idk he looked like Scottie Barnes to me.
Scottie Barnes in the 2nd half was like Thanos assembling the infinity stones. Generational.
Aight. I hereby declare Scottie Barnes of Toronto   #NOT A BUST
"OG is better at leveraging his strength to score inside compared to Barnes at this point. Scottie's handles are obviously better overall but OG has a quicker first step and is better at creating separation/beating his man 1 on 1 so far.   Scottie needs to figure out how to leverage his body and athleticism on offense the same way he does on defense. He's got the tools, but I don't know how much of that is teachable. It's going to be an uphill battle for him regardless, considering his lack of polish on that end. But here's hoping that he can tie it all together."
Jalen Suggs has a better rookie season than Scottie Barnes.  r/torontoraptors is very understanding and handles it all quite well.
Scottie Barnes will be the 2nd best rookie this year after Jalen Green
"i get what you’re saying, but like the other guy showed many of the rookies are shooting bad in the summer league. if you’re gonna say kuminga has huge bust potential then you’re practically saying some of the other lottery picks including your scottie barnes has huge bust potential as well. this is why you shouldn’t put too much into summer league…"
"Yuta Wantanabe wins MIP , Scottie Barnes wins DPOY,  Kyle wins mvp on the heat and we meet in the conference finals. Goes to 7 games and game 7 goes into 10 overtimes. FVV wins with a 3 at the buzzer when we are down by 2 and then goes over to hug a crying Kyle Lowry, but removes his mask and it turns out he was Kyle Lowry all year, and Miami Kyle is actually mvp Freddy. They kiss as the screen fades to black. They don’t bother playing the finals"
"In a similar boat.  Predraft I was high on Scottie but if we reached past Suggs I wanted it to be Kuminga, because I value offensive upside over defensive upside.  Clearly though the Raptors prefer defense, but also envision a high offensive ceiling for Barnes and I’m starting to see it!"
"Haha well neither did you because you won't answer any questions knowing you don't believe in it yourself. You literally say you choose Curry because of MVP. Now there is more criteria..ok what is the criteria? Why are you choosing Curry over Pippen? Is it personal preference, what about his play makes him better than a 6 foot 8 playmaker, all nba all defense, guards 1 through 5, scores 20 easy player?  And you know well enough being smart that Scottie didn't have a championship caliber team with the Bulls. And only barely got beaten with by the Lakers with 2 superstar hall of famers. So again, where are you trying to compare Curry with Klay, Iggy, Draymond, Barnes to what Scottie had? Because he won with that? Come on haha you know the difference. You know what happens when Curry misses Klay."
“What does Scottie Barnes bring to the table?”
Scottie Barnes the most durable prospect confirmed; we won the draft 👏🙌
Scottie Barnes-OG-Siakam-Boucher-Moses Brown lineup? Lol
I Love Scottie Barnes. I’m not a raps fan and I 10000% wanted them to take him over Suggs.  Ya I said it.   Remind me in 3 years.
Scottie Barnes &gt; Scott Barnes
Least annoying Scottie Barnes hater
"Damn bro why are you so obsessed with Scottie Barnes, he's all over your post history. Chill out on the kid"
Lmao bro you gotta relax this is like the 3rd anti Scottie Barnes post you have made in a row
How are non Raptor fans feeling about Scottie Barnes right now? I want a non rose-colored early impressions since we're all biased as hell.
Man Scottie has had so many almost highlights but I swear I love his motor and effort. I'm so sold on him! I want a Scottie Barnes jersey.
Not embarassing myself as bad as Scottie Barnes in these highlights.  Wanna take an over/under bet on games he plays in his career?  I'm saying &lt;350. You?
I just went to r/NBA new and there were like 3 Scottie Barnes posts on the front page. Which were all actually bad plays LMAO  Like there's literally highlights being shared of this guy blowing dunks and layups. Can't make this up
"Dude literally searched up Scottie Barnes on r/nba, sorted by new, and is talking shit about him in both highlights vids for tonight. Weird ass mf lol"
He's a Scottie Barnes hater believe it or not lmao
"scottie barnes rn gives me some draymond green vibes on both ends, but he can definitely develop to be much more"
"Stop trying to make Scottie Barnes happen OP, it's not gonna happen."
"If Barnes fails to score this game do we start calling him ""Scoreless Scottie""? xD"
I saw it with Scottie Barnes and Kuminga last night as well. #4 pick vs. #7.
"Pascal is a #2 option at best, if he has the right kind of player with him to lead the charge. The man is lethal with an open floor, but if he's double teamed he falls apart and his play making in these scenarios is soft af.   This is why I wish we went with Suggs. They say Barnes has a higher ceiling, but our offense desperately needs someone to take the pressure off of Siakam. Hopefully Scottie matures enough to fill this role, otherwise you are 100% right."
"Seriously, I wonder if they’d keep the same energy if Scottie Barnes forced his way home to Miami lol"
"&gt; Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  The dude has been absolutely everywhere on the defensive end, making incredible reads. Something I think is really unsung about him is how good he's been at rebounding on both sides of the ball. He can have a poor shooting game but still end up with a Draymond double-double just because he's been doing everything else really well."
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher’s defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade’s poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He’s good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can’t create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it’s over. He won’t get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
Only one who shot up was Scottie Barnes who I'm okay with.  Giddey at #6 was a bit of a surprise.
"People in this thread are wildin man, Scottie Barnes is better than Kuminga right now imo, and the Raptors made the right pick."
Scottie Barnes came off the bench at FSU and was virtually a non-factor in the tournament. I think he'll be a good player but don't say he looked good at the college level if he's coming off the bench for FSU while Suggs is hitting game winners in the semi finals for the undefeated zags.
Generation talent Scottie Barnes with a tough game
"A rough shooting night for Kuminga. 18 points on 17 shots.  A bright spot to me is that on defense, he appeared to give Scottie Barnes some troubles."
&gt;Locked down Scottie by a lot  🤡 LOOOL someone link that shot when Barnes shook the shit out of Kuminga
Kuminga is locking down Scottie Barnes damn
Masai is too smart to get this wrong.  I personally loved Kuminga for the Raptors but Scottie Barnes must be the better player long term   Masai doesn't make mistakes
yikes Scottie Barnes shooting form is ugly
Scottie Barnes a bust and Siakam has trash spin moves. Kuminga &gt;
"THATS SCOTTIE ""STEPH CURRY"" BARNES"
Scottie Barnes about to give Kuminga the business
Scottie Barnes speaks to referees with respect and dignity   - Masai probably
"That they like Scottie Barnes more. It's still Summer League, so don't be a dumbass and jump to conclusions."
"And?  We've got promising young prospects in OG, Gary Trent Jr., Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes. Aside from Wiseman, any prospects we got for Siakam would have to fight for minutes with them.  Also, for all of VanVleet's flaws, he's about as close to a cultural replacement as you can get for the juggernaut that was Lowry. Trading Siakam would compromise the franchise's relationship with FVV the same way trading DeMar compromised the relationship with Lowry, except there'd be no Kawhi to wash away the hurt feelings with on-court success."
"Scottie Barnes, OG , &amp; Pascal 3on3 team would be a nasty team based on how you described an ideal team (haven't watched any 3on3)"
"Those attributes are things that can be learned but I think they are the hardest thing to learn.  For example a guy like demar was not a good passer or playmaker.. but developed that to be a pretty good passer and have good decision making ability.. the thing about that is it took damn near 10 years to develop it.  The guys that have it coming in like a lebron, CP3, etc it just makes things soo much easier to impact winning right away.   Personally I think that is what the raptors saw in Scottie Barnes.. a guy who know how to play basketball who has good vision, defend, and have good instincts.. the shooting is something that can be taught much easier then those attributes.  Anyway that’s my two sense"
Damn u/scottie-barnes you really showed me there.
Well their roster now has a glut of forwards and a relative weakness at guard. They seemingly love OG and just drafted Scottie Barnes in the top 5 who is another 3/4. Meanwhile the best SG on their roster is probably Gary Trent Jr.
"I guess Cade, Green, Ben Simmons, Suggs, Mobley, and Scottie Barnes were all in the list?"
in 5 years when scottie barnes becomes one of the best players in the draft come back and comment under this that i was right.
Usman Garuba is on his way from Olympics to claim that title.  But seriously Scottie Barnes had a great game
i am high off Summer League games right now. Aaron Nesmith is Ray Allen with hair. Scottie Barnes is Giannis with thigh high socks. Bol Bol is Jesus in a basketball jersey.
"Which means Garuba is ahead of them in development already.  He’s also only 19, 6’8 with 7’2 wing span.  Scottie Barnes would be the only comparable and he’s a year older than Garuba."
"Cade, Scottie Barnes, and Moses Moody were in 1 team in highschool. That's pretty crazy"
"Remember people, it’s summer league don’t take anything too serious, especially 1 or 2 games of summer league. With that being said. Scottie Barnes 2021 Dpoy,Mvp,Finals,Mvp,Rookie of the year. Book it"
Yeah there was a post about Immanuel Quickley trying to bait a foul on Scottie Barnes
"By that logic, the Raptors ”missed out” on everyone below them in the draft. Jalen Suggs will be a solid player, and as a Raptors fan I was getting hyped for him, but clearly the organization sees more than us.   For the rest of their careers the two players will be compared against each other because of the Raptors decision in the draft, but until we see how they do in real NBA games, over an extended period of time, you cant say they missed out. Surprisingly often, the best player in a draft class is not the highest pick(Kawhi, Giannis), which is why scouting is so important. Perhaps Orlando missed out on Scottie Barnes…"
"&gt;Scottie Barnes signed for 120% of rookie scale, as most picks do.    Has there been any first round pick to sign for &lt;100% of rookie scale?"
KD is both a better shooter and slasher than Dirk but young Dirk wasn't a slouch. I feel like KD is almost like a natural evolution of Dirk. Like LeBron is to Magic or Oscar (or Scottie Barnes? Please let Scottie be that guy! Lmao). Or like Giannis is to David Robinson or Orlando Shaq...or Wilt.
nickname for Scottie Barnes
"I think Raps front office should've had a talk with him to stay out of the media or coach him on what he'd say knowing they're shopping him around – honestly though, he's a vet and should know better.  I think the best alternate universe version of his first message to raptors fans would've started something like, he knows how special wearing no. 7 is, and that he's ready to wear no. 7 for Toronto. He's excited to get to know his teammates and the city, and represent this country both on and off the court. And literally the first photo he posts is him with Scottie Barnes, and Dalano Banton at the jerk chicken joint. A man can dream, instead he's saying he got higher ambitions – we were 4th seed before covid hit the team."
"&gt;Which makes sense but you should always draft BPA  That's how you draft Shabazz Muhammad over Giannis and Jimmer over Kawhi. Sometimes you roll the dice on these crazy athletic lengthy players even if there is a more polished player available. Scottie Barnes is 6'9 with a 7'3 wingspan and has demonstrated that he has the natural feel for defense. With the strength of our development staff and the way our team is built, I think we're a team that should swing for the fences. If the 2010's have taught us anything, it's that we need a clear #1 option to win a championship and the player that has that ceiling is Scottie more-so than Suggs. Suggs can be a great player, multiple All Star but Scottie is the one that has the athletic potential to be a star."
I was mixing him up with Scottie Barnes. On the draft shows on NBA Radio they would always talk about them one right after the other because of where they were expected to be drafted.  *This is what I get for not watching college basketball.*
They tried but you took Scottie Barnes instead /s
I thought Scottie Barnes was the Draymond comp https://www.nbadraft.net/players/scottie-barnes/
He’s just cheering on Scottie. Barnes is friends with the other top recruits  People are crazy reaching with these takes. Why would he ever want to go to Orlando over Toronto? It makes zero sense
I thought Scottie Barnes was supposed to be Draymond Green. turns out it was Suggs all along.
"well it’s just stupid to say right now because everybody with a pulse knows that Franz #1 trait is his versatile defense. they aren’t putting in a super complicated system so his ability to help everywhere and switch onto everybody is minimized   secondly, he’s younger than Scottie Barnes and he was an 83% free throw shooter. everyone knows he needs to work on it, but he’s 19   3rd, summer league has always been about guards. wings and bigs always get docked in summer league because they suffer from the poor playmaking of the summer league guards   4th, it’s literally just one game. anybody who has taken any statistics course knows that isn’t even close to being a big enough of a sample size. so while it’s one thing to say “Steve won’t be good because he sucked at XYZ in college” it’s just dumb af to do it after one summer league game where he’s playing in a brand new system with brand new teammates and brand new rules"
"Honestly, I'm pretty happy with Scottie Barnes. That being said, Suggs would have been just as nice. I look forward to him destroying us whenever we face him."
Raps fans get very annoyed when a player says they don’t wanna play here because we’ve seen so many players do that already. It’s also why we went from crying about not drafting Suggs to praising Scottie Barnes like crazy once he called Toronto his top destination choice
&gt;he showed out in his debut  Scottie Barnes had a great game as well. His defense is just at another level for a rookie. He fit's the Raptors identity perfectly
"Barnes in our system can be special too, idk Suggs probably comes in with a better floor but Scottie is gunna be special i bet.  No need to really do comps until like 3-4 years"
1 game of summer league ah yes. I’m happy for Orlando fans &amp; i’m happy with Scottie.   Someone upset that Barnes didn’t make his way to OKC?
You’re acting like Scottie Barnes didn’t have a great game as well. Both players can be good bruh.
I don't think anyone thought Barnes would be a better player than Suggs right away. Suggs has the highest floor of the top 5 so it's not surprising to see him have a great first game.  Regretting the pick will come in a couple years if Scottie doesn't improve much
FR we really just gonna act like Scottie Barnes didn’t also have a very good debut
Aron Baynes. Man gifted us Scottie Barnes
"Who cares Scottie Barnes absolutely loves Toronto and will be the next Kawhi/Giannis hybrid. Before I get downvoted I'm half joking. But at least the young generation of players thinks highly of Toronto after our championship run. Dragic is an old loser and with an old mindset, fuck him"
"&gt; Scottie Barnes is the next Scottie Pippen  It's funny how often I see this done seriously. Like, yeah, there are some similarities in their build, and even in their game, but nobody would be doing this if his name were Vince Barnes instead or even if he just went by Scott Barnes. It's even crazier than the ""compare guys because they are both the same height and white"" deal, it's the ""compare guys because they have the same spelling of their first name"" level of laziness."
Scottie Barnes was Solid
"I think people really underrated Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs because they were next to Cade and Mobley. Even though both were top 5 picks in comparison to Cade and Mobley they were placed into the ""just categories"":  ""Oh just a scorer.""   ""Oh just a defender.""   ""Oh just a \_\_\_\_.""     Nah, they're ""Just stars."" if you ask me. The same with Scottie Barnes, I thought that guy played great during FIBA but he was placed outside the main 4 and was being overlooked."
Looks like Scottie Barnes
"After some development we can throw Precious in there too, he has huge defensive upside  Lmao, here’s a potential future lineup  Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa."
"On a totally different note, I am stoked to see Scottie Barnes play for ya'll . His energy is so contagious!!!"
"Contextually yall are not in a bad spot at all. Yall are two years removed from a championship. In that time you guys are minus a star point guard, a superstar, and a defensive anchor but still have Siakim, Gary Trent, Vanvleet, OG, and Scottie Barnes. A young core with a lot of championship blood going into the playoffs is a nice place to be in"
"There are 7 east teams with better scoring 1st and better roster construction:  \- Nets  \- Bucks  \- Sixers  \- Bulls  \- Celtics  \- Hawks  \- Heats  They will beat the Raptors in 4-6 games of playoffs. So they are on the same level as Knicks, Wizards and Pacers. Raptors are stuck in ""purgatory"", they are one of the worst places to be in. They are not bad enough to tank nor are they good enough to compete for a playoff seeding. The best move for the Raptors is to blow it up and tank. They can build a team around Scottie Barnes"
The draft day thread everyone was questioning the scottie barnes pick. Even in your guy's subreddit people were questioning it.
Scottie barnes Roy and all nba 3rd team gonna make our fanbase so toxic next year 😁😇
"Man, I don't know I've always been a fan of this guy's playmaking and knew it'd be something people would start seeing sooner than later.  The guy is naturally gifted at finding passing lanes. Watch from the 3:30 point in this video where he makes some great passes against a team with Cade, Scottie Barnes and Day'Ron Sharpe:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4mxb1lwiek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4mxb1lwiek)   Check the FIBA highlights too dude was hitting some clean passes. Same goes for G League. yesterday there was also that trick he got from Sengun and instead of forcing a shot or be caught off guard dude threw *another* touch pass off of that:   [https://youtu.be/o1f4ryAPrT8?t=156](https://youtu.be/o1f4ryAPrT8?t=156)  Then there's the fact that like I mentioned the Rockets looked far better whenever Green bought the ball upcourt or lead the break.  I don't know, eventually at the next level you may have to consider making this guy a heliocentric player."
"No Lowry, spacing isn't the greatest, last year's regression, taking scottie barnes over green, are all some reasons why people don't take them seriously"
"shhh, let them sleep.  Scottie Barnes will wake them from their slumber."
"Worry about your own broken team lol, Barnes will be fine and will be an elite defender off the bat. You know defence is very important, it’s the area which the Mavericks are absolutely atrocious in. You guys could use a Scottie Barnes to defend NBA talent"
Scottie Barnes is 6'8 without shoes and 6'9 with shoes with a 7'4 wingspan according to his latest measurements.  On top of that Barnes attended the combine and Cade obviously didn't to hide his height.  Most players wear a 1 inch to 1.25 inch shoe.  Cade Cunningham is out here wearing 2 inch platforms.
"So, what you're saying is....Scottie Barnes is 6'11?     Next Gen Giannis, let's go!"
PG Cade  SG Jalen Green  SF Scottie Barnes  PF Mobley  C Sengun
"As the first scottiesexual I am officially declaring that in 3 years, Scottie Barnes will be the best player from this class. Stop sleeping on him!!!"
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
"OP referencing Scottie Pippen who shot 6/18 for 17 points, including 0/5 from 3, and 5/9 from the line is the most liberal definition of ""bailing out"" a team mate I've ever seen.  I guess Harrison Barnes bailed out Curry in the finals as well."
"I think so.   Look for PG: We got Vanvleet, Dragic, and Flynn, now I don’t have to explain why Vanvleet is great. Flynn is a good backup and someone who can pick up key minutes while resting Vanvleet. And Dragic is questionable since it’s possible Masai would wanna trade him or something but again, promising vet who brings in that Heat mentality of defence and rough play.   SG: Gary Trent, he’s a dawg. Like a bulldog, he’s great offensively and if Nurse can bring a very strong defending curve into his game (reason why he signed a 3year deal because he wants to ball out and bag an even bigger contract after his deal’s done), David Johnson, a two way player is a developing rookie but the best thing about guards are that all of them are interchangeable except Gary Trent. Vanvleet, Flynn, and Dragic can all create their own shots and playmaking is good.  SF: OG, Gillespie, Banton (OG is AMAZING defensively) Banton and Gillespie are promising due to their size and Gillespie plays Center but you can try to put a squad out there for resting minutes with your last backup as Gillespie as well.   PF: Probably the most exciting position on the squad because we got some titans like Siakam, Scottie Barnes (which yes doesn’t have a great shooting production due to his jumpers but man can run and defend), and ofc interchangeably Boucher as PF as well because this kid is freaking amazing.   C: Thank god we have Khem Birch, Boucher, and Precious, Gillespie. Arguably one of the most underrated Centers squad on a team. They all have great and different skills which can be used in different situations.  Other people like Wainright, Watanabe (great development last year), and new addition Bonga are so vital to this team as well.   So yes, I think they are very underrated partially because the most star players we have is Siakam and Freddy.   As long as Nurse’s diverse coaching rolled in with the squad that Masai is rebuilding with I can def see us making the playoffs and upsetting at least one team.  Idc who Raptors play, defending is going to be elite. Plus, the biggest thing is Raptors can play at Scotiabank Arena, because getting booed in Tampa rolled in Covid really did not do them any good."
Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Kawhi Leonard  Raptors fans know we are just trying to build our own Kawhi.
Brandon Jennings &gt; Kemba Walker &gt; Allen Iverson  TJ McConnell &gt; NBA Rubio &gt; Olympic Rubio  Andrew Bynum &gt; Hassan Whiteside &gt; Andre Drummond  Ben Simmons &gt; Ben Simmons + a therapist &gt; Lebron James  Scottie Barnes &gt; Larry Nance Jr &gt; Draymond Green
Can add scottie barnes as an even earlier version too
"Out of the 2021 rookie class, the most Kawhi-like is probably Scottie Barnes.  I'd do something like: Scottie Barnes -&gt; OG Anunoby -&gt; Kawhi Leonard"
He doesn't have a nickname yet.  But I propose 'The Winter Soldier' for Scottie Barnes.
"Toronto is in a transitionary period, but the question is whether they got more worse than the Hornets got better?  The Raptors guard rotation is weaker than the Hornets', though I think you are overestimating Ball slightly and underestimating VanVleet slightly.  I think its hard to argue that the Hornets frontcourt is better, Siakam and OG are more versatile options than Washington/Hayward; and I have no confidence that Hayward will stay healthy long enough to revert back to old Hayward and make it a contest between him and Pascal.  Centre is basically a wash between each team.  Last year the Hornets won 6 more games than the Raptors.   The respective factors in their issues were Lamelo's Injury and Hayward's for the Hornets.  COVID absences, Pascal/Kyle injuries and playing ~70 away games for the Raptors.  We lose Kyle over the offseason, gain Scottie Barnes, Dragic and Precious Achiuwa, likely a net negative in win shares.  Hornets get Oubre, Plumlee, Bouknight and Kai Jones, I would score that as neutral, maybe +2 win shares.  My confidence comes from believing that a healthy Raptors team that gets to play out of Toronto increases wins by 8-10. Whether that is enough remains to be seen, any gap in projected wins is made up by homerism.  My greater point is that you refer to teams getting significantly better in the last 2 years, for the Hornets their improvement is Lamelo Ball, Hayward and improvement from Rozier. In the last 4 years they finish 10th, 9th, 10th and 10th in the East. Their success this year depends on Lamelo growth, Rozier maintenance/growth and Hayward health, none of their acquisitions are big needle movers.  I don't think they belong in the conversation about why the Raptors no longer figure into the Playoff picture. And as for the Raptors not being contenders, that's pretty clear, but not because the Hornets are a juggernaut.  My confidence in 100 out of 100 matchups is just me saying if I was putting money on the head to head matchup, I'm taking the Raps."
U/Scottie-Barnes &gt; thibs
Scottie barnes
"Don't kid yourself Khem and Freddie are 6'8-6'9, same height as Barnes/Pascal.   And what are you talking about? Scottie played PG in high school, he played PG in FSU, which is the main reason why he even went there in the first place.   And news flash: you don't need to be a great playmaker to be a point guard. They're great playmakers for their size that can also do a bit of everything else. You're not going to get Ben Simmons that can shoot at every position if you want to be positionless. I don't know what kind of grand expectations you have for what a true positionless team should be."
Scottie Barnes and OG both wear em for the Raps
They have already been making a comeback.  Look at Scottie Barnes as an example.
Is it ~really~ a log jam?  PG: FVV / Malachi Flynn  SG: GTJ / ???  SF: OG / Yuta Watanbe  PF: Siakam / Scottie Barnes  C: Khem Birch / Chris Boucher  Also with Scottie Barnes and OG those are basically positionless players
Scottie Barnes. Screaming and clapping in people's faces on the court and being a super likable goof off the court.
"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That’s not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."
Scottie Barnes
Jalen green is going to be better than Scottie Barnes
"Thats jake""nailed the scottie Barnes pick"" fischer to you"
"Warriors: I have no idea what Klay will look like. I think they could fall anywhere between 2nd-6th seed.  Nets: How good can they be if everyone is actually healthy? It’s a big if considering how Harden looked in the playoffs, how often Irving is injured and how miraculously well Durant played coming off injuries.   Sixers: Joel Embiid has oft been injured and last year, he could have won MVP had he been healthy all year. Will they have Simmons? How’s that all going to work out after everybody on the team expressed their frustration with him, but they can’t trade him for more than peanuts?  Lakers: How many seasons does LeBron realistically have left? This reminds me of that Lakers team with Payton and Malone. They’re so old.  Pelicans and Wolves: I don’t know if either of these teams with their exciting young talent can actually play enough defense to win. I think Valenciunas will be huge for the Pels. That guy makes every team he’s on significantly better.  Heat: I think we will be a tough out, but our guard depth is not great. I feel like Herro is going to play a lot of point unless we make some other move.  Boston: I’m glad Horford is back with them. He is either utilized incredibly well or horribly. I’m glad he’s on a team who knows how to play him.  Pacers: They’re always good, but never great and absolutely never all healthy at once.  Kings: Davion Mitchell looked so great defensively in Summer League. I’m really hoping they can do something.  Hawks: I have no idea if they will continue with their playoff momentum or be a 6th-8th seed.   Some teams I think probably won’t be great:   Mavs seem the exact same. Idk why I would expect them to do anymore than get out of the first round at most. Kristaps knees seem to be forever plagued with “soreness”.   Wizards: They’ll need everyone to step up to make the playoffs with improved Bulls/Pacers/Celtics teams.  Raptors: I’m hoping somewhat selfishly as someone who went to FSU that Scottie Barnes is the truth. He kind of reminds me of Paul Pierce if Paul Pierce was a much less good shooter. Good court vision, solid defender, can handle a little bit and his game isn’t really dictated on athleticism, so if good, he could have a really long career."
"3 *is* already taken by the god OG so All NBA, Future MVP, Current MVP and already better than LeBron Scottie Barnes is back on the menu and no longer a bust"
"Yea, Scottie Barnes looks solid."
Yes - Scottie “Barnes”
Stop hyping up mediocrity by Scottie Barnes and it won’t happen
"Fr lol, feel like I’ve seen nothing outside of Jordan Poole, Scottie Barnes, and the Chicago Bulls."
"Scottie ""don't call me Pippen"" Barnes"
gonna be hilarious watching Scottie Barnes stat lines being posted to this sub while the raps lose by 30
I've never watched Scottie Barnes but is he kind of like Draymond?
Scottie Barnes is a future first ballot HOFer
Shooting the three is considered Barnes main weakness so… No? This should be as expected and the rest of Barnes game has looked outstanding in both SL and preseason… and I know this is just a response to the Suggs thread but the obsession with comparing Scottie and Jalen is fucking lame.
I don’t think the Raptors picked Scottie Barnes to immediately be taking a lot of 3’s
"&gt;Scottie Barnes is off to rough start so far,  Bro Scottie's been killing it in virtually every other stat line"
"This is a history of Scottie Barnes  It's not just a list of bullshit he's done in the past, it's a chronicling of his rise.. TO POWER  HE RIDES WITH KINGS ON MIGHTY STEEDS ACROSS THE DEVIL'S PLAIN"
"How do you think they defend the rim?   And even then, Scottie Barnes running vert is still better and he gets higher than rim Running 5’s."
"He fell to round 7 and pick 66 in our draft. Notably shocking players to go before him included Terry Rozier, Jalen Suggs, Robert Williams and Scottie Barnes."
"1) think of it this way. at their very highest ceiling, which player would any team take? it's obviously Barnes. and why are you acting like Suggs is guarantee to become a great floor general/leading scorer and Barnes won't? You have absolutely no basis to make that claim given what we've seen so far.   2)you completely missed the point, which is not surprising. again, players of the same mold did not contribute significantly on the offensive end when they were rookies, yet they developed into lethal scorers. what about Suggs? you speaking as if he's going to dominate offensively as a rookie. from what we've seen so far, his shooting, ball handling and playmaking still need A LOT of work. no weaknesses my ass.   3) you're placing way too much emphasis on college, especially when it comes to Barnes vs. Suggs. college is over and it's the NBA now. it's a different style of game. a lot of players destroy college but flame out in the NBA. at this point, people are paying attention to what's going on in the NBA and skills demonstrated so far, not what happened playing against little boys in college. use some common sense.   4)Fuck dude. everyone knows Barnes is offensively raw. The Raptors drafted him knowing this LOL. You acting like Suggs is this great shooter already, he is not. If Scottie, develops his jumper, he could be one of it the best player in this draft class given his other attributes. and it's not just his physical profile the Raptors looked at. You constantly and conveniently ignore other parts of his game that make him special already. Barnes is stronger, longer, and is a better play-maker than Isaac, even as we speak when he's 20 and Isaac is 24.   5) Wtf. Lowry came to the Raptors at age 26 after being tossed around the league like a rag doll. look at his stats since becoming a Raptor. Serge Ibaka was traded to orlando and his career appeared to be going down hill. He had career years playing in Toronto and won a ring. The Raptors revived his career. Uhh no, the raptors have a longer list of excellent players developed compared to Boston and OKC. it's likely easier to develop lottery talent than it is non-lottery talent and the Raptors have been doiing the latter. Why don't you list some non-lottery players from Boston or OKC who have become quality starters? LOL. Jonas is a quality big man in the league, Raptors traded Ross for Serge who was essential in the championship run. Ed Davis was drafted when Bryan Colangelo was still the GM, Poetl was traded after his rookie season, Malachi's just a sophomore. I'm resorting to insults because I have a low tolerance for idiotic, uninformed posts such as yours."
"This is definitely a on-paper vs functional athleticism thing, because Scottie Barnes does not get off the ground as quickly or easily as a lot of other guys with lower verticals.  Westbrook wasn't measured with a particularly remarkable vertical in the combine. Leaping in the NBA is mostly about how good you are at getting off the ground, not how high"
"Yes I know you linked a video, but I’m saying he has a notably better standing vertical than multiple rim running 5’s with a much more complex role (was playing as a PG in college).  And so far Scottie Barnes vertical has been functional. And as his footwork/handle gets better it will only get better.   Guys that play as true 5’s get the benefit of not dribbling the ball while trying to dunk. I’m not saying he is a blow by you while handling the ball jam it down type player, but if he played a reduced role like a rim running 5 his vertical would be very clear.   It’s honestly ridiculous to suggest he isn’t a functional athlete, especially with how he has played so far in summer league and pre-season"
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9’0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn’t as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6’1.25 H, 8’1 SR), Keon Johnson (6’3.5 height, 8’1 SR), Jericho Simms (6’9 H, 8’10 SR), Jalen Harris (6’2.75 H - 8’1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6’10 H, 9’1 SR), Tyler Bey(6’6 H, 8’9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."
Barnes also gets a chance to showcase himself as a starter. Wouldn’t be surprised if he keeps the starting job and we go with the massive lineup with FVV/OG/Scottie/Pascal/Birch or precious
The Raptors do. OG and Scottie Barnes can guard…oh wait.
Scottie Barnes led an NBA game in assists

"Honestly after watching the Raptors today, I'd go all-in on a Fred/Ben swap.  I think they're going to struggle to make serious noise without a genuine superstar player but I think you can sometimes get around that by being different and they have the potential to be really different.   No hate against Fred, he's a great player, but they're already a very big and switchable lineup and I'd lean into that size and switchability and hope to strike gold.  Watching Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa playing as well as they did has me feeling like they could just throw caution to the wind.  Simmons / Anunoby / Barnes / Siakam / Achiuwa  Spacing is an obvious concern but I think there's potential there for the team to be insanely weird and dynamic."
"there is literally no way to tell if scottie barnes will or won't become an all time great yet, the chances may be low, but the chances a player will become great are never zero, look at kawhi and giannis, who got compared to role players coming into the draft, but now are already both future hall of famers"
"Jordan Poole... playing like some kind of Steph lite...  I never thought I'd see Steph's teammate draw a triple team with Curry 12 ft away on the same court.  OG... about to score 20+ ppg has a deeper offensive bag than i ever expected.  Herro... Strong 6 MOTY candidate   Rookie list  Barnes- Grittiest rookie going... Siakim was a top 20 player not too long ago and Toronto is like ""we're good with Scottie thanks""  Giddey- Rediculous vision and perhaps better live ball passing than Melo (not the handle though) that 45 mph lefty corner to corner live ball pass was some sh... i never expected to see from a rookie.  Murphy III - 65-1 ROY odds seem ludicrous after watching two of his games"
"And I thought OG was gonna be our next Kawhi, Scottie Barnes might get the role instead."
Scottie “pippin” Barnes
Scottie Barnes is nice and he should get a lot of minutes this year as Toronto look to rebuild
"Alternatively, Draymond is a pretty suspect shooter and is still a problem. Barnes looks like he's somewhere in that Draymond or Artest type of mold where he will add a lot of value to a team, even if he's not dropping 25 every night. Just using my favorite team as an example, we have several players on the roster who add value without being elite scorers (Iguodala, Looney, Draymond). All have multiple rings at this point.   Scottie will be a fun piece for Toronto to build around. They'll have plenty of chances to find shooters in the future, but a chess piece like him can actually be very rare."
"Yeah I think BPA is pretty much always the way teams go in the top 5. Unless you already have a great player at a certain position you never decide who you take based on your current roster. I think Suggs is a great pick for them even though they have lots of young guards because he's a better prospect than all of them. Same reason why Raps took Barnes, they already have good forwards but Scottie is the guy they liked the most"
Scottie Barnes ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time..
"I feel like you're taking what I said out of context. Yes, it's possible that Barnes won't pan out; but your two examples of guys that didn't pan out are players that aren't extremely hard workers; from every person who's spoken about Scottie, he's extremely hard working and very receptive to coaching...that's a very good combination.  Does that mean Suggs won't be a bomb ass player? no. Does that mean Barnes will be a bomb ass player, also no. It's simply a statement saying that Scottie's margin for being dominant is much higher; the league today is ruled by versatile players like that."
"The Scottie Barnes comepsationjerk is getting out of hand. We went as far as using ""generated points"" to make it see lm he scored 30 points like bruh, why are you like this? Is it because you fear that Suggs might be better?"
"All in on Scottie Barnes but Durant got blocked by Mamu, I think it was, yesterday.  That is never happening during the regular season. The only person who has a chance at blocking Durant is Giannis, if he gets really lucky"
Did someone say Suggs? Because Scottie Barnes is definitely better than that guy.
Scottie Barnes is the future for the Toronto Raptors.  HOLD MY HYPE BACK
Scottie Barnes made Dragic want to be here now. Of course with a wink wink nudge nudge we'll try to get you to Dallas if they cooperate with us
"Scottie ""Scottie Pippen"" Barnes"
"I do think Scottie Barnes will be compared to Ben Simmons the same way we compare Fox to John Wall.  Not quite an all-star, but a better player to have on your team and build alongside."
I don’t think so but I really like Scottie Barnes so I fuck with the Raptors. I could see a playin spot definitely but I don’t think your a team that should drafting top 5 picks on win now
"Imma have to live with the fact that whenever Scottie Barnes does something, Jalen Suggs will forever be mentioned and vice versa."
"Im not an avid college basketball fan, so I'm still learning about Scottie Barnes. Dude's a bucket and has been impressive to watch"
So you want credit for Toronto having Scottie barnes who can start at PG and also guard bigs as well when Ben Simmons has been doing that since he got in the league
Scottie barnes is second behind AD in big man rankings.
How does OG win it with a bunch of minutes going to Scottie Barnes tho?
"Raptors fans always overhype their players. I mean have you seen all the overhyped Scottie Barnes posts? It's hilarious. Just let them have their little fantasy, it's all they got this season."

"Scottie Barnes looks like a future hall of famer at the very least. He’s basically LeBron’s height/build, with Magic Johnson’s passing ability, plus Kawhi’s defense and Rodman’s rebounding/hustle."
Bouknight has a shot imo. Pure scorer and apparently passing is going to be a focus this year.   Scottie Barnes if he can score points. He’s going to have the ball enough.
"For the rookie one, I'm watching raptors games for scottie barnes. Dude has borderline crazy energy and I'm here for it."
"Add pascal and GTJ and Boucher to this squad , people are gonna hate playing version of the raps with that Scottie Barnes pick you up full court energy in the pre season"
"""Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack""  Scottie Barnes WHO WAS ON CRACK"
Zion for sure.   Lamelo. Kyrie.   And of course homer pick Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes is Chris Boucher with extreme hyperactivity
I’m all for Scottie Barnes is Lebron off crack
Scottie Barnes could be a sleeper pick for ROTY
Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack  Does this make him better or worse than LeBron?
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen
"Wanted to point out, I don’t think Devin Vassell and Kabengele were highly recruited coming out of high school. Further proving your point that FSU basketball lately has been developing ALL of their players, not just the super star Jonathan Isaac/Scottie Barnes type players. Leonard Hamilton has been doing a great job getting the absolute most out of that program. During my time at FSU, the basketball team was much more fun to watch than the football team, which had likely never been the case previously."
Scottie Barnes is looking gooood though
"What other colleges can stack up with FSU right now in the NBA? I know there are a few, but for being a football school it’s shocking that FSU has to be in the top-5ish?  PG - Scottie Barnes SG - Malik Beasley SF - Terrence Mann PF - Patrick Williams C - Jonathan Isaac  Devin Vassell off the bench"
Better than Scottie Barnes
Suggs will be good. But there just isn't a gap between him and Scottie Barnes like ppl thought
"Idk man but Suggs vs scottie seems very stupid to me. Like had Raptors taken Suggs, this wouldn’t even be a thing. It doesn’t help that Raptors fans keep flaunting Scottie Barnes a lot as if 5ey’e compensating for something"
"Riffing on that Raptors thing, I think Fred and Scottie Barnes would be an ok offer and really good fits for the 76ers specifically."
"They definitely need some iso scoring. If Siakam can replicate 2019-2020 then they might be OK, but they still need more reliable scoring from the perimeter and I don't think FVV or Trent have that.   Simmons certainly isn't a perfect fit, but Simmons/FVV/Trent/Siakam/Birch or Boucher makes them better now and the age of that lineup is 25, 27, 34, 27, 29 with 20 year Scottie Barnes probably moving into next year also means they're pretty set for the future too. I much rather teams make these win now types of moves than just sit on their hands and wait for the lottery balls to do all the work for them."
Raps fans getting the last OG posts out before they spam the sub about Scottie Barnes
Least annoying Scottie Barnes hater again
Giannis's positive energy is unreal. I hope Scottie Barnes can progress like him.
"Nick Nurse is being heavily disrespected, wow  Edit: also Scottie Barnes"
Scottie Barnes
"For this class, I'm feeling Jalen Green or Scottie Barnes"
"They’re all sleeping on Scottie Barnes, not saying it’ll be him for sure but he should be top 5"
"to be fair Suggs was a top prospect throughout the year.  but I got downvoted once on the raptors thread for giving an honest reason why the raptors would not take suggs. I just said that if they took scottie (pre draft discussion) it was because they couldn't move up for mobley, then they would of had to seriously consider moving back a spot or two and trying to grab barnes or kuminga. I said that it was because Suggs was limited based on his physical tools by comparison to the other two. He also didn't have the strongest dribble and struggled to make the midrange. I also mentioned things like his wing span, and I compared him to brogdon which I still believe is a fair comparison. I think he will be a good player but with a ceiling. I got downvoted to the depths."
Where the fuck is my boy Scottie Barnes?
Scottie Barnes 🤩🤩
"Does anyone else immediately think of Scottie Pippen and Matt Barnes when they hear the name ""Scottie Barnes""?"

Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes made such a beautiful baby
"Scottie ""Tsu Surf"" Barnes"
Bless Baynes.  He's legit the reason we got Scottie Barnes.
"You had a good point until you mentioned Suggs. Suggs shot 3/11 and had a worse assist to turnover ratio than Barnes and you come to the conclusion he was better?   Even after the fact, who gives a fuck? It’s preseason. LaMelo scored 0 in the first preseason game last year, he won ROTY. Raps fans are just excited as fuck about the team being back, and naturally Scottie having a pretty good game is gonna warrant a lot of hype"
This has become a Jordan Poole and Scottie Barnes sub for today.
"Scottie ""Dani Rojas"" Barnes"
"Buy your “r/nba favorite” stock in Scottie Barnes now, before it goes through the roof."
"I remember when we spent a month expecting our pick to be Barnes, Andrew Schlecht was saying how it wouldn't be long before Scottie is referred to as ""the heart and soul of the team"" by commentators. E.g. big dunk with flex ""and there's Barnes - the heart and soul of the team"""

"Underrated loss when Serge left was the off the court glue guy role. Serge really balanced all the personalities and was a great connector. When he left, team chemistry took a bit of a dip with the most prominent example of Nurse and Siakam going at each other. Barnes brings that youthful magnetic energy. Trying to lift everyone’s spirits and put a smile on everyone’s face at all times. Scottie is going to be huge for team chemistry and just making sure everybody feels loved. It sounds corny but those types of people are the best morale boosters."
"I thought Scottie Barnes was '' Ben Simmons at home '' at first but I was wrong, he just evolved into '' Magic Johnson at home ''"
Scottie Barnes may be still raw but holy fuck this guy looks legit.   He's got the physical tools and his energy is amazing.
This guy seems to particularly hate Scottie Barnes for some reason. [Check his post and his comments in it lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pn7406/how_did_scottie_barnes_go_number_4/)
THT 33/10/4/4   Scottie Barnes 13/9/3/2
"Bruh nobody is looking at scottie Barnes and thinking about box score stats right now.   We are looking at the raw, freakishly large human with crazy athleticism and more energy than anyone we’ve seen in god knows how long guard point guards, outmuscle big guys for rebounds, take the ball up the floor, throw no look passes and throw down massive dunks.   We are looking at a potential unicorn and simply being surprised that he is also producing in the box score."

Scottie Barnes not playing like a rookie at all tonight
Logged in for the first time in a while to say that Sabonis is Scottie Barnes son
Scottie Barnes is better than Lebron James
Watching Scottie Barnes play has me irrationally excited for these games lol.
Scottie Barnes is winning ROTY
You can do this with anything though.  &gt;That’s not a fair one:  &gt;Scottie Barnes did not look like a top-4 pick out of the gate.  &gt;Raptors would have been killed for taking him over Suggs.  And they were. But they stuck to their guns.  It all comes down to scouting and player development.
"Ohhh, I haven't watched a lot of the rookies, but scottie barnes has been getting multiple calls every game. I think its because of the way he plays because he will just drive into the defender and then shoot"
I would add Scottie Barnes to this category too. I mean his defense is not as elite as mobley but he definitely has a huge impact to the team; that is why he is part of the starting lineup compared to boucher and dragic who are veterans
The Chris Duarte/Scottie Barnes rookie battle everyone was hyped up about pre season goes down in about 4 hours.
lol no scottie barnes impact is pretty similar to mobley .. they both have an elite defense and their offense looks to be ahead of what was reported.
It really is something else. The raptors will be getting blown out in the 2nd half and a scottie Barnes dunk will be the top upvoted post on the subreddit lmao
According to my Raptor metric Scottie Barnes will be the GOAT 🐐   My raptor metric is just being a raptors fanboy though.
"I don’t think they’re unlikable but I do think a lot of them are really boring and bland.   Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, Trae Young are injecting a lot of life into the league. I like Scottie Barnes’ energy. We need some juice"
"Subscribe. I do like the Blazers, but I think they're missing that one killer piece to really be a big threat. Simons is looking nice and has a bright future, but is also sort of ""more of the same"" in terms of what you have. You need a Scottie Barnes, not that they grow on trees. Just luck and good scouting for GSW to find Draymond with a 2nd."
I don’t care about Scottie Barnes
The Scottie Barnes pick is justifiable.  His really passes the eye-test.
"How else am I going to let every thread know Scottie Barnes' stat line, and how he's MVP calibre?"
Scottie Barnes is the future of the Raptors.  Prepare to hang his jersey!
"I have no idea what to think tbh, other than that Scottie Barnes is going to be a superstar...probably...maybe."
I honestly think it will be Gary and Khem starting instead of Precious eventually. I figure Barnes sits around the 6 min mark for GTJ to play with the starters and then Scottie comes back with the bench and GTJ in the second quarter
Scottie Barnes ROTY
You’re sure it ain’t Scottie Barnes?
I see him as a combination of Scottie Pippen and Harrison Barnes
"Scottie Barnes, Josh Giddey and Austin Reaves deff tier 1"
"Raptors have a lot of young, happy-to-be-here role players and undrafted guys, and now the lovable Scottie Barnes, with everyone's favorite team president, Masai ""Fuck Brooklyn"" Ujiri.    And of course they play in Canada.  Have to be up there on the most wholesome list.  Turns out the owner might be a piece of shit, does that count against the Raps?"
"He honestly is the frontrunner without a doubt right now. Scottie Barnes looks like a great offensive player, but Mobley is a top defensive player in the league while also being efficient on offense."
I wanted to after watching Scottie Barnes torch us in what? His second game? Kid’s nice.
In Scottie Barnes we trust LMAO
Scottie Barnes
"Damn, another nice game from Scottie Barnes, has me worried about Cade lol dudes gonna be under a lot of pressure to perform from game one"
Scottie Barnes????
"Virgin: “scoTTie bArneS”  Chad: Jalen Green, Houston Rockets.... Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers. ... Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors. ... Jalen Suggs, Orlando Magic. ... Josh Giddey, Oklahoma City Thunder. ... Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic. ... Davion Mitchell, Sacramento Kings. ... Ziaire Williams, Memphis Grizzlies."
Scottie Barnes looks like a future Hall of Famer  He’s basically a mix of LeBron/Magic Johnson/Kawhi/Giannis all in one
Are you telling me playing the future goat scottie barnes isn't competitive
"Scottie Barnes is the real deal, going to be a nightmare in a couple years"
Scottie Barnes betta? Much to consider 🤔
I could do with not having to face OG and Scottie Barnes much in the season. Barnes is so fucking good.
"God damn what a great game. Caruso had some clutch defensive plays in the 4th. And of course DeMar hits a mid range EVERY time we seem to gain some momentum.   I really want to see FVV run the PnR with Scottie Barnes, and have him make the decision to either drive or pass from the high post like Draymond Green. I feel like he's standing around too much on the offensive end, and this should be a good way to make use of his playmaking abilities."
"""Scottie Barnes is a no level scorer"" - Sam Vecenie"
"Scottie Barnes kinda similar to a young giannis, dude has the frame to be a superstar"
Turnovers were the name of the game 1st half Toronto gave it to us. 4th quarter we gave the ball to them. What stifling defense they play. Scottie Barnes is good
That 4th quarter was WILD Bulls were so close to blowing it  Scottie Barnes draft night apology letters gotta be sent out
Scottie Barnes is the future
Scottie Barnes Arena
Scottie Barnes Arena
Scottie Barnes is a Toronto Raptor fuck
Their lenses are too rose tinted. Scottie Barnes is good but he's no Luka at least not yet.
do scottie barnes and OG have the same barber
Scottie Barnes looks like a solid piece man fuck
" **Full quote from Jason Kidd (Wolves Head Coach)**  &gt;Scottie Barnes is a heck of a rookie. Great player. He's 20 years old, he's really really good. He causes a problem on both ends of the floor and he knows how to play the game. He's going to be a star in this league if he's not already a star. He loves to play the game. Watching him on tape, you would think he's been in the league three or four years. It's very impressive what he's doing early on in his career.  **More from Billy Donovan (Bulls Head Coach):**   &gt;""He’s going to be a very good player,"" Chicago Bulls coach Billy Donovan said prior to Monday's game. ""Very aggressive, puts it on the floor, he’s got really good length, a two-way player. Defensively, [he] can play a lot of different players. [He's] got the versatility and length to guard a lot of different people. ... He's only to get better with minutes and through playing. And certainly, he's gotten off to a great start in this early part of the season.""  [Source: Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-scottie-barnes-praised-by-bulls-nick-nurse-talks-chris-boucher)"
Scottie Barnes first career triple double today
"But like, the best thing is that you can say “I was so wrong” and be grinning like Scottie Barnes while you do it."
"Right?  It's still so early.  So many hot takes on our sub about Jalen Green after two single digit games...but then he drops an incredibly efficient 30, and now his numbers look good on the year.  Add in Scottie Barnes looking great along with Giddie...and Cade hasn't even played yet, and Suggs isn't going to be this bad for long.  Add on guys like Sengun (who has looked great at times but still very raw) and this draft is going to look wonderful in 4 or 5 years.  Going into the year I thought Mobley would be like, 6th or 7th on my most likely to win RotY because of how raw he is compared to Cade, Barnes, Suggs, and Green...but even with that he just looks so smooth on the court.  I've been so incredibly impressed by him, but he absolutely does *not* have RotY locked down by any stretch."
Who's your way-too-early all-rookie team? I got   Chris Duarte / Jalen Green / Josh Giddey / Scottie Barnes / Evan Mobley
Scottie Barnes has a plus/minus of 8.3 he’s already an MVP
"I know this is a homer's opinion, but Evan Mobley is currently my ROTY and i'm a big Scottie Barnes fan. Mobley is playing like he's a veteran with a high BBIQ. His defense is calculated, he's guarding 1-5, and he's making big stops without fouling. It's actually insane how refined his game is 3 games in."
"That’s gonna be a fun one! Demars attitude is contagious man, I can see why y’all love him so much. You guys got a real one with Scottie Barnes, he’s a monster already!"
"Contested shots is one stat of defense. It also skews to PF/C players as there is less separation and movement closer to the basket than further out. To get a full picture for defensive you have to use Defensive Win Shares, this is how much has your defense contributed to winning. It includes +/-, DFREBs, Steals, Blocks, contested shots and more. Just peep which rookie is leading the league in DWS  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_WS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerExperience=Rookie  I think Mobley has a better shot after Pascal comes back, but with Barnes playmaking ability, he is a triple double threat. He played as PG all his life, emulating his game off of Magic Johnson. I think that is super rare in a 6'9"" combo forward.  However, if we had the #1 pick I'd go with Mobley as it fits what our team needs better. However, the charisma, the energy, and the hustle that Scottie Barnes brings is a rare gem for a rookie."
"Went to the Celtics home opener on Friday and my main takeaway, aside from deep feelings of depression, was how fucking natural Scottie Barnes looked out there.    He is listed 6’9”, wouldnt be surprised if he is at least an inch taller and still growing. Was simply the best player on the court all game. I know its early in the season but if Barnes eventually settles into his jumpshot, he is going to be an all-star at the very least. Very impressive."
I'd go   evan mobley   scottie barnes  jalen green  chris duarte  josh giddey
Ya and fuck him.  Scottie Barnes Arena now
ACC was perfect for Air Canada Carter and now SBA will be known as Scottie Barnes Arena
"No they would probably end up promoting Bobby Webster the the current GM and the man who does most of the foot work for Masai (oversees scouting, trades, development etc.) Bobby doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, or they would promote one of the many talented executives on Masai's team...it's not as if Masai did it alone, he led the charge and build a winning organization and culture but that organization is made of people...Bobby Webster is actually the reason for the Raps going after Kawhi and scouting Scottie Barnes.    Masai is essential to Toronto success because he built the culture, changed the tide etc. there is no question he's valuable but it's not as if he's they would fall apart if he left....it certainly would hurt the organization though."
Jalen Green and Scottie Barnes have entered the chat.
"Yeah, Scottie Barnes"
"Cade: Grant Hill is a better comp. Both are smart, unselfish, and offensively versatile players who gave a damn on both ends. But neither were A+ athletes like the way Penny was.     Green has a higher ceiling than Lavine if he hits. Athletically, I think Green is more explosive slashing, while Lavine's athleticism is really his bounce. Green has also shown way more passing intuition than Lavine did until maybe the past year or so. Hard to compare a guy to MJ/Kobe, but he's definitely higher than Lavine.     Mobley: I wonder if there's a better comp than Bosh. Both are talented on both ends of the floor and are long as all out. But Mobley's passing skills are really impressive, not something I've ever seen from Bosh. I might argue ""KG without the f\*cking intens\*ty"" for Mobley.  If Scottie Barnes hits, he could be AK-47. (How's that for cross-race comparisons)     Jalen Suggs: Jameer Nelson 2.0, except Jameer shot it better.     Giddey: Kukoc is not the comp I would go with given that one of Kukoc's hallmarks was his shooting ability and Giddey still has very big ??? about his shot. There's got to be a better comp."
Don't say that about my boy Scottie Barnes. My heart won't be able to take it if he gets injured and busts out
ToO MuCh ScOtTie BaRnEs ThReAdS
No Scottie Barnes?
You guys definitely have a gem in Scottie Barnes
Whats up with rookies shitting on the Celtics? First Scottie Barnes and now Jalen Green
Scottie Barnes is.
"Fuck yeah, this better go to the top like scottie barnes does every game"
"If Barnes continues playing anywhere near this well I don't know how we'd justify benching him, and at that point, yes, we might consider trading one or two of our starters for a better young player.   That, or run Scottie at point, FVV at the 2, OG, Siakam, and either Birch or Achiuwa at the 5. Which honestly could work, though I dislike Gary off the bench because he's forced to create shots with a lot less help."
Scottie Barnes will win ROY
Raptors overachieve most likely cause of Scottie Barnes
Don’t look now but Scottie Barnes is averaging 18 and 10.
"Many analysts said Ben Simmons is the next Lebron &amp; we’re seeing how that turned out. 85 total career games isn’t enough to put him here. If you want to say “bUt HiS cEiLiNg” you could put in Lamelo, Scottie Barnes, all these young talents. You just picked him because he’s a big name."
MVP: Jokic  ROTY: Scottie Barnes  6MOTY: Cam Reddish  DPOTY: Giannis  MIP: Michael Porter Jr   Jazz will never make it out the second round with this group/short of adding a third superstar. I guess that’s my bold prediction
Scottie Barnes ROY
i dont know about you but i would love to scottie get essentially free reign with the second unit. When Siakam returns we then have another that will demand the ball which limits what Barnes can do.   Let him work with the second unit and then run death lineups at the end of games or quarter or whatever.   Also if Trent is good starting then fucking start him lol. You want him engaged. I assume Barnes will be high energy no matter what role he is given.
lol Wiseman is a generational type player when he realizes his potential. Moves like Giannis shoots like Lamarcus. Better than fraud scottie barnes.
Speaking of... scottie barnes has been awesome as well
"Yeah. Sorry I should of elaborated a bit. I sounded like a dismissive jerk there. I do agree with your point that shooting is a real problem with that lineup.   I just think that this is a bit of a gap year for the team. I would go small. FVV-GTJ-Barnes-OG-Siakim. If we had a good Centre I would more amendable to moving Scottie to the bench provided he was still playing 30+ mins.  Regardless this whole conversation is great though. I did not expect Scottie to be this advanced already. Love the combination of defence, intensity and playmaking."
"That lineup really lacks shooting. I think Scottie might have to play 30+ minutes off the bench and try to stagger it so you almost always have 2 of Siakam, OG, and Scottie.  I also think we could close games with no center. Siakam, OG, Barnes, GTJ and FVV could be our version of the death lineup."
18/10 through his first 3 games and has been his team’s primary on ball defender.  Plus those highlights!  There’s nobody in the league who is low on Scottie Barnes right now.
"Man, I LOVE Scottie Barnes and the energy he brings. That dude wants to yam on everyone and has all the physical tools to do it. He also looks more comfortable with the ball in his hands than expected. Mavs also got lucky OG got into foul trouble. He was on fire.    For Mavs Luka looked like Luka again, THJ got hot as he does, and KP had some good help defense which was sorely missed last year. We also played a sexy lineup of Brunson, THJ, DFS, Bullock, and KP. Let’s hope we see that again but with Luka in Brunson’s place. That would be our ideal 5 out offense with serviceable defense.       Toronto fans- would you rather see this team tank for another nice pick, or try to make playoffs?"
Scottie Barnes stat thread after every game lfg!
Scottie Barnes has removed Chris Duarte from the ROTY chat
Lmao stfu if someone made a separate post about him yall would be crying about too many Scottie Barnes posts. Seems like he really lives rent free in your head
I mean Mobley could easily be the best player in the draft. Scottie Barnes looks nice as well.
Scottie Barnes for ROTY
/u/WhiteSteveNash is Scottie Barnes confirmed
"Only 4 rookies are playing well rn, we get several posts for Mobley &amp; Davion, but somehow its scottie Barnes posts that are a problem?   Hell the real problem is Duarte getting slept on and how butthurt yall get about the raptors."
Scotty Barnes &gt; Scotty 2 Hotty &gt; Scottie Pippen

He’s younger and better than Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes had another better game than russ
"Fun fact, Ant is actually younger than Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes"
we need to make both lamelo and scottie barnes posts punishable by death
you right we need another scottie barnes post
"Scottie Barnes and Mobley are shooting the same from FG.   The only up he has is FT in which Barnes is 71% and Mobley is 80%  Scottie Barnes is averaging 16.6 points while Mobley is averaging 14.9.   Barnes is averaging 8.7 rebounds while Mobley is averaging 8.   Both averaging the same amount of assists.   Both averaging the same amount of steals.   Mobley is averaging 1.4 blocks while Barnes is averaging 0.7.   Both averaging nearly the same TOV.   So while Mobley is playing better defence, the ROTY race is really close. No one has a upper hand right now because we are only 11-12 games into the season.   Gotta wait until atleast 41 games are done and we are half way through the season unless there are injuries."
You mean Boston Celtics highlights featuring Scottie Barnes
"I’m a simple man, i see a scottie barnes post =  a instant upvote"
"As a Raps fan, Scottie Barnes was the only thing keeping me from scratching my eyes out"
All I want is Scottie Barnes to pull up from 3
That’s the thing they missed the boat on a golden opportunity to trade up for Scottie Barnes.
lmfao shroeder said CALM DOWN BRO to Scottie Barnes
"So, what exactly did the draft gurus miss when they said Scottie Barnes couldn't score?"
Scottie Barnes scares the hell out of me. Baby Kawhi
Most rational scottie barnes fan.
Scottie Barnes where? Lol
What the fuck? I was told that Scottie Barnes was the best Scottie of all time.
"you're asking for quiet. So outside of fantasy basketball, where it's a little more know, these are the guys responsive to the question:  bobby portis mo bamba gary trent jr. John Collins Dejounte Harris Tyrese Haliburton Wendell Carter Jr Grayson Allen cole anthony richaun holmes tyrese maxey  Not listing mobley, scottie barnes, harrison barnes, miles bridges, carmelo, and some others since they've definitely been talked about a lot."
Scottie Barnes will lead an exposition to Mars one day
"Barnes was out for a few games as well, and Mobley has been the best rookie so far this season. No qualms with him being #1 (but y'all will eat your words when Scottie finishes 1st in the MVP race)."
Scottie Barnes is a growth spurt away from being Giannis.
Scottie Barnes will develop like Giannis into a perennial MVP candidate as a point forward.
"If spicy = Scottie Barnes layup highlights plastered all over the sub, then sure, SPICY."
Scottie Barnes played 34 minutes and 47 seconds tonight. This is only the seven hundredth time in NBA history that a player has played that much in a game.
Scottie Barnes 👀
"Fun fact, the league is only averaging 2 less free throws a game currently and 1.5 less fouls per game. It's still not too far into the season, but we talk about this season like there's 5 less fouls a game, it's not even 2 less. And people are still going to the line.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_stats\_per\_game.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)  At the same time, it does seem to have messed with Harden mentally. The clip where Scottie Barnes ""locks him up"", he baits the foul at the 3 and then passes it up because he realized he couldn't do anything about it."
You spelled Scottie Barnes wrong
"bro you're in argument mode trying to cherry pick a scenario where yes, it didn't tell us too much. But there are also scenarios where we find out things like, ok yes Scottie Barnes can get points against NBA defenses right now, or ok Franz Wagner looks like his scoring game is more polished than advertised and works in the league"
"Not at all, if Scottie Barnes did this I’d want him laid out. But no one else’s team would do this because there are only two Morris bitch boys in the nba."
Lol Scottie Barnes would end up being the prime minister of Canada
Scottie Barnes and Cedi Osman would end up higher than Bill Russel
"Yeah lmao, this was better than atleast 10 Scottie Barnes highlights we have seen in the sub lately. Would've liked Zu to contest it though"
"I guess if my franchise only chip came from the other team being injured I'd come up with a justification too. Not sure about being weirdly childish online tho, that's just a you thing. Good luck with Scottie Barnes, dude looks legit ✌"
Everyone’s just going to say Evan Mobley or Scottie Barnes
I mean Scottie Barnes is in the league now…so there’s your reason
"Harrison Barnes, Carmelo Anthony, Scottie Barnes"
Evan Mobley 52%   Scottie Barnes 52%  Franz Wagner 47%   Alperen Sengun 47%  Chris Durate 45%
What was your take on Scottie Barnes and has his ‘tape’ changed from what it was in college?  Disclaimer: Scottie Barnes fan club member who watched zero college games
"I love Scottie Barnes. But saying any rookie has a higher ceiling than the most offensively gifted centre in a generation is crazy.  You could argue that Kat doesn't fit the Raptor culture of defense first, hustle hard, team play and that would be a reason not to trade for him.  You could argue that salaries are a problem because of who you have to give up alongside Scottie since I don't think Dragic and some small salaries get it done  But I would trade any single prospect short of one who has shown Lebron, Shaq, MJ level immediate impact in for a sure thing top 15 player like KAT."
"We welcome anyone to the Scottie Barnes fan club, [we have baked beans](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCLJSV2WYAINkZV?format=jpg&amp;name=large)."
He would be Scottie Barnes. I wish we had Scottie Barnes :(
Imagine Pat with Scottie Barnes personality
A video of Harden getting punched in the face by Scottie Barnes with no foul call would be the all-time top post on Reddit
you just described scottie barnes tbh
I still think the favorite is still Scottie Barnes but this class has been looking amazing.
Scottie Barnes?

""Watching these new kids like Scottie and Giddey play man, its like they got that heat culture ingrained in them, but they still have Basketball IQ unlike Westbrook. Can't wait to see how they do against the best player in the league Luka Doncic"""
Bruh put some respect on his name. Without baynes raptors dont get scottie Barnes.
"They only ever needed a superstar player, and they've got the unevolved Pokemon version of that in Scottie Barnes.  The Raptors FO is really good at putting together all the complimentary pieces needed to surround a superstar for a title run. Annunoby, Siakam, FVV - they're all great players, great secondary and third options - but not the KD/Kawhi level guys who really push a team over the top.  Barnes really could be that guy, and in a few years they should make the Eastern finals no problem."

I want to be like Scottie Barnes when I grow up
"everybody likes scottie barnes, it’s raptors fans that are annoying"
Honestly the way they are playing I almost don't care what the final score is. I just love this team so much.  And it's even better because they're draft picks who were excited to come play in Toronto. Like watch the video of Scottie Barnes getting picked. He was thrilled.   It's a really special team we've got up here. I'm almost glad Kawhi left because it felt like a rental. These guys have a chance to win it on merit one of these years.
Scottie Barnes: I'm 26....
Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
"Are you also 6'8 with a 7'3 wingspan and massive hands like Scottie Barnes? Plus do you have any actually basketball skills and coordination? Dribbling, passing, motor and instincts as a defensive prospect?"
Love seeing Scottie Barnes name allover this sub.
“Scottie Barnes [something something] Ben Simmons and Doc [something something] Mickey Mouse ring [something something] OKC Thunder.”
I'm so excited about Scottie Barnes being a Raptor.
\[Highlight\] Scottie Barnes breathes
&gt; Scottie “take them out behind the” Barnes  lmfao this is a good one
Mobley and Scottie Barnes are just flat out ridiculous right now.  Clearly the 2 most impactful rookies thus far
Scottie Barnes is pretty damn good in his own right though def made the right call over Suggs there.
Ahem  SCOTTIE BARNES  Upvotes plz
Scottie has more highlight plays but a lot of what Mobley does goes beyond the box score. I think the media is leaning Barnes right now.
r/nba: Kevin Durant feels [Josh] gidd[e]y when he sees Scottie Barnes' IQ and enthusiasm.
"Really weird game from the Raps. Too many iso plays and defensive breakdowns. We usually move the ball much better than this and have much better defensive rotations. But some great positives to take away, Siakam looked good, Scottie Barnes is not scared of anybody on defense, and Gary Trent Jr. turning into DeMar DeRozan is just an added bonus lol."
"lmao you wouldn't know it by looking at the front page of this sub. It's currently flooded with Raptors highlights. Not that I'm complaining, because Scottie Barnes is awesome, but it's just funny that the Nets cruised in the second half and won by 13 but there's only Raptors highlights climbing the front page here."
"Scottie ""Omar"" Barnes"
All of the Scottie Barnes clips would make you think the Raptors won by 30
Lol right. 2 Scottie Barnes highlights in the top 5. I'm here thinking he has like 20 points or something. Still gonna be ROTY imo
Can’t even get mad. Give me as many Scottie Barnes highlights as possible
“Scottie Barnes and josh giddy are like the new me and Lebron. They’re going to run the league for a long time”
KD or Scottie Barnes 👀👀
"FSU = Florida State University. That's Scottie Barnes' college before he went into the NBA.  From what I've been reading, he wasn't a very good scorer in college. I don't watch much College Basketball, so I don't know what was going on during his college career. But I do know from another comment that FSU had a pretty deep and decent squad to run."
We would never of tanked to get Scottie Barnes with Kawhi still on the roster
KD needs to mention Scottie Barnes and somehow tie it to his time with the Thunder to get the maximum amount of awards possible on r/nba
Raptors fans post more highlights than any other fanbase I think  I swear Scottie Barnes gets a highlight every time he breathes
"at least Scottie Barnes had a couple of steals though, keep those highlight clips coming"
"It's Raptors fans  They could be down 50 and the top post would be ""SCOTTIE BARNES WITH THE UNCONTESTED LAYUP"""
Scottie Barnes a true hooper. DAMN
Scottie Barnes
“The future is now old man”        -Scottie “take them out behind the” Barnes
Watching Scottie Barnes play basketball gives me life
Is that Scottie Barnes or Scottie Pippen?
Barnes is the best Scottie!!!!!
I'm Scottie Barnes. Y'all know who i am
#SCOTTIE BARNES
"people underestimate the raptors because they dont get any really high draft picks or huge name superstars  but who needs that when you can develop OG and siakam and FVV into all star level players, and grab scottie barnes for another one"
Y’all know who he is. He’s Scottie Barnes.
HIS NAME IS SCOTTIE BARNES
Scottie Barnes at the half: 8pts/7reb/3ast/3stl on 4/5fg

"Scottie Barnes, wow"
"Scottie Barnes is incredible, easily my ROTY pick. The Raptors drafting and development is top tier."
Pls stop.  People are complaining we have too many Scottie Barnes highlights.
Scottie Barnes has Rick Sanchez hair today
Most deserved Scottie Barnes highlight of the year so far
SCOTTIE FUCKIN BARNES BABY
i dont know how scottie barnes is supposed to develop when he refuses to put the ball in his hands
Not true. Sometimes we talk about Scottie Barnes.
"As a Raptors fan, I'd take Giannis over KD. Our core would be: Fred VanVleet (27), OG Anunoby (24), Pascal Siakam (27), Scottie Barnes (20), Giannis Antetokounmpo (26).  That roster is absolutely disgusting and would peak at the right time to maintain a dynasty. It's impossible contract-wise and Giannis ain't leaving, but a man can dream. Imagine the ***length***."
Lillard was very vocal to Scottie Barnes in the Toronto-Portland game when Dame started hitting his shots. He seemed to be really try to prove something or put him in his place.
He'd stop the progress of Scottie 'Michael Jordan' Barnes
"For Scottie Barnes it says ""he has started all 16 games for the raptors"" but the raptors have played 18, and Barnes missed 2 with a thumb injury, does nobody proof read this stuff?       You could say ""Has started all 16 games he's played for the raptors"" but this totally feels like someone just looking at box scores / season stats"
No problem man. Can't wait to see what the Scottie Barnes hype is about
Scottie Barnes &amp; Mobley haven’t played 20 NBA games. This is insane
Scottie Barnes is the most promising rookie since lebron
"Can confirm, I now hate Scottie Barnes thanks to Raptors fans."
Let's gooo raptors fans we the north !!!!   Siakam All star. Fvv All star.   Scottie Barnes best out the draft.

Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes is gonna look so damn good in a Bucks jersey man.
I think that the ceiling for Scottie Barnes is somewhere slightly north of Andre Iguodala. The floor is what he is now. We've seen enough to know.
"Seen this a couple times, just realized that jalen green, jalen suggs, and scottie barnes are there in the background watching haha"
Total crapshoot but floor for Scottie Barnes is Thad Young imo. Really solid role player that could be a fifth starter on a title team.
"I hope the Raptors miss the playoffs for a decade.  It’s pure pettiness, but… - They gave us our most painful playoff loss maybe ever and **gloated** over it for years. - They used that loss to relentless call Giannis a choker and paper MVP - They were somehow simultaneously just as relentless about our “choker” ditching us for Toronto, where he would of course be a legitimate superstar - The whole goddamn Kevin Durant thing - Borderline delusion about being a “championship franchise” when they were just carried to a ring by Kawhi and a historic collapse from GSW   You asked for petty.  Don’t tell anybody I fucking love Scottie Barnes."

Keep that same energy when a clip of Scottie Barnes breathing reaches the top of the subreddit again
From what they say Scottie Barnes is the next coming of KG
"Saw someone else mention this first, so the credit is theirs, but Scottie Barnes does remind me of a taller and remixed version of Andre Iguodala. Taller, with similar vision and pass first instincts, not as explosive of an athlete, but much longer on defense.  Maybe a mix of Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Shawn Marion, with emphasized poise and passing ability? I am very bullish on Scottie Barnes with a solid organization developing him. Can see him as an impactful championship team player."
Scottie Barnes + Evan Mobley combined haven’t saved a teammate from that many games due to suspension   Really makes you think about ROTY
Scottie Barnes?
Nah. Rasheed was more of a post player who had the ability to shoot out to the three point line. He didn’t really create off the dribble from the perimeter. His strength on defense was guarding other guys who were post scorers. I don’t remember him having the ability to effectively guard guys on the perimeter which I think Scottie Barnes has shown more of an aptitude for.
"This is actually a really nice article. Goes in depth on each rookie. I’ve been really impressed with Wagner, his defense on KD in our first meeting was legitimately great even tho kd only missed one shot all night.   The point about Scottie Barnes shooting is also very relevant. It’s falen off a cliff and if he can’t sustain moderate shootign it’ll be a barometer for his career."
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland

"The Raps are one of the teams I'm watching in the east this year. Funny enough, the other is Cleveland. Our old nemeses. But both your squads are young and unique with swarming defense (defence). Scottie Barnes is going to be the leader of this squad by like February. He is so fun to watch."
"The game I've been most excited for all season so far and it didn't disappoint. Very entertaining game despite the Raps game-planning hard against Steph and OG being out. Mini-Steph brought solid energy with his drives and Draymond, Poole and Wiggins were all really solid  Scottie Barnes has a ton of potential, just needs to keep getting the reps and look to create more consistently.. Looking forward to the next match-up between my two favourite squads, hopefully everyone will be back in the lineup on both sides"
We getting a Scottie Barnes stat line post tonight raptors fans?
Scottie Barnes been extra quiet
Fr the clipper highlights are oppressed af. I’ll rarely see one with more than like 2k upvotes.   But Scottie Barnes makes a layup and its on the top of the sub. We live in a society
Scottie Barnes doesn't exist?
"&gt; But the lakers signed him knowing he wasn't a good 3pt shooter (at the time at least,) and they don't need another ball handler.  They didn't sign him from a pool of possible options. They kept him because they couldn't replace the salary slot if they let him go, and because they believe in his longer-term ceiling being much higher than Caruso's. Now, they didn't keep both for financial reasons...which might have been dumb. But THT hasn't even turned 21 yet.   He's younger than Bouknight, 3 years younger than Davion Mitchell, 4 years younger than Duarte. He's only a few months older than Suggs, Scottie Barnes, and Evan Mobley."
Night as well subtract Hakeems entire offensive game because Russell wasn’t close to it.    The comparison is just bad     It’s like saying Scottie Barnes is like lebron James except without the scoring or playmaking or high level IQ. But other than that he is like lebron James
Scottie Barnes! Bahah
Does Scottie Barnes count?
This guy prob got scottie barnes meat rammed so far down his throat he can feel it in his toes
Scottie Barnes
"He's younger than Evan Mobley, Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs."
"Daryl Morey is the most overrated and ridiculous GM in the NBA...he had a handful of great offers last season and this off season and he blew it by acting like a cartoon clown  The rumor is they could have had Lowry, Flynn and an unprotected first rounder in 2023 but Daryl Morey insisted that he wanted OG Anunoby, Fred Vanvleet, Garry Trent JR. and the 2021 4th overall pick (Scottie Barnes), Masai Ujiri hung up the phone on him and ended discussions....haha  The 76ers with Lowry would have been an absolute beast, instead their going to waste Embiid's prime years and never win a championship...no one is giving them market value for Ben at this point...and as much as I blamed Ben for this entire thing, I'm starting to think maybe their just a poorly run organization and Bens the scapegoat...."
I am shocked I don't see more people talking about Anthony Edwards and Scottie Barnes.
"Even when his shot wasn’t falling he still looked more impactful than Scottie Barnes, at least on offense."
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes?
From a neutral perspective:  &amp;#x200B;  SUPER SURPRISE:  Kelan Martin  - SF on the Pacers  Omer Yutseven - PF on Heat  Jalen McDaniels -PF on Hornets  Franz Wagner - SF on Magic  Malachi Flynn - PG on Raptors  Isiah Jackson - C on Pacers  &amp;#x200B;  NOT SURPRISING:  Scottie Barnes:  Patrick Williams  Mobley  Lu Dort  Tyrese Haliburton  Immanuel Quickley:  Tyrese Maxey
"Defining “Surprise player” is kinda the crux of this whole question. To me, it’s not a surprise if Scottie Barnes becomes a superstar. He was drafted 4th overall, and had great expectations coming into the league based on his physical frame and skill level. Maybe he wasn’t viewed that way by casual fans that don’t follow the draft but anyone picked that high in a loaded draft should have superstar potential.  I’ll say Cole Anthony. Was picked low in a weak draft class, didn’t make much noise his rookie year. Now he’s off to a really hot start, and I legitimately think if he keep it up he can steal the franchise starting PG spot from Fultz and Suggs. His shooting is improved, he’s still got good athleticism and seems to be stepping up his playmaking. He also has a really confident and determined mindset that will serve him well as he tries to break through. I’m not saying it’s incredibly likely he becomes a SUPERSTAR but I also think it’s not out of the question and All Star seems to be a possibility for him. And I think if you asked, very few would have suggested that on draft night or his rookie year  Honorable mention to Rui Hachimura who I think has a sneaky high ceiling."

Scottie Barnes.  Dude’s actually having a monster ROY campaign.  He’s WAY better than what I expected.

"That’s the issue, raptors haven’t really had a good center in 2 years and they seem to be struggling to find a comp that works.  They got away with using two PGs (Lowry/Vanvleet) at the same time for awhile. Now they have Scottie Barnes and Siakam in the PF position and they want to have their cake and eat it too by having both on at the same time. So what happens is that one is put in a suboptimal spot."
"Tbf he's okay with his team being owned by human rights violists, only people like that could hate Scottie 'michael Jordan' Barnes"
Nah this dudes a prolific Scottie Barnes hater look at his comment history he’s a weirdo
Tf is this. Where my Scottie Barnes stat line of the day?
Your poverty franchise would still be nothing if not for your cheap ass one year rental of the only superstar player you've ever had. Kawhi made your whole franchise in one season and then left. And Scottie Barnes is an average rookie that is overhyped af by raps fans.
Scottie Barnes. I’d take him over MJ for sure
"Stop calling Scottie Barnes ""Scottie"" or ""Barnes"". It's disrespectful to Scottie pippen and Harrison Barnes. I'm for some reason going to get really passionate about this non-issue"
"Fox, Brogdon, Scottie Barnes, Turner, KAT-that’s my starting squad of players that are overrated here. Honorable mention is also Beal"
Scottie Barnes
Thanks for the stat. As a raptors fan I know he was doing good but this is amazing. Hope he can keep this up with scottie Barnes in the future.   Masai never misses
"Facts, I remember I missed a Raptors game and the front page had 3 or 4 Scottie Barnes highlights that were all pretty average or slightly above average looking. I figure he must have had a really good game with 20 or 25 points and when I checked the box score, he had 8 points 💀"
Everyone forgot about Scottie Barnes already smh
"I feel like the number of Barnes posts have dropped considerably after that Raptors/Nets game that happened about 2 weeks ago (the last highly upvoted post I've seen was the [""KD praises Scottie""](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qp097e/brooks_kevin_durant_on_scottie_barnes_how_old_is/) post)."
Id love to see an actual count of Scottie clips. The most ive seen after/during the game was 3. Lately Ive barely seen any.   I see more complaints about Scottie Barnes clips than actual Scottie Barnes clips lol.

Came back to find proof that I did call Scottie Barnes for ROTY before the season started and I even predicted him as a 15+ PPG scorer wow maybe I should follow the raptors now 👀
Scottie Barnes is not faster or more explosive than fucking Zion bozo

DALANO BANTON AND SCOTTIE BARNES
My good raptors fan. I think it's time to blow up the core. Actually our core is gone. Just the pieces are left.   Who would you trade fvv and siakam for to play with scottie Barnes upside in the future
"I just looked up Defensive RAPTOR cause that seems apt, and Scottie Barnes is -0.7 which is a slight negative. +1.3 on offence tho"
"I’ve seen these posts one to many times. I went back and looked at Josh Allen’s draft post when the Bills took him and some of the comments have to be the worst aging things i’ve ever seen.  “Y’all took the wrong Josh LMAO”  “We HaVe JoSh RoSeN aT hOmE”  and barely 3 years later, Josh Allen was an MVP candidate, and Josh Rosen is now a fourth string quarterback. Scottie Barnes could develop a jumpshot and be the next Kawhi for all we really know. I’ll also look like a genius if this ages well."
It wasn’t the real Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes saying thanks for the support.
"welp, Scottie Barnes’ agent is a legend for getting his stock up so high"
im just here in case this blows up if Scottie Barnes turns into something lol
Oh yeah didn't realize. In that case it could be fake - someone with a fake Scottie Barnes account saw his chance and just deleted all posts and comments to make it look like he's been lurking for two years.
Best defender in the draft besides maybe Scottie Barnes.
Usman looks better than Scottie Barnes ...tf was Toronto thinking
Planning to go to a bunch of Raptors games this season. Excited to see Scottie Barnes develop
if scottie barnes becomes an offensive player like anyone you've listed outside of ingram i will send you 1000 dollars. hold me to it.
"&gt;2  Scottie barnes on on record loving raptors development team as well. He's saying if anyone can help him develop his shot it's them since they have examples   OG, pascal, bocher, vanvleet all developed heavily there."
Yeah that fool ain’t the real Scottie Barnes lmaoooo. How are people so dumb
I low-key like him more than Scottie Barnes. I'm really confused on the Raptors pick but obviously I'm an idiot and Masai knows best. Just hope it works out the way they clearly think it will.
Scottie Barnes mom is bad af
That Scottie Barnes pick throw me in a loop   I don’t even know what to make of Raptors plan rn
Dude we just drafted Scottie Barnes. Same story there but at least he looks passionate
i mean raps took scottie barnes at 4 too  i trust masai but damn
I had a strong feeling we were going to pick scottie barnes because of how Masai thinks but im still sad lol
"On the bright side for me, I've been a Scottie Barnes stan since before OKC fell to #6 in the lottery. Toronto's development team will probably prove me right about him. He's going to be great. Less sure about Suggs now, oops. I still think he'll be great, but he might be more like Jrue Holiday at his peak than a legit multiple-time-all-star type of player. But hey, I mean shit, Jrue's a champion."
"David Thorpe had some high praise for Barnes on [Chad Ford's podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/mock-draft-wars-2/id1503591370?i=1000530149983) a couple days ago where he has him #2 on his big board behind only Mobley. Starts at 18:21. Ends 27:41.  Some highlights:  - Excellent locker room presence - Can guard all 5 spots - Super high floor  - Comparisons to Pippen and Draymond Green - Projected first team All NBA player   - ""Most Giannas like player in this draft"" - ""Scottie is going to be a better player than Draymond, without question. And I think a very similar impact defensively. Which means Defensive Player of the Year."""
Yup. Scottie barnes is now my favorite players
"scottie barnes. only because i trust masai’s eye. he clearly knows something we don’t and given the raptors history of drafting incredibly well, i have a feeling he will be something special."
ok my shock is over! lets go Scottie Barnes

Scottie Barnes suit looks like something Diana Ross would wear.
Franz can defend the 3. In college he defended the 2-4 and did a pretty good job. He destroyed Scottie Barnes in the  ncaa tourney. I think franz has a better 3 point shot than his percentage showed he shot 34% from 3 last year and shot like 83% from the line.  I think franz can play the 3 in the nba and you can play him with Isaac imo
Scottie Barnes
I'd literally rather have Franz than Scottie Barnes.

"Yep, but Scottie Barnes can fuckin' play. Smart, hardworking player with insane physical tools and bankable skills already. Higher ceiling than Suggs for sure."
Couldn’t the Raptors have traded down if they wanted SCOTTIE BARNES so bad lol?
"I'm so sad right now... Scottie Barnes... Are you kidding?  Broken jumpshot, just trash."
You guys do know scottie barnes has giannis potential right?
Scottie is a jump shot away from being a more athletic type of Cade Cunningham prospect. He was always going to rise with the draft workouts.  It can be hard to pin down FSU players because we usually like to go 12 deep. So Patrick Williams and now Scottie Barnes end up not playing quite as much as they might elsewhere.
"Idk anything about Scottie Barnes but I always thought the Suggs hype was a bit much, so I am going to make this comment now so I can hopefully go back and use this to suggest to other people I know something about basketball (which I probably don't)"
Which is worse?  Perkins analysis on ESPN or these random r/nba armachair analyst who talks shit about Scottie Barnes?
We went from a Suggs Siakam duo to SCOTTIE BARNES OMFG
So Scottie Barnes averages 10 and 4 and goes fourth?
Scottie Barnes is a great add and versatile. He definitely had a higher upside than Suggs
"time for the cavs pick, and everyone is talking about the mods or scottie barnes. sick  can't wait to look back in 5 years time when mobley is the mvp that this was the post draft reaction (not a homer btw)"

"I don't think I've exhaled since Silver uttered the words ""Scottie Barnes""  Trying to trust Masai but this is questionable."
i mean Scottie Barnes is a PROJECT project offensive wise. Offense is gonna suck for the Raps
Scottie Barnes is a stud.  Amazing wing defender.  I trust our player development to get his offensive game going.  He can guard 1-5. Love the pick.
"Just took a look at the Raptors sub, so many overreactions that will look idiotic in a couple years when Scottie Barnes is an all star."
"Now, I’m curious:  What exactly makes Scottie Barnes a poor pick?"
"I kinda expected this after all the news coming out about how Scottie Barnes really impressed in workouts. I trust in the Raptors draft selections, we have been the best drafting franchise in the past decade."
"Scottie Barnes and Cade, that Montverde team was stacked"
Toronto spent a season in Tampa just to select Scottie Barnes.
People in this thread prob haven't even watched Scottie Barnes play lol
Scottie Barnes kind of looks like OG.    I don’t get it
Bye bye to Siakam  Scottie Barnes sounds just like a NBA2k created player's name
much respect for jalen suggs for clapping for scottie barnes. pure class
Bro how can you take scottie barnes over suggs
Yes Scottie Barnes = Draymond Green   /s
Scottie Barnes is a pretty good pick guys. If he can get his shot working he'll be a great pick up. Suggs has had some bad workouts so not that surprised he's been passed on
People on this sub havent watched Scottie Barnes play and it really shows
"I'm not completely shocked about this because Scottie Barnes is a beast and fits the Raptors so well, but Suggs falling to 5 is huge for the magic. Best PG they've had in a long time"
I dont think many people watched Scottie Barnes play - guys legit
Scottie Barnes over Suggs feels like Marvin Williams over Chris Paul
raptors hit with this pick.  scottie barnes is one of my very favorites in the draft.  great choice
one of the biggest bets on bovada before the draft started was scottie barnes to go 5th.
"What a shit pick.  Uhhhh, prove me wrong, Scottie Barnes. Prove me wrong."
Fucking scottie barnes 4th lol
Scottie Barnes is a hardworking Ben Simmons. Can’t fucking shoot
"lmfao my bad your FO wanted Scottie Barnes over both     Too smart for Kuminga, dumb enough for Scottie"
How u feel abt Scottie Barnes?
Scottie Barnes 😂 … I trust Toronto though … they have a great developmental program
Is scottie Barnes good?
scottie barnes are u fucking kiddnig me
Realistic takes on Scottie Barnes?
They picked Scottie Barnes lol
Scottie Barnes seems like a fun guy.
WHAT THE FUCK SCOTTIE BARNES WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
"Scottie Barnes, the Fisher dude from BR was right!?!?"
I like Scottie Barnes. Reminds me of Draymond a lot. Even down to the heavily limited scoring
Raptors fell for the Scottie Barnes hype train.
"Idk how anyone can watch Jalen Suggs play basketball, then Scottie Barnes play basketball, and come away thinking Barnes is better. Dont overthink this cuz of size and wingspan or whatever blog bloy statistic. Pick the guy who plays basketball better. This isnt the olympics    Lol this u"
LMAO SCOTTIE BARNES
Scottie Barnes????
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes - has incredible glue guy written all over him. I think hes gonna be a fan favourite for whoever gets him.
Scottie Barnes because He goes to fsu and I like fsu
Can’t wait to watch raptors fans backtrack their takes on Jalen Suggs being the 2nd best player in the draft when they end up drafting Scottie Barnes 😭😭😭😭😭
"&gt; Excluding Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley (everyone is keeping a close eye on them)  Lol how are you gonna say this and then talk about Jalen Green like he's not in that category.  To answer your question though--for me as a Michigan fan,  it's Franz Wagner. Apparently he's grown to 6'10""/6'11"" since the season ended. Top tier defender and can do it all on offense. Outplayed Scottie Barnes start to finish in the NCAA tourney."
Scottie Barnes the best defender
"The article says the Raptors aren't interested in Mobley anyway. Says if they move up it will be to get Suggs. If he's off the board, they want Scottie Barnes."
My bad the Scottie Barnes rumours are driving me crazy today
"Because it happens all the time. I was looking at this year's [draft combine](https://go.nba.com/8dyl) last night  Scottie Barnes is 6'7 without shoe and he is listed at 6'9 sometimes.  James Bouknight 6'3.5'', list at 6'5  Davion Mitchell, 6'0, listed at 6'2. Hes shorter than Trae who is 6' 0.5''  A lot of top drafts including Cade are missing. But I'm sure teams know, they met him in person, made sure hes taller than Isaiah Thomas. So two inches not a big deal. But I think NBA should really make these measurements available for all players."
We need to talk about Barnes tho. As in Scottie Barnes.
"Scottie Barnes and OG Anunoby. Whelp, that's one frontcourt defense nobody would like to play against."
"I’m sad that we didn’t get him, I REALLY wanted Scottie Barnes"
Is Scottie Barnes the goat?
Who was hating on Scottie Barnes???
Bro the narrow minded take is that all these players are supposed to become offensive stars. It’s just a really terrible opinion to think these players are gonna completely reinvent their games   Scottie Barnes just isn’t that offensive force that isn’t his play style. He has the potential to be a Iggy/Draymond hybrid. That would be a hall of famer if he lives up to it     It’s just so god damn stupid how kids like you who are new to the NBA expect every high draft pick to become Kawhi or Giannis.    Barnes simply does not play the game of basketball that way and never has.
Scottie Barnes is going to insert himself into the nba this year
"“Scottie Barnes in his Summer League Debut: 18p/10r/5a  Scottie Barnes led the Raptors Summer League squad to the win with 18/10/5, along with 2 steals and 1 block.”  Idk how that constitutes “sucking off” another player but aight"
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes is UNDEFEATED in the opening tipoff in professional play.   LITERAL GOAT
I’m really high on Scottie Barnes. His bulky body with that skill is scary.
"lol i'm one of the biggest die hard Scottie Barnes fans and I think this is downright disrespectful to OG.     Let's watch Barnes' ball handling, vision and pass accuracy (his college weakness) in the NBA before we say takes like this."
I don't think it was that.     I think the fact that every single Raptor fan thought we were going for Suggs so most fans didn't even bother looking at other prospects.     Then when Scottie Barnes was selected everyone was freaking out and trying to figure out who he is.
Scottie Barnes is the real deal.  Man he’s going to end up being such a good 1-on-1 defender
I wouldn’t even trade cade for scottie barnes
Scottie Barnes woulda hit that.
I want Scottie Barnes!
"I'm praying that its gonna be Scottie Barnes! Having only heard about him a couple weeks before the draft (shout out Run it back) all the stuff I've found out since the guy has some crazy vertical, and could have some huge potential ceiling."
Scottie Barnes is the next Scottie Pippen you heard it here first.
"He's trying to hype him up. People love hype.  Scottie Barnes is Magic Johnson after that one good pass, Blakeney is Kobe, and Gelo is now the GOAT ball brother."
Scottie Barnes. Only rookie on a good team
In Masai i trust….Scottie Barnes
"From all reports sounds like magic/okc woulda have taken Barnes if they moved to 4.  Not sure about magic though that might have been smoke.  If people looked a little more closely the signs were kind of there all along though, Masai has ties to David Thorpe and Leonard Hamilton who are both extremely high on Scottie."
This exact question was asked in 2024 and the overwhelming response was Scottie Barnes
I’ll concede that. I think (or at least I hope) that we can all agree Scottie Barnes is not a LeBron tier prospect
Hollinger had the Raptors taking Scottie Barnes for weeks and was mocked by a few sites
"Scottie ""Kevin Knox"" Barnes"
"The Raptors know how to develop players. Look at their track record, guys like Pascal, FVV, Boucher and others are all low picks who turned out to be great. Scottie Barnes is almost a lock to be an All-Star player."
Scottie '' Showtime '' Barnes
One summer league game and this guy is the HOF. Is Scottie Barnes the greatest player of all time??
Don’t let Scottie Barnes’ performance distract you from Malachi lighting it up to. Raptors could have passed on Suggs due to the belief in Flynn taking that next step this year
I LOVE Scottie Barnes already. What a guy!
Scottie Barnes better
Get Scottie Barnes some help that was three good passes from him that all resulted in bricks LMFAOOOO
Now Scottie Barnes… ooooooooh it’s an equalizer! Scottie Barnes! Get in!
Scottie Barnes is garbage on offence
Barnes had Obi on the spin nicely there. Defense had to collapse cause he got beat and Scottie made the assist
Scottie Barnes is a career 50% 3 point shooter.
Scottie Barnes is out hustling everybody.
ESPN: Scottie Barnes early leader in ROY race
Scottie Barnes swish put that shit in the lourve
Scottie Barnes - BUST
"Ah yes I forgot we had all star Siakam, Gary Trent jr, Vanvleet, (Dragic? Idk), Precious, OG, Scottie Barnes, Khem Birch, Boucher, Yuta, etc"
Who doesn't want to watch Scottie Barnes dance after making a layup while down 30 in January?
"Ben Simmons, yes he's a hugely flawed player offensively, yes he has a horrible attitude and character issues. But some of these takes about him on this sub and on social media have been ridiculous, I've heard people call him a net negative or that he should be out of the league. I've heard people say that they'd rather have Andrew Wiggins over him. I've heard some people on the Raptors sub say that it would be a disappointment if Scottie Barnes ended up as good as Simmons.  Like you guys realize he's made 3 all star games, 2 all defensive teams, and is a worthy contender for DPOY right?"
"Defensive bucks fans, everybody on this sub thinks they’re an expert on everybody on their roster. Raptors fans lose their minds when you tell them Scottie Barnes can’t shoot and they only got him like a week ago"
"Without shoes:  Pascal is 6’8.25”, Chris Boucher is 6’8”, Khem Birch 6’7.5”, Scottie Barnes 6’7”, Freddie Gillespie 6’9”, Dalano Banton 6’7.75”, Precious Achiuwa 6’7.5”, Yuta Watanabe 6’8”, and Sam Dekker 6’7.75”. So most of these guys would end up being 6’9” in shoes, except Scottie Barnes, who’d be 6’8” in shoes, and Freddie Gillespie, who’d be 6’10” in shoes."
"Honesty nah. The players coming back would have played hard and maybe worsened our lottery position. We got the 4th pick and Scottie Barnes so still worked out for us.   And it’s not like we could have used the cap space for anything if we were rebuilding/retooling anyways if Masai didn’t want to give Holmes a 4th year, etc. We just kick the can further down the road with the S&amp;T with a Goran expiring instead of a Kyle expiring last season."
Wagner locked up Scottie Barnes in the tourney. If we are going by that logic Barnes shit the bed as well
Scottie Barnes/Ziaire Williams - Bust  Jalen + Cade - ROTY
"Scottie Barnes, Yuta Watanabe and Johnathan Kuminga."
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley  4. Scottie Barnes  5. Jalen Suggs  6. Josh Giddey  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Franz Wagner  9. Davion Mitchell  10. Ziaire Williams
"bro dont compare the city and franchise of la to Toronto lol   congrats on the championship you will always have that, I'm just saying yall ain't winning in a very long time, and scottie barnes cant be the number 1 player on a championship team . I don't see you winning this decade in ujiri era"
Scottie Barnes 🙂
"[Jalen Suggs](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-jalen-suggs-nba-draft-preview) ""Toronto, as Suggs acknowledged, has one of the NBA's best developmental programs. He mentioned how far Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, and Fred VanVleet have come and that kind of developmental trajectory would work wonders for a player as talented and, in some ways, as raw as Suggs.""   [Evan Mobley](https://www.si.com/college/usc/basketball/evan-mobley-shares-opinion-on-toronto-raptors-organization)  ""They're a good player development organization,"" the 20-year-old said. ""When players get there, they get better and it's a great city and all that. I feel like, overall, there are a lot of different teams that have that aspect and Toronto is definitely a good team that does a lot of player development.""  [Scottie Barnes](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-scottie-barnes-nba-draft-preview) ""Their player development is great,"" he said. ""You see a lot of young players coming to the league and immediately just get better, no matter if they're in a G League player at that time or just NBA players, you just see the player development with so many young guys."""
Scottie Barnes
"Scottie Barnes could he ball out in Toronto? With Siakam being down and out due to injury, Barnes could end up as a starter in Toronto's lineup. If that happens, could he ball out enough to be in consideration for Rookie of the Year? I doubt it"
"Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes, evan mobley, Jalen green, Jalen suggs"
Some kid on the Raps board told me (when I said Barnes might end up a Batum) that Scottie Barnes would body him.
"Look at the team though.  Siakam: Good player, all-star caliber. Disappointed on offense. Not really a #1 option.  VanVleet: Another good player, but undersized and clearly given too much scoring responsibility last season. Needs to develop as a scorer outside of the three point line.  Powell: Traded for GTJ, an inferior player with a lot of the same issues as FVV  Lowry: Traded for Dragic, a significantly worse player.  OG Anunoby: I love OG. nothing to say here.  Boucher: Good young scorer, not sure what else to say lol  Birch: Better option at the C position than Baynes  Scottie Barnes: I think the raptors development staff will turn him good, but I don't think he'll make a huge impact this year while his jumper is still developing  Precious Achiuwa: Decent young big? Should get rotation minutes this season  That's the rotation, unless I'm missing anybody. Considering how dense the east is this year, I have very little faith in this team making the 5 seed. Decent depth but Siakam + VanVleet as a 1-2 punch is extremely underwhelming when you pit it against the teams they'll be competing against."
Ngl I'm mildly surprised we didn't get a Canadian version of Tingus Pingus when we took Scottie Barnes
"You might want to reread that, I'm not saying Scottie is more talented than Ben lol.  I'm comparing how much easier it'd be for our coaching staff to develop Barnes.  Duh, no shit Ben is a better player *right now*.  But Ben also costs 30 million dollars a year."
"You can't possibly compare Scottie fucking Barnes to an all-star, DPOY candidate, no matter how faulty he is."
"You would've thought the Scottie Barnes pick would end this fantasy about ""Raps never leak"""
Scottie Barnes is a huge get  wdym  We tanked and put ourselves in a position to get high potential high ceiling young players. Both of Barnes and Suggs are going to become awesome players. We wouldn't have lost either way which is what happens when you tank for a high pick.
we wanted to tank and took scottie fucking barnes
"We already got a project. His name is Scottie Barnes. And he's more moldable and coachable than Simmons ever will be, and is more cost controlled."
"Fvv and siakam are in their primes, they have the pieces IMO to win games and playoff rounds and their leaderships mo is to develop while winning as it should be.  That’s why they should have expectations. They can meet them because Birch’s fit as shown last year is what cp’s fit was to Phoenix this year. It answered their defensive hole and allows their proven championship caliber defenders to switch which maximizes them and on offence it gives them the roll man they needed. Gary Trent jr and fvv will have to bend their games to fit each other but they can do that. And if Scottie Barnes buys in he can develop off the bench with Malachi by trying emulate steph and draymond with a green light if they play hard defence in limited minutes.    I think they have the perfect recipe to win and they have winners top down in the organization. I dunno man"
From what I've read on here... josh giddey is steve nash but substitute the shooting and handles for height. And scottie barnes is a hybrid of kawhi and draymond.
Raptors believe Scottie Barnes will be their future point guard. Kuminga def not a point guard.
thats fair but you would be stupid not to pick scottie barnes to take the final shot..
"Him and Scottie Barnes are on the same level of rawness, we’ll see how Scottie’s defense translates at the NBA level but they’re both at the same level in terms of NBA readiness."
Scottie Barnes will
Scottie Barnes will get one someday (with steals)
"Nah dude, Scottie Barnes is fkn legit. He’s gonna do wonders this year just watch."
"I have a weird feeling that Kuminga, is who the Raptors, think Scottie Barnes is."
We should thank him for that 4th overall pick. What if Scottie Barnes turns into the next Kawhi? :D
"Scottie Barnes looks terrible(although this should be expected he’s a project), Pascal Siakam does not return to form, Birch goes down with an injury and we’re left without a center again"
"For what it's worth, without him they wouldn't have gotten Scottie Barnes so maybe it was worth it."
I've been seeing people say that since FVV isn't a natural point they might start Flynn and try to develop him. Hell ive seen some people say Scottie Barnes even. I just didn't want to make an assumption
"Point taken. I didn't know the Raptors got two more pgs in the second. I get the Raptors prioritize adding playmaking with length and switchability at all positions, but if they Raptors want to be competitive this year(and maybe they're not idk), I don't see how they can do that with FVV and Scottie Barnes as their best playmakers, especially since Barnes will need to time to rebuild his jumpshot. Again, I know Dragic isn't ideal, but I don't get why is such a negative asset or how he couldn't get minutes and make the Raptors better. Either way I think it's a moot point cause I'm pretty sure y'all are going to trade him for Powell in the next day or two"
"Then you don't understand Raptors' schemes. Raptors have always run with multiple PGs. Nurse believes in having multiple play makers on the floor at the same time. We actually teach that, develop that in our players once they've developed certain shooting and shot creation skills - Norm, Pascal, DeMar are examples. Look at our draft this year - all 3 players are actually tall point guards. Scottie Barnes averaged the same assists as Suggs in less minutes. both 2nd round picks are tall point guards. May play SG or SF or even PF but facilitation skills are expected. This is why Gasol fit Nurse's schemes - even though he was washed, he could facilitate as a stretch 5 from the perimeter.    edit - FVV ran point alone whenever Lowry was injured. When they play together FVV and Lowry would switch roles on the fly - one would run plays for the other as SG. It's all part of the scheme, to make  things unpredictable for defenses."
"This line up is precisely why it's a terrible idea. Imagine benching GTJ and Scottie Barnes and stunting their development, for a starting line up that will be fighting for the Play In at best.   That is definition of mediocrity. You just proved that guy right."
Scottie Barnes.
"I mean I’m not doubting u I’m from Canada so I watch quite a bit of Raptors games but IMO in order to make the playoffs the following has to occur.  - a better Center is a MUST. Re-signing Khem Birch should be enough and have Scottie play small ball 5.  - Siakam is the big wildcard as he’s your best player. If he gets back to 2019-20 form it’s a easy playoff team but coming of a torn labrum (major shoulder injury) we have to take a wait and see approach. My best bet is he won’t be that good until post-ASB, but since it’s on his non-shooting arm there could be a quicker recovery.  - FVV needs to be better. 39% fg is atrocious especially if your not even scoring 20 ppg. His career efficiency is 40% fg and needs to significantly improve otherwise y’all got no chance.  Some swing factors that could help is an OG breakout season, GTJ showcases more playmaking, and any positive production from Scottie Barnes.  In summary: That defense is legit, but you might have trouble scoring. If you follow the Knicks formula that should make you a playoff team."
"Hmm let’s see Bucks/Nets/Sixers/Hawks/Heat/Bulls/Celtics/Hornets/Pacers are the competition. Maybe Pistons if everything goes right.  Yea you probably make the play-in this year and get the 8 seed. It’s not guaranteed because Siakam is coming back from a shoulder surgery 1 month into the season and can’t determine he will perform at the same levels. We also have to see how FVV does as the primary ball handler and if his playmaking is good enough to let everyone eat.   Also, you guys STILL haven’t figured out your center position unless you think Scottie Barnes will be your small-ball 5 which would be a cool experiment for a rebuilding team.  There’s a lot of question marks to see if the Raptors can get a playoff spot after losing Lowry."
"“You can’t stop me, the only person that can stop me is Scottie (Barnes).”"
You haven't seen Scottie play nor look at scouting reports. Scottie Barnes basically played point guard in college. Raps are going to make him a distributor. Either a point guard or point forward.
Raptors still have a good core of Siakam FVV OG GTJ and now Scottie Barnes. They also get to play home games next year  Also public perception on the Sixers is just really bad rn and the Drummond signing def didn't help
"I'm telling you that Pascal and Scottie Barnes aren't starting from anywhere near the same point, which anybody with so much as a fraction of a functioning brain could have figured out, deluded Raptors homer."
"You are just gonna ignore how we have 3 point shooters around Siakam and Barnes, because you lost that point there. And now you say Raps don't do miracles. Did you see what Derozan was in college? He was a dunker, didn't do much else. We improved him tremendously. Casey didn't push Demar on defense. We pushed him to shoot 3s when we finally went with Nurse's offense in the final year of Casey in 2017, and he shot 31% from 3 - that's only after one summer of working on 3. The next summer we traded him to Spurs, and he stopped shooting 3s with Spurs. It's only been since 2017 that Raptors have gone over to the 3 point shooting offense.   Now did you see what we did with OG, Siakam, Boucher? Siakam was a 17% 3 point shooter. He was shooting 37% in 2018-2020 before dropping last year. That's a miracle. Scottie in contrast was shooting 28% in college. Have you looked at him? His stroke is much smoother than Siakam's. We'll get him to be a 38% shooter from 3 in a year or 2. Count on it."
Scottie Barnes is also multi-positional and literally ran PG in college so I mean they can easily play together
"We'll win more than 29 wins unless we straight up go into tank mode, which is possible lol.  We were on pace to win 31 wins this season with COVID, Tampa, along with our tank so that already exceeds the 29 win prediction lol. With no COVID issues, being back home in Toronto, and the fact that we'll most likely see an improvement with our players we'll probably win more than 29.  Not having Lowry is going to hurt, but our record without him is not that bad.   Unless we straight up tank and just let Scottie Barnes take 25 shots each night, which I'm definitely down for at this point."
"They should do a full rebuild imo and trade Siakam,Vanvleet and Boucher  OG,Gary Trent Jr,Precious Achiuwa,Scottie Barnes and whatever they get from Siakam,FVV and Boucher sounds like a good young core"
"Just a few things here. First, there are several 6'9"" centers in the league, heck even Draymond was good at center, so you can't be too hung up on height. Second, Maxey is not a PG, he's an undersized shooting guard. Finally, the Raptors already had FVV and Flynn, and they just drafted Scottie Barnes, so I don't see why would you think PG is a position of need."
Just in time for the finals. Scottie Barnes is going to need all the help he can get
"i think the top end of the East is equal to, if not a bit better than, the top of the West right now. But below that, there are still a lot of mediocre teams in the East, and several teams that will make the playoffs in the East would be bubble teams in the West.  This is how I see it (all subject to health and future roster moves, of course):  **FINALS CONTENDERS**  West: Lakers, Suns, Jazz, Nuggets  East: 76ers, Nets, Bucks, Heat  *Comment: I think a case can be made that the East’s top contenders are better on average than the West’s, especially with Kawhi out and Murray recovering. I’d take the Lakers over any of the East teams … but I’m a Lakers homer and even then it’s close. I’d take PHI, BKN, and MIL over the other three West teams. As for MIA, I think they’re just a half notch below my other three West contenders*  **PLAYOFF LIKELIES**  West: Warriors, Blazers, Mavericks, Grizzlies  East: Celtics, Hawks, Knicks  *Comment: This is where the West‘s strength comes through. I’d take GSW, POR, and DAL over BOS, ATL, or NYK. I think Memphis is on the same level as Atlanta, and I don’t think New York took a step forward so far this offseason; if anything, I think they may have taken a step back with their free agency thus far. Any hope for New York replicating or improving on last year will depend on injury luck (bad luck to other teams) and RJ taking a huge step forward (which is certainly a possibility!). But other than the four contenders and the three likelies, I don’t see any other team where I’d be surprised if they don’t make it to the playoffs in the East. In the West, though, there’’re 8 teams that* should *make the playoffs.*  &amp;#x200B;  **PLAYOFF HOPEFULS**  West: Clippers, Kings, Pelicans, Timberwolves  East: Wizards, Hornets, Bulls, Pacers  *Comment: Even with the Pelicans’ controversial offseason thus far, I think they’d be a near lock for a playoff seed in the East. While in the West, they’re going to be fighting it out for a play-in spot. The T-Wolves showed that they have aspirations of going for a play-in seed, too, and I think the Clippers will still play well enough to push for a play-in seed - and if Kawhi was healthy, they’d be a contender. I think all of these teams would be likely to get into the East bracket if they switched conferences. In the West, though, they’re going to need things to break right to even make the play-in. These East teams, though, are almost practically guaranteed at least a play-in slot, but I wouldn’t be shocked if any of them were lotto bound. The Wizards might be fun to watch - a rotation of Beal, Dinwiddie,, Hachimura, Bertans, KCP, Bryant, Holiday, and Avidja could be one of the most fun teams in the league - but it’s going to be a .500 team at best. The Bulls with LaVine, Vucevic, Ball, and Caruso will also be fun to watch, but I don’t think they’re going to be very good, either.*  &amp;#x200B;  **LOTTERY LOCKS**  West: Rockets, Spurs, Thunder  East: Magic, Cavaliers, Pistons, Raptors  *Comment: The bottom of the East is* ***bleak.*** *The Magic, Cavs, and Pistons will all be bad. The Raptors might be decent, but Siakam, FVV, Scottie Barnes, and flotsam and jetsam aren’t playoff material. In the West, Houston is the only really bad team, and they’re incentivized to be bad this year, since they have their pick. The Spurs will be plucky, and the Thunder could win some games if they don’t bench SGA. They won’t win enough to make the playoffs, but they’re better than the bottom of the East by far.*"
scottie barnes
I can't believe he called the Scottie pick. Even theost enthusiastic Barnes fans didn't really think the Raptors would actually take him
Dig deep and run into class everyday with the energy of Scottie Barnes. You'll do great.
Scottie dropped an insane statline today while having great efficiency.  Cade today gave us a **checks statline*...the DONUT.  Yep Scottie Barnes easily
have you seen Scottie Barnes stat line?
and 1 crazy spin move welcome to the NBA moment to Scottie Barnes.
"Scottie Barnes ain’t no normal power forward he ain’t gotta cherry pick in the paint and dunk like he’s some 3rd option bitch, this ain’t Ben Simmons, this is a fucking god human, Magic Johnson come again only this time he’s not a fucking pussy pull up from the fucking logo and Fortnite dance on you at the same time"
"I think of all people, Scottie Barnes would know how tall Scottie Barnes is."
I HEREBY DECLARE SCOTTIE BARNES OF TORONTO  #NOT A BUST
"The sample sizes are just too small, creates too much noise.  Like I had someone tell me not long ago that Scottie Barnes won’t be good because the past decade the 4th picks haven’t been good. Seriously lol.  He forgot to check the decade before though when like half of them were Hall of Famers."
"""Yeah, that one time Andre Drummond did a spin move with a loose ball, then turned it over 2 secs later and resulted in an easy dunk for me... yeah, that was when I knew the NBA was different.""   \~ Scottie Barnes"
Scottie Barnes plays like a flamboyant 80s player and I fucking love it.
I love Scottie Barnes and I don’t care who knows it!
"Not crazy, but something that bothers me:  Patrick Williams is a wing picked 4th overall in 2020 after his freshman year at Florida State.  Scottie Barnes is a wing picked 4th overall in 2021 after his freshman year at Florida State.  Scottie Barnes is 25 days older than PWill."
"Scottie Barnes, probably something like 10/5/2"
"He hasn't even played a game yet, but man I'm loving Scottie Barnes' energy. Seems like a good guy who just wants to have fun"
"Pascal, if he further regressed his game, I can see this season as his final one here in Toronto and they start the proper rebuild around Scottie Barnes"
"Hell, I'd add the Cavs (Sexland gets another shot, and does Allen/Mobley work?), Raptors (Scottie Barnes, weird all-6'9"" lineups, plus return to Toronto), Pacers (talented but perpetually-injured team might get it together under a great HC)... and that's not even counting the teams with the #1 pick and the #5/#8 picks."
"Raptors have one of the brightest futures IMO. Top tier FO, top tier development team, probably a top 5 coach in the league, great young talent in OG, Gary Trent Jr., Siakam, and *hopefully* Scottie Barnes. The biggest thing working against us is that we're not a great FA destination beccause we're in a different country.  Raptors were a bad for awhile, there was a lot of effort to improve the FO and development team. Recently, even with the shortcomings in the playoffs it was mostly LeBron beating us, we had a solid team and the COTY.  Kawhi and Spurs had a falling out and we were able to get Kawhi for 1 year by trading DeMar, which was risky trading our star for an injury prone player who wanted to be in LA. We also traded an above average starting center for aging Marc Gasol who was the star in Memphis for awhile, picked up Danny Green, and fired our COTY to promote Nick Nurse. All these moves turned out and the Raptors were one of the best teams, we probably don't beat the Warriors with KD, but they didn't so we won. Still beat a super stacked 76ers, Bucks, and Warriors  The bubble season which was the season after we won we lost Kawhi, Marc looked washed af, we had one of the most injured teams in the league and we managed to have the second best record, and I think we would have made the finals and given the Lakers a run for their money if Siakam hadn't regressed so much during the pandemic start.  Last season we didn't have a playable center and we got unlucky with injuries and COVID, we had the 4th best record at one point until half our starters and coach got COVID.  The teams that I might avoid because they're inconsistent would be: Knicks, Hornets, Timberwolves, Pelicans, Magic, Cavaliers  Then there are middeling teams that are content with being average: Pacers, Blazers, Grizzlies, Wizards"
"In terms of potential? That's really vague. Like, try assessing Scottie Barnes potential. Theoretically, he could get a shot up to 38% from 3 and be an efficient midrange and post/paint scorer, and he can have near Draymond defense and playmaking. That's a perfect player. That obviously won't happen, but that's his theoretical ceiling. So, how would you assess that? It's just a pointless excercise to me. Also Wiseman should be 4th to me."
"Among our top eight guys, none seriously regress and half of them show reasonable development. The dream is that Scottie Barnes is RoY."
"Scottie Barnes is 6'9 with the same 7'3 wingspan as Giannis and while he is not on the exact same level of athleticism as Greek freak Scottie still has freak athleticism not every player needs a jumpshot and his potential is definately not ""Capped"""
"The post asks who has more potential not who is the better player. Cade is obviously the better player now and I am not that biased but I do believe Scottie Barnes has higher potential than Cade especially since Cade measured at 6'6 on the summer league  EDIT: I think all of Green,Mobley and Barnes has more potential than Cade"
Was debating putting him ahead of Scottie Barnes to really spice it up. But this is an honest list from me.
I played 1v1 with Scottie Barnes in Wellington. He smoked me so bad.
"My new constant hot take is that players of his ilk will never be properly valued by the general public. That goes down the line from Rodman to Ben Wallace to Tyson Chandler to Dray to Jrue and Bam.   If your best attribute is rebounding or defending then you're just never going to get the same love as an equivalent player who wins with handles, scoring, and passing.   You would be called insane for ranking Rodman ahead of Kobe all time. They both have 5 rings though. Rodman was a 2x DPOY, 7x first team all-defense, and one of the GOAT rebounders in league history. He had seasons where he was averaging 18, 18, and 17 rebounds per game. Just think of the value of all those extra possessions and stops. It's pretty nuts. He won with multiple franchises and contributed to some of the best teams in NBA history.   But because he couldn't dribble or shoot, he's just not going to be in the conversation on all-time lists.   Dray is a slightly different animal because he's not as good at rebounding, but much better at dribbling/passing. Still, the simple fact that his shot making is below average for an NBA player holds him out of most ""top 10 in the league"" conversations even though he does so many things that contribute to winning (defending 1-5, playmaking, rebounding).   There just seems to be a sense that the general public values players 80% based on ppg, and then everything else. In actual basketball, the other dimensions can be just as valuable as scoring. That's why you see the league covet a guy like Scottie Barnes over people who are better at just hitting shots."
"Toronto got its Antetokounmpo (Alex, on a training camp deal), Scottie Barnes seems like a fun guy, and they re-signed Masai.  League is fucked!  ~~Honestly most of the FA signings weren't great but at least they retained Gary Trent Jr. for a reasonable contract and Barnes' energy and drive is infectious.  I like the kid already.  A lot.~~"
Growing on me is Scottie Barnes at first I was upset we didn’t get jalen suggs but I feel it was the right move raptors looking like they can make the playoffs and Chicago is looking like they could be a really solid team in the east
In Scottie Barnes we trust
Think that stopped a fair bit ago other than some fringe clowns.  There was even a post a couple of days ago on the raps sub about making sure we treat him well.  Plus the dude was absolutely beaming when answering questions about Scottie Barnes. We may have another bromance on our hands.
To me this signifies the Raptors are tanking. Scottie Barnes running PG will be fine reps wise but in terms of results he doesn’t have enough scoring gravity to create efficient offense
It was Aron Baynes last year. Love him for getting us Scottie Barnes. Hate him for being ass at basketball and making me watch that shit.
"Terrible point, your job isn’t specifically to trade and manage a team. Their FO’s entire role is to make positive moves for their team which they aren’t .  With what salary slots? We had Paschall and Poole on a minimum deal, then Looney making 5 mil, then Wiseman making 10 mil, then Wiggins making 31. It makes no sense to trade both of your bigs so tell me who is worth trading the previous #2 pick, is available, and makes less than 15 mil?  &gt; You literally called him a big. You are very confused in all of this my friend, almost as if you truly don’t know what you’re talking about.  “Apparently you’re not patient with young players so I pray for Scottie Barnes cuz you’ll be calling him a bust after 1 month.”   As for Kuminga he has all the intangibles but needs to work on efficiency and putting it all together. By year 2 he’ll look like a budding star.   &gt; The greatest shooter ever makes offense much easier for you which helps your defensive ability, he also has Draymond.  Yet he still averaged over 15 PPG for the Wolves. Yeah his efficiency should drop down a bit elsewhere but he’d still be good. On defense he would have Embiid as a rim protector which is gonna help him a lot. Dray doesn’t make you okay on-ball perimeter better, he does discourage defenders from driving there.   &gt; Curry already played with the worst spacing in the league. You are moving multiple non shooters and an average shooter for one non shooter. You still have 2 more roster spots to add shooters if you make the Simmons trade. I don’t even fully care about trading for Simmons specifically, any other high end player or all star would be good.  Is this your knowledge of basketball? There is only 1 Non-shooter, Simmons took 10 shots from 3 last season, Wiseman and Moody are around average shooters, Wiseman AND Kuminga are already better shooters and they are unrefined. And it’s not like you replace those 4 with shooters, there aren’t any good players on the market. You replace two average shooters and two bad shooters who can be nightmares in the paint for one non-shooter.  &gt; FO is absolutely ruining the tail end of Curry’s prime. There is 0 reason for him to be on the same team as Wiseman, Wiggins and Kuminga. That’s terrible asset management. Are you aware this is not the same FO that developed and created the Curry/Klay/Dray Warriors.  It’s the one that took that group to the finals. Again who do you think is worth Wiseman, Wiggins and Kuminga? Dumping them for a player who makes you worse is the definition of asset mismanagement."
"Allen wasn’t traded for a lotto pick, he was traded for second rounders. My point was to show that Memphis basically gave him away, so trades are clearly possible.  Ofc trades are possible, I can trade you my house for your sandwich! But are they worthwhile? Not with what was available.   &gt; Scottie was rated higher all around the league than Kuminga. The Warriors themselves were going to take him instead of Kuminga if Barnes was available. He’s projected much higher. Please do not act like you actually keep up with the league, this is evident considering you called Scottie a big. He’s a point forward/point guard actually. Kuminga went so low specifically because he is raw and I’m not even talking about summer league.  I didn’t call Barnes a wing I was talking about Wiseman and staring if you were impatient for him I feel for Barnes. Kuminga went 7 and Barnes went 4. That’s not so low. Prospect ranking wise Barnes was 5 and Kuminga is 6. Kuminga actually played in a much better league than Barnes and as we saw with Lamelo Ball, that helps your maturity a ton. But for now Barnes is NBA ready defensively and his passing is good but has no shooting as of now, Kuminga is more raw yes but has shown great flashes. He is not bone raw. Kinda like Anthony Edwards level raw.  Wiggins may have been better offensively but he wasn’t as efficient and the greatest shooter doesn’t make you a lockdown on-ball defender.  &gt; Warriors FO are wasting the tail end of Curry’s prime.  No. Trading your best assets for the next 3 years for a salary dump or a guy like Simmons who makes spacing much  worse on Curry instead of waiting for an actually good fit is wasting the end of his prime."
"Allen wasn’t traded for a lotto pick, he was traded for second rounders. My point was to show that Memphis basically gave him away, so  trades are clearly possible.

Kuminga went so low specifically because he is raw and I’m not even talking about summer league.  Wiggins is playing next to the greatest shooter every, he is overrated. He was actually better offensively in Minnesota.   Warriors FO are wasting the tail end of Curry’s prime."
"&gt; Memphis who have log jams at the guard position, they even practically gave away Grayson Allen.  Because of course someone like Grayson Allen is worth a lotto pick. Trades are possible but wasting your top assets for someone like Eric Bledsoe is just dumb.   &gt; Nope. Kuminga is extremely raw, Wiseman had one of the if not the worst rookie season ever for someone playing the minutes he was and Wiggins is extremely overrated.  If you actually watched around the NBA you’d know Kuminga is not as raw as advertised. He has already shown great IQ. Needs refinement but this isn’t some full time project. Apparently you’re not patient with young players so I pray for Scottie Barnes cuz you’ll be calling him a bust after 1 month. Bigs normally suck year 1. That’s just how it goes. Now this big was thrown into the fire for a team with a difficult scheme trying to make the playoffs and he didn’t have a training camp. He’ll be fine but yeah he is raw, it will take 1 to 2 seasons but he’ll be a good to great player. Wiggins is underrated not overrated. He played nothing like his Minny years, he was efficient and a great defender. Is he worth 30 mil? No. But he is worth 20-24."
Scottie Barnes has a very well built body and I could see him getting even stronger.
Well consider Scottie Barnes development over then
"I think OG Anunoby will end up being the best player in the 2017 draft class  Nah but fr, Scottie Barnes is going to be an All-NBA 1st team player one year"
Isn't he redundant with Scottie Barnes already on the team?
"Fans overrate scoring. Simple as that.  Players who specialize in other areas (i.e. Draymond, B Wallace, Rodman) will never be *fully* appreciated because so much analysis is reductive to the point of ""Who scores the most points?""   You see the same thing in soccer. Ask about the best players of the past decade. People will invariably name goal scorers like Messi, Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, etc. It is very easy to understand the person whose job is to finish the chain. What's harder to value correctly is the people who toil in the support structure, like a defensive midfielder, center back, or goalie.  In basketball there are players like Ron Artest, Jae Crowder, Andre Iguodala, Tristan Thompson, Jrue Holiday (until this year), Andrew Bogut, and Tyson Chandler who just sort of fly under the radar because the things they excel at aren't the things that most impress the general public (i.e. shot making).   But to actually win basketball games, you need rebounding, passing, defense, etc. That's why you see Scottie Barnes as a top 5 pick in the draft, and the Bucks selling the farm for Jrue, who is not regarded as a great pure scorer. Teams have more of an understanding that winning isn't just about having a bunch of guys who can drop 20 every night."
It could happen again with Scottie Barnes ahead or Suggs.
"i disagree. i think he’s already a front runner.    cade, jalen green, scottie barnes, giddey, bouknight, duarte, trey murphy, sengun, jared butler, davion, bones. i don’t see anyone else getting enough minutes to qualify for the discussion. suggs looks like he’s a little more of a project than anticipated."
I’m so confused with scottie Barnes height. He keeps getting listed as 6’7 but he has 6’8 in his bio and I saw a video of him getting measured by the raptors team and they measured 6’9. I guess his wingspan is ultimately what’s gonna be more important for getting rebounds and whatnot but the whole thing is strange.
Scottie Barnes will win Rookie of the Year
"I’m actually kinda excited to watch the Raptors play this year, I’m been curious about how a 5-man lineup of Scottie Barnes, OG, Siakam, Precious Achiuwa &amp; Khem Birch will do on the court, especially on defense."
I’m kind of surprised that less than 3% of GM’s think Scottie Barnes has the potential to be the best player in this draft 5 years from now.
"Scottie Barnes 4th in FG%, 3rd in rebounds, and 1st in assists among lottery picks 😤😤"
Worked out well for you getting Scottie Barnes.  I’m not saying the Raptors tanked last year but surprised your saying a year out of the mix and in the lottery isn’t beneficial for a team 😂
"The only injured team the raps faced was the Warriors and KD was already out the entire playoffs so his doesn't count. Klay played most of the series and got injured game 4 or 5 can't remember.   That raps team had one of the toughest roads to the finals in recent memory, you're super trippin. The best Philly team in decades (Jimmy, Embiid, Simmons, Harris and Horford), the bucks with mvp Giannis + Middleton, and then the Warriors.  Compare that to the Lakers run in the bubble and the bucks run and it's not even close. Both of those teams had a cakewalk compared to the Raptors.   As for the team's rep it's the best it's ever been. Young players are hyped to be apart of the organization. Scottie Barnes was super excited to be drafted by Toronto, and Justin Champagnie turned down multiple offers from like half the league to come to Toronto because of our development program and winning culture. Btw DeMar forgave Masai last year for that trade and they had a long chat in the bubble. So again, the rep of the team is the best it's ever been.  Hella weird that you're from sauga and hating on the Raptors, but hey do you lol. None of what you said is remotely true though, not even in the slightest."
"He will improve for sure. But he’s currently the same age as guys like Cade, Green and Scottie Barnes will be 4 years into their nba career. So it’s pretty understandable why nobody thinks he’ll be the next great player or whatever"
[Scottie Barnes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9G2-3Y5Dmw) debut breakdown and [Josh Giddey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4VlzP8ipR0) debut breakdown
"Coming to NetflixThis fall, Scottie Barnes in: the found footage Vietnam War film you’ve been asking for. DRAFTED. ^rated ^PG13"
"Yeah man Scottie Barnes looks really REALLY good he has a NBA body ready right away, can defend incredibly well and I can’t wait to see him guard other big wings in the regular season not to mention his playmaking and I’m sure he’ll take the next level fast in the regular season for offense I can see him averaging 15 PPG maybe."
"Scottie ""Pippen Michael Jordan"" Barnes"
If Scottie gets a good 34%+ outside shot it’s him. If Giddey can get a 37%+ outside shot and Barnes never develops a shot then It’s Giddey.
Scottie Barnes no bias
Scottie Barnes = Bust Confirmed‼️‼️
"Added Oubre but lost Graham. I just don't see that as much of an upgrade.  Pacers on the other hand added Torrey Craig and get a healthy LeVert who gets a chance to integrate after his health issues after the trades last year.   I don't think anything about the Raptors last season really matters, playing in Tampa meant that the players played every single game on the road in a sense. Adding Scottie Barnes and Achiuwa and flipping Lowry for Dragic leaves them in a better spot but the bigger deal is just being back in Toronto."
"They didn’t believe me, I made a whole new account with this username because I am the prophet.  I all come to you with news that Scottie is the nba mvp in 3 years.  Believe in it. Manifest it. Scotttie Barnes it.  He’s that guy."
Scottie barnes will average 15 ppg with 35% from 3 over the final month of the season helping the raptors to a 5 seed
Scottie Barnes really out here leading in assists
Heat will win the East as their big 3 mesh perfectly and Tyler Herro breaks out as the 6MOTY.  Raptors will finish as the 6th seed as OG/Siakam/VanVleet all average 20 and Scottie Barnes cements himself as a ROTY finalist.
Scottie Barnes as ROTY ofc
Scottie Barnes seems like a one man party machine  So damn likeable  Can't wait to see him play!
Scottie Barnes helping the Raptors to a top 4 seed.  Lakers miss the playoffs and Lebron retires.  D.Mitchell will win ROTY and MVP  The 1st all NBA team will be full of new faces.
Scottie Barnes has grown an attachment to him.  They're going to keep him.
You have no idea how hyped I am for the team and especially Scottie Barnes 🔥
"It's gonna be a battle between him and Scottie for best rookie defender. Barnes just held Beal to 1/11 shooting, and he did well against Tatum too"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"I think people overlook the fact that Poku is younger than Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and Scottie Barnes."
I swear a Scottie Barnes video with the same stat line was posted here
Would you rather have Scottie Barnes or Zion?
"The non-OKC fans were bashing him because of OKC fans, that's what I'm saying. Fans just like to hate on players, and Thunder fans bashing him made other fanbases believe the guy truly sucked and so they started clowning him too. Like the other guy said, the OKC fan that posted his weakness is basketball made its rounds everywhere.   Other fanbases weren't hating on Scottie Barnes and Josh Primo because their fanbases started to support them after draft night."
"Agree and disagree. A lot of the disappointment had to do with us getting dad dicked by the lottery and being 6th in a ""5 guy draft"", us talking ourselves into Scottie Barnes at 5, depression when actually people are down on Kuminga so Scottie Barnes is probably going higher, talking ourselves into Kuminga or Bouknight, and then the Giddey pick being a blind side.  I honestly always liked him but was hoping to trade 16 &amp; 18 for like 12 to get him. So taking him at 6 was a little anticlimactic. But yeah, Thunder fan reaction to the draft was pretty obnoxious. I think people were more mad about trading 16 (sengun) for two future firsts, and Giddey just took the brunt of the criticism because he was our lottery pick. There were also a lot of non-OKC fans calling him a bust before he even played though."
"his best spot is as the smallest guard in a starting lineup with a tall playmaker like lebron, luka, or hell, maybe even scottie barnes.  let him handle secondary playmaking duties and be able to snipe from behind the arc."
He still takes potshots at the pick all because he has a dog in the Suggs/Barnes battle. He has never referenced the good things Scottie has shown this summer league/preseason and his co-host just yes-man's the conversation to death.
Kinda strange Scottie Barnes isn't on this list but oh well
"I know man, but Scottie Barnes is not a point guard.  Coach Ham played almost everyone at point last year. It was bizarre and fun to watch at the same time"
https://lmgtfy.app/?q=scottie+barnes+film+session+mike+schmitz
"Players averaging exactly 9.7 assists per 100 possessions this preseason: Scottie Barnes, Dean Wade, Shake Milton, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
It's pretty damn hard to get 6 assists in the nba as a forward even if you're an all star.  Promising start.  Fuck that RELEASE THE HYPE ENGINE SCOTTIE BARNES FUTURE ALL STAR
That's ROTY candidate Scottie Barnes to you.  Kid's real special.  Can't wait for the threepeat.
"Scottie ""That Guy"" Barnes.   Rudy ""Not This Guy"" Gay"
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valančiūnas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."
"Unless we roll out Barnes/FVV/OG/Siakam/Birch, Scottie is coming off the bench once Siakam returns in November."

I’m impressed with jordan Poole and Scottie Barnes the most this year

Scottie Barnes. Shooting from three and sometimes his handles is his main weakness

Presti punching the air over Scottie Barnes
"Cade's ""floor"" is a nice on and off-ball player who reads the floor well and can score at all levels and has a pretty good understanding of defense. His ceiling might be Paul George who passes more than scores. He's not as athletic as PG though.  Jalen's ""floor"" is scoring machine with just okay playmaking/defense. I've seen him be compared to BI and to Beal and I kind of see it. I think his ceiling seems like it'd be like Beal but taller lol.  Mobley, ""floor"" is tricky because he's still putting on weight and he's not really playing a lot of reps on center now. He's really dynamic on offense. He can move well but he's not going to do well when bigger guys bully him in the paint. I see his comparison is often Chris Bosh. Evan's a really underrated ball-handler/passer too, Mobley's got a lot of tools in his bag.  Suggs is my favorite one to think about. He's just a playmaker. He makes plays on defense and offense and just flat-out hustles. His ceiling should be about him finding his outside shot. Dude is scrappy. I see a little of Lonzo and a little of Jamal Murray in his game. His ceiling to me might be a mix of them but more defense than Murray but less scoring than him too.  Scottie Barnes, is also very interesting. Scouts were calling him 'magic johnson' and saying he had a magnetic personality. He is more athletic than Green, Suggs, and Cade. He's 6'7 and can pass and defend but his bigger question is offense. He needs a better handle too, but tall big athletic and good at a lot of important things. If Scottie can find a lot of offense to match his defense, he might be better than a few of the guys who went before him. It'll be interesting to watch."
"I am semi-content with this season being The Scottie Barnes Highlight Reel, but also ^pls^^get^^^some^^^^wins"
Everyone should go watch the 3 Scottie Barnes plays where he just stronk’d through or blew by Luka.
That Scottie Barnes kid is good man!
"Scottie Fucking Barnes he’s literally our best player, his impact on the game is insane"
Scottie Barnes is legit
Don't let this loss distract you from the fact that Scottie Barnes is the ROTY frontrunner
"Random thoughts:  Luka needs to work on his offseason conditioning (and defense), cuz his current fitness is just fucking unacceptable for a player of his caliber  KP is a fucking statue, his defensive limitations will determine how far Dallas can go in the playoffs, because playoff caliber teams will abuse the shit outta him  Bullock should probably start in place of DFS, no knock on DFS but Bullock's skillset would probably fit the starting lineup better  Hardaway is such a hot and cold player, hes either 7-9 or 1-9, very little in-between, not a huge fan of high variance players like that, but when hes on they can beat damn near anybody  Dallas also has a C problem, Powells fine as an off the bench energy small-ball C, but isnt good enough too start, get bullied too easily, and his offensive game is too limited, WCS is just hot sweaty plumber ass, and Boban's really useful in certain matchups, completely useless in others, should probably look to acquire a C in buyout/by the deadline, and ship out WCS if they can  Klieber is the teams X-factor, needs more minutes, good stuff happens for the most part when hes on the court  It took Kidd 1.5 games to realize putting the ball in Lukas hand more is a good idea, this man and NBA head coach rofl, as an aside id like to see Dallas run a small ball closing lineup, with Luka-THJ-Bullock/DSF-DSF/Klieber-Powell/Klieber once Luka's drops weight.    Torontos in a really weird spot teamwise, cant tell if they're gonna sell hard at the deadline or look to be buyers to make a playoff push, neither would surprise me, a lot probably hinges on OG's development, and whether or not he takes that next step  Toronto's D is legit, they will be a pain in the ass to play against all season, also Nick Nurse is a really good coach, TOR's lucky to have a guy like that.   Scottie Barnes is legit, winning player, very savvy high bbiq, does lots of small things well, reminds me of young Iguodala  Toronto's bench was assssssss tonight, outside of Dragic, who quite frankly should play better than he did today, they seem pretty thin i atm  TF happened to Boucher?  Dude was and elite 2way player last year but looks absolutely lost on offense rn"

Scottie Barnes looks like Anunoby with PS2 graphics

SCOTTIE BARNES IS ROTY
Scottie Barnes is looking real fucking good too
Scottie Barnes is gonna win an MVP
Scottie Barnes is the greatest Raptor ever to wear the uniform.   So is OG.   This team is fun to watch.
I’ve sold my Kristaps Porzingis shares.  I’ll spread Toronto Raptors propaganda for 7 Scottie Barnes RSUs annually.
OG is the best player I've ever seen since Scottie Barnes

"When you look at the difference in circumstance between scottie barnes and giddey for teammates and roles as a rookie, it's like the difference between luka and giannis for teammates and roles as the star.  Raps and Bucks have great role players"
Scottie Barnes ROY

No.  Also probably wouldn’t trade Scottie Barnes for SGA.
Scottie Barnes  (Raptors say no)

"The Celtics' playmaking is really, REALLY bad, and two young stars aren't gonna be enough to compensate for it.  Their roster isn't even bad, it just has no connective tissue.  Also, while it's too early for calling ROTY, Scottie Barnes is nowhere near as raw an offensive prospect as we initially thought and has just as much of a chance as any other top 5 pick. And Mobley is... *really* good."
oh i know jalen green was blowin this page up too. but he was doin cool shit scottie barnes be makin layups and dumpoff passes 🤣
"I mean spamming anything is annoying. i come here just to see like a roundup/highlights. and all summer it was nothin but vaccines. which like good lord idk how y’all have the capacity to care so much about athletes getting vaccinated.  it’s not solely scottie barnes that i’m like alright y’all can limit it to like 2 posts a day please lol   i’m mostly just doin this cuz i know raptors fans would flood my inbox and it’s be funny, but i’m clearly not alone in noticing lol. i’m not really irked i just kinda was rollin my eyes in summer league and preseason at the SCOTTIE BARNES: 13/5/2 WITH GREAT DEFENSE threads. but raps are a big fanbase it’s inevitable"
"So i just make you bust a nut Scottie Barnes GOAT, ROTY !"
my point is very simple. it’s gonna be annoying seeing an abundance of scottie barnes posts. it’s not complex  the suggs thing was like a secondary point but just wait man. it’ll happen
"i’m not trying to make some reasonable argument. i’m jus sayin Scottie Barnes is this years “post every time he does decent” guy, and it’ll be annoying. that’s all  but cmon it’s not an exact starlike but we both know i’m close"
"respectfully, we don’t care about every layup he made. plus y’all be titling shit like  Scottie Barnes goes OFF for 14/4/3 with Amazing defense!.  But raptors a big fanbase so imma have to live with it"
all the annoying fan bases have their own sort of vibe  Lakers fans are the cringe ones. delusional too  Knicks the delusional ones  Hawks fans the victim complex ones  *You know which teams* the racist ones   and Raptors are the obnoxious ones. they’ll see a post about a player doing well and comment like “well what about their defense” or come in swarms to mass upvote every scottie barnes layup
Scottie Barnes
I’m here to give my most sincere apologies to Masai Ujiri and Scottie Barnes. The media tricked me.
Raptors. Scottie Barnes might be my favorite player ever
* Scottie Barnes ROY * Zach Lavine/Julia Randle Co-MVP * Lakers 9th seed * Celtics miss the playoffs * Miles Bridges MIP * Wes Unseld Jr. COY
The entire nation of Canada needs to let us know every time Scottie Barnes has a 18 point game
"as i predicted, Scottie Barnes is going to get 4 separate 3000+ upvote posts every time he has a decent game. gonna be an annoying year folks"
"I  agree with OP, Scottie Barnes is probably the greatest player of all time."

"Scottie ""Scottie Barnes"" Barnes. I like it."
"Two points:  1.	Scottie Fuckin' Barnes  2.	One thing that has worried me is OG's court vision. Some examples below. We rightfully discuss Freddie's vision a lot, but not as much about OG. If he wants to level up as a player he needs to improve on this in my opinion, especially since we're using him to crash the offensive boards and bang down low which will lead to defensive collapses and 3 point opportunities for teammates.   [example 1](https://i.imgur.com/LrrNdzB.jpg)  Early on, OG gets the ball in the low block. The entire Celtics organization collapses on him, leaving 4 wide open raptors shooters available. Rather than noticing the sea of white shirts around him, OG elects to go up himself for the tough layup, and misses.   [example 2](https://i.imgur.com/y6HNqDD.jpg)  OG receives the ball in the corner. He attempts a step to his left to gain some space, but is immediately closed out. He elects to shoot the 3 anyway despite a wide open Scottie B (who was already heating up from 3) right next to him.   [example 3](https://i.imgur.com/YD8Jpeq.jpg)  Here he had just driven to the hoop, bobbled the ball, went up for a layup anyway, missed it, and gathered the rebound. Nothing terrible in its own right. But now he's standing in the low block with the ball and isn't even looking for cutters. Precious and Scottie both have basically guaranteed layups or dunks available to them. Instead, OG attempts to throw it back out to the well covered guards and the ball is picked off."
SCOTTIE BARNES!   I'm glad to see him killing it. He's got a real bright future considering he's only gonna improve and he has the attitude and ethic to get there too.
Scottie Barnes ain't no spot up shooter
Those are almost Scottie Barnes numbers! Happy for him.   Jk
Scottie Barnes sends his regards
"No wonder he got 25 with that defense? Wyd Celtics, you just became Scottie Barnes first victim"
You mean  Rookie of the year Scottie Barnes
No shame in losing to Scottie “Celtics Owner” Barnes

"I love that kid, Scottie Barnes! He has so much swagger and energy. So much passion and love for the game. He rubbed his nuts all over Boston Celtic's faces in Toronto Dominion Garden, their home opener. He, a rookie in his second game, sushed their bench who were talking smack, after draining a deep two calmly! That is MOXY. Love it. 2nd greatest loss on Boston's home court in over 50 years!"

Scottie Barnes is getting as many minutes as he can handle. Coach nurse said that himself.
Scottie Barnes. Raptors use him well
So Scottie Barnes at the 2? At the 5?
Scottie Barnes will continue to get starter minutes regardless of Siakam’s status

Tatum wants to be Scottie Barnes when he grows up.
"For reference the Rookie of the Year last year, LaMelo Ball, averaged 15.7 pts and 5.9 rebounds over the season. Obviously it's not a fair comparison (LaMelo was a year younger than Scottie is, a few inches smaller and plays a different game, and Barnes isn't gonna do this every game lol) but it should illustrate how impressive it is, especially in game 2 against a pretty solid team like the Celtics."
"""Scottie Barnes"""
scottie barnes higher than 30?
Scottie Barnes &gt; Josh Giddey
SCOTTIE BARNES WHO?
Only scottie i fuck w nemore is Barnes
Feeling good! This team is so fun and they play incredibly hard! Scottie Barnes makes me excited to watch every minute of every game
"Franz wagner is playing like year 4 mikal bridges at Age 20 in year 1, crazy. Hes reminds me of lesser physical profile scottie barnes but still athletic 2 way wing with high ball iq with a progressive shot. Both of them are going to be stars"
I wouldn't trade Scottie Barnes for Zion straight up
"Raptors defense and effort are so fun to watch, half court offense is a struggle but has been improving overall  GTJ’s defense has been amazing and surprising; Dragic being glued to the bench is a surprise but totally deserved   Precious has talent but he isn’t playing the right way, Nick believes in him so I’ll trust that for now. Dragic’s play style doesn’t fit this team at all. Sviji has been a big positive surprise too, didn’t realize he had more to his game than just shooting 3’s  Scottie Barnes is fucking amazing, Banton has been way better than expected and I like Champagnie papi a lot, hope he gets a ton of reps with the 905"
Scottie 'michael Jordan' Barnes MVP
Yes Scottie Barnes has a thumb injury
How does Scottie Barnes fit into all this?
"Franz, Duarte, Herb Jones, and Scottie Barnes are all starting and playing great and you didn’t even mention them?"

"Exactly lol, Scottie Barnes exists."
"""SCOTTIE BARNES FOR ROTY"""
"And in our one year of tanking, we turned it into Scottie Barnes"
"Having GTJ since camp is huge, he's now comfortable, OG seems to have some new post moves and he's scoring in the paint at star levels, Scottie Barnes is basically adding a star player for free.  Also everyone is tall, it honestly looks like they're playing children most games.  When you're that tall, passing is easier, posting up, push shots in the pain, hands in passing lanes, etc.  I think Masai is onto something with going tall and agile, this might be the new NBA before others have caught on.  Only guy that is on the team that doesn't fit that mold is FVV."
"A ball handling 2 way wing with a progressive shot? So he sounds hell be like a player that scottie barnes is, a lebron."
"Scottie Barnes is averaging like 20 points a game, this is a fact. What he’s doing is historic. You’re from a fanbase that jumps and chants outside the MSG after winning a game in the first round, even regular season. Lol talk about being overconfident."
"I think I'm commited to getting a Scottie Barnes City Jersey, but man Franz Wagner is tempting me  As a Michigan fan I'm getting a Franz jersey eventually and hopefully Caleb Houstan gets drafted to a team with good jerseys"

nah scottie barnes fym
"mmmm the Lakers are bad, the Knicks are good, Chicago is killing it, The suns are a dumpster fire, GSW out to shut every mother fucker up that talked shit the past 2 years, Zions fat, Washington being better than the lakers with ex laker players, Kyrie and the Nets, Scottie Barnes, Jimmy Butler and his 'dogs'....  Soooooo i dunno whats 'boring' to you but thats a fucking lot of fun shit happening....."
We are terrible without our best players Scottie Barnes and Siakam  Oh well
"Do the Bulls count their games without MJ? Why should we count our games without future GOAT, Scottie Barnes?"
No Scottie Barnes or Pascal siakam this game does not count in my book
Scottie Barnes has been a pleasant surprise as a rookie through his first 7 years  &amp;#x200B;  What?
after 2 decades of immense suffering the basketball gods have rewarded the Knicks with a Scottie Barnes thumb sprain
On what planet is Scottie Barnes not number 1? Jalen is gonna be good but he has not been the best rookie so far
Part of the fun in keeping in tune with the draft is seeing how people's stock can quickly rise or fall at the least minute.   Patrick Williams went from a lottery guy to #4 almost overnight. Similar thing to Scottie Barnes. Haliburton got criticized for a lot of things like wingspan and shooting form.
This doesn't follow my Scottie Barnes is the GOAT narrative
Scottie Barnes been doing this for years
"If you're going to make a post about someone else these days it has to be Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving or Scottie Barnes. Didn't you get the memo?"
Nice book scottie still has more potential because RJ doesn’t have freak measurements like Barnes.
That Black/Gold Scottie Barnes jersey will be a cop forsure.
I love me some Scottie Barnes news but a local article about a local player...I can imagine there is a article in every market like this one about their rookie.
Yes I apologize I got this mixed up with your original Comment on Scottie Barnes. My bad
Anything with Scottie Barnes in it gets my attention
You have to put Scottie Barnes over Bron
1. Scottie Barnes 2. Evan Mobley 3. Chris Duarte 4. Josh Giddey 5. Jalen Green
Scottie Barnes but Mobley is close
I promise you Raptors fans would've gotten Scottie Barnes to the front page if he made a move like this and missed
"currently, Scottie Barnes."
Scottie Barnes flying up that list fast.
"Apparently nobody was on Reddit when Zion, Lonzo, Lamelo got hyped like crazy day in day out but Scottie Barnes hype is where the line gets drawn lmfao."
i'm so sick of the scottie barnes community.
"wow that’s so cool, Scottie Barnes is so cool, the other rookies? not cool"
Dude! Scottie Barnes! He plays for the raptors! Epic!
"Right now, Scottie Barnes. Dude is legit, fans are insufferable."
Scottie Barnes is a future Hofer let's relax on the stifling his threads.
Scottie Barnes is on the way!
Scottie MF Barnes
"Scottie Barnes,Pascal Siakam,OG,Fred and Gary  Easy"
"I mean, you should understand. Raptors fans suck off Scottie Barnes because of recency bias lol."
"Scottie Barnes, and its not even close"
Imagine if someone like Scottie Barnes did this in game .  This guy is 1a/1b with MJ for a reason.
"Acoording to Raptors fans, it’s Scottie, Barnes, and Scottie Barnes.  But I say, Ben Simmons, easily."
Scottie Barnes aka the future of the Raptors
Scottie Barnes has no flaws
I dont think anybody knows scottie barnes scoreline . Or how he is playing.
Scottie Barnes.
Yep. Herro is flying under the radar in the same way that Scottie Barnes and Russell Westbrook are flying under the radar so far this year.
"I meant more in terms of pre draft the consensus for the top 4 were Suggs, Mobley, Cade, and Jalen Green. Scottie Barnes then came into the picture in the last month or so but even then most pre-draft had the 4 I mentioned be drafted 1-4."
Idk if you guys heard but Scottie Barnes has been pretty good.
i know this is a troll account cause you have a raptors flair and like a player more than scottie barnes
Dang the guy saying Scottie wasn’t the best Barnes actually had an argument.
"De’Aaron Fox? I wouldn’t exactly call him elite, he averages like 18 ppg. He’s a good PG, but his stats may be a bit boosted playing on a team where he’s the #1 option.   I don’t think I’d trade Scottie for Fox,  we have Van Vleet to run point already and he’s not a big step behind Fox. At shooting Guard we have GTJ who’s a good scorer but needs to develop, and that’s fine, we’re a young developing team now. We have a great back up PG in Dragic, and a great backup in Banton.   Barnes is already averaging the same PPG as Fox, gets more rebounds, and has a bigger impact on defense. Fox is better at distributing the ball and playmaking, sure, but Barnes is a 4 and doesn’t really need to do that. Barnes is good as a Point Forward though, which is how he’s been used and it’s worked well. I really wouldn’t trade Barnes for Fox straight up, Fox is a guy who may be an all-star every once in a while but so far Scottie looks like he has a much higher potential.   Their stats are pretty similar (Fox has more assists, Barnes has better defensive stats), except Fox has been in the league since 2017 and will be on a much larger contract, and Barnes is doing similar stuff for cheaper and has higher potential."
scottie barnes = next michael jordan   quick maffs
Scottie Barnes is great but that’s disrespectful to Grant Hill. He was supposed to be the next superstar after Michael Jordan
Scottie Barnes is the ROY and closest thing to Grant Hill we’ve ever seen
"Some dude said the raptors wouldn’t trade Scottie Barnes for Fox, which is pretty crazy imo. Fox is an elite pg—the raptors would be lucky if Barnes because as elite as Fox"
Scottie Barnes is reminding me of a young McGrady.
scottie barnes is already the greatest athlete in the history of sports
scottie barnes and evan mobley are both already better than jaren lmao
Be more telling of barnes' greatness if cade is a monster and scottie still wins roty
scottie barnes isn't
"Scottie Barnes now leads all rookies in PPG, the ScottieROTY agenda lives on"
Did you watch Scottie Barnes at florida? I'm curious.
"People need to realize this. Players get better. I watched every single Scottie Barnes game in college, nothing he did in college indicated he would start off this well. Not that it said he *couldn't*, but anyone claiming the scouting reports were completely off base are straight up lying."
"Every time I see a different flaired post that praises Scottie Barnes, I have PTSD of that Mavs guy that got exposed as an actual Raptors fan posting in the Raptors sub, saying that he likes Scottie but resides in Dallas.   This time it isn't probably it because the poster loves Giddey I just want to let y'all know that there is a Scottie Barnes propaganda machine in r/nba its fucking annoying."

Scottie Barnes obviously.
"Pretty torn on the Curry odds. On the one hand, good record. On the other, he's not needing to carry the team. Definitely selling him as ppg leader.  Buying Scottie Barnes and Miles Bridges."
I let out a 5 second fart and decided that Scottie Barnes is the correct answer!
Scottie Barnes ROTY!
"Look at the table, Scottie Barnes is playing well and they're 3-3. On paper, prior to season start, alot of people wouldn't have them playoffs because they gave Lowry.  Like I said, it's hard for the east because if you look at the table, alot of weaker teams are playing super well (wizards 5-1, Hornets 4-2, Bulls 5-1 etc.) and I think they're legit, which is why I make this discussion."

"[Fred, GTJ, Barnes, Siakam &amp; OG will start for Toronto](https://twitter.com/blakemurphyodc/status/1457430358748798986?s=21)  Gone be interesting to see who gets the Durant assignment, I’m guessing they’ll be putting Scottie on him since Siakam is just returning to the lineup today."
Just mad that Scottie Barnes is better! Cry harder 😭😭😭
Scottie Barnes for Prime Minister!
"scottie barnes. he does a ton of different things, and those glue type guys are pretty hard to find. and his offense has been worlds better than expected this early."
"&gt; Imagine if there was a Raptors fan constantly on this sub, commenting only about Scottie Barnes.   aint this all of  yall right now?"
"Imagine if there was a Raptors fan constantly on this sub, commenting only about Scottie Barnes. Scottie Barnes advanced stats, how he’s the best rookie since xyz, how he’s a future MVP, blah blah blah. Going into a thread like this that has nothing to do with Barnes and making a paragraph long comment about how he’s better than Jokic  That’s what EG did with Jokic. Sure he ended up being right, but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t a complete troll"
Scottie Barnes is somehow the perfect Raptor.

Not as much - I'm sure that's because their team was in Tampa Bay all year. But I'm more dumping on the way they're gassing up Scottie Barnes already.
"No, I don't bother watching the games, I just look at the box scores and read all the posts on this sub. I assume that means that Scottie Barnes is the rookie of the year and is on track to be the GOAT."
*Scottie Barnes laughing on the bench*  20k upvotes
scottie barnes for simmons and green?
"Scottie ""Judoka"" Barnes"
Scottie Barnes is chopped af I didn’t realize
gg man scottie barnes is ridiculous
Scottie Barnes knows his judo well.
Scottie Barnes is legit and OG is still getting better. Love your fan base what a fun game.
I want Scottie Barnes to father my children
"Mobley = Barnes rn imo... hard to put one above the other.  Tonight Mobley was better, despite Scottie actually playing pretty well off injury"
Scottie Barnes
Not at all. Weird subsect of the Rapt community doing shit like this and Scottie Barnes starling.
Scottie Barnes: Judo Master
Those are rookie numbers not Scottie Barnes numbers
Never did I think Scottie would be this good on offense early  I was one of those skeptical about Raptors picking Barnes. His shooting isn’t there yet but he has a really soft touch around the rim  Different player than he was in college
Yoooooooooooooo i just realized that Scottie Barnes reminded me of Biz Markie. That's been bothering me since the draft
Pick which ever team Scottie Barnes plays for.
"So what you're saying is that us Raptors fans need to post more about Scottie Barnes, got it."
"Scottie Barnes, the Winter Soldier."
"You're right, we need more Scottie Barnes and Giddey posts.    And we should really do something about that guy with a gun to your head, forcing you to click on posts you don't want to see.  Sorry about that."
Where's Scottie Barnes?
"Scottie Barnes MVP?! Raptors top 5 in the east, on the back of this stud. /s"
*thumb injury to Scottie Barnes has ultimately made Evan Mobley the better player*
"ok fuck it everyone is going with the same guy so i’ll give the counter argument   mobley is undoubtedly lankier but putting on weight the way people in this comment section are talking about is harder than you’d think. giannis was able to do it but there are some bodies that genuinely cannot fill out to a big frame  i think scottie’s offensive upside is superior to mobley. he’s got better touch around the rim, more athleticism, and better vision. on the contrary mobley has equal ball handling and better shot mechanics but honestly i just don’t see mobley getting buckets as easily as barnes will  i think mobley’s potential is a top, top tier defender who is a plus on offense (think AD defense with like JJJ offense), while i think scottie has legit 25-30 PPG potential with plus defense and other capabilities on offense"
"Super late to the party, but if you still peak at these replies, could I please get a Toronto: Scottie Barnes flair? =]"
Scottie Barnes probably will at some point
Just below the superior Scottie Barnes
"Because Raptors fans are well, Raptors fans.  Absolutely obnoxious.  (psst, where's my invite to the Scottie Barnes circlejerk)"
Lol he's much better than scottie barnes 👀
"So when ppl ask why is scottie barnes statline posted, because hes kinds good and leading the ROTY race atm  to all you trolls saying r/torontoraptors"
"Barnes is going to win it because the Raps will make the playoffs and he's a better defender but Giddey might be the 2nd best rookie this year. He's got an automatic feel for the game just like Scottie and man I wish we drafted him, we still didn't miss out with Giddey."
"Scottie ""Superstar"" Barnes.    Superstar."
"What are you looking to learn here OP? A high quality NBA rookie is worth what they can contribute to teams plus their value over a replacement contract (which can be substantial). For example, if Barnes becomes a starter-quality player within two years then his contract will be worth a lot more than the Raptors are paying him today, since right now he's on a rookie scale contract. As for what that means in dollars, try using this tool: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/scottie-barnes/"
Sorry that he can't be as good as Scottie Barnes
Free Scottie Barnes please. His team is trash. Send him to a big market like he deserves. He could help so many teams
Might as well give future Hofer Scottie Barnes some playoff reps.
"Jimbo, Curry(s), Ja are obvious candidates but I'm going with scottie barnes."
"Kawhi, Kyle, and Marc gave them rings. The remaining raptors outside of maybe Fred did not. Myles could help lots of teams, but he's currently busy helping us.  Edit: free Scottie Barnes please"
"Fuck dude, he was supposed to be the backbone of my fantasy team. Scottie Barnes has been my most consistent player lol"
Another raptor fan pretending to be a nuggets fan so that they can gargle Scottie Barnes balls in every post without being downvoted?
Scottie Barnes
"Not only that, they've done it without Scottie Barnes, Pascal, and Yuta."
"Yes it does. Do you guys think if you had LaMelo instead, you guys would be so quick to include him in all these trade packages?  Look at any fanbase with a blossoming young player like Tyler Herro or a Scottie Barnes, etc they rarely want to include these players even if it meant getting a proven stud."
Hands down Scottie Barnes
"James Harden - super underrated post defender  Steph Curry - small but very smart, as good a defender as he could possibly be   Alex Caruso - so smart and hardworking. The 2020 Lakers had such good defense for a reason  Scottie Barnes - this guy is already a superstar. some might call him a forward but he’s definitely a guard as well  D’angelo Russell - 4th best defensive rating in the league so far this season. Can’t argue with the numbers"
"Lots of takeaways so far:     - OG is an Allstar? Dude is ballin    - FVV just hits shots when you need em (Chauncey Jr?)   - Trent Jr is a confident scorer and can fill it up    - Precious, Svi, Flynn, and Birch are better players than we thought   - Scottie Barnes is a special talent    - Dalano Banton  has been a massive steal"
"People seem to underestimate the power of good coaching. I genuinely believe we have the best coach in the league. Also people didn’t believe me when I said OG took that next step. Scottie Barnes however, I didn’t even see that one coming myself."
Let's give some first fortnight awards.  * MVP of the first two weeks - Jimmy Butler * DP of the first two weeks - Jimmy Butler * 6M of the first two weeks - Tyler Herro * MIP of the first two weeks - Tyler Herro * RO the first two weeks - Scottie Barnes who's from West Palm Beach and probably was a Heat fan as a kid * CO the first two weeks - Eric Spoelstra * EO the first two weeks - Pat Riley * Teammate of the first two weeks - Kyle Lowry
Future 🐐 Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes no biasy
"“..Should the Toronto raptors trade FVV, Pascal, OG, Scottie &amp; Barnes for Ben Simmons? I think they might need to sweeten the pot with 3 1st rnd draft picks to get it done..” -skip bayless tmrw morning"
"Did you follow any of Scottie Barnes draft coverage? Most people expected him to be an extremely underwhelming scorer for a top pick which hasn’t been the case so far. Also, almost everyone expected Mobley to be really good, but a lot of people thought that it would take him a couple years to get there."
Does it work halfway down the thread as well?  Let's find out:  SCOTTIE BARNES.
"Lol they’re somehow doing it without Lowry, Siakam and now Scottie Barnes. The Nurse Train stops for nobody."
"Nah man that was Scottie, we are talking about Barnes"
"Looking at the Scottie Barnes pick, imagine Philly running the process with Masai as the GM.  They probably would have had multiple rings by now."
SCOTTIE BARNES
"And Scottie Barnes being a top 5 midrange shooter in the league lol, like we all predicted"
Probably wants Rivers replaced with Scottie Barnes
**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
So strange that Scottie Barnes’ worst attribute might be his defense this year. Those Draymond comparisons seem so off. He’s the exact opposite type of player apparently lol.
"Yeah, but the comment before had the context of implying that these copy cats weren't as good as the originals and couldn't actually do what the original did. You saying scottie barnes implies that he's that, which I (and I'm sure you) disagree with."
How many wins would this all-rookie starting 5 lineup get?  * PG) Josh Giddey * SG) Chris Duarte * SF) Scottie Barnes * PF) Franz Wagner * C) Evan Mobley
meanwhile Scottie 'can't shoot' Barnes leads the Raps in FG% and points per game.
"The scottie barnes shooting 22% from three? That scottie barnes? His middy has been falling, but i wouldn't say he can shoot yet lol  Scottie's good even tho he can't shoot tho, other guys like Josh Jackson, Stanley Johnson... not so much. I'd say guys like OG and siakam are better examples from the raps alone, even tho siakam isn't a wing"
"That bad game against UCLA really stuck in people’s minds, but he was incredible last year in college. Thoroughly outplayed Scottie Barnes the game before that in the tournament as well."
Scottie Barnes for ROTY!!!!
"IMO it should go: 1) Scottie Barnes, 2) Franz Wagner, 3) Chris Duarte, 4) Evan Mobley, 5) Jalen Green"
"What makes you say Trae and Luka are leaders? As far as I know they are both more ""lead by example"" types, which usually means they are just the best players but not really a leader.  If we are talking about young players though, Ja tops the list as an immediate leader. I'd also put Cole Anthony and in his own weird way, LaMelo Ball as young leaders on their teams.  I think Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes will be that as well.  I think a lot of it can be developed with experience, but it depends on locker room dynamics as much as anything. Bam wasn't really a leader when he was drafted, but under UD's mentorship he basically has become one. It's not super neccessary with Butler and Lowry there, but he's a good example of someone developing those traits."
"Yeah, definitely can fit and execute the ""tall point guard"" meta: can score on all three levels and has the courtvision to make some terrific passes. I always thought Jalen was exceptional enough to be a heliocentric player. That game he had in highschool vs Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes and Day’Ron Sharpe he was pretty much the main point guard and threw some insane passes then too to lead his team and get the win.  However, if you want him to load balance an offense and for him to be a defensive stopper, I really think you start asking for too much. For example, Mavericks fans have accepted that Luka won't be able to be a defensive stopper if he's carrying the entire offensive load.  Earlier than better is the time to decide the skill tree: outside of scoring (the given) do we want Jalen to execute the offense top to bottom or expend more energy on defense?   Now if Jalen does both, that guy would be something else entirely.  This would also affect what we want out of KPJ: if we want Jalen to carry the playmaking then kpj should be able to anchor the perimeter defense."
More stat line posts this year — Westbrook or Scottie Barnes?
"Scottie Barnes, you know the vibes."
"Oh word? I had no idea.  Not every Max Contract is a bad contract, Siakam is a young enough player on a high dollar contract locked up for the next 3 years. Haliburton may improve linearly, but he also may not and given the trajectory of our team right now, trading Pascal for Haliburton puts our rebuild back 2-3 years, around the time OG and FVV need new contracts while betting that Haliburton will become a star when we already have OG primed to take a big jump and Scottie Barnes looking great.  Yes if we could get a great 2 guard to go with a future of OG at the 3 and Barnes at 4 that would be amazing, but its a swing you don't need to take right now.  Even if you think its a positional improvement it just doesn't make sense in the current environment, especially considering Sacramento isn't one Siakam away from being relevant, they don't make that trade for the timeline/expectation of their team OR for the fact that they'd need to give up considerable pieces as well to make the salaries work.  Yknow not everyone who disagrees with you is a fake fan, its possible they know their team situation better than you do."
You mean like Scottie Barnes?
U mean king good sir. Scottie Barnes is our prince
Boy oh boy do the Raptors and Masai look smart right now...their playing 3d chess while the rest of he league plays checkers lol  Who would have thought we would be saying Scottie Barnes will probably win ROY while Cade looks like a bust lol   I'm sure Cade will get it figured out but what a wild and entertaining year it's been so far!
Josh Giddey Jalen Green Scottie Barnes Franz Wagner Evan Mobley
scottie barnes ?
"Here are his previous comments on the raptors in the last week (We won the last 4 games in a row btw)  ""Mobley you can make a case for but all Barnes has done is empty stats""  ""lmao OG does not belong here"" (On a post referencing og winning MIP)  ""Best player from this draft class, cant believe r/nba said Scottie Barnes and Giddey better lol""  ""Franz Wagner &gt; Barnes tbh.""  (Made a post about Scottie being off the bench despite being our best player)  ""Overpaying Fred and Trent. These bums earning 40 million a year combined is gonna kill our cap""  ""Oh my god get this bum FVV off the team. Garbage player""  &amp;#x200B;  You really think this guy is a real raptors fan?"
I'm not going to declare #1 overall pick Cade a bust but so far he's 0-14 from 3pt range averaging 3 PPG. Meanwhile:  \#4 pick Scottie Barnes is averaging 18/9  \#13 pick Chris Duarte is averaging 18/4  Cade Cunningham isn't off to a ROTY start I think it's fair to say.
I'm excited about Sengun the way Raptors fans are about Scottie Barnes.
Jalen Green: 17/3.6/3.6 on 37% from the field  Scottie Barnes: 18.1/8.9/2 on 55% from the Field  Scottie &gt;
"Best player from this draft class, cant believe r/nba said Scottie Barnes and Giddey better lol"
Scottie Barnes sadly
Scottie Barnes would never
I mean just rename it the ‘Scottie Barnes award’ already
"I just love every rookie all around, Scottie Barnes was my pick for ROTY and Evan Mobley a close second. Now that Cade is showing his true potential I won’t be surprised if he gets it instead. I’m loving this rookie class a lot"
"Doesnt always work like, a lot of times adding a good player doesnt contribute to wins. If the same thing happened with Scottie Barnes I guarantee you'd be all over raving about his impact."
"Scottie Barnes&gt; all your young players.  Masai&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Morey.  Having Embiid on the Sixers is like having buying  expensive furniture for a dog shit house. No matter how much good furniture you buy, you will always be in a dog shit house."
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes would never
"I was bout to shit on you as a Raptors fan trying to bring Scottie into a conversation he has no place in, but then i realized there was another Barnes in the league."
He’s the same age as Scottie Barnes and younger than Mobley
Because we need to be talking about Scottie Barnes instead
Stay mad your garbage franchise won't win anything after Kawhi carried your bum asses against a completely injured warriors team. Don't you have to jerk off to Scottie Barnes you freak?
So began the tale of Scottie Barnes' career....
Anyone else think Scottie Barnes is better than Jesus?
"Yeah, I just don’t think the front office is in a rush to trade him. Pascal was a pretty good 3 pt shooter prior to his injury, when he wasn’t the number 1 option, and he was getting open looks from the corner. I think the team thinks he can get back to that type of efficiency, especially now that OG, FVV, GTJ are coming into their own offensively, and command respect in their own offensive creation. If Scottie can progress shooting wise, there’s lots of upside here. If there’s some amazing offer I’m sure Masai will listen, but I’m not sure there’s many players that meets what we’re looking for that are on the block. Harrison Barnes certainly isn’t the one to move the needle for us. It’s too early, with too many variables right now to truly gauge this current lineup."
He’s no scottie barnes thats for sure
Love combining the old school Dino with the new age black and gold!  Pre-ordered a Scottie Barnes as soon as they were released!
Bench Scottie Barnes? Oof you’re really asking for the Scottie circle jerkers to target you. Scottie is GOAT level.  How dare you?
"The problem with shifting the lineup around is that  A. Siakam isn't really a floor stretcher, so any lineup with Siakam/Barnes/Center is really squeezed offensively  B. We kinda need Scottie in the lineup cause he's our only defender out of our main 5 who doesn't constantly gamble  I just see no way to fit Siakam into the Raptors long term personally, although Raptors fans give me tons of shit for saying it and then don't explain why"
The Scottie Barnes stuff is literally all from one person lmao
Hear me out an aged Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes is overrated and will flame out of this league.  Damian Lillard is a better player than Steph Curry because of his intangibles and leadership.
"Sorry, let’s get back to posting Scottie Barnes breathing and giving it 100 awards"
"Top 5 is as followed KD, Giannis, Steph, Jokic, Scottie Barnes"
Scottie Barnes
"Do you play basketball to win it all or get the 4th overall pick? Team is having one of its worst seasons of the past decade after getting the pick, that ranks exceptionally low on list of Raps accomplishments of past decade.  And I say that fully expecting Scottie Barnes to be much better than typical 4th pick.  Would you trade the title for some 4th pick?"
"Just have it cycle between Scottie Barnes, Klay's boat, the Lakers, and Ben Simmons at random and you're good to go."
Wait... If Scottie Barnes is the GOAT and CJ outplayed Barnes...
I’m saying it’s not always the non-Scottie Barnes fans bringing him up lol. OP literally posted this for the purposes of talking about other rookies and the ROTY race.
Its funny how its always non-Scottie Barnes fans like you bringing him up every thread.
Meanwhile Scottie Barnes got a tech yesterday for clapping after a horrendous call by the ref when Dame slipped and they bailed him out.
He was the only thing stopping the Scottie Barnes circle jerkers going all out :(
"AD getting ejected for tying his shoes  Kelly Oubre Jr. getting ejected for complaining about a no call  Scottie Barnes getting T'd for clapping  With them removing the offensive foul baiting for the most part the refs have been on one, by far the worst part of the game"
but muh Scottie Barnes !!!!
better than scottie barnes
It would only be feasible in a world where he demands a trade. It’s kind of a lateral move for the Wolves (we’d obviously be the ones adding picks or someone else like Flynn to sweeten the deal) because Siakam doesn’t really have the “young with potential” thing going anymore (they’re the same age) and doesn’t necessarily elevate their team if they were to swap places although he’d def change the dynamic. As an onball creator he does add another option for them because Towns is more dependent on his guys getting him the ball which is why with Ant and DLo you’re seeing Towns shoot as many FGA as Scottie Barnes lol
Stop with the Scottie Barnes spam
Scottie Barnes would never
He’s younger and better than Scottie Barnes.
"Yeah, it seemed like that tech got him to start driving. He blew by Barnes a ton tonight, definitely had him worried about the step back threes. And once he decided to drive, there wasn’t much waiting behind Barnes at the rim.   There was another sequence earlier where Portland went on a run and you could 100% see Dame was hunting a dagger three to put it to bed. Scottie did an amazing job crowding him and Dame finally gave up after like 14 seconds of trying to set him up for a step back three. Of course it ended up just being CJ wide open from three.   Anyway, point being that when Dame was hunting his shot against Barnes, he seemed to defend him well, but when Dame got aggressive and went to the rim, he easily blew by him."

If Scottie Barnes dunked this successfully it would have 3000 upvotes and 500 Raptors fans in the comments fawning over him
"He's no Scottie Barnes, but he's gonna be a hell of a player."
The GOAT is obviously Scottie Barnes.
it’s all good when we get a scottie barnes post after every game tho
Nice. I’m going to my first game at Chase Center on Sunday to see Steph Curry. Draymond battle vs Scottie Barnes too.
"Cavs have a lot to be happy about. They stayed competitive until the last 2 minutes while missing Allen/Sexton/Markennan/Love and Lamar Stevens (bleh). Losing Sexton is really going to hurt this team's offensive flow for awhile because of his burst and relentless attack that keeps opposing defenses on their heels, but it's clearly going to be Garland's time to shine. He was already super talented, but now he's learning how to be a NBA point guard - only real weakness is his size.     As for Mobley - the kid had his first bad game. He's leading the league in contested shots per game and I imagine he will continue to impress defensively while his offensive game improves. Get some meat on him - he's already got the package, including beautiful form on his jumper and post footwork. ROTY is his and/or Scottie Barnes to take at this juncture IMO."
Scottie Barnes would never…
"Nurse Matched Nurkic up to barnes to start off, Chauncy was smart by taking Jusuf onto pascal, where he certainly was able to leverage himself, Since its still only 4 games back. Keeping dame attached to Scottie and away from FVV was another good call I can think of off the top of my head.  y'all did good after that rough start, GG"
No love for Scottie Barnes in this thread huh
Scottie Barnes getting blocked? Yesssssss
This Scottie Barnes is seriously good.. alongside og.  From a blazers fan
Scottie Barnes FT is getting better.
Scottie Barnes turnover in crunch time LMAO
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes is going to be great.
Bullshit foul. Scottie Barnes shouldn’t be getting calls.
"I don’t think it’s a matter of dislike for the player though, maybe the accounts yeah but it gets annoying seeing 5 Scottie Barnes highlights from one game to find out he had 8 points"
"Scottie Barnes, you Raptors fans made me think this dude was a legit star. He’s closer to Scott Brooks than anything else right now, a disappointment. 8 points at the half? Sad."
"Why post here, you’ll just get downvoted if you’re not a raptors fan and sucking off scottie barnes"
"lol, what's with this blame culture. We won the most road games. Siakam came back from not playing for a billion months. Scottie Barnes is a fresh off stove rookie.  Give it some time."
Scottie Barnes disses Scottie Barnes better 🤷‍♂️
Scottie Barnes fans salivating rn   Me included /s lol
"Cade’s defence has been a lot more than fine. You saw him block Scottie Barnes last game, I’d say his defence has been the strongest part of his game, especially how he guards multiple positions   I’m just confused cause Cade went #1 due to BBIQ and feel, and he’s shown that plenty so far."
Except Scottie Barnes is sick
You misspelt Scottie Barnes brodie
But this ain't a Scottie Barnes post
"I have no love for your Lakers, but I think the hate came more from overexposure. There are more Lakers fans on this sub than any other team, so seeing a bunch of uninspiring highlights from role players on the front page made people sour on pretty much every Lakers player. Scottie Barnes is going to be the most hated player on /r/NBA in a couple seasons for the exact same reason."
Spamming every Scottie Barnes post with awards is extremely insecure.   r/RaptorFanMoment
Every Scottie Barnes post is spammed with awards by insecure raptors fans lol
Just title it “Scottie Barnes sniffs air” and you’re good
"That’s not Scottie Barnes, it’s GODZILLA"
What kind of dumbfuck says “x player has more potential than Scottie Barnes”. Have you lost your fucking mind bro cuz I’ll help ya find it
"Jesus fucking Christ, there's no way you said this with a straight face. We may not have lived through Jordan's era, but I sure lived through the Curry Warriors era and Curry is by far the most important player of the Warriors, the entire system do not work as well without Curry. People were sagging off guys like Draymond/Harrison Barnes to double/triple team Curry.  Like the other guy said, there's levels to this.  P.S. I know I am 2 days late but this is just a terrible take. Draymond is a valuable part of the Warriors dynasty, almost irreplaceable, like a Scottie Pippen, but he does not nearly have the same impact as Steph fucking Curry. Not even close. Please don't take this the wrong way, this doesn't mean that they're not valuable to the team, it's just that Steph Curry is Steph ""skyfucker"" Curry. That's it."
Bro if you guys can flood the sub with Scottie Barnes taking a mid range shot then this definitely deserves to stay.
Mf be flooding the sub with Scottie Barnes mid range shots and then tag the Spurs sub on a genuinely interesting post which includes close games against other teams.
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
Scottie Barnes is the same distance from Korkmaz as he is from Michael Jordan
just checked the raptors sub and its pretty unanimously scottie barnes
"Obviously Mobley or Cade would've been huge, Scottie Barnes, etc. but until we know what we have in Primo I'd rather Devin Vassell, Lonnie and Keldon get as many minutes as they can handle.  Not to mention that Dejounte has taken a step this year. He's still not efficient enough and is still frustratingly allergic to the FT line, but he hasn't lowered his efficiency with the larger offensive load and his defense is the best it's been since he made all-defense in 17-18. He can be a starter on a contending team depending on the other pieces."
Scottie Barnes award
Hooray!  Another Scottie Barnes post. This time about how tall he thinks he is. Quality content.   When do we find out his favorite ice cream flavor?
"Lot of people keep mentioning Mobley, and rightfully so, but we shouldn’t forget Scottie Barnes. Another name to watch out for is Cade."
They will not go extinct because someone else will come along. Like Scottie Barnes for example.
I got that as well lolol tried to connect Scottie Barnes to Wilt
"It's not perfect, I tried connecting Scottie Barnes to Wilt Chamberlain and it told me raptors rookie David Johnson played in the 1950s"
"I would bet anything Scottie Barnes is not a superstar. He is going to be the first supergalaxy. The way his brain works, the way his arms move, that girth, that goddamnned smile….. those eyes…. a star is too limited a ceiling. This man is a galaxy."
\#1 Raptor is obviously Scottie Barnes
"If you’re trying to say Scottie Barnes is not going to retire as the greatest of all time, I’m sorry bucko, you’re crazy."
Is THT a 6’4 Scottie Barnes?
should i trade ingram for scottie barnes / dinwiddie in fantasy?
"The other day I was watching the Raptors game in the living room. My girl came in and I had to tell her, sorry babe, the Scottie Barnes jersey stays ON while I watch you have sex with that man I paid on the street"
Scottie Barnes has:  LeBron’s physique  Derrick Rose’s speed  Michael Jordan’s vertical  Magic Johnson’s passing ability  Steph Curry’s shooting ability  Dennis Rodman’s rebounding  Kawhi Leonard’s defense
As if we don't get 20 Scottie Barnes highlights every game... 🤔
"""With all these Scottie Barnes highlights every night you'd think he'd be averaging 30 ppg"""
True. You agreeing with Scottie Barnes = More potential than Giannis.
"Yeah, when you look at the advanced stats this becomes obvious.  The other day I was watching the Raptors game in the living room, my mom came in and was like “that guy seems really good.” She was actually talking about Scottie Barnes, who had just hit another one of his signature layups."
"We're over the moon, because getting Barnes at all was just a consequence of many things working out better than they should have by chance:      * the team having an unexpected tank below their talent level due to playing in Tampa because of COVID    * being lucky to get the 4th pick when we were only 7th worst team.   * This particular draft being so talented that a guy as talented as Scottie fell to 4th.  It took those 3 things for us to land Scottie, and then on top of that he's exceeded expectations already.  The guys right though, if you give me Scottie or Mobley right now I'd take Mobley, but that's because he has a legit chance to be the best player in the league some day."
It is Scottie barnes
Either that or Scottie Barnes
"Mobley all but has it in the bag, Scottie Barnes the only one close. But Cade catching on too"
Totally. It's Mobleys to lose but Scottie Barnes can't be counted out. Cade is looking good too.
"Scottie was hounding Cade full court but he ain’t force no turnovers &amp; Cade got the ball past him every time so i don’t see what the issue was? Just seems like nitpicking to me  It’s not like he’ll be guarded by Barnes or Simmons every game, of whom are nightmare matchups for every guard in the league let alone rookies"
"&gt;Scottie Barnes at 5?  I kid you not I read something today where he was the final pick, of the 2nd round.  60.   I will chop my own dick off and eat it on camera if that happens."
If we pick scottie barnes then i trust the front office tbh
"going off the board and picking Scottie Barnes or Kuminga at 4 (if they want any of these two players they should trade down and get them, not take them at 4)"
"scotties agent deserves a raise, we where debating Davion Mitchell / Scottie Barnes at 7 and now he's somehow hyped Barnes all the way up to 4/5"
meanwhile im out here losing my mind over every report and rumour that the raps might pick scottie barnes at 4 even though I know its probably nothing.
didnt some other guy just tweet that the Raptors are going to take Scottie Barnes?
"Hi Jake, thanks for taking the time on such a big day to do this! In terms of your reports on the Raptors (ie. Suggs’ workout not going well, Raptors liking Scottie Barnes a lot, ect.), are your sources from within the Raptors organization or are these more the general feelings from teams/executives around the league?"
"&gt;If you're reading this in 2025 to see who was early on the scottie barnes train, send me a message Lol so I can use this to become an NBA scout.  Not sure if people hiring would be impressed with   &gt;I just have this feeling  as your reasoning lol"

"Idk how anyone can watch Jalen Suggs play basketball, then Scottie Barnes play basketball, and come away thinking Barnes is better.   Dont overthink this cuz of size and wingspan or whatever blog bloy statistic. Pick the guy who plays basketball better. This isnt the olympics."
Scottie Barnes horny af
"Is this Scottie Barnes himself, one of his relatives, or the head coach of Florida State?"
"Scottie Barnes has seriously gotten the biggest draft week push ever, lol.   Dude went from in the solid 6-10ish range, to suddenly people saying Toronto might pick him #4."
"No clue, so I’m just gonna throw this out. Shoutout to anyone from 2026 if you’re reading this.   1) Jalen Green  2) Cade Cunningham  3) Alperen Sengun  4) Davion Mitchell  5) Kai Jones  6) Scottie Barnes  7) Someone from the 2nd round  8) Late 1st rounder  9) Jalen Suggs  10) Undrafted player  This is super random, so I’ll be intrigued to see how this looks in 5 years."
"Scottie Barnes at 5?  I kid you not I read something today where he was the final pick, of the 2nd round.  60."
"I'm guessing that we really want Scottie Barnes but can only get him if we somehow indirectly convince Orlando to trade back with someone, especially a team like Memphis who may covet a player we just *reportedly* leaked that we're going to select."

The Thunder are so hard to pin down right now. But I do believe they are trying to get to No. 4 to draft Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes taken over Suggs would be nuts
With #5 I'm almost certain it'll be Scottie Barnes because of how much our FO values character. With #8 it depends on OKC and GSW but my guess is the pick will be Moses Moody.
"Right now, there's a strong belief it could just as much be Scottie Barnes as Suggs."
At this point it seems either Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs. There is a bunch of information flying around team executives right now that Suggs' workout with the Raptors did not go very well.
At this point it seems either Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs. There is a bunch of information flying around team executives right now that Suggs' workout with the Raptors did not go very well.
Thats fair It does feel like over paying. If we had the 20th pick id feel better about that statement. How do you feel about trading the 12th with a player like (lonnie or white) for the 5th or 6th spot for Scottie Barnes? Clearly im looking for a high upside pf for my Spurs
"1) Is there anyone in this draft that you think/have heard rumbling about, that might go a lot higher than they're currently mocked to be picked, or anyone you think could have an unexplainable drop?   -------------------------------  2) Kai Jones and Isaiah Jackson seem to be two of the most polarizing players in this draft, with mock drafts having them anywhere from a borderline top 10 pick to sometimes even the 2nd round (more so regarding Isaiah Jackson). Any thoughts on them as prospects, and where you think they finally end up getting picked?   ---------------------------------  3) Scottie Barnes has seemingly exploded in media hype over the past week, with reports yesterday even saying Toronto could potentially pick him at #4. Is this just typical draft week over sensationalized hype to stir up discussion? Or is there truly something there?"
"Hi Jake, you've put out a lot of content surrounding the Raptors' plans lately. From what you've heard, what can you say about their decision-making process heading into the draft? Trying to get an idea why they're looking at Scottie Barnes at 4 over Suggs. Thanks!"
"Why would Scottie Barnes be on the menu if Suggs is off the board? There's two (three) possibilities in that scenario. Green is available, in which case the Raptors will take him or Mobley is available in which case the Raptors will take him or God forbid, Cade is available in which case the Raptors will definitely take him."
Star: Jalen Green   Bust: Scottie Barnes   Steal: Trey Murphy
Star: Jalen Suggs   Bust: Scottie Barnes   Steal: Ayo Dosunmu
Scottie Barnes*
Scottie Barnes is
He's no Scottie Barnes...
&gt;though six-foot-nine do-it-all defender Scottie Barnes of Florida State would be a more than welcome fallback option if Suggs is off the board.  What situation does that imply?
Did you miss the part where he said Scottie Barnes was the fallback
I saw a rumor that okc would have to give up 4 first rounders IN ADDITION to the 6th pick to get this done. That would be an awful move. Rather have Scottie Barnes at 6.
"Thank god, was hearing a lot of Scottie Barnes buzz and I’ll be pretty disappointed if we don’t take suggs."
"2K drafts are always so random though, I had one the other day where Scottie Barnes was taken 1st overall and Cade fell to 8th lol"
Franz is a really good player and I think his 3 will translate he was a decent free throw shooter. I personally think he’s a better player than Scottie Barnes is right now but I am definitely biased
With all this scottie barnes talk you would think he would be the number one pick.
Scottie Barnes agent is the new goat
Scottie Barnes hes too limited on offense and drafting a Draymond green type of player without two of the greatest shooters ever wouldn't be a good move.
"You called him a low upside shooter, a low upside SHOOTER, for a guy who just shot 65.7% TS last season in college, 42% from 3, might as well just say you have no idea what you're talking about.   And this point about him not being able to create for himself is just dumb. Is he some elite level Trae Young type shot creator? No, no one claimed he was, but treating him like so Scottie Barnes level of shot creator, almost non existent, is stupid"
Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes unless we trade down for some reason
Scottie Barnes. If I hear the name Scott after the 4th pick that TV is going out the Window.
Scottie Barnes
Teams hope Scottie Barnes can be half the player Simmons is.
Scottie Barnes will be Stanley Johnson 2.0
God I hope the Magic don't take Scottie Barnes. He is a super interesting prospect and I feel like Orlando would just ruin him.
"Man the more details I find out about that the madder I get. How the fuck did that happen?  Like I’m trying to find the equivalent here, it’s like if Houston took Scottie Barnes, but even *that* wouldn’t be as bad."
"James Bouknight   Scottie ""shooting doesn't matter"" Barnes"
I would want Scottie Barnes if he's still available but I don't think it's happening and we'll get Bouknight instead.

You prioritize BPA...   I think SCottie Barnes is is already the consensus top 5
not buying into the scottie barnes hype.
"The way people talk about Scottie Barnes, he not only is good on defense, he’s also a generational point guard/Draymond 2.0 who can also walk on water…   Never seen someone so gushed over that not only wasn’t the number one pick, but also not even top 3. By the sounds of it, Barnes will save whatever franchise he comes to.  So, Orlando…sounds like they better take Scottie Barnes."
"Suggs and Suggs, might jump off a bridge if I hear Scottie Barnes called"
"I'm a Raptors and a Pistons fan so I've been doing a deep dive on this draft. Many respected writers and basketball minds have said Suggs and potentially Scottie Barnes would be #1 in last year's draft. The Athletic's draft guru, [Sam Vecenie, says that Suggs would go #1 in last year's draft](https://theathletic.com/author/sam-vecenie/) (and has him as #2 this year). John Hollinger said the same thing. [Many scouts agree](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2918974-2021-nba-draft-buzz-scouts-see-3-prospects-who-wouldve-been-2020-no-1-pick).  This is all to say, the reason this draft is getting more hype than last year is that the high-end talent is significantly better than last year."
"Seems like the exact same fit in both teams honestly. Are you guys open to trading 3 for 5 &amp; 8 from the Magic? A Scottie Barnes could fit seamlessly into what yall got goin on, and then you could get another really good player"
"Barnes might not end up being the best player in the draft, but hes going to be one of those guys everyone wishes they had on their team. Insane work ethic, love for the game, makes his teammates better, incredible locked in defender. Does everything out there. He probably won’t ever be a 25 point a game scorer - but hes going to be a key piece on a championship team. No one should be disappointed if they get Scottie Barnes"
"This draft has been hyped for awhile. A lot of blue chippers between Cade, Green, Mobley, Kuminga, and Suggs. Scottie Barnes, James Bouknight, Moses Moody, Josh Giddey, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones are all intriguing in their own ways too."
"dawg, I've seen full Scottie Barnes games. I really don't understand why he's even a lottery pick. His playmaking is promising, but other than that, teams are just jerking off at the idea of his height and wingspan, not actual basketball skills."
"Its not Masai being cute, its everyone else acting like trading down from the most loaded top 4 in a long time is a good idea.   I just hope we dont see those dumb ""What if we had traded down or selected Scottie Barnes"" posts after Suggs gets drafted."
Scottie Barnes. Versatile defender and skilled offensively!
"Am I crazy, or should Detroit have accepted that? Shai averaged 24-6-5 on 50% shooting and 42% from three. He's literally the type of player you hope you get in a draft. I understand you'll have to pay him, but that seems worth it, plus you can still add a Scottie Barnes/Kuminga."
"I still just feel like it's a big reach at 6. If we're banking on him significantly improving 4 or 5 skills to reach his ceiling, why not just go ahead and draft Scottie Barnes or Kuminga? Those guys need to make similar improvements to their games, but they have significantly better athletic profiles to start with.  I just have a hard time seeing the reasoning for Giddey at 6. 10-15 is where he starts to make sense IMO."
After scottie Barnes
"I know they won't draft him, but scottie barnes would be awesome in cleveland"
cade is worth more than Shai and 6 anyway   Shai and Scottie Barnes giving me flashes of 2010s Atlanta
That standing reach is impossible. Scottie Barnes has a standing reach of 9' while being 4' shorter and a smaller wingspan
"Tbh if that actually was offered, i would have taken that if i was Detroit.   You get SGA and one of Scottie Barnes or Kuminga."
"Ok then, look at the top of this draft, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson, and Evan Mobley are all good-to-great passers."
Scottie Barnes*
"three top 6 picks for a public school. fucking absurd. [first time *any* HS team had 3 lottery picks](https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-11-18/chino-hills-high-three-nba-draft-lottery-picks)  (montverde had cade, scottie barnes, and moses moody who are all likely goin lottery this year though. not public)"
"Running the point =/= being a point guard, they had no point guards. And that link you posted literally calls him “forward Scottie Barnes.” Scottie was a bench player anyways &amp; I highly highly doubt he’s being drafted to run a team’s offence from the 1."
"&gt;Florida State didn’t recruit any point guards  Lol what tf are you on about.  [""As of now, only Florida State is recruiting Barnes as a point guard""](https://usatodayhss.com/2019/usa-basketball-chosen-25-forward-scottie-barnes-wants-to-run-the-point-in-college)  He is a PG, and if you had watched him at all it would be abundantly clear."
I have this weird feeling Scottie Barnes will go 3 to Cleveland. I don’t see them doubling up with Mobley and Allen or letting Allen just walk.
"Kevin O'Connor did a Jonathan Kuminga video yesterday on The Ringer and mentioned the Kuminga discussion most likely starts at 6, as Orlando likes Scottie Barnes with the 5th pick. Honestly, either one of Barnes/Bouknight seems great, at least personally."
"I think you're saying the same thing. he's just also saying we should have tanked so we could get Scottie Barnes instead of Kai Jones, for example. personally I'm happy to take Sengun, he's my favorite guy after Scottie at 5 anyway so I'm not mad about it at this point. I will admit I was mad when we didn't trade DeMar and Rudy, though, because I didn't want to lose them for nothing."
Exactly what people are seeing in Scottie Barnes right now.
Scottie Barnes is Stanley Johnson 2.0
&gt;The one that makes make more sense is Scottie Barnes  I don't know if a PG who shoots 28% from 3 and 60% from the line is what Cleveland needs right now
It's tough to find a good fit in Cleveland. The one that makes make more sense is Scottie Barnes and after him Kuminga and Mobley would be amazing with Toronto. I would love to see the Magic trading up with the Cavs and select Suggs with the 3rd Pick!

Scottie Barnes is the best player in the draft.
All this scottie barnes hype... Hes basically the second coming of MKG. Jalen Green will be the next T Mac
"How so?   They haven’t really announced much besides a report yesterday saying they were looking at Scottie Barnes and then this one.   Typically the Raptors don’t announce anything, so this news is definitely being leaked from other people or speculation."
"I really really want the raptors to swing on him at No. 4, part because I believe in him and part because i'm a bit uninspired with suggs. However, Masai has earned the right to whatever the fuck he wants. Beyond exited. I think the raps might ultimately end up making a move because the draft starts at #4 unless Scottie Barnes goes top 3"
"we have no true offensive creator, which is nightmare fuel for the playoffs. Unless Pascal takes a huge step out Scottie Barnes develops a jumper."
lol raptors aren't taking scottie barnes
"Masai picks Scottie ""literally Magic Johnson"" Barnes and this is the question you ask? No way bud, they're gonna go 82-0, Nick Nurse gonna play center for them"
Man deserves $2 for helping us get Scottie barnes
Scottie Barnes is a power forward. idk why people keep calling him a guard. Just because he's young and can defend guards doesn't make him one.
"This man got us Scottie Barnes. If you need a lottery pick, this is your man. No reasonable offer refused. Or any offer."
"CJ for Siakam feels like it makes some sense for both sides.  Siakam has proven to be a great #2 option, when he played next to Kawhi. He just hasn’t been able to thrive as the number one option. He’s also very good defensively. It’d also open up a starting spot for Powell.   For the Raptors, CJ has more playmaking chops than he’s shown next to Lillard. It’d also open up playing time for Scottie Barnes. Plus, FVV seems like a perfect backcourt partner for CJ.  The Blazers don’t have to find a move that makes them an instant contender, but it seems crazy not to make *any* type of move."
"Yea he’s really the main asset here. I think we’d rather give more run to fvv, Malachi, and even some Scottie Barnes at the 1 (for developmental reasons). Raptor fans would prolly appreciate him more if we were contending."
"I mean, but you believe in his development over proven stars? Scottie Barnes is a 6”9 Wing drafted by Toronto who I’d argue has a better developmental system than Memphis. Why not include him?"
"I have lasting images of Scottie Barnes, Chris Boucher, &amp; Khem Birch/Precious Achiuwa murdering us on the offensive glass  As well as Gary Trent Jr. getting to the rim at will on us"

That Scottie Barnes guy is pretty good.

"Lamelo has been famous since he was 14, why would him and Scottie Barnes get the same type of attention?"
Agenda is being switched from OG MIP to Scottie Barnes MVP
I wouldn't have predicted this result after Thursday but fuck me that second half from the Celtics was awful.  Scottie barnes is going to be a hell of a player.
Scottie Barnes. He special
Scottie Barnes.
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes is the real fucking deal
"Fred and OG were both lacking on offense tonight, but the whole team looked locked in on defense. Scottie Barnes really showing what the Raps saw in him. Love his fit with this team. First game was definitely rough, but this team definitely has play-off aspirations even with the East looking stronger than it has in probably a decade. Excited to see how they look once Siakam is back in the lineup."
Scottie Barnes
It's not a Scottie Barnes game unless he does a no look off-handed pass
*Why were 3 players drafted before Scottie Barnes?!*
scottie barnes is top 30 in ppg as a rookie…
Not to over react but Scottie Barnes is the best player in the NBA
"Scottie ""Magic Johnson"" Barnes"
Is Scottie Barnes the GOAT? 🐐
"SCOTTIE FUCKING BARNES, THIS GUY IS A ROOKIE???????????????????????????????"
I’m… too Scottie for my Barnes.
SCOTTIE BARNES IS A TORONTO RAPTOR !!!!
Scottie barnes
Can’t wait for Scottie Barnes to recruit Tatum
"Get ready r/nba, we’re gonna spam 101 Scottie Barnes propaganda posts in a few mins…"
Scottie Barnes is a Toronto Raptor.
#Where were you when Scottie Barnes became the best SF in the Eastern Conference?!
scottie barnes looks legit
Scottie Barnes
Rookie Scottie Barnes is laying a dump in TD Garden.  Tatum and Brown should be traded and Brad Stevens should be banned from the Celtics organization. I'm sick of watching these guys embarrassing the Celtics jersey.
wow boston is getting spanked by scottie barnes and the drakes
Scottie Barnes might be the best Raptors player in waiting.  Or clearly right now as this game continues.
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes
Lmao getting blown out at home by Scottie Barnes. This franchise is a dumpster fire.
Our two #3 draft picks can't beat rookie Scottie Barnes and undrafted FVV.  How do you not get mad at this incompetent organization?
#Scottie Barnes &gt;&gt;&gt; Your favourite rookie not named Jalen Green
"What does this have to do with Jordan Poole, Scottie Barnes, and Tyler Herro?"
I was hoping Scottie Barnes would be best player on the team eventually. I didn’t expect it to happen by way of everyone else forgetting how to shoot.
Scottie Barnes :)
"OOo it's an equalizer, Scottie Barnes!"
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they’re rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
Draymond with the Scottie Barnes statline
Scottie Barnes
Scottie Barnes  Not full on hate but the media and everyone convinced me Suggs was some kind of god and we would 100% pick him so I did not even scout scottie at all and I disliked him predraft
"Hey Spencer, what's your opinion on the Ben Simmons situation, and the potential ramifications towards players being offered max contracts? Do you think the NBPA will be forced to change the way contracts are structured to force players to not sit out during team disputes? Do you think players should be allowed to make decisions like siting from play while being under contract for 4+ years?  Also as a raptors fan, what is your opinion on Scottie Barnes? Would love to find out your take on these things, best of luck in the season 😁"

You’re a socially awkward virgin who is watches Scottie Barnes highlights
"Mediocre Scottie Barnes highlights such as? His first NBA basket? That's your mediocre highlight? Better get on Rockets fan cause there is a highlight of Jalen Greens first NBA bucket on here! You seem to have also forgot posts hitting front page of rookie Tatum doing banal things like hitting a basic corner three off a kick out.  And Tatum was actually good? Yeah, duh, he is Jayson Tatum he was good as a rookie. But I guess based on one NBA game in his career so far you are going with the ""Scottie Barnes is not actually good"" angle huh. And why wouldn't Scottie Barnes posts be posted by fans of the team he is on? The same way rookie Tatum posts were all Celtics fans or Caruso and THT posts were all Lakers fans. Mans is really clueless af."
Tatum was actually good. Other flairs post his highlights too. Only raptors fans are posting these mediocre Scottie Barnes highlights.
"I replied to another guys comment, which I can do because I'm not the idiot who said ""You want to know what I do when I see a comment I don’t like about my team or players, I keep scrolling...you know the thing you couldn’t do without getting sucked into this stupid back and forth"" as they go and reply to a comment they don't like about a different team. Practice what you preach, if you don't like a comment continue scrolling, like I did with the rookie Tatum spam, Caruso spam, THT spam, etc which have been more egregious than any Barnes posting. Keep that same energy with all the big fanbases my guy.  You are attacking flairs. ""every time the guy dribbles a basketball you Raptors fans try to validate your pick"". ""Raptors fans as a whole"", you take the lowest common denominator dumb fucks and brush anyone with a Raptors flair with it (attacking a flair), so let me ak you a question. Do you think Lakers fans as a whole were sucking THT and Carusos dick like every basic play they made was next level, or do you think that was the lowest common denominator idiots who did so? You are doing the whole Anti-Raptors circlejerk to counter the Raptors circlejerk (which I actually dislike outside of memes like comparing every NBA rookie to Flynn or Kyle Lowry aint a spot up shooter), which makes yall just two sides of the same circlejerking coin.   Pointing out that as a Celtics fan they have no ground to stand on is also a perfectly valid and reasonable point. Then you came in triggered af with your panties in a bunch like the snowflake you are. And your point wasn't ""Raptor fans are sucking their role players dicks"", you were bitching about there being too many Scottie Barnes posts like he isn't the 4th overall pick and only had one singular post today which was his first NBA basket. Thinking you're a dumb fuck isn't the same as having your panties in a bunch, being a snowflake or triggered. You are clearly triggered, a snowflake and got your panties in a bunch over seeing posts of the 4th overall pick. Get over yourself."
Scottie Barnes*  Banton is clearly #2 All time. Still 25 spots left on the NBA 75 team for both of them. We can even fit Precious in there.
Scottie Barnes with team high 12 points as everyone expected.
Scottie Barnes athleticism was way overhyped. He cannot finish at his size and length? It's absurd
Bro I seen a guy post that he drafted OG and Scottie Barnes first in his $50 fantasy league. So cringe b
Same thing just happened in the Raptors game and Scottie Barnes did get called for the foul
Scottie Barnes gonna average a no look pass a game guaranteed
Lol isn't he right handed?  Takes some balls to just throw out an off hand hook shot and be confident it's going is  Therefore Scottie Barnes&gt;Ben Simmons
SCOTTIE ABDUL BARNES
Scottie Barnes lookin like a young Magic lmao
"They literally just drafted Scottie Barnes, why would they do that"
On the Raptors sub there was a quote from FVV talking about how him and Pascal would be in the gym 3-4 hours before practice and now Scottie is trying to beat them to the gym. Barnes is gonna do great things in the NBA
And just like that im a fan of Scottie Barnes
"Scottie Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Montresz Harrell, Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry"
Scottie Barnes
Why does voter fatigue matter? I thought these awards weren’t supposed to be affected by narrative and were to be decided by stats? If the stats show Gobert is the best Defensive player this year then why would him winning it the past 2 seasons have any impact on that? Shouldn’t they be looking at this season and not allow their past choices to cloud their judgement?  Anyways here’s what I think.  MVP: Luka  DPOY: Gobert again  6MOY: D Rose  MIP: Anthony Edwards  ROY: Scottie Barnes based on the fact that the Raptors are better than the Pistons and I think they are better than the Rockets. Maybe them finishing higher and Barnes putting up decent stats swings the judges.  COTY: Steve Nash because the Nets with KD and Harden are really good and if they try in the regular season they could get a lot of Ws. If they load manage them then I think Spoelstra could lead the Heat to a really good record.
this giannis fellow kinda reminds me of Scottie Barnes
"Mvp: Giannas. Lakers too stacked. Nets durant and harden cancel each other out. Curry-&gt; 2nd  Dpoy: Ben simmons on another team or Bam adebayo   Sixth man: Grayson Allen, Cameron Payne   Roy: Scottie Barnes.   Coach: Hawks coach. Nuggets   Mip: Michael porter,"
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"
no way scottie barnes is 6'10 dude looks huge compared to other wings
Scottie Barnes taller
"they just meant kiss it goodbye because it's obviously a two man race between Scottie ""Pippen"" Barnes and Josh ""Magic from Down Under"" Giddey"
"Look at the table, Scottie Barnes is playing well and they're 3-3. On paper, prior to season start, alot of people wouldn't have them playoffs because they gave Lowry.  Like I said, it's hard for the east because if you look at the table, alot of weaker teams are playing super well (wizards 5-1, Hornets 4-2, Bulls 5-1 etc.) and I think they're legit, which is why I make this discussion."
Scottie Barnes. Man’s has potential to be the best Greek Freak
"I don't normally care but seeing like 5 posts every single game is annoying, I would feel the same way about Caruso being posted like that also  ""Scottie Barnes passes for an assist!!""  ""Scottie Barnes makes a jumpshot!""  ""Scottie Barnes farts!!!"""
How dare you the Tampa Bay Raptors and the lottery got us Scottie Barnes! Lol
"Zion, Giannis, bron those are generational physical specimens. Barnes is close but not maybe tier below in how impressive a physical prospect he is .  Now playing that's another ball game. Obv Bron is Bron.   But Scottie doesn't look far off the other two in their first few years."
THATS IT  THE KID IS A BUST  SCOTTIE BARNES AND MOBLEY BETTA  RATIO  or whatever the fuck the kids are saying on Twitter these days
scottie barnes would never
"19-2020 - bubble season - ECF  2020-21 - short offseason, team racked by covid/injury (kemba, brown, tatum, smart don't play more than 10 games together all season),   2021-22 - new/returning players (horford, schroder, richardson) have to fit in, other players dealing with new roles (tatum's the undisputed first option for arguably the first time in a season), new coach, injuries (smart, rob williams, brown), covid (brown), five overtime periods in six games, and a whole lot of premature panic (six games into a season)  add to that that the teams we've played haven't been bad teams - washington is thriving with beal having pieces and those young guys having a 2017 celtics moment where they realise they're crucial pieces instead of sidekicks to lebron, knicks were a legitimate team that just added fournier (had covid issues all last season) and kemba (had injury issues last season after a tiny off season after his playoff run) who are both fresh for the first time in months and eager to ball, and the raptors have the second coming of jesus in scottie barnes.   i don't think it's all that much to worry about yet."
"As an orlando fan, i have to honestly say suggs is a bust that shouldnt even be in the NBA and scottie barnes is a future top 5 player all time. Great get for us, i mean for the raps"
Scottie Barnes scored 10.5x more points than Cunningham tonight.    Source: SCOTTIE. M*********. BARNES.
Fred getting hit with that new dad energy ever since he had Scottie Barnes 🤣
I didn't even notice how bad our sub had gotten until the night we picked Scottie Barnes. Just an absolutely embarrassing display of ignorance and lack of trust.
I am in love with Scottie Barnes
"A Scottie hater is gonna post his stats and think they did something lol  “Scottie Barnes tonight: 7 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists on 3/14 shooting in the loss”  “Where are the raptor fans telling me he’s good??”"
Scottie Barnes is on pace to be the GROAT
The Church of Scottie Barnes growing by the minute
How TF is Scottie Barnes the LEADING SCORER for Raptors again. Wow he's exceeded all expectations.
Scottie Barnes is indeed a good basketball player
Back to back 21pt games from Scottie Barnes!
Duarte and Scottie Barnes are on the phone
I feel you. Scottie Barnes for MVP.
Gimme Scottie Barnes vs Giannis
Scottie Barnes actually has Marvin Bagley's supposed quickest ever second jump
r/nba: Seen enough. He’s a bust. Scottie Barnes better.
"A whole night without Scottie Barnes highlights, why even bother coming to r/nba"
can we get that Scottie Barnes pass to the paint highlight please
"I see Barnes as Scottie Pippen lite. I see Green as Kobe lite. That is if they fulfill their potential. Barnes is going to be a guy who is going to help teams win a lot of championships with his intangibles and versatility on offense and defense.  Green looks to have the raw explosive talent to lead the league in scoring in his prime and from what I have seen, if he dials it up, he can be a decent defender too."
Like this post is about Caris Levert and dude brings up Scottie to talk about how Raptors fans post about Scottie Barnes too much? Lol
scottie barnes has the most posts on r/nba as a rookie
Toronto Raptors’ Masai Ujiri and Bobby Webster. The Rudy Gay deal. The Kawhi deal. Scottie Barnes.
"We do love hyperbolizing. But also, Scottie Barnes is very clearly the greatest rookie of all time so it’s hard not to."
Nah. We should only post about Scottie Barnes like 4-5 times every single night 😂
"You didn’t finish the quote “except for Scottie Barnes, pretty clear already he’s the GOAT”"

Did Scottie Barnes just cock that joint back …and bang on em ?
"Gary Trent has become a true 2 way player. A guy that can get crucial steals and plays good tenacious defense on ball, and he can also get you 16-20 points per night. Raptors are gonna be scary if they get a top 4 seed in the playoffs. I honestly believe Scottie Barnes can play Good honest defense on Giannis. Good enough to slow him down enough to eek out close games in a best of 7."
"Raps but it's close  Middleton  Allen-Pierce-KG and it's not particularly close, Giannis probably has a *slight* advantage over 2008 KG but the #2 and #3 aren't really close  Giannis, he's already got about as much in terms of accomplishments as Dirk and he's only 26  Harden and it's not even a little bit close  Dame, we're (theoretically) trying to compete right now and Dame's got at least a few years left in the tank  Shai, he's got playoff experience and his slashing and passing would be huge for us in terms of opening up mismatches for JB and JT  Scottie Barnes. Not even for on-court reasons, I don't want MPJ's antivax ass on my already COVID-battered team lmao  Considering contract, definitely Barnes. Not considering contract, it's a tossup.  Marcus Smart when healthy, but it's been a while since we've seen him able to go 100%. I think he'll recover this season though. On-ball it's pretty even, but when he's giving full effort Smart is one of the best guard team defenders in the league, whereas Dort is just alright at that.  Heat, then Cavs 1.0, then Cavs 2.0, then Lakers"
"Felt pretty good winning a chip tbh, still riding that high. Now we’ve got a hype future in Scottie Barnes. Future is bright my dude, but keep that same energy all season - stan up mi yute"

SCOTTIE BARNES BABIEEEEE.
"Rly? I thought the opposite for two reasons, the only players whove had the scottie name were role players, second options like pippen, then 3rd option to role players in harrison barnes ( i know hes having a big season atm) and matt barnes. But atm, his play looking like hell be a superstar m"

"What a fckn squad. FVV, GTJ, OG, Scottie Barnes, Precious  With Dragic and Siakam off the bench  They're going to be scary in the playoffs imo."
To be clear: Scottie Barnes is not Giannis.  But . . . Watch that play and tell me you’re sure it’s not Giannis in disguise.
Scottie Barnes will win a MVP one day
Along with Scottie Barnes yes  Fr tho Sengün is also a fantastic second draft choice from the rockets
"Scottie Barnes -13 and Jalen Suggs +7. Sorry Raps fans, but this debate is settled."
Scottie Barnes
"Turns out Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs are both good basketball players, who knew?"
"Game Notes   - Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.   - Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly   - Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.   - Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)   - Chris Boucher finally had a good game.   - Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.   - Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)"
“Magic Johnson and Scottie Barnes are black basketball players” - Magic Johnson

Are we going to say Scottie Barnes is overrated now LMAO
"why does scottie barnes get magic johnson, giannis, simmons comparisons when hes better than them?"
Scottie Barnes just sounds like a superstar name
Toronto Raptors doing a good job keeping Scottie Barnes down. Kid scores 19 pts in the first half and has 1FGA this quarter ffs. Starters turning into black holes just trying to get theirs.
Scottie Barnes &gt; Kevin Durant
"""has a chance to be top 5 when it's all said and done"" is a more delusional take than thinking scottie barnes has the potential to be giannis?  I'll die on that hill."
Scottie Barnes final dribble took place 5 ft behind the 3pt line.
"After the pre game festivities of Kyle Lowrys return to Toronto, we need to have a post game coronation of Scottie Barnes as the new king of the North. Seriously is impossible not to love this guy already"
SCOTTIE FUCKING BARNES
"Hey guys, haven’t watched the NBA in 4 years. Is Scottie Barnes the best player in the league?"
Scottie “no shot” barnes proving all these draft scouts wrong game by game lol
Scottie Barnes is the best player the Raptors have ever drafted
Holy Shit that was filthy.   #4 SCOTTIE BARNES
Scottie Barnes is a Toronto raptor
Just got out of a supermax Thai prison. Is Scottie Barnes the GOAT?
scottie barnes a menace tbh
THE TORONTO RAPTORS HAVE SCOTTIE BARNES
"Not ridiculous at all, Scottie Barnes is already basically Prime LeBron with an elite 3 point shot and better defense"
"The one thing about this guy, so far. Almost every basketball decision he makes on the court(not just passes), I tend to agree with. It's 70/30 at most even with elite players like Bron.. With him it's nearing 90/10. Crazy  You know how you're watching a play develop and you say something under your breath on what's about to happen... he does it and you're there thinking maybe you &amp; Scottie Barnes have a special connection.  Idk what to call that. Only in Lebron, Magic &amp; Bird have I seen this specific quality."
Scottie Barnes looks absolutely massive for some reason like beyond his height
Anyone want to call dibs on making the “Scottie Barnes/Jalen Suggs tonight” posts?
"&gt; I am pretty confident there is nobody in China with a body type and athleticism similar to say Scottie Barnes or Pascal Siakam to throw out randoms  Based on what?  I'm serious.  State any factual source that you're basing this on.  Literally, any single factual source.  Or... are you pretty confident based on literally nothing?"
Raptors fans posting every time Scottie Barnes wipes his nose
"That might be true, but the Toronto Raptors are one of the best drafters and developers in the league. I’m a lakers fan, and raptors got a gem in scottie barnes. I come in peace raptors fans, you guys have the best fanbase in the league. I’m a lakers fan and my posts on the raptors subreddit are my brother so ignore them"
"I think he'll still end up with a great chance at it, once Pascal is back it'll definitely impact Barnes' production. I hope Scottie stays aggressive but who knows."
Raptors. They drafted Scottie Barnes and he’s the next Magic Johnson /s
"Most of those guys became superstars before the advent of the foul-baiting that the NBA legislated out this offseason. If anything little guys are gonna get phased out because big guys are coming up way more well-rounded than they used to. Look at guys like my boii Scottie Barnes. Someone posted a video highlighting his playmaking from 8th grade. The question isn't how is Fred Van Vleet Junior Gunna score without fouls in 2040, it's why would we roster Fred Van Vleet Junior when lots of players are gonna have his skill set with 6 extra inches of height and 10 inches of reach?"
"Raptors - tougher opponents   Middleton   Celtics 3   Giannis   Harden   2022 first overall pick   Lamelo   Scottie (obviously I’m biased, but aside from the bias the injury risk is still scary with MPJ)   Harrison Barnes   Dorture chamber  Heat Bron"
"I mean he's already 27 and has declined significantly since he's played meaningful minutes on a playoff team. I'm rooting for him, but I think he'll be playing overseas next year now that we have Scottie Barnes."
I never realized how much influence raptors fans had over the doscourse/narrative on this sub until this entire scottie barnes thing. Holy fuck there are a ton of raps fans on this subreddit
How dare he disrespect future 5 time MVP Scottie Barnes like that!
Yeah and I’m Scottie Barnes
2015: Delon Wright with pick 20  2015: Norm Powell with pick 46  2016: Jakob Poetl with pick 9  2016: Siakam with pick 27  2016: FVV undrafted  2017: OG Anunoby with pick 23  2019: Terence Davis undrafted  2020: Malachi Flynn with pick 29  2021: Scottie Barnes with pick 4  2021: Dalano Banton with pick 46
I think Raptors fans are really leaning into this whole Scottie Barnes thing (or perhaps Anunoby).  Who do the Kings have though?
"Umm, that's not moving the goal posts. I mentioned Magic fans commenting first - which I've seen and provided examples above. Even your own fans call it out:   https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q1k8qj/highlight_jalen_suggs_with_a_good_sequence_of/hffnjy7/  And then pointed out how your ""victim narrative"" statement is bullshit by providing examples from other team flairs on r/NBA. Raptor fans didn't create this narrative, even the Media is running with Barnes vs Suggs since day one, it's the whole point of these comments from Scottie.   &gt;yall need help honestly.  yah you're right, we just made up this whole thing in our heads. Also none of these comments exist:  https://np.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/oujnlh/look_at_suggs_happiniess_when_toronto_pass_him/"
My brain says absolutely! My raptors heart says Scottie Barnes is the exception to this rule (only joking)
If raptors can't get a good return on him I'd honestky just keep him the rest of the season to help Scottie Barnes with his development.
"That is true, your rookie would be Former Florida State Forward, Scottie Barnes"
really? I've seen like a hundred Scottie Barnes posts and you're complaining about Jalen posts lmao
Why is this whole sub consciously obsessed with Scottie Barnes
Imma say Scottie Barnes just to see the Raptors fans reactions
2 games man after not being able to do any conditioning or anything till now. 2 games is not indicative of who he is lol. Shit Scottie Barnes has had 7 games and I'm still questioning if that's who he's gonna be or not.
Scottie barnes looking great right about now
who will win the josh giddey-scottie barnes karma war
"(Raptors) unbelievably excited! Scottie Barnes looks amazing, the rest of our team is getting it together... Rebounding the shit out of it and playing great d, average offense without potentially our best player.  Barnes Siakam Anounoby Trent Jr FVV  Should be good offensively, absolutely filthy defensively."
"I’m an overseas League Pass subscriber and enjoy watching the other teams’ broadcasts when they play the Raptors. The incredulous ness is the best - THE Boston win was particularly great. Scalabrine and Gorman were literally speechless at points when the Raps would do something. Scalabrine at one point just said “Wow. Scottie Barnes is a player, man.”"
"We have way overperformed. I was expecting a deeply flawed team that would occasionally show us flashes of promise to feel good about going forward. Instead we’ve got a team that has been a ton of fun to watch, players are exceeding expectations and Scottie Barnes is electric. We won’t be making any noise in the playoffs but I’m absolutely loving the team this year"
He’s the first player to be 6’9 AND Scottie Barnes.    I Would Have Voted Scottie Barnes For A Third ROTY Term If I Could
If Barnes ever becomes the best known Scottie in NBA history we'll know he's really good :-)
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
"This was a great move, especially against a premier defender like OG. I think it was the play before this where Cade also completely lost Barnes out on the perimeter and forced Scottie to grab his jersey for a foul. Really impressive play"
"“Michael Jordan or Scottie Barnes?”  Such a interesting question. Jordan was an Unstoppable scorer, the best player ever with 6 championships. However he was a unstoppable scorer that shot 50% from the field for his career. He took fade aways and didn't necessarily make his teammates better. Scottie Barnes on the other hand, he's more than unstoppable scorer. He's a player that makes everyone around him into unstoppable scorers. Barnes is a player that will probably shoot 60% for his career and make everyone around him shoot 50%+. We are already seeing the results, OG is the number one shooting guard for shooting percentage. The Raps already have a better Offense than the prime Warriors (with KD, Curry, Thompson and Draymond) while Scottie only plays 30 mpg. With Scottie Barnes you are pretty much guaranteed the best offense in the NBA for his entire career and Scottie could have a 20 year career when it's all said and done. Jordan just didn't make his teammates better, he had to wait until he got a superstar coach. Scottie doesn't have to wait, he just needs to be given the ball and given minutes. The rest will take care of itself. In all honesty this question is way too early. However after Scottie’s 3rd year, (when he averaged a triple-double, wins MVP, and takes the Raps to the Eastern Conference Finals,) I could see question even being taken seriously on r/NBA. For me I've always been fine with getting a bit ahead of myself and predicting the future even when it's not popular. I definitely wouldn't have said this after Scottie’s freshman season but after his rookie season seeing his historic improvement. I would take Scottie Barnes  over Jordan to start my franchise."
"I feel like ur underselling Scottie Barnes here. Giannis is a great player dont get me wrong, but he cant do 1/10th of the things scottie does. What we’re watching is someone on track to be the Goat and only the name of Jordan should be mentioned with Scottie Barnes"
"[6'7"" Scottie Barnes with 6'6"" Chris Duarte](https://i.redd.it/4vpwu4chz8w71.jpg)"
"Scottie Barnes has more potential than Giannis imo. The one thing about this guy, so far. Almost every basketball decision he makes on the court(not just passes), I tend to agree with. It's 70/30 at most even with elite players like Bron.. With him it's nearing 90/10. Crazy You know how you're watching a play develop and you say something under your breath on what's about to happen... he does it and you're there thinking maybe you &amp; Scottie have a special connection. Idk what to call that. Only in FVV, Malachi Flynn &amp; Bird have I seen this specific quality."
"The thing with Paul George is that he has a double first name. Just can't trust a guy with two first names. Paul GEORGE. George is a first name but is where his last name should be. Show me the advanced metric that shows that's a winning strategy. I have no problem with the name George. In fact I don't have a problem with the name Paul either. It's just that the combonation of both names into a Front Court Back Court duo just won't work.  Now ""Scottie Barnes"" that's a respectable name. One first name, one last name. Perfectly balanced. Trustworthy. If I had a daughter and she was dating Scottie Barnes I'd know for sure that there was no way Scottie Barnes would cheat on her. Scottie Barnes is what all men strive to be. It starts with his name and ends with his game. #WeTheNorth #ScottieBarnesROTY #ScottieBarnesMVP"
He forces Adam silver to put bronny on Cleveland he goes back teams up with Evan Mobley but gets swept by Scottie Barnes in the playoffs sad ending to the goats career but he should be proud about getting swept by Scottie is nothing to be ashamed of. Im a time traveller so what I say is fact.
I think the Toronto fans are fuxking happy they got Scottie Barnes
"Absolutely. There's a long way to go, so it's not impossible Scottie could catch him, but it's looking like Evan's to lose at this point.  I still believe that Cade and Green will be great, but it's crazy how good Mobley and Barnes have looked so far as rookies. Really unexpected."
"This is Morey’s fault for trying to make king ransom level deals in the summer.      Like no one in their right mind would trade FVV, OG, and Scottie Barnes for  Ben Simmons"
Love Scottie Barnes but Evan Mobley is definitely the front runner now. I don't think anyone could be upset about that fact either. We're witnessing greatness   This rookie class just keeps impressing me more and more each game
My redraft:  1) Evan Mobley 2) Scottie Barnes 3) Cade Cunningham 4) Chris Duarte 5) Jalen Green
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23. Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"Yeah there are a dozen posts for every good Bulls or Cavs win, and every Scottie Barnes or Evan Mobley  statline.  And while they’re all deserved, that same “let’s see if they can keep it up” argument applies."
As someone that has money on Mobley winning ROTY and has had to watch Scottie Barnes go off I need everyone to carry the Mobley ROTY storyline for the next half year.
"I hope we reward people who are actually playing well this year with good teams instead of just the usual picks. I think top 8 teams in the east all deserve at least one all-star this year so if I had to pick 1 all-star from each right now it would be:  Wizards - Beal  Nets - KD  Bulls - DeRozan  Cavs - Mobely  76ers - Embiid  Heat - Bam  Raptors - FVV  Knicks - Randle  Then that leaves 4 more spots. Harden and Lavine should be givens here. Then Giannis is the 3rd spot here.  That leaves 1 spot that is up for interpretation really and I think will be difficult to pick just one of them: Butler, Lowry, Lamelo Ball, Jaylen Brown, Trae (I don't think he deserves it but will be in the convo due to name), Garland/Sexton (depending on how that Cavs are looking in the standings near voting time), Scottie Barnes (depending on how raptors look in standings). I think media will give this one to Butler or Brown even though I'd like a new all-star here."
Scottie Barnes has entered the chat
scottie barnes?
"Raptors if it relates to Scottie Barnes, but I’m a lifelong rockets fan   Oh shit this ain’t r/nbacirclejerk"
"I would think about it if that magical trade also landed me Scottie Barnes, otherwise no"
"Idk. They might be a thing already. No one's playing like D'Antoni's pre-CP3 Rockets where EVERYTHING was a 3, a ft or at the rim. Last years Finals featured players who love the mid range. I think KD is leading the league in mid range jumpers and scoring.  Scottie Barnes is the leading ROY candidate and he shoots a lot of mid range Js. Derozen's playing great and winning doing same."
"You're not watching much raptors then dude. The whole thing is he isn't playing like a rookie at all. He's shooting above 50. Not forcing shots, hustling and making good passes and attacking the rim hard.  Nothing about Scottie Barnes looks like a rookie."
"Scottie Barnes great player but we don’t need to go trade for him at all, it would be just stupid for the warriors FO to do that. The warriors are 11-1 and I’d say they have some great trading piece asserts if necessary."
respect the hell out of scottie barnes but even when mobley was ice cold in scoring he made huge fucking plays on defense like every other game.
"Scottie Barnes has so much heart, it’s made this season so much better to watch knowing that there’s still more to come from this kid"
The disrespect to Scottie Barnes and Noble
Reminds me of 2018.  Good thing we have Scottie Barnes
 Scottie Barnes is gonna be so good
"What about Moody, Wiseman and a future 1st for Scottie Barnes + filler? Which team says no?  Even as I was spit-balling earlier, I figured both teams would say no and I just can't imagine Masai giving up Barnes without getting Kuminga + other prospects back. Barnes is the only player ready to impact winning and would improve the Warriors' championship odds imo  Just imagine a closing lineup of Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Scottie Barnes, and Draymond, with Poole, GP2, Iggy, Bjelica, Kuminga, Lee, Looney as bench support..."
I hope to receive amnesty as a long time (college) fan of Scottie Barnes. Praise be him.
Scottie Barnes is all I have to say.
Scottie Barnes is the greatest player of all time
Scottie barnes
You don’t trade Kuminga and wiseman for Scottie Barnes.
"The 2021 Toronto Raptors fanbase is on pace to be the worst fans of all time.  Please, tell me what Scottie Barnes had for breakfast."
"Was just about to add a comment about how happy I was to have Iguodala (share that fountain of youth bro) back in the Bay, but intelligent team players are so valuable and somehow not commonplace in the NBA. It's awesome to see everyone thriving in their roles, as you mentioned, and I love everyone in GSW's rotation now assuming that Klay can ramp up to being Klay by the playoffs  If Bob Myers could somehow turn Wiseman, one of either Kuminga or Moody, plus a future first round pick for Scottie Barnes and a salary filler backup big who can set screens and play defense, my twisted dark two-way basketball fantasy would be close to complete."
"Because it ignores context. You are literally reading a stat sheet 30 years after the fact and pointing at shooting percentages.      He was also leading the team in assists during the time and drawing a lot of defensive attention. He wasn't Harrison Barnes out there.      Also his defense matters because it is half the game. You replace Scottie with virtually anybody and the defense is significantly worse. The defense the Bulls played was a huge part of why they were so good, and you can easily point to Scottie being as responsible for that as Jordan if not more so. Again, offensively, Scottie played a massive role for the Bulls. Without him on the court, way more defensive focus for Jordan, and/or somebody who can't capitalize on the extra attention Jordan got by moving the ball.      If you watch those games back and don't think Pippen was a huge part of them winning championships, you need to stop talking about basketball, because that's nonsense."
"I had / have the Spurs, Rockets, and Magic worse than y’all.  Shai could be a top 10 player but Dort seems like a good but not great player (someone who shouldn’t make more than 10 million dollars).  I thought you messed up with Giddey (was higher on Kuminga, Mitchell, Williams, and Moody) but I should know better than to doubt an OKC draft pick after a few years.  I think I heard a rumor that you guys wanted Scottie Barnes in the draft."
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Jalen Green  4. Josh Giddey  5. Franz Wagner  6. Chris Duarte  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Davion Mitchell  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Alperen Sengun  11. Cam Thomas  12. Jeremiah Robinson Earl  13. Jared Butler  14. Sharife Cooper
"I’m going to sleep so I’m about done talking here.  &gt; Again you don’t understand. The logic is that many many many players are available if you are willing to pay the price. The Warriors FO didn’t even attempt to make a trade. All stars would love to play with Curry.  You don’t specifically have to use #2 on them. They were just examples of teams willing to literally give away quality players. They could’ve drafted #7 and #14 on behalf of them and then traded players this past draft. Again your FO didn’t even try.  You don’t understand our salary situation. Last offseason we had Wiseman and Wiggins as our ONLY tradable contracts not named the big 3. Last midseason we had minimum deals, Wanamaker(which we traded), Wiseman, and Oubre(who we took offers on but the only one that’s known is Dinwiddie on one knee). We’re talking about trading our young pieces not our minimum deals though, and even then a player making a minimum deal(which is all we could trade without giving up salary), is not going to be worth a lotto pick. All stars are not just any player, it’s nice that many players are available but many all stars aren’t. Last offseason vet minimums didn’t want to play with Curry because Klay was out, you think All-Stars wanted to come? And when is the last time you’ve seen an All-Star traded around the deadline? Boogie? That’s all I can remember and that’s because he was disgruntled for YEARS and the Kings sucked. There wasn’t a scenario like that last year.   &gt; You’re not even in the play in if Wiseman literally just sits on the bench, you didn’t even need to trade him. If he literally sat on the bench and the Warriors had the same squad they wouldn’t have been dealing any possibility of a play on game lol.   That’s just a bold faced lie. You’re placing the ENTIRE blame on Wiseman when we had Poole starting the season bad and Bazemore, Oubre and Wanamaker playing terrible. We’re still a play-in team without Wiseman and we’re actually probably the 9th seed.   &gt; Again it’s a savvy FOs job to surround a talent like Curry with win now players that put you in contention for a ring, they didn’t do that and they payed the price.  They surrounded him with Klay but he got hurt. That’s what lost them the year.Then FAs weren’t as interested in coming. Most likely if he doesn’t tear his Achilles we surround Curry with guys like Gasol and Batum.   If the Lakers find out Lebron tears his ACL you think the Lakers go All-in on winning the title around Davis? Are the Clippers going all in on PG13? They’re doing what they can with what they have because they aren’t a destination without their top 2 guy. And really it’s two of the top 3 because they hadn’t recovered from KD.  &gt; To get to hear 3-4 Wiseman you wasted 2021 and then Curry himself is 3-4 years older. These players aren’t covering the ground the Curry will leave behind  Does it look like this year is being wasted right now? No it doesn’t. If we are in trouble near the deadline then maybe that’s a different story but it doesn’t make sense to do a deal when right now we are winning. If we have a good shot at this title I’m gonna try and double-dip.   &gt; as at most they can reach all star level while Curry is generational literally right now.  You don’t know these player’s ceilings unless you are in a time machine. They’re ceilings are franchise faces the question is do they reach them. It’s like saying Scottie Barnes is at best a top 10 2 way player. You don’t know that he can be even better.  &gt; That’s a complete waste of his talent and disrespect for all that he’s done for the organization.   Are we losing right now? We are not. So how are we disrespecting? By not screwing up the entire future of the team going after 1 ring so he can retire on a perennial lotto team? It is perfectly respectful to look to keep the team competitive for the ENTIRETY of his career, not just 2-3 years of his prime.   &gt; A lot could’ve been done with #2, and a lot could’ve been done with Wiseman, Wiggins #7 and #14 but your FO didn’t even try.  Oh yes they did, every single sports outlet said they were trying. There wasn’t anything worth it or players (like Beal) just weren’t available.   &gt; There’s no chance in hell the Warriors odds at a ring INCREASE as Curry declines through age.  But the Warriors odds at leaving Curry the past 3 or so years of his career to be a Kobe like guy just chucking on a lotto team definitely are.   Superstars win rings not all stars, that’s why you go all in on Curry and not take gambles on “what ifs”.  We’ve gone All-in. We know All-in isn’t going to last but 4 years at best and because of Klay/Dray’s age probably less. If we are winning now and can get contributions from our young players now that’s enough. Because we are the best team and right now the deepest team in the West. We can grow those players into stars so we are always contending. A true dynasty. It’s worth the risk instead of risking this season hoping a trade acquisition fits and gambling the future of this franchise on 1 ring."
Just wait until Steph has to shoot over Scottie Barnes
Trade them all for the 4th pick and draft Scottie Barnes.
Lol probs the same quack who banned me for saying that Scottie Barnes basketball IQ is higher than Jaylen Brown. I may have been wrong but God damn dead sea levels of salt over there.
"Obviously its...  .  .  .  Scottie Barnes, who you'd think."
Scottie Barnes should be scared
"Nah there is like a couple best players none are better then each other really Either Curry or Giannis,Jokic,PG13, Scottie Barnes. thats it"
him and scottie barnes
"&gt;whether Scottie can sustain a 17 ppg/8.5rpg average but that's impressive company to be in this early into the season.  They're not really in the same company. Shaq averaged 24 and 16 with 3.3 blocks in his first 10 games.   Barnes is more in the company of Tom Gugliotta, who averaged 16 and 9 on 51% shooting."
"Old and busted. Let’s talk about something no one has brought up yet - Who is better, Evan Mobley or Scottie Barnes?"
Best: Scottie Barnes is our best player.  Worst: Scottie Barnes is our best player.

"Guess this Scottie Barnes dude is actually kinda good at basketball, huh?"
Sadly I cant have 14 Scottie Barnes clones on a roster
"I said Scottie Barnes for ROTY, my raptors brethren was behind me the whole time so therefore I love this!"
"&gt;Scottie Barnes is the real deal.  No kidding, the rookies are insane this year, same goes for Maxie, he went supernove tonight"
Does anyone have that clip of Scottie Barnes farting?
doesnt matter to me no more we got scottie barnes
First time seeing Scottie Barnes play. Hell of a baller.
gg Raps. Well coached team to fight that hard on a road b2b. Scottie Barnes is the real deal.
"Scottie Barnes the only guy who has almost as many offensive rebound as defensive rebounds half the time, if he was stat padding for defensive rebounds he would have 15 a night."
This is the Scottie Barnes of comments
"You no what I noticed about current raptors roster?  They just don't communicate like they used to with Lowry, Ibaka, Gasol. I'm looking at FVV just idle walking around on defense while Achiuwa isn't getting to his defensive assignment in snappy motions.  No matter how good our defense is or perceived to be. There needs to be a floor general constantly communicating assignments. I see Scottie Barnes already doing this, but there needs to be more.  On offense, someone should tell players to cut more."
Scottie Barnes looks like a bust tonight
"I'm so disgusted that Boucher &amp; Achiuwa are getting more touches than our top draft pick and leading scorer, Scottie Barnes. Too bad Khem Birch and Yuta are out, Nurse can't bench either of those selfish ""try to do too much"" players especially on a 2nd night of a b2b."
"Scottie Barnes.  Both are top notch talents, who could go on to become great, but I give the slight edge to Barnes."
"Not sure how he ranks, but I've been loving Scottie Barnes' game, little raw, but damn he's got talent."
"Scottie Barnes, obviously. And that’s coming from a Celtics fan who has wished death upon Raptors players in the past. Mobley can be great but Barnes can be a generational talent."
"Scottie Barnes, but I'm just a FSU homer. Hoping the Spurs get another one this year lol"
"I am fascinated that you are aware that KAT for Cade Cunningham + Stewart + picks and filler (maybe grant) is unlikely to happen but think that the Wolves can get Siakam and Scottie Barnes for KAT or John Collins, Reddish, Huerter + picks"
KAT for Scottie Barnes and Siakam.   Hahahahaha  No.
"another day, another scottie barnes post"
People keep saying this but for the love of God keep this stuff on the raptors site before everyone’s enjoyment of watching him turns to annoyance.   Scottie Barnes 1) In pointed assists.
"I really don’t see anything toxic or hostile about either of those comments. A little strange? I guess. But those commenters look like angels compared to you claiming we want other rookies to “burn in hell” or whatever.   And to be completely honest they have a point. This sub would be 1000x better and more conductive to discussion without flairs.  &gt;Especially since many barge into every rookie thread to shit on the rookie and praise Scottie Barnes, that shit’s actually pathetic  Yeah, except this doesn’t actually happen at anywhere near the frequency you’re pretending it does. Again, go on any Mobley thread (the one rookie who’s been better than Barnes) and look how many compliments there are from Raptors fans. We actually had a “would you rather have Barnes or Mobley” poll and the majority of people picked Mobley. I’ve seen a few Pistons fans be shitty to Green but that doesn’t mean they’re even close to the majority."

I’m a Canadian, I know Raps fans irl and i love them (even tho they biased af but o well) but on Reddit theyre by far the worst. Especially since many barge into every rookie thread to shit on the rookie and praise Scottie Barnes, that shit’s actually pathetic"
"I'm really impressed. Not with scottie barnes, but with how hard yall shill him."
Kanter for Scottie Barnes?
I need you to understand that Scottie Barnes is literally already Wilt Chamberlain
Scottie Barnes is a Toronto Raptors... fuck all of yall teams
This guy lost 720k because he didn't want to face scottie barnes back to back
Scottie Barnes bouta have his ROY season and carry the raptors to their 2nd ring just to make the whole Antetokounmpo family have rings
WE'RE GOING TO SUCK AND ITS OKAY BECAUSE THE SCOTTIE BARNES/OG ERA OF TERRORIZING THE NBA STARTS NOW
"How? He's driving away suitors with ransom like offers       Why would the Raptors trade FVV, OG, and Scottie Barnes for Ben?"
"Thanks for doing tiers, way better. I'll do it too.

I'd be cool trading anyone not named Scottie Barnes or OG
"If he ends up leaving, I'd love to see the Raptors give him an offer sheet. They need a big man and Ayton fits really nicely with their roster. He needs someone to develop him on offense and Nurse could be a great fit. Plus it restores the Raptors ""plus defenders throughout the rotation"" that they had for the Finals run. Most importantly, imagine trying to play against a team with FVV, OG, Barnes, Siakam, and Ayton. And if Scottie pans out, you can have lineups with him running the offense, that's an insanely switchable lineup."
"People are sleeping on the Raptors. They’re going to shut down opposing teams offences; they’re finally back in Toronto so the energy will be electric; and they play excellent team basketball. Scottie Barnes is honestly so much fun to watch…dude just brings that energy to the team. Pascal will be back soon, and OG taking a big step. Lowry’s gone but VanVleet is ready and a proven winner. I think the over/under on them was 35 wins. Easiest money ever betting on the over"

I never realized how much influence raptors fans had over the doscourse/narrative on this sub until this entire scottie barnes. Holy fuck there are a ton of raps fans on this subreddit
The Scottie Barnes adoration in this sub is getting out of hand /s
And Scottie Barnes ROTY
Who would have thought Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes are better scorers than Jalen Green lmao
This is what I'm talking about cmon. Scottie barnes is in no way shape or form a great shooter
"Yeah, if I was Suggs I would rather go to the Raptors with a freshly opens PG spot rather than Orlando who has 3 recent lottery pick PGs.  I definitely don't think he feels anything toward Scottie over it though lol, it would be pretty dumb if he did.  Especially since pre-draft it was pretty widely expected Suggs would go 4th to the Raptors and Barnes wasn't really on the radar for a top pick."
scottie barnes in the running for ROTY
"&gt; not act like your sub wasn't clowning Masai and the raptors on draft day  Yeah, this never happened.  [Here is our draft day thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/ou8vs1/nba_draft_thread_nba_draft_live_thread/?sort=confidence)  [Here is our post draft thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/oufdcg/post_game_thread_2021_nba_draft/)  The closest thing to ""clowning Masai"" is a couple of comments saying ""Thanks Toronto"" which frankly isn't even a shot at Toronto, it's a reference to Cole saying ""Thanks Denver"" about RJ. Everyone was just happy to get a prospect we thought would never drop. There are literally Raptors fans in those threads saying ""you are welcome for Suggs"".  Raptors fans have generated this entire ""war"" in your own little victim-complex world. Our sub literally does not care about the Toronto Raptors besides the fact your insecure fans constantly brigade our sub, and shit on our franchise at every opportunity on r/nba. No-one cares about Scottie Barnes beyond him being a Seminole.  It is quite literally only Raptors fans, and legions of them. I've seen maybe two Magic fans in total over the last 3 months do the things your fanbase does regularly. Frankly I wish I could just block everyone with a Raptors flair, but since you have Raptors fans who use other team flairs to try and seem more credible that wouldn't even work."
Scottie Barnes DPOY!
