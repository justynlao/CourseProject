I think Jalen Suggs will be a superstar. Kid has amazing vision a great handle and showed he can hit big time shots. Also I think KD if no other injury could still be an all star but yeah good list
Jalen Suggs
"I’ve written a long post about this before (but now I can’t find it, of course) but the only comparable TV markets to MSP without a current NBA team are Seattle and Tampa. Seattle seems all but assured of an expansion team soon, which leaves Tampa as the only market similar to MSP.   But it’s also important to note that Tampa’s less than 100 miles from Orlando and less than 300 miles from Miami, which means it’ll be battling with 2 more established teams (one of which is quite popular) for fans/eyeballs. Now, it’s totally possible for a team to be moved to a smaller market (Seattle to OKC made that abundantly clear), but I don’t think ARod and Lore have any sort of special connections to other possible markets (like Kansas City or St. Louis). And if we’re talking about an idealized version of the team, I have a hard time seeing the Wolves being situated elsewhere.   Too, I think the league is interested in having basketball in Minnesota to ensure it keeps a footprint in middle America (the closest team to the Wolves is Milwaukee which is over 300 miles away, and it’s even further for states like Nebraska or the Dakotas). Obviously those aren’t exactly the biggest markets, but you can argue you’d lose a potential foothold in that portion of the country if the Wolves leave. Especially since youth basketball in Minnesota seems to be growing (4 Minnesota-born players were drafted in the 2020 draft, Jalen Suggs is going top 5 this year, Chet Holmgren could go #1 next year, and Paige Bueckers is a once-in-a-decade type of player). Now, that doesn’t stop ownership from moving the team, but the league may throw up a few more roadblocks or make the process thornier if they think it won’t benefit the league as a whole.    The final component is money itself. ARod and Lore aren’t exactly rich by NBA owner standards (they’re effectively paying for the team in installments because they can’t afford it up front). They’re already forking over a ton of money for the Wolves. Continuing to strain their pocketbooks by breaking the Target Center lease, paying a relocation fee, covering the logistics of moving the team, and potentially having to invest in a new arena in their target destination adds another hurdle to the moving process (like, would they really throw away hundreds of millions of dollars for something they’re not sure will increase long-term profits?). It could still happen, of course, but it’s one additional element decreasing the likelihood."

Found Jalen Suggs account
"I heard this floated on the DTD pod and I'd like it AFTER the draft lottery.  If the Thunder get a top 5 pick and and land Cade or Jalen Suggs they won't have space in the backcourt for: the pick, Theo, SGA and Dort - all of whom should play over Kemba.    If they get Evan Mobley instead, I could see it."
"Cade or Jalen Suggs with KPJ,Tate and Wood is a damn good young core. I’m rooting for y’all"
"Well as long as we're fantasizing, I'll take one Jalen Suggs, please and thank you. &lt;3"
Its crazy to think if we had LP then we are sitting here with a record so bad Hawks fans are watching film of top 8 prospects while talking up how awesome it would be to have Jalen Suggs coming off the bench behind Trae.
You know the potential No. 1 pick (Jalen Suggs) and the No. 1 overall recruit this season both come from Minneapolis? There are extremely talented players all around the county. Not just in a few major markets
"MN churns out fantastic basketball players - most recently Jalen Suggs, Paige Bueckers, and Chet Holmgren.   We love basketball here."
"I’m assuming you’re just a kid, you don’t know what the target center used to be like with KG. Also, even though Minnesota isn’t good for the NBA (according to you) out of last years draft 4 of the first 41 players selected were from Minnesota, the women’s NCAA player of the year is from Minnesota, Jalen Suggs is from Minnesota, and the number one ranked prep athlete and recent Gonzaga commit Chet Holmgren is from Minnesota. All this with a shitty local franchise. Minnesota is dying to have a competent owner, the fans will follow."
"His little brother plays at Minnehaha Academy where Jalen Suggs and Chet Holmgren played, and he seems pretty legit."
I’m taking Jalen green or Jalen Suggs any day over grant. No way we pass on that potential if we get a top 4 pick.

"I personally think Suggs is going to translate to the best NBA ready player . He’s got intangible things you can’t  teach , he makes the guys around him better when he’s on the court . Top 5 for me goes Cade , Suggs , Mobley , Kuminga , Green with Jalen Johnson or Moody Moses being the 6th"
"If Luka played for Portland and Dame played for the Mavs, Portland would be the 1 seed and the Mavs would he in the lottery.    At least they could get a good PG, like Jalen Suggs"
"They already have Wiseman.  Honestly, the Warriors did the righ thing tanking in 2019-2020 and trading D'Lo for Wiggins and the T'Wolves draft pick. They will likely get another highnpick in this deep 2021 draft class.  A Jalen Suggs or Jalen Green or Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes."
"Prepare yourselves for year 2, when he inevitably has a few bad games and people start posting the ""Is Jalen Suggs better than LaMelo Ball?"" threads."
"Steph, Klay, Dray, JTA, Looney, Wiggins, Wiseman, Poole.  If we get Jalen Green before the expansion (Or Suggs), then I'm moving off JTA for him. I'd assume an expansion team wouldn't take him and he's the safest choice, but I'd of course keep him."
As soon as you get Jalen Suggs and the following year Chet Holmgren!
I hope the Raptors get Jalen Suggs.

"Cade would be the dream, but realistically I want Jalen Suggs or Green. We also have the bulls pick, which is top three protected. We have to go best player available with that one. Other than that I want some veteran forward depth, some shooting, and JI and Kelle to be fully recovered and ready for next season. Hopefully we can be competitive next year, but we need much better injury luck."
That buzzbeater Jalen Suggs hit was posted here and I bet no one was complaining.
Jalen Suggs Lavine Pat Will Markannen  Vuc  make it happen
Depends on who we draft in the top 5. If we get cade suggs Mobley or kuminga I would love to pair moody or bouknight with them. With jalen green pairing scottie barnes with him would be cool or maybe a shooter like krispert.
"I wouldn't say Marcus Smart making All Defense is that outlandish.  I'm gonna go off the rails and list my hot prediction takes for next season.  - 50% chance Westbrook will get traded in a blockbuster at the deadline for a 3P shooter if they're struggling during the regular season.  - The other 50% chance being the Lakers get eliminated in quarter finals again due to a combination of injuries, LeBron getting older and their lack of shooters if Westbrook doesn't get traded.  - The Bulls will make a convincing playoff run and be on the verge of eliminating a contender team in the semis, only to be reverse eliminated due to a heart breaking injury to one of DeRozan or Lavine at the worst timing possible.  - SGA will make All NBA third team.  - Kuzma will change his reputation and breakout as Washington's no 1 option. However, Washington doesn't make the playoffs.  - Klay Thompson will suffer another debilitating injury when he comes back, this time will be career threatening.  - Isaiah Thomas will be signed to a 10 day contract late in the season from a team decimated by injuries and proceed to still do nothing noteworthy.  - Jalen Suggs will emerge as the ROTY. Cade will have played better, but is ineligible due to injuries keeping him out of too many games.  - A package surrounding Ben Simmons will be eventually traded for CJ McCollum midway through the season, despite both front offices vehemently denying they're shopping either of them the entire time up to the trade.  - Donovan Mitchell will request a trade by the end of the season if the Jazz don't make it to the WCF at minimum."
I know it's Bleacher Report and I should probably just  ignore it but these are surprisingly not garbage takes especially for a causal watcher looking for players to root for... Except why in the fuck is Jalen Suggs on here? He's never played an NBA game before to back up that he's a different player then what people rate him as and no one's really been at all negative about him anyway
"I don't think anyone is sleeping on the Hornets, but I think they'll be as good as the 6th seed, floor is 9th. Graham being gone might actually help them not have a log jam at guard, but I looked him on this team.  I think the Rockets and Pacers are good sleepers.  I really like the players the Rockets have like Christian Wood, John Wall, Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr among others, and their head coach.  I don't like how the roster had played over the last few seasons for the Pacers, but Rick Carlisle is a big reason why I think they could surprise people.   I want to say the Magic so bad, but Jonathan Isaac will be out a lot of the season, but Fultz is coming back with Cole and Suggs. They still have Ross and MCW off the bench too, but I know nothing about Jamahl Mosley"
"So Nike got Cade Cunningham, Jonathan Kuminga, and now Scottie Barnes. Adidas got Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley already.  That just leaves Josh Giddey as the only sneaker deal-less of the Top 7"
You could have a deep team if you chose Jalen   - Jalen Rose - Jalen Green - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Johnson - Jalen Suggs - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith  Funnily enough a lot of them are really young
"Masai deserves whatever he's getting but Michael Grange is literally fake news lol. His ""sources told him"" Raptors were going to draft Jalen Suggs."
"He wrote an article days before the draft stating, ""the Raptors have zeroed in on Gonzaga’s six-foot-five two-way guard Jalen Suggs as their preferred choice."
Can Jalen Suggs reach DJ Augustin level?
"Teams do overthink things, y’all just passed on Jalen Suggs lol and I like Scottie Barnes"
Jalen Suggs
"The obvious 2 superstar candidates are Cade and Jalen Green. Suggs would be my other guy becoming a star in the league.   Barnes and Kuminga are both developmental guys, so depending on how their development goes they can be rotation guys or lower level stars"
"its thoughtless, but I understand why someone would ask the question. people do the ""assuming Len got to play, he'd have _______"" all the time. i think Clarke would have gone ahead of Bouknight, for example, in all likelihood. not sure if he would have entered the Suggs or Jalen Green tiers. it's a bit insensitive but common enough hypothetical conversation."
Jalen Suggs is gonna get us out of it. I'm convinced until he plays an actual game
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jonathan Kuminga 5. Jalen Suggs 6. James Bouknight 7. Jalen Johnson 8. Alperen Sengun 9. Scottie Barnes 10. Davion Mitchell 11. Trey Murphy 12. Chris Duarte 13. Moses Moody 14. Josh Giddey
"I agree…  I think it’s clear that Cade, Suggs, Mobley are going to be a bit more of a soft-spoken guys. So Jalen is going to the the “personality” of the class"
"I really couldn’t care less about Cade, Mobley or Green I’m most excited to watch Bones (hopefully he gets pt) and Jalen Suggs  A couple guys from the 2020 draft are Tre Jones and Jaden McDaniels"
"Besides Garuba, Jalen Green and Sengun?  Cade, Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Kuminga, Mobley"
"I would go:  1) Cade Cunningham  2) Jalen Green  3) Jalen Suggs  4) Evan Mobley  5) Jonathan Kuminga   6) Scottie Barnes  7) Josh Giddey (don’t think it’s fair to drop him since he pretty much hasn’t played)  Also, Scottie Barnes being two spots lower than where he was drafted isn’t meant to be a diss or anything. I still think he’s gonna be a great player and 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable to me, plus that’s where I had him before the draft anyway. I also think Cade or Jalen Green going #1 would be fine"
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley 4. Scottie Barnes 5. Jalen Suggs 6. Josh Giddey 7. Johnathan Kuminga 8. Franz Wagner
"If the Raptors are really able to get Simmons for just FVV and OG then I think it's a *plausible* (not great, *plausible*) trade.  For all of Ben's flaws, he provides two things for the 76ers in passing and great defense. It's hard to get a single player back that does both of those things in one package. FVV and OG replace both of those things.   Ben to CJ is talked about a lot but while CJ replaces the passing portion, the 76ers will have a giant hole at the 3 that needs to be replaced if he's gone and CJ isn't good enough to make up for that. Dame might be though.   I doubt that trade would happen though nowadays because I thought that a predecessor to that happening was drafting Jalen Suggs to replace FVV. But who knows, maybe the Raptors would have enough faith in Simmons + Scottie Barnes as a ball-handler to still go through with it?"
coming from a raptors fan whose fanbase was pushing to draft jalen suggs for weeks…
Jalen Suggs ;)
"I hope more than 15 of them become NBA mainstays just so I could field a team of Jalens on 2k.   A starting five of Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Brown, Jalen Johnson and Jalen McDaniels is easily a playoff contender, albeit a little backcourt-heavy.   Right now tho the bench seems pretty thin with Jalen Brunson as the only sure thing."
"Best all Jalen roster? Suggs, Green, Brown, Johnson, Smith would be pretty damn good, especially in 5 years."
Jalen Suggs is the player the Magic needed deeply. House hold name who is a bona-fide leader. Magic haven't had a leader since like Penny. Dwight was amazing but idk if he was that.
"There’s a Jaylen Adam’s on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors. Jalen Crutcher, Jalen Green, Jaylen Hands, Jaylen Hoard, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Lecque, Jaylen Nowell, Jalen Smith, Jaleen smith (not a typo), Jalen Suggs, Jalen Tate. That’s just in the summer league. In the nba, there is also Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson."

"Jalen Suggs ROY, Jonathan Isaac all defense"
Raptors fans be like gaurunteed better than Jalen Suggs
"**MVP**: **Kevin Durant**. Best player on the best team, now with chemistry. I think he will eclipse his GSW stats considerably because Brooklyn isn't afraid to play iso. Don't buy the stars cancel out theory. Steph up there as well.  **DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo.** I think Gobert (unfairly)  will get docked for being somewhat exposed on the perimeter. I don't think anyone else will genuinely be in the running. I think Jonathan Isaac will be a conversation, but no chance of winning.  **6MOY: Dennis Schroder**, I think Payton Pritchard will start at PG.  **ROTY: Jalen Green**, with Suggs close behind. Cade will get Dwane Casey'd for at least first half of the season.  **MIP: Jonathan Isaac**. Maybe a homer pick, but could be Orlando's leading scorer. He has a lot of offensive game he hasn't really unleashed because he plays like a pastor, and was starting to turn around his mentality before the injury.  **COTY: Billy Donovan**, I think the Bulls are being underrated because none of the names are splashy individually, but when you break it down each player is going into the best fit of his career offensively. Billy Donovan has historically gotten good team defences out of bad individual defenders. IMO they will be a top 3 seed in the East, behind the Bucks and Nets.  **Exec of the Year: Arturas Karnisovas** - see above.  **Champions: Nets (KD)** - Talent."
"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."
Scottie Barnes &gt;&gt;&gt; Jalen Suggs?
"Jalen Suggs will win roy by a mile, and come out as the only generational talent of the 2021 draft. Bucks will sweep nets in east finals. steph curry will win 3rd mvp + final mvp. Game 6 klay will send Lakers to Cancun in western conf finals."
Jalen Suggs has a better rookie season than Scottie Barnes.  r/torontoraptors is very understanding and handles it all quite well.
* Anthony Edwards - Dion Waiters/Oladipo  * Jalen Suggs - Rose/Rod Strickland  * Cade - 00’s Paul Pierce/Duke’s Grant Hill  * De’Aaron - Evil Brandon Knight  * Ja - Whatever Mudiay should have been?
Jalen Suggs is a rookie all star!
Jalen Suggs will win ROTY
"Favorite Summer League rook not on your team? Loved watching Davion, Duarte, Shareef, Jalen Johnson and Suggs last week.   There's like 40 dudes balling out at NBASL this year. Draft class is legit!"
Jalen Suggs should also learn to tone it down for summer league. He can give 80% effort only instead of being way too aggressive for these meaningless games.
"Lots of highlights tbh. That's why people are raving about this class. Jalen Green, Suggs, Barnes, Kuminga, Mobley etc.. gets highlights almost every game"
he’s dope but man Jalen Green and Suggs are ballers too. this whole draft was stacked.
The Jalen Suggs era is over in Orlando. Fun ride while it lasted.
"Jalen Suggs and a combination of Jesus, MJ, and Bron"
No lie Jalen Suggs is the best one out there then Green then Cade
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De’aron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I’m pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos
1. Jalen Suggs will have the best career of this years draft class  2. The Lakers will not get past the first round  3. Giannis does not win another title  4. CP3 is replaced by Cam Payne as starter halfway through the season and the contract sends the Suns back into NBA purgatory   5. Paul George wins his first NBA MVP this year
"Barnes isn't a great shooter but he's not nearly as bad as advertised. His passing and rebounding, however, FAR exceed expectations.  Kuminga is raw but not nearly as raw as advertised.  Jalen Green is a monster.  As much as I hate to admit it, Suggs over Barnes was proooobably the right pick."
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher’s defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade’s poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He’s good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can’t create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it’s over. He won’t get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
Uhh Jalen Suggs tho
"Jalen Green has taken/averages fewer shots than Mobley, Suggs, Cunningham and a number of other rookies. In fact he doesn't even take the most shots on his own team.  For a player touted to be little more than the best scoring prospect, he's been surprisingly the most all around player so far."
He’s injury prone but Orlando can’t give up on a player with Isaac’s defensive potential so early. Do you really want to take the ball out of Jalen Suggs hands to give it to Dame?
"""Mom, I gave Jalen Suggs a tech! He was the 4th pick in the draft!!"""
"You think James Wiseman would be drafted ahead of Jalen Suggs? I was low on Wiseman pre draft. He doesn’t have good defensive awareness and doesn’t move well in short spaces. He’s supposed to be a great defensive prospect, but he has a bunch of deficiencies. He doesn’t have good hands and I don’t see how he contributes to a good offense."
Jalen Suggs will be in the running for ROTY as well imo.
It’ll be between him and jalen Suggs IMO
"Redraft goes Jalen Green 1, Suggs 2 imo"
"Cade is so smooth wtf. This draft might be '03 levels if all goes well w/Cade, Jalen, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, and all the other guys like Davion, Sengun, Bouknight, etc. I'm totally cool w/optimistically overreacting to these young guys lol"
"It's weird aspect of new draftees, they get asked the same questions over and over again. I watched pretty much every Jalen Suggs interview post-college, and he got the same questions 90% of the time, and he answered them the same way, basically word for word."
"Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Anthony Edwards, and Jalen Suggs would be fun to watch. All Athletic, Strong, and Dynamic!"
jalen suggs is gonna be great tv this year
"By that logic, the Raptors ”missed out” on everyone below them in the draft. Jalen Suggs will be a solid player, and as a Raptors fan I was getting hyped for him, but clearly the organization sees more than us.   For the rest of their careers the two players will be compared against each other because of the Raptors decision in the draft, but until we see how they do in real NBA games, over an extended period of time, you cant say they missed out. Surprisingly often, the best player in a draft class is not the highest pick(Kawhi, Giannis), which is why scouting is so important. Perhaps Orlando missed out on Scottie Barnes…"
"If Jalen Suggs didn’t fall to the Magic, I would’ve picked them"
Jalen Suggs is exciting. I know Magic fans are hyped.
Tbh I have no problem with any of that. It’s the statements like “they screwed up” because a biased zags fan thinks so that makes me laugh and engage with it.  I just think you should cut the toronto connection to jalen out of your gushes about him. He’s on Orlando now and that could easily start becoming a negative narrative for him (a la: “guess the raps saw this coming”). The Magic aren’t exactly known for winning and making much out of players.   Toronto fans are rolling their eyes at it and Suggs fans would look better just letting it go.
"I liked how, unlike Kyle Lowry, Jalen Suggs stopped this play with actual defense instead of yanking the offensive player’s arm down as hard as he could when the player was going up for the finish at the rim.   Just one subtle difference from Kyle Lowry that I enjoyed seeing."
"Yeah, there's absolutely no way to tell how he'll do against NBA level athletes and ball handlers, like a Jalen Suggs or Cade Cunningham.   You do make a great point though that the NBA subreddit shouldn't be allowed to compare player's abilities in any facets of the game until they're playing in the NBA. That's when we all really know exactly how good every player is at each part of the game, and we should save our invaluable message board posts for then."
Jalen Suggs
"Jalen Suggs and Jay Scrubb, some very unique names."
"Although I am a Detroit Native, I really enjoyed seeing Jalen Green and Suggs play. Green vs Cade might actually be a great watch tomorrow night as well. I think Cade and Mobley will be a threat in the future tho. The Cavs and Pistons might be finally building towards a great future. I wish Detroit would've drafted Green tho"
Jalen motha fuckin Suggs
Jalen Suggs city edition jersey on its way as soon as I can buy it
Mr Jalen Suggs is the next ROTY. Thanks to the Tampa bay raptors for letting him fall to Orlando
Jalen Suggs was a beast.
Jalen Suggs
Jalen Suggs is gonna be a problem
"Obligatory Pistons, Rockets, Raptors, Cleveland screwed up Jalen Suggs is the next MJ confirmed."
"Friendship ended with Darrell Armstrong, Penny Hardaway, Jameer Nelson, Rafer Alston, Elfrid Payton lol, DJ Augustin, Markelle Fultz and the black hole Cole Anthony.  New best friend is Jalen Suggs"
Jalen Suggs
"Fuck those fans, Jalen Suggs looks good."
Surprised I haven't seen Jalen Suggs suggested. He's decently polished and will be stepping into a big role on the Magic right away.
"I think people really underrated Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs because they were next to Cade and Mobley. Even though both were top 5 picks in comparison to Cade and Mobley they were placed into the ""just categories"":  ""Oh just a scorer.""   ""Oh just a defender.""   ""Oh just a \_\_\_\_.""     Nah, they're ""Just stars."" if you ask me. The same with Scottie Barnes, I thought that guy played great during FIBA but he was placed outside the main 4 and was being overlooked."
Raptors fans trying to convince themselves he's 6-9 because they passed on Jalen Suggs lol
"I dont think there was ever a real risk of them relocating in the near future.  Declining revenue league-wide due to COVID and the subsequent recession has increased the likelihood of league expansion. It's been a talking point all year, one discussed even by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. The substantial ( &gt; $2.5 billion) expansion fee being discussed would provide an avenue for the league to recoup a considerable amount of their losses due to the pandemic.  Minneapolis is a moderately large media market. By my count, there are 14 NBA teams that have a smaller media markets than the Timberwolves, including the Heat, Nuggets, Bucks, and Blazers. Seattle is also a big media market, and one that has shown a desire for an NBA team. But, you move the Timberwolves from Minneapolis to Seattle, and suddenly Minneapolis is the largest media market in America without an NBA team. It just doesn’t seem like it would be in the league’s financial interests to move them. Right now, even though the team sucks, the infrastructure in place for an NBA team. Minnesota is a big sports state. Minneapolis *loves* basketball (just look at the Garnett years, 2017/18 with Butler, even the buzz after the DLo acquisition, the hype around Ant, the amount of love the city/state has for local players like Jalen Suggs and Paige Bueckers, I could go on). Give them a reason to watch, and they’ll be ravenous."
"Thought Jalen Suggs was well above Scottie, just due to IQ and potential. Not the case, raptors might have gotten the steal of the draft"
I shut down jalen Suggs in a summer tournament one time. I’m four years older but I can still say I did it lol
Look I already anointed Jalen Suggs the next Chauncey Billups.  I can't take that back.
Any time Jalen Suggs has a good game it’ll be because he was a QB in high school
"Anybody that thinks otherwise is ridiculous. This was on short/no practice, with 3 key players who played a Finals game the week before, some players who had the join on short notice and some potential players missing such as Curry, Kyrie, Harden, Lebron, Kawhi and AD. Team any of them up with KD and it would have been an ultimate joke.  2024 will have a prime Tatum, Booker and Lavine.  This year's rookie class (Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Scotie Barnes and Evan Mobley) were blowing teams out by nearly \~100 points the last few years. They showed some incredible chemistry reminiscent of what the original Dream team looked like vs the competition and played lockdown defense. That 2028 team is potentially going to be special imo especially when you combine them with vets from the 2024 games which I'm thinking will potentially be Lamelo, Ant, Ayton, etc.  Remember, these NBA players are the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the 1% of the world's best basketball players and Team USA is the best of the best of that."

Jalen Suggs
And this is why Jalen Suggs chose Basketball over football
So you dont think Jalen Suggs learned more by going to a championship game and playing meaningful basketball rather than playing against guys who arent good enough for the nba or europe while 300 fans watch?  Thats pretty interesting man!

Marvin Bagley finds his niche as a role player on a good team.  Jalen Suggs makes an all-star team.  Kenny Smith takes a GM job and fails at it.  Knicks make the Eastern Conference finals  OKC doesn’t get much out of their picks.  A major PED scandal in another sport occurs and some NBA stars are implicated.  Chris Paul retires and becomes the lead analyst on ESPN.  The debate is still occurring on who will be the next LeBron.  Nuggets win a championship  A superstar not named Kawhi or Kylie retires before the age of 32.  Kings still haven’t made the playoffs  Orlando rebuilds into a solid team.  Draymond and Kerr both retire at the same time and join the TNT studio show.  Cam Payne makes the finals again on a different team.  Luka hasn’t made the finals  Heat don’t get past the 2nd round  James Harden starts having AD like continuous nagging injuries.  Grizzlies make a playoff run.  Two teams tie for the 10 seed and the clearly better team loses out on the tiebreaker.  LeBron embraces the gray beard.  A streaker runs onto the court in next years NBA finals and KD body slams him injuring him. ESPN debates whether KD was too violent.  Jason Kidd fails as Mavs coach and the Mavs then hire Bill Self and make him the highest paid coach.  Cavs trade the wrong half of Sexland who takes a leap on his new team.  Spurs are mired in mediocrity.  76ers trade Simmons and win a championship
"dream scenario is houston take jalen suggs, cleveland take mobley and jalen green falls to us"
THere's a chance  https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2021/07/16/report-rockets-leaning-jalen-green-with-no-2-pick-some-prefer-jalen-suggs/
&gt; Suggs is just a 6'4 Davion Mitchell 🤦  Nobody said that but you.   You aren't drafting a PG who has concerns with ball handling and shooting over Jalen Green or even Mobley.
"&gt;But the selection at no. 2 will cause ripple effects throughout the draft. Will the Rockets’ choice be Jalen Green, a 6-foot-5 scorer who played in the G League? Evan Mobley, a versatile big man out of USC? Jalen Suggs, a floor general from Gonzaga? Or will they trade down?  &gt;League sources say the Rockets prefer Green. Selecting him would make perfect sense: Not only is scoring a premium skill, he’s also flashed playmaking ability. Green is raw, but the Rockets have a young team that doesn’t need to worry about contending anytime soon. He’s a hard worker, and at just 19 years old, he’s only starting to tap into his full potential as an elite athlete with shot-creation skills. It would not be a shocker if he ends up as this draft’s best player.  &gt;Though Mobley and Suggs remain in consideration, teams are planning for scenarios in which Houston will pick Green.   https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/16/22579643/nba-draft-houston-rockets-cade-cunningham-jalen-green-evan-mobley"
"Damn, I thought they was drafting Jalen Suggs instead. Im glad this was posted phew"
I would actually probably prefer that package to a Ben Simmons package IMO. Fred and Bobby are both quality starters and the #4 pick is probably Jalen Suggs.
"Luka, Cade/Jalen Suggs/Jalen Green, Wenbanyama, Chet, Tatum/Brown"

and now you get the privilege of Jalen Suggs on a rookie contract!
"He's about to get a massive pay raise and there is a questionable fit on the team he is currently on. They are also in position where they probably draft someone positionally similar.  It's pretty straightforward.   If the Cavs aren't willing to pay him a large amount of money they should move Sexton.  If they decide Garland is the guy they want going forward they should move Sexton.  If Jalen Green/Suggs is their pick and they view him as redundant with Garland/Sexton then they should move Sexton.  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with it, but that's why."

"Just 1 year ago our core of Lowry,Siakam,FVV,OG,Norm,Gasol and Ibaka finished 53-19 and the 2nd best record in the league  Since then we lost Norm,Gasol,Ibaka and most likely Lowry but we added Gary Trent Jr,Jalen Suggs,Boucher and we have about 20 million in cap space to potentially pursue Holmes or Allen and OG and Freddie both improved since 2019-2020 . Im not saying we will be the 2nd seed again but to think our ceiling is 7th is delusional"
Also a lot of Jalen/Jaylen’s:  Jalen Green (2021 draft)  Jaylen Brown  Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Johnson (2021 draft)  Jalen Lecque  Jalen Smith  Jalen Suggs (2021 draft)
im automatically gonna assume this means were drating jalen suggs
The amount of Jalen is actually unsettling:  - Jalen Suggs - Jalen Green - Jalen Duren - Jalen Harris - Jalen Lewis - Jalen Adams - Jalen Brunson - Jalen Lecque - Jalen McDaniels - Jalen Smith - Jalen Wilson - Jalen Pickett
No. Lonzo was supposed to be an All Star. While Jalen Suggs is predicted to be a solid starter
Why would we take Suggs? Or are you somehow expecting Jalen Green to fall to you guys?
"I would agree back when the MN pick still had the potential to be someone like Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs, but now I feel like that would definitely be worth it for GS"
&gt; Everyone else has a big question mark  Neither Mobley nor Suggs really have big question marks.  Mobley in particular has just as high of a ceiling as Cade IMO.  Jalen Green is the only real wildcard in the top 4.
"Yea i agree, in the playoffs cade gets dominated by 12 seeds and chokes in the second round while Jalen Suggs blows out most teams and is hitting halfcourt buzzer beaters in Final 4’s"
Jalen Suggs who is around 6’4 and is the perfect Lowry replacement. Also Toronto loves two point guard lineups so the fit is great. Many stretches against gsw where fvv and Lowry were ran together along with pretty much all of last season. Yes we were undersized but were stil incredibly successful
Suggs or Jalen?
"Don’t pay attention to lazy scouting that likes to lump everyone together. Imo there’s 4 tiers within the top 5 alone, with cade being comfortably in his own.   Just look at the size and think of how the league works now. It revolves around the scoring PG or the elite 6’7+ wing. Cade can be both. Meanwhile, Suggs is neither. (Nope, not in the mold of the modern scoring guard), Mobley is neither, Jalen green is neither. And I like Jalen green but chances are you’re only gonna have but so much impact as a good SG."
I’d try and package 7 and 14 to try and move up to #3 to take Jalen Suggs I think the Warriors need to start planning for life after Steph and he can be a great teacher for him and you can run some lineups with both of them and Jalen and Klay. Or even start both of Steph and Jalen in the backcourt eventually.
Raptors how? Is Jalen Suggs going to be that good lol
"Depends on the direction they want to go. If they’re trying to contend now then probably not but if they want to rebuild then they should do it. Siakam is 27, he doesn’t really match up with a rebuilding team. I think a rebuilding team surrounded by Gary Trent jr, OG Anunoby, Jalen Suggs??(4th pick), Wiseman, Bouknight?? (7th pick), Giddey?? (14th pick), and Malachi Flynn is actually pretty formidable. Obviously I don’t know how the picks will turn out but that has potential to be a scary team in the future"
"This might be the wildest take I've ever made, but rokas jokubaitis from zalgiris kaunas should be a top 15 pick this draft class, IMO he is even a better player right now than jalen suggs (honestly though I don't really understand what people see in him)."

Without looking at stats my guess is Jalen Suggs
Yes correct Philly and Boston just bet on the wrong guys but in theory you are correct. As for the Nets I think if they salary dumped Harris and don’t bring back Dimwinie they still win the chip next year and would put them under the tax.   Same for the warriors if they would consolidate Wiseman + 7 + 14 and grab like Jalen Green and Suggs they could win the chip and cut their tax bill a lot.   The gist of what I’m saying is if you have 3 real stars playoff rotation players 4-7 just need to be replacement level. Like I don’t need to pay Joe Harris 18m I can swap him with Shamet and get 50% of the returns for a fraction of cost.

"Suggs: Look at me, I am the Jalen now"
"I think you guys take Jalen Green at 2 because he’s more NBA ready than Suggs. That being said if you guys take Suggs, I wouldn’t be surprised if we went with Jalen Green at 3 instead of Mobley."
Perhaps the most trash mock I've seen so far.  Suggs @ 2 to HOU   Jalen Green @ 4 to TOR   Giddey @ 7 to GSW
"Jalen Suggs, if this is how the first 3 picks shake out."
Probably because Houston is picking one of Jalen Green/Evan Mobley. Suggs plays good defense and does a little bit of everything. Personally I think he has the 2nd highest floor behind Cade.
The Raptors select Jalen Suggs fourth overall
"Young guys that control the pace like CP3, money from midrange, expert passing &amp; IQ? Idk if there’s any young stars like that rn. Lamelo/Hayes are close to that I guess, maybe Ja Morant, but i don’t think the next CP3 has entered the league yet. Maybe Jalen Suggs! Or Sharife Cooper idk"

Jalen drugs to Jalen Suggs
Holiday- Cade Cunningham   Booker- Jalen Suggs   Middleton- Jalen Green  Give some young players a shot. USA is getting gold anyways
Fine by me as long as we replace him with Jalen Suggs
"The draft is a 4-5 player class with the best prospects being Cade, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs, and Jonathan Kuminga/Scottie Barnes.  I believe Cade is 1A, and Jalen Green is 1B. This draft has a lot of wings + premier role players in the back end of the draft, and surplus of vertastile bigs. But if you watch Beal/Lavine/Brandon Roy, you can see a lot of similarities in his game. Super advanced scoring feel, his athleticism also takes him over the top, dude just glides when he finishes.  The dude scoring is just effortless, and he averaged 17.9 PPG against grown professional G-League players at 19.      [The man is just money, look at him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8YWVkr8D6w&amp;ab_channel=CPH2K)"
"Off topic, but its getting so hard for me to keep track of these younger players and prospects who have similar names. There are so many guys in recent drafts or in the upcoming drafts (especially some of the higher rated prospects) that have names like Jalen, Jaylen, Jaden, Jaren etc that I keep mixing them up. In this case there literally was a guy named Jalen McDaniels the year before Jaden McDaniels which is what caused me to go down this rabbit hole   2018: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson  2019: Jaylen Norwell, Jaylen Hands, Jalen McDaniels  2020: Jalen Smith, Jaden McDaniels, Jalen Harris,  2021: Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Jaden Springer, Jared Butler  2022: Jaden Hardy, Jaden Ivey  2023-24: Jalen Duran, Jalen Washington, Jaden Bradley, Jalen Lewis, Jaylen Clark, Jayden Nicholson  Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk"
Probably has a lot to do with Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs.
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Welcome to Toronto Jalen Suggs
"Idk if this is actually unpopular but I think the NBA and WNBA should forbid all pro players from playing for the national team. The USA will win the Olympics this year and it won’t be close. Instead of having our best players dominate the tournament, it should be non-pro/minor league players (College, G-League, Overseas Americans, Semi-pro, etc.). The tournament would be way more competitive and it would make our gold medals more worth it. It would be interesting to see Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green and co represent The USA Men’s team in the Olympics. We’d also likely get to see some Americans playing in China or Europe, which would give them great recognition. The way it currently is makes for a stale product. Who really wants to see team USA effortlessly wallop every single opponent? I’d much rather watch games that are actually gonna be close.   Just an FYI, The United States Men’s team currently has a record of 138-5 in the Olympics. The Women’s team has a record of 66-3 in the Olympics."
I think if any one of the players in this draft has a shot at being amazingly good it’s the Jalens. Jalen Green looks like he could by a bigger Kyrie and Jalen Suggs has a ceiling of being a good Paul George-type
Jalen Suggs*
Yea but he could be a good second option to Jalen Suggs/Green or OG/Trent if they step up. They’re both only 22.
Jalen (s). Green and suggs
"That 4th pick will do wonders for making a playoff push. Siakam and VanVleet are only 27, everyone else is even younger. Lowry is the only one over 30 and his window for contention is much shorter which is why he'll probably move on. Jalen Suggs will fit perfectly into the point guard role Lowry leaves behind."
"The Cavs have a lot of needs because they took average guards very high up in recent drafts so I think grabbing a future FRP to move back 1 spot would make a ton of sense. They can still get Mobley/Green/Suggs (whoever falls) and this way the Raptors guarantee Mobley or Jalen Green which is great for them, while also getting #7 and Wiseman."
"Assuming Wiggins is the salary filler I would do 7 + Wiseman but Ide try and push for 14 as well, maybe send them our 2 seconds back if we need to.   Suggs, FVV, Wiggins, OG, Wiseman. With a bench of GTJ, Boucher, Birch, +2 lotto picks (maybe Jalen Johnson + Kai Jones) would be a super fun season."
"Only issue is that I think trading Wood to GSW for Wiseman and the 14th pick would be a win win, but rockets can't do that if they have Mobley. Idk who the Rockets could take because rn there assets are Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and he doesn't fit great with Jalen Green and I think Suggs or Kuminga at 2 is a mistake but idk."
Jalen Suggs + OG + Gary Trent Jr + Wiseman + 7th overall pick is a pretty stacked young core
"For Suggs I don’t think the cost is worth it because he has high just good starter vibes.  Suggs has a great medium outcome of being a solid starting point guard for 10 years without being an all star even if he has a slight chance of being an all star (think Mike Bibbyish), but for Jalen Green who has top 10 player in the league potential you go all out.  I’d offer 5 the future Bulls pick, the future Nuggets pick we have and a top 5 protected Magic pick for next year as well to move up to get Jalen Green at 2 or 3."
DET - Cade Cunningham   HOU - Evan Mobley   CLE - Jalen Green   TOR - Jalen Suggs   ORL - Jonathan Kuminga   OKC - Scottie Barnes   GSW - Moses Moody   ORL - James Bouknight   SAC - Jalen Johnson   NOP - Franz Wagner   CHA - Kai Jones   SAS - Alperen Sengun   IND - Davion Mitchell   GSW - Josh Giddey
"There is a very good chance that OKC had their eyes on Cade since we started this rebuild. I'm just saying that it's possible that OKC would do whatever it takes to get Cade in OKC.  Even if Cade and SGA end up with the same ceiling, we would be able to build a better team around Cade.   Cade might be MVP one day, but OKC would be able to tank his rookie year and possibly the Emoni draft too in 2023.  If I'm Sam Presti, I want a chance to have Cade and Emoni.  SGA is great, actually too good to tank with.  That is putting OKC in a hard position right now...  The reason why Detroit would do this is because they would be able to get that ""Big ass haul"" they are looking for.  If they want Jalen Green + A big ass haul.  Then, OKC could trade with Houston no problem because they are looking for a star to trade #2 with.  It might actually work out well because we have all of Houston's picks and that star player they are looking for.  Toronto will tear the doors down to get SGA too, not saying that they have anything that Detroit wants, but Houston is rumored to be looking at Jalen Suggs.  There are all kinds of opportunity here."
Makes sense for PDX to get the #4 pick in the draft.  TOR is not far from a full rebuild.  Added on a legitimate PG in FVV who can shoot the ball and defend.  Vet presence and either one of Jalen Green/Suggs.
1. DET-Cade Cunningham  2. HOU-Evan Mobley  3. CLE-Jalen Green  4. TOR-Jalen Suggs  5. ORL-Jonathan Kuminga  6. OKC-Scottie Barnes  7. GSW-Moses Moody  8. ORL-James Bouknight  9. SAC-Franz Wagner  10. NOP-Davion Mitchell  11. CHA-Usman Garuba  12. SAS-Alpern Sengun   13. IND-Josh Giddey  14. GSW-Corey Kispert
I think Houston goes with Jalen Green and Cleveland probably trades down with OKC or Orlando. Only locks I see are Detroit with Cade and Toronto with Suggs.
"&gt;The Cavaliers hold the third pick in the draft. While many believe they will choose from a highly regarded pool of four prospects -- Cade Cunningham (likely the top pick), **Evan Mobley (who many believe will go second to Houston)**, Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs -- the Cavs are expanding their search beyond that quartet. Sources say Kuminga is in the No. 3 mix, with the organization believing that particular draft slot isn’t too high for him."
"I mean I think it’s more than they will likely have the option to add either Jalen Green or Suggs as the BPA at 3, AND that they are going to have to pay Sexton a lot. If they are able to flip Sexton for a competent wing and a pick or two they’d be able to pick BPA at 3 and add a few assets in return from trading Sexton while keeping enough cap to sign JA and maybe others."
Not worth it for the Cavs to keep both him and Garland. Both are undersized with bad defense  Garland has more potential so I would cash in on Sexton and replace him with Jalen Green or even Suggs this draft
"Cade, Mobley, and Suggs are all pretty high floor sure things.  Green is the only one of the top 4 who is a bit more of a wild card at the next level.  The problem with Simmons is we basically know what his ceiling is because he's been there for a few years now.  Teams at the top of the draft are really looking at ceilings because they want a superstar.    Cade and Mobley are gonna be stars.  Jalen Green could absolutely be a star.  Suggs may not be a star but his floor is really high and I'd take him over Simmons."
"Breaking: Jalen Suggs has migraine, draft stock projected to fall to 19"
Cade Cunningham at 7th and Jalen Suggs at 14th.
"Suggs, unless Jalen Green falls to us"
All in on Jalen Suggs at #4
Jalen Suggs 100%
Whoever goes to the Raptors will have the best career so probably Jalen Suggs
"I'm not. There's no guarantee Suggs will even fall to 4 because the Rockets are interested. There's a also a possibility that that with Cleveland looking to move Sexton that they will try and get one of the Jalen guards making Mobley drop. I'm happy with the 4th pick, it's not really possible to make the wrong choice (unless we pick Kuminga)."
"Pretty much. Sexton is already pretty good at 22 and he's still incredibly young himself.  Jalen Green has superstar potential and Suggs has good potential as well, but if neither pan out the Cavs are shooting themselves in the foot."
Nobody comes to mind tbh.  Maybe Jalen Suggs? Wouldn't mind him becoming CP3 for the Raptors
There's seems to be a definite top 6 in this draft.  Cade Cunningham - Evan Mobley - Jalen Green - Jalem Suggs - Jonathan Kuminga - Scottie Barnes
With Jalen Suggs as 6th man 😤😤😤
Jalen Suggs on these nuts
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"Either would be fine. I would be surprised if Jalen Green becomes available past 3. Nurse and his staff can work on Suggs. He definitely has the tools considering his height, speed, athleticism, and he’s at NBA weight already. I mean Kyle Lowry averaged less than 4 assists in college but he became a solid PG for the Raptors eventually. OG and Siakam were taken beyond the 20th pick and VanVleet was even undrafted. I trust the development team of the Raptors to unlock the potential of a 4th pick player."
I hope its jalen green and  not suggs. Suggs is a combo guard who isnt ideally a 1 with his passing and isnt ideally a 2 as he cant shoot
"The Rockets could also take Jalen Green out of potential since it also seems that he’s ready for NBA spacing with what he showed in the G League. The only reason why they won’t consider Mobley is because his game may be conflicting with Woods. I do get your point about Wall. However, not sure who would want that 40+ M per for 3 more years after what they saw this season from him. They’ll most likely go Green before Suggs since you also can’t succeed in the NBA without that solid wing.  After Mark Jackson, there was Starbury though not from the draft. Also, Linsanity. Lol"
"Sam was on a podcast right after the draft and these are the relevant things I found from it:      Some Rockets relevant stuff on here:     -Troy Weaver (DET GM) has been high on Jalen Green all year and is ""a wild card"" and someone ""that doesn't subscribe to groupthink"" when it comes to draft eval &amp; pref     -Evan Mobley isn't a loud vocal leader type     - Both guys have Suggs 2nd https://t.co/zapou59V5m      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021      (ctd):     -Rockets have to consider Mobley's quieter personality in how they want to construct their locker room, Isaiah Mobley was the vocal leader for the USC team but Evan did try to ""come out of his shell"" more the last few seasons     -Vecinie has Mobley as All-NBA ceiling      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021      -Vecinie likes Suggs aggressiveness     -Green's athleticism and ability to produce against pros in G League are key and his shooting looks legit as well as half court creation abilities trajectory is most intriguing; needs to add strength     -Pennie has Mobley as more off-the ball guy      — Don Knock (@DonKnock) June 23, 2021"
"After winning the 2021 [NBA](http://bleacherreport.com/nba) draft lottery on Tuesday night, the [Detroit Pistons](http://bleacherreport.com/detroit-pistons) are open to trading the No. 1 overall pick.   According to [Rod Beard](https://twitter.com/detnewsRodBeard/status/1407679561169506305) of the Detroit News, Pistons general manager Troy Weaver said Wednesday that trading the top pick is ""an option.""  Per [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2668326/2021/06/23/nba-mock-draft-2021-picks-for-every-lottery-team-including-jalen-suggs-to-magic-and-evan-mobley-to-cavaliers/)'s James Edwards III, Oklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham is the likely pick for Detroit if it stands pat, although G League Ignite guard [Jalen Green](http://bleacherreport.com/jalen-green) and USC center Evan Mobley are under ""strong consideration"" by the Pistons as well."
"cade cunningham, jalen suggs, and more"
"It's not a good comparison. Cade Cunningham is widely believed to be a lock for #1, but not everyone agrees (Sam Vecenie of the Athletic)  &gt;While Cunningham is by far the most likely pick here, I don’t think we should necessarily write this in stone yet. The one thing that every person in basketball says about Troy Weaver is that he absolutely does not subscribe to group think. He said in a post-lottery presser that they’ll look at five guys and then make the best decision. It’s worth taking him at his word. After the lottery, I got texts from multiple sources that said the Pistons are also thought to be fans of Jalen Green. So look, I’m mocking Cunningham here. Pistons fans who want Cunningham shouldn’t have a meltdown based off this. But this isn’t like 2019 when Zion Williamson was a done deal and everyone in the basketball industry knew it. Cunningham is considered the likely choice here. He’s the overwhelming favorite. But everyone seems to be acting like this is unequivocally a done deal, and I’m not totally convinced of that as of right now, an hour after the lottery.  Most people have Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley at similar levels, with some adding Jonathan Kuminga to that mix. Since yesterday, Rockets fans have generally be in favor of drafting Jalen Green, followed by Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs a distant third."
"Nah Jalen Suggs is  (Sorry, gotta start my unreasonably biased raptor takes early before the others hop on)"
"Been there, my guy.  Gotta let that dog go.   Brighter days ahead, including with Jalen fucking Suggs manning the Point for us for the next 10 years."
Jalen suggs baby!!!
well it depends on who they get tbh   jalen suggs- future pg of the team.  mobley- future center of the team
"Mobley is far from a traditional center like those guys. He’s not paint dominant. He was like 10th percentile at post scoring last year.   He’s a face-up, agile, rangy big man. His game screams 4 at the NBA level. He would co-exist very well with either Wood or Allen.   I think there’s a good chance he makes it post Rockets if they really like Green. But it’s really hard to see Mobley slip past the Cavs.   Green is 6’5 and projects as a SG and Suggs is 6’4 and is a combo guard. Sexton and Garland are like the two building blocks in Cleveland so far. It doesn’t make sense for them to go with a Jalen. Mobley makes a lot more sense for them."
"Yes, and next season with Wiseman second season and Jalen Suggs or Green running the second team with Paschall as sixth man will easily put Warriors ahead of LA teams"
Weltman actually drafted isaac but yeah I agree hopefully all of our injuries could be a blessing in disguise and we can get cade jalen green kuminga and suggs out of it who can all possibly be franchise players.
"Pop and Buford been doing weird things since Duncan retired.  Like giving a 36yo Pau Gasol a 3 year 45 million contract.  If any year is the year to tank, this gotta be it with Cade, Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Zaire coming in the draft.

"Absolutely agree. Cade is like a better scoring MCW. He's too slow and doesn't have a quick first step. Defensively, he lacks lateral quickness.   Jalen Suggs reminds me of a George Hill/Chauncey Billups hybrid."
Unpopular opinion: I’ve been more impressed by Jalen Suggs
Better land a Jalen Suggs or someone who can play point or I'm outta here. All we have are 2 score first combo guards running the show. Pain.
"Edwards has so much potential. My dream for him and the T-Wolves is we end up getting that top three pick, draft Jalen Suggs, trade Dlo for literally anything, and end up putting out a starting lineup next season of Suggs, Edwards, McDaniels, Vanderbilt, and Towns."
"That 2021 Draft is gonna be one of the most loaded in recent memory.  Cade, Mobley, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Zaire Williams, Scottie Barnes, Kuminga. Jalen Johnson."
"not just top, Jalen Green might be the best pure scorer in the draft and was the #2 prospect out of high school. Both of these guys would have probably been the #1 overall pick had they been in last year's draft. A lot of people have knocked them down to 4-7 in mocks simply due to the fact that Suggs and Mobley have been killing it in college, but this is def their chance to try to earn being 2nd/3rd overall picks"
"After the season perhaps, why not go for a Top 3 Draft pick to ensure its out of the Warriors hands?  Then get one of Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs."
"If they land the Wolves pick outside the Top 3 in 2021, this team is gonna be stacked again.  Steph - Klay - Wiggins - Oubre - Draymond - Wiseman - Paschall - Looney - Wanamaker - Bazemore  And one of Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Suggs. Jalen Green, Scottie Barnes or Zaire Williams."
"You guys become stupidly scary next season if Minnesota get unlucky and their pick lands 4th... Imagine bringing say Jalen Suggs off the bench...   Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Wiseman with a bench of Suggs, Bazemore, Oubre, Paschall and Looney..."
"Exactly. Bulls fans who are not against trading Zach don't think he's a bad player, just don't think he's a true #1 due to his poor defense and decision making as a play maker.   People bring up Booker, who was always a bit better of a passer than LaVine, and point to the Suns now being good. Well yeah, they added arguably the best point guard of all time to their team haha. CP3 can turn anyone into a playoff team – we saw it with OKC last year.   I would have loved the Bulls to get him. So, our doubts are more about trying to get the superstar winning player like a CP3 to pair with Zach. If we can't bring that guy in, or develop one of our young guys to be that soon, then maybe trading him and trying to land a Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley type potential two way superstar is our best option.   I trust AKME to make smart decisions."
Jalen Suggs would be the pipe dream. His tape looks really good
Who we gonna take?  Suggs?  Mobley?  Lil' Kobe Jalen Green?
Jalen Green?  Jalen Suggs?  Evan Mobley?
"Yeesh. Nasty sprain right there. I'd start watching some Jalen Green, Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs highlights if I was a Rockets fan"
"OKC at the 2nd pick:  “With the first pick in the 2021 NBA draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves select Jalen Suggs, guard from Gonzaga”  Instantly every Oklahoman now roots for MIN as their 2nd team for the next 10 years minimum"
"That Minnesota list is going to look super different in a few years. There’s a decent chance the next two #1 overall picks are from Minnesota (Jalen Suggs in 2021 and #1 overall recruit Chet Holmgren in 22). Add to that Paige Bueckers, #1 overall recruit in 2020, should be right up there when she leaves for the WNBA."
"I love Tyus, but Jalen Suggs takes over the top active player spot for Minnesota the moment he is drafted this year."
"A lot of people might be surprised that Minnesota (the twin cities specifically) has a pretty healthy basketball scene.  Just that those people are fans of other teams, or just the nba in general , rather than following the wolves.  Can't blame em , we suck, but theyd hop on board if we ever get good  Recently have some nba talent come out of the state.  Tyus Jones, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Suggs (will be a top 3 pick in the 2021 draft) and Chet Holmgren (projected top pick in the 2022 draft)"
"Cade, Mobley, Suggs, Kuminga all look like phenomenal players. Guys like Jalen Green and Ziaire are ballers too"
"Top 3 would be Kush for the magic. Suggs, Cade, Jalen"

"Why though? If Minnesota's whole branding is ""We exist only by forcing people to play here"" like ... why would you even want to be a fan of that? Minnesota isn't a franchise because of the draft and they wouldn't stop being a franchise if you got rid of it.   Lets see every single player in the NBA literally only wanted to play in LA (which isn't even close to true). The NBA gets its money from fans and TV deals. The LA market is not big enough to support 29 teams. The NBA would go broke if they tried that. LA can barely support TWO teams and now they have two NFL teams, two MLB teams, etc. You want to just throw 27 more NBA teams on top of that?   Also, players sign with non-LA franchises ALL THE TIME. The Lakers couldn't give their money away when they had Buss and Mike Brown. Guys want to be the #1 option, or close to home, or the most money, etc. LA/Miami/etc. will always have an inherent benefit. That's why small market superstars on teams that don't win leave to go there now. You can't change that. But eliminating the draft doesn't give the Lakers 50 roster spots and no more salary cap. Guys aren't going to say, ah shit. Lakers are full? Guess I will just sit out. My family doesn't REALLY need to eat. All good.   One hypothetical; lets say the Gophers had signed Jalen Suggs. He wanted to be close to home. He's coming pro this year! Amazing! Oh wait. The Wolves have the 10th pick. The Warriors, already with Steph Curry, pick first due to injuries. Suggs wants to be a Timberwolf and stay close to his family. Too bad though, he is going to be a Warrior. Maybe the Wolves can draft a project from Europe though instead! Yay draft!"
"I like Cade, but I think Jalen Suggs will be a more dynamic player."
I was always more of a Jalen Suggs guy myself
I would love to somehow get Jalen Suggs

"If the Dubs start winning, they need to slow their roll a bit. See if they can get two top-15 picks. They can make the playoffs, then fine-tune their positioning a bit. Get a top-10 and a top-15 player, you have the foundation for the future (Wiseman, Wiggins, Pascall, two lottery picks in a great draft, or take both and package them to move up for their guy like Jalen Suggs if he slipped a bit or whatever).   If Minnesota can somehow manage a pick from 4-9 or so, this draft will be lit for the Dubs, they will have a solid block of young talent. The Athletic had GS with the 7th and 15th picks, seems about right, snagging a stud wing in Scottie Barnes and then arguably the best defensive player in the draft at 15 in Usman Garuba (6-8, F/C). Obviously who knows who they will get, but they are exceedingly well-positioned.  Oh, and I am forgetting Nico. IDK man, that kid was projected to be a top-10 pick, had a meh first season at Arizona, but that kid is a year younger than he was supposed to be when drafted (graduated HS early and reclassified), and playing with Steph, feel like he might learn enough to breakout like Draymond. Or maybe I just like how he plays, just watching him, I feel like he could definitely start in the league one day."
"Likely no way to get Cade. Can't see him dropping out of the top 3 (realistically dropping form #1) and the Minnesota pick is top 3 protected- we hopefully won't be bad enough to be in the lottery.  If Jalen Suggs somehow drops to #4 though, oh my lord. A 3 guard lineup with Steph, Klay, and Suggs could be deadly."
"Jalen Suggs, come on home. Chet, you'll probably come the next year, too."
Jalen Suggs has entered the chat

"Wish you guys can somehow get Cade, Jalen or Suggs. You guys are a great franchise and deserve to be good. I think the Gasols connection make us endear to you."
Jalen Suggs is making a strong case right now.

"Warriors will probably end up tanking this season for a top 5 pick, and try to nab one of Cade/Suggs/Jalen Green.  The Wolves pick likely ends up in the lottery.  Next year's roster could realistically look like:  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Wiseman  Suggs, Kispert, Oubre, Paschall + some randos  That takes the team from 1 shotmaker to 4 instantly, with 2 players who can handle the ball / iso when needed.  This team can compete while not sacrificing the future either.  Warriors can have their cake and eat it too.  I actually love how the team is positioned going forward, it's far from doom and gloom."
Scottie Barnes Ignoring Jalen Suggs' Instagram Stories?
"I had Mobley at 1, Cade 2, Jalen Suggs 3, and then Barnes Green 4-5. I think Cade is being a bit overlooked with the whole hasn't played yet thing but he's got a unique set of skills only Mobley can match from this class"
But he’s not playing bad right now. Russ is obviously still better than a good amount of starting PGs in the league though. But he’s been bad SO FAR and Kemba has been good SO FAR. I definitely think Jalen Suggs is the worst rn
"Doesn't matter. I'd probably take Scottie over every Jalen in the NBA **combined**.  Suggs, McDaniels, Green, you name it."
Masai knows Jalen Suggs worth better than Jalen does
Masai read Jalen Suggs for filth and he was right
"People kept saying he was the odd man out after Jalen Suggs was drafted.  Between Him, Suggs, and Fultz, he seems like the most natural scorer."
Jalen Suggs is a bust
"Meanwhile, Jalen Suggs is a blend of Anthony Bennett, Javaris Crittenton, and 20-21 Udonis Haslem."
"Early observation: It’s gonna be a long season. Won’t be pretty record wise, but it’s a step in the right direction. Three point shooting continues to be an issue, as does our defense.  Player that surprised me for the better: Franz Wagner  Player that surprised me for the worst: Jalen Suggs  Rookies: Kind of a mixed bag. Franz is looking good, but Jalen has been struggling  New coach: It’s a bit too early for me to give a detailed review, but I like how he has us playing at a faster pace. Like I said before, the defense isn’t great, but it’ll come with time."
"Virgin: “scoTTie bArneS”  Chad: Jalen Green, Houston Rockets.... Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers. ... Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors. ... Jalen Suggs, Orlando Magic. ... Josh Giddey, Oklahoma City Thunder. ... Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic. ... Davion Mitchell, Sacramento Kings. ... Ziaire Williams, Memphis Grizzlies."
"Right?  It's still so early.  So many hot takes on our sub about Jalen Green after two single digit games...but then he drops an incredibly efficient 30, and now his numbers look good on the year.  Add in Scottie Barnes looking great along with Giddie...and Cade hasn't even played yet, and Suggs isn't going to be this bad for long.  Add on guys like Sengun (who has looked great at times but still very raw) and this draft is going to look wonderful in 4 or 5 years.  Going into the year I thought Mobley would be like, 6th or 7th on my most likely to win RotY because of how raw he is compared to Cade, Barnes, Suggs, and Green...but even with that he just looks so smooth on the court.  I've been so incredibly impressed by him, but he absolutely does *not* have RotY locked down by any stretch."
" I know no one will like this suggestion, but this is how I would handle these sorts of situations in the new CBA.    At a certain key date (end of one season, beginning of a new season or something) a player can officially request a trade through the league office to get off a team he really has a problem with.  To offset this, his contract could take a hit depending on how many years he has left - for example, with a five year supermax- if its in the season following signing the new contract, its value can be reduced by up to 50%. If he requests the trade after the second year it can only reduced by 40%, third year 30% etc.  How much it is actually reduced by is determined by how much incoming trade value the trading team chooses to take back - anything from full value (another 40 mil per year contract or combination of contracts) down to 50% value (a 20 mil/year contract or contracts)  I think this makes trading a guy they’ve invested in much more palatable for a team and gives them some additional flexibility to get the trade done.  One of the biggest hurdles to trading for a max player for teams stuck in the lottery or on the fringe of the playoffs is they often don’t already have more than one player of equal monetary value, if that, even though they may have several promising young players on cheaper contracts.  So they have to ship off a whole bunch of players along with the real trade targets to make the money work.  I’m thinking of teams like Orlando, Detroit, Indiana, and Memphis who all have no one making more than 20 million right now or New Orleans and Washington who have only one guy currently making the max who they want to keep and not trade.  Getting a disgruntled star on the cheap also makes the trade more appealing for other teams.  Of course the player REALLY has to want out if he’s willing to sacrifice up to half his pay for a change of scenery.  But this can also incentivize the player to stay and try to make it work for another season or two, to reduce his losses.  In the Simmons situation, this would allow Philadelphia to trade him for a player or combination of players in the 20 million dollar range and create some cap space if they can’t find a deal for a player/s in the same salary range as his current contract. So while a team like Washington might be unwilling to give up Beal for Simmons, this would allow them to make an offer of a guy like Dinwiddie or Caldwell-Pope or Kuzma or Bertans, plus any combination of lower salary players along with draft picks to get the deal done.  A team like Orlando could trade Gary Harris, a high value rookie like Jalen Suggs, and draft picks without having to completely gut their team for a guy who has already shown he can be a headache.  I do think even with this the CBA would have to get stricter provisions for “injured” or “mentally unable to play” players to keep someone from being able to just sit and home and collect checks rather than officially requesting a trade.  Alright, feel free to destroy me now :)"
"Cade: Grant Hill is a better comp. Both are smart, unselfish, and offensively versatile players who gave a damn on both ends. But neither were A+ athletes like the way Penny was.     Green has a higher ceiling than Lavine if he hits. Athletically, I think Green is more explosive slashing, while Lavine's athleticism is really his bounce. Green has also shown way more passing intuition than Lavine did until maybe the past year or so. Hard to compare a guy to MJ/Kobe, but he's definitely higher than Lavine.     Mobley: I wonder if there's a better comp than Bosh. Both are talented on both ends of the floor and are long as all out. But Mobley's passing skills are really impressive, not something I've ever seen from Bosh. I might argue ""KG without the f\*cking intens\*ty"" for Mobley.  If Scottie Barnes hits, he could be AK-47. (How's that for cross-race comparisons)     Jalen Suggs: Jameer Nelson 2.0, except Jameer shot it better.     Giddey: Kukoc is not the comp I would go with given that one of Kukoc's hallmarks was his shooting ability and Giddey still has very big ??? about his shot. There's got to be a better comp."
Jalen Suggs with a completely wreckless and brainless play

JALEN SUGGS AND 1 BITCHES
i still worry the cavs might regret passing up Jalen Suggs tbh. guy hasn’t even started to focus on basketball for that long
"Feels like 40 games of Isaac, as long as he's still a plus defensive player (top 25 even, not his pre-injury top 10) would be enough for them to get above 15 and closer to 20.   The guards will mostly be horrid, but Bamba/Carter-Isaac-Franz Wagner is a structurally coherent enough frontcourt (okay defenders, nobody with horrible complimentary skills) that if one of Anthony or Suggs are good every 2-3 games, they can win some of those.   You have to be really bad to win 15. Right now, by WS/48, 4 of the 6 worst players in the league playing rotation minutes (over 15) are Magic guys (Anthony, Brazdeikis, Suggs, Mo Wagner) and that seems unlikely to last. If Suggs and Anthony can be terrible instead of dead last among starting guards as the year goes on they'll win some games.   I did seriously think about the under of 22, but I don't hate  the frontcourt enough to have them at 15, even if Anthony is going to heroically try to get them Jalen Hardy or Banchero to be their #1 scorer next year."

"Mo Bamba might lead the league in blocks this yr, Jonathan Isaac is a DPOY player when healthy, WCJ is a really good defender, Franz Wagner at 6'10 and Chuma Okeke at 6'8 are long and tall wing defenders. Jalen Suggs is also a really good defender Magic have all the makings of being an elite defensive team."
"last night, chris duarte  two nights from now, jalen suggs"
Jalen Suggs
"Masai really is a genius. Taking Barnes over Suggs was clowned on early after the draft, but now Jalen is more like Jalen Sucks rn."
meanwhile Jalen Suggs is awful
You clearly salty because Jalen Suggs going 3/15 every game so far lmao. Don’t see any of his highlights on the sub because there are none
"Man, I was shtting hard on Masai for passing up Jalen Suggs but man oooo man Barnes is good.  So glad they picked him"
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they’re rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
Me a Jalen Suggs truther: ……well…..
lol they all have a lot of weaknesses and are all under 24  Markelle needs to improve his shooting or he will be a below average to average starting pg in this league and will really cramp the spacing for us.   Cole Anthony needs to work on his decision making and shot selection and get better as a finisher but he gets by guys with his speed and athleticsm and than throws up tough shots over the rim protector.   RJ Hampton gets in the paint but makes bad decisions since he jumps up with all the defenders and than has to force a shot up or force a pass to someone on the perimeter.  Jalen Suggs ball handling is still a work in progress and he won't be a lead creator or be efficient until he tightens it but we will put the ball in his hands and let him learn through his mistakes.  JI is injury prone but he has shown the ability to be an elite defender and I hope his shooting is improved with so much time off.  Okeke is perfect he doesn't really force shots and just is a good player on both ends.  Franz needs to get bigger and gain confidence on his shot and tighten his handle  WCJ is also a high IQ guy other than turning down some open shots and threes he has been really solid since he got here on both ends.  Mo hopefully has a career yr it has been rough past 3 yrs for him but he looked really good needs to not pick up so many quick fouls and keep his hands up.
jalen suggs has never been as good as lebron so far
1st team - Cade/Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Davion Mitchell/Mobley
"i disagree. i think he’s already a front runner.    cade, jalen green, scottie barnes, giddey, bouknight, duarte, trey murphy, sengun, jared butler, davion, bones. i don’t see anyone else getting enough minutes to qualify for the discussion. suggs looks like he’s a little more of a project than anticipated."
Jalen Suggs the supposed nba ready pg that doesn’t have the handles to play pg whatsoever  Wagner played terrible in preseason not a good sign especially when you compare him to duarte another pro ready role player prospect picked lower  Davion Mitchell seems like the new pat bev  Bouknight will be a worse version of Jordan clarkson at best until he improves his passing  those are the only players I watched
"The the Magic hands down.  Isaac is a right wing nut who is made of glass.  Cole Anthony is a great dude but doesn't have the size to be an impact player.  Suggs hasn't played a game but I'm not convinced.   Honestly if we are talking young players to be excited about, I still think RJ Hampton has the most upside of anyone on our squad. Which....is sad.  The rockets blew up their team like 8 minutes ago and they have Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, and Alperen Sengun-- all who have all star ceilings.   I'm so jealous."
Jalen Suggs quits the NBA in favor for the NFL after the Magic go 10-72.
"So Suggs is the same height as Green? He is still listed at 6'4""  https://www.nba.com/player/1630591/jalen-suggs"
"Ooops.   Yeah, Jalen Suggs doesn't have that same appeal."
"Damn I didn't know Jalen Suggs was only averaging 5 lmao, he's gonna be great though. Also wtf Jared Butler??"
Jalen Suggs
Jalen Suggs lmfao
You think Jalen Suggs’ floor is better than Prime Fat Lever?! Lmao
"I saw Jalen Suggs at the Minnesota state fair with his mom and the rest of his family last month, and he surprisingly wasn't getting bombarded much. Might be different in Orlando now though that he's their star"
"I think the magic. I understand teams that may struggle in the Midwest or smaller markets, but your in FLORIDA.   You got high pics and did nothing with them. You chose to pick up Markell fultz as if he can shoot after his accident. You've drafted the same position for 2 straight years. Cole Anthony rj Hampton Jalen Suggs.   I don't see any player that says wow for merchandise. It's just sad. You got all the theme parks, clubs, weather, diversity that would attract any player but can't get any notable names or look to even try to.   You have the most athletic big man with the longest wing span in nba history train that dude into a faster Rudy gobert in mo bamba. Then u got Johnathan Isaac who ppl say have the potential to be the best all-round defender. But nothing..."

"No, no he wasn’t. Beal was an all nba performer and the only reason our team didn’t end up with Jalen Suggs"
Jalen Suggs blocked Jayson Tatum twice. Scottie Buns only did it once. Should craptor fans be worried or should they cope more?
Shooting the three is considered Barnes main weakness so… No? This should be as expected and the rest of Barnes game has looked outstanding in both SL and preseason… and I know this is just a response to the Suggs thread but the obsession with comparing Scottie and Jalen is fucking lame.
"He fell to round 7 and pick 66 in our draft. Notably shocking players to go before him included Terry Rozier, Jalen Suggs, Robert Williams and Scottie Barnes."
Trust in Masai lol did you guys hate him or something because he didn’t choose a player  other media told you was the best available? Toronto fans gonna compare him to Jalen Suggs forever.
*furiously deleting jalen suggs tweets*
"Imma have to live with the fact that whenever Scottie Barnes does something, Jalen Suggs will forever be mentioned and vice versa."
BeT jaLEN SuGGs CAn't DO this
"PG: Jalen Suggs  SG: Jalen Green  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jalen McDaniels  C: Jalen Smith  For current players, ain't half bad"
"Rockets have kpjr, senguen, and Jalen green as high upside guys.  I have Suggs as lower upside than all 3 of those.  Feelsbadman"
Jalen Suggs and Chet Holmgren are gonna link up again in Orlando next year
"lool scottie with more points than jalen green, more rebounds than mobley, and more assists than suggs"
"He’s really not even that much older than those guys. He’s 2-3 years younger than Mitchell and Duarte and really only around a year older than guys like Cade, Jalen Suggs, and Mobley. He just turned 21 in mid June"
I love how Suggs plays. Ima be sick if he’s better than Jalen.
I don't think Jalen suggs at all. I actually think he's really talented.
Its litterally Jalen Suggs and the rest are not that good
calling cole anthony an amazing prospect is a stretch and RJ Hampton has shown barely any upside tbh. Jalen Suggs is still far and away their best guard prospect
Jalen Suggs ROY
Anthony Edwards is younger than Jalen Suggs
"magic starters: jalen suggs, gary harris, terrence ross, franz wagner, wendell carter jr"
He's gonna be a force for sure - his worst-case scenario imo is Kristaps Porzingis with a better handle   That Minnehaha team with him and Jalen Suggs was so ridiculously talented and fun to watch
"Yeah I was gonna say this sounds like exactly what happened (or is happening) to Jonathan Isaac especially since he's uber-religious.  Also because it's the Magic, I didn't realize they actually drafted someone by the name Jalen Suggs."
I'm pretty sure this post was addressed to Jalen Suggs tho
"I think you’re taking it too personal, it’s a dig at the Magic, not Jalen Suggs"
Why is Jalen Suggs there over Jimmy Butler?
Why Jalen Suggs?  Surely they have a better option then a rookie who has never played a game. Especially considering the team you put already us 2 guards
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
just asked my roommate who is a soccer fan if he knows jalen green he said no  i asked him if he knew jalen suggs and he said yes because he watched the final four  you are delusional and blinded by being a rockets fan
"Brother Jalen Green has a huge platform, a lot bigger than Suggs, was the first big time rookie to join the gleague and was the higher pick in the draft idk what ur saying  Jalen has 150k on twitter  Suggs has 50k   Green has 1.4M on instagram  Suggs has 500k"
ask your average sports fan if they know who jalen green is  then ask your average sports fan if they know who jalen suggs is  oh yeah he's the guy who played for the #1 ncaa bball team most of the year and hit that crazy game winner in the final four  you know i'm right
"Idk what the thumbnail shows, but Suggs has a photo with Jalen"
Lol idc bout no thumbnail but Jalen Green is like 100x more popular than Suggs
Bruh how is Jalen Suggs in the thumbnail over Jalen Green
Growing on me is Scottie Barnes at first I was upset we didn’t get jalen suggs but I feel it was the right move raptors looking like they can make the playoffs and Chicago is looking like they could be a really solid team in the east
"Jon isaac is ""untouchable""      Here's the truth, despite being drafted a year earlier, Isaac has only played 18 more games than Marvin Bagley III, while averaging less points and less rebounds. But one of these players gets clowned and is labeled as a bust, while the other is considered the ""best player on the team"". In 2 summer league games jalen suggs has already shown more potential than isaac has shown in 4 years. The only thing he's got going for himself is ""he looked like a real dpoy candidate for 7 games"". And before people come at me for politics, I felt this way before the recent drama, when people were saying they wouldn't trade him for the number 1 pick."
markelle fultz -&gt; james harden   jalen suggs -&gt; jason kidd  chuma okeke -&gt; robert covington  jonathan isaac -&gt; rashard lewis  wendell carter jr -&gt; al horford    cole anthony -&gt; mo williams  rj hampton -&gt; dante exum  terrence ross -&gt; eddie jones  franz wagner -&gt; mike dunleavy jr  mo bamba -&gt; rudy gobert  thats pretty damn good
Here’s one. Jalen Suggs will be a bust. I hope not but I get a weird feeling.
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Anthony Edwards 3. LaMelo Ball  4. Jalen Green  5. Evan Mobley  6. Jalen Suggs
"Ziaire Williams over Jaylen Brown, Bam, Jalen Suggs, Ingram, RJ and Kyrie?"
"I was born in 2000 and when i saw jalen suggs was born in 2001, i was blown away. Weird how unprepared i am for everything while he’s gonna be making millions next year."
Jalen Suggs lol
"Lol then we would have to hear you cry even more when cade, Jalen and suggs all signed with the Lakers or nets or contenders like the bucks or sun's.  It's literally not a problem. If teams really wanted the player they would draft him and own his rights even if he left and devoloped his game in Europe like Ricky Rubio did(or stayed in Europe*)  People just want to cry because it's the lakers"
Wiggins if he's still on the  warriors. Cole Anthony if fultz is healthy and Jalen Suggs addition.
Jalen Suggs and Jonathan Isaac gonna be amazing for us in a couple years you right
It's clear to me now after watching this why the Raptors took Scottie Barnes over Jalen Suggs he has a relationship with Cade Cunningham so if the pistons can't win with Cunningham build a decent team around him he will want to exit why not play with a former team mate. Raptors playing the long game.
Jalen Suggs is the next one.
PG - Jalen Suggs  SG - Jalen Suggs  SF - Jalen Suggs  PF - Jalen Suggs  C - Jalen Suggs
5 Jalen Suggs
I'm looking forward to that 2019 u19 USA team who *dominated* everyone in their tournament:  Tyler Halliburton   Jalen Green   Cade Cunningham   Jalen Suggs   Evan Mobley   Scottie Barnes  Those Suggs/Green and Halliburton/Green lineups were lethal.
"Yes the reporting is wrong. There’s been so many false rumors lately that have been getting swept under the rug simply because of all the chaos of the offseason. The SGA + 6 rumor for pick 1? False. Bradley Beal wanting out? False. Jalen Suggs to the Raptors? False. Dame wanting to give up his contract? False. The media will report anything and everything that fits their narrative. I highly doubt we’re shopping Siakam, but he’s obviously not untouchable. This report is pure speculation."
"Jalen Green is not quite as dynamite a prospect as I think people assume and is a much riskier prospect than Cade/Suggs/Mobley/Barnes.  First, players his size (under 200 pounds, SG height/length) are seldom superstars unless they are high PnR players.  Tough for traditional SGs (off ball scorers) to become superstars.  So his offensive upside isn't quite as high as guys with primary playmaker potential.  Second, he has kinda bad physical tools for becoming a high level defender - small, skinny, gonna be tough for him to navigate screens or defend big wings.  And physical strength is also hugely important on offense.  And Green low-key has a pretty good defensive motor for a pure scorer, his issues are not effort based on defense imo.  Third, G League stats can be a bit fool's gold, I think people overrate the quality of the league.  I think he is a really good prospect, but it is tough for players of his build and archetype to get that much better than Zach LaVine, even if Green is clearly better than LaVine was at the same age.  And LaVine is clearly not a guy you want as your best offensive player, teams like that have had issues on offense.  Given I don't think he will be a superstar based solely on offensive contributions, I'd take one of the two-way players who have the potential at least to create significant value for their team on both ends of the court.  My other unpopular opinion is that Davion Mitchell's game won't really translate and he'll fall out of fashion in Sacramento."
- Jalen Green is most likely going to be an empty stat guy to start his career  - Evan Mobley is only going to be a solid starter until he puts on weight and refines his offense  - Barnes over Suggs isn’t even remotely a bad choice. People are overreacting off of name recognition and not seeing the issues with Suggs
"*To be or not to be?*  When compared to Jalen Suggs, Barnes' metrics such as PER 36 provide a point of debate, but I believe Suggs is the more proven scorer and can effectively generate offence.  I feel like I'm trying to persuade myself that Barnes is the better prospect, but I'm left with ambiguity, which leads to a conservation rather than a definitive answer.  Barnes is more of a project player who, given a couple of years, has the potential to develop into an above-average player.  I believe Suggs will be great right away. I just optically see a better player who appears to be able to handle the ball for a long stretch of time in an NBA game.  I was bewildered by the Barnes pick, and I’m still questioning the choice."
I thought we were gonna take jalen Suggs but we didn’t
"Don't you like Guard rotation of Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Markelle Fultz, and Jalen Suggs?"
Tatum was the 4th like Jalen Suggs this year  It was always a 4 person draft
Oh absolutely. I’m very high Scottie to Toronto. That front court of OG and Scottie might be insane. I think Jalen Suggs was better because I’m sure if the Raptors are still willing to keep Kyle Lowry
"He’s a younger Draymond Green. He can facilitate like a Point Forward, he can slash, plays great defense, and has great IQ. He’s just limited offensively because he cant shoot well. The Raptors development team will help him greatly, but Jalen Suggs was a better fit for the Raptors"
jalen suggs burner
y’all really never watched Jalen Suggs???? Casuals
It's better to draft a project with a higher ceiling than to draft a guy like Suggs who will never be good enough to lead a team to the chip .A fully realised Jalen Green would be Kobe esque with his athleticism and scoring ability . Suggs just won't put up enough points on the board .
Scottie Barnes will be Andre Iguodala  Jalen Suggs will be Jrue Holiday
alright and that's the end of my UDFA posting night. take care and for the love of god Jalen Suggs please don't become a superstar I can't handle it.
Either Masai is going to look a genius or Jalen Suggs is going to kill you slowly and painfully every time he plays you.
Moody literally has the highest floor besides like Cade &amp; Suggs &amp; Jalen lol
And 0 Jalen Suggs
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."
I just learned Jalen Suggs second cousins with Terell Suggs too
Jalen Suggs looks like a man who is planning on going LeBronto on the Raptors every time he plays them. You can really see the anger flowing through him.
"Jaylen Suggs, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Smith - all I got"
"I mean so were a lot of players that didn't make it into the league.  In plenty mock drafts, Docic was at highest 4, and he got selected 3 instead of what you think should be 2.  All mock drafts had Toronto selecting Jalen Suggs at 4, but Toronto valued a lower pick. Just like Dallas did (through Atlanta)  with Doncic.  This could easily be the same thing through workouts with Suggs and Barnes, or they're planning on trading a bunch of a player that fits well with Barnes."
Isnt Jalen Suggs a PG? You think the Magic gonna play this fucking small?
Before the night started I thought our best case scenario was Kuminga and Moody.  And the dubs ended up with it and I'm not upset whatsoever.  Because Jalen fucking Suggs.  I dont have to watch a long boi who can't shoot at the 3 anymore.
"He isn't, but he apparently did popularize the name. Jalen Suggs is on the record saying that his parents named him after Jalen Rose and there's a few other Jalens in sports who've said the same thing."
&gt;Jalen Suggs had a simple message for the Toronto Raptors and the three other teams drafting atop the 2021 NBA Draft: pass up on me and you'll regret it.
"Jalen suggs is a consensus top 4 and could be a replacement for Lowry so yeah a bit surprising  But Barnes himself is no slouch with a high ceiling as well. It might be not the pick Raptors fans wanted, but it could the picks they will grateful for in the next few years"
We also need a fucking point guard and Jalen Suggs was right fucking there
If you took a shot every time they talked about jalen Suggs playing football you’d be dead right now
You haven't seen Jalen Suggs play basketball?
"""I think that Jalen Suggs' competitiveness reminds me of a young Michael Jordan""  \-Kendrick Perkins, probably"
Suggs much better fitting suit than the other Jalen
RJ Hampton is better than Jalen Suggs
Hell Jalen Suggs is gonna make Orlando fans forget about Markelle Fultz
Guys did you know jalen suggs played football
Suggs lucked out. Florida &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Canada.  Have fun jalen!

JALEN SUGGS LETS GOOOOOOOOOO

He’s not Jalen Suggs
I’m glad something not chalky happened just sucks it had to happen to Jalen Suggs.
"Orlando taking Jalen Suggs is legitimately one of the best picks in a long, long time."
much respect for jalen suggs for clapping for scottie barnes. pure class
I was only prepared for a Jalen Suggs pick... it made too much sense   Now I gotta listen to Kendrick Perkins terrible takes lol shit man i'm salty
No comment. This is gonna be another Marvin Bagley III over Luka Doncic situation with Jalen Suggs becoming really good
Jalen Suggs gonna drop 40 on the Raptors in their first game
Lmao at the idiots who bet Jalen Suggs at 4 @ -200
I think Jalen Suggs is gonna be a huge steal
Jalen Suggs in shambles
Jalen Suggs is gonna score 50 in his first game against us.
Shout out to all those Jalen Suggs threads.
Raptors why no Jalen Suggs :(

Scottie Barnes    Obviously some 2nd rounder is going to crash the party but I think all 10 of those guys are in great places to be high floor high ceiling.
"Idk how anyone can watch Jalen Suggs play basketball, then Scottie Barnes play basketball, and come away thinking Barnes is better.   Dont overthink this cuz of size and wingspan or whatever blog bloy statistic. Pick the guy who plays basketball better. This isnt the olympics."
"Jalen Suggs is good at basketball and I hope, after tonight, he is a Toronto Raptor"
"If the Magic end up with Jalen Suggs at 5, what a plot twist"
"No clue, so I’m just gonna throw this out. Shoutout to anyone from 2026 if you’re reading this.   1) Jalen Green  2) Cade Cunningham  3) Alperen Sengun  4) Davion Mitchell  5) Kai Jones  6) Scottie Barnes  7) Someone from the 2nd round  8) Late 1st rounder  9) Jalen Suggs  10) Undrafted player  This is super random, so I’ll be intrigued to see how this looks in 5 years."
Jalen Suggs too (based on the road tripping podcast)
MVP: Luka  DPOY: Ben Simmons  ROY: Jalen Suggs  MIP: Markelle Fultz
Jalen Suggs will also be the first NFL player from Gonzaga since 1982 by then
"&gt;[Perry was teammates with Scottie Barnes on the gold-winning USA U-19 World Cup team in 2019. That team also featured Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Jalen Suggs and Tyrese Haliburton... but it was Perry that came away with tournament MVP.](https://twitter.com/JLew1050/status/1440347658443374609)  👀"
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."

Jalen Suggs is so good man I might cry that he landed to the Magic man I love 2-way players I’m so happy
"Not NBA, but last March Madness: UCLA vs. Gonzaga.  Johnny Juzang calls his own number, drives the basket and putbacks his own miss to tie the game in OT (UCLA was down 5 with ~30 seconds left), and Jalen Suggs immediately hits a half-court buzzer beater.  Still gives me PTSD as a UCLA fan today."
"Because we are going to start 8-2 and then Jonathan Isaacs leg will be severed, matkelle fulz will tear his Achilles, and Jalen suggs dick will fall off on the court."

"Two points isn’t two points.   Jalen Suggs was the right pick, we overthought it and picked the wrong player in Barnes"
"Wish you had better insights than “hater” but oh well beggars can’t be choosers. Based off of upside alone, (which is not how drafting goes) yes you’re probably taking THT. Still upside wise however you are taking the following over Talen Horton Tucker  Cade, Green, Mobley, Barnes, Suggs, Kuminga, Wagner, Mitchell, Ziare, Bouknight, Giddey, Sengun, Moody, Cam Thomas, Trey Murphy, Jalen Johnson, Keon Johnson, Kai Jones, Shariffe Cooper and maybe even JT Thor. So for THT the highest he gets picked is 20"
"&gt; Is that a comprehensive enough rationale?  Well very little of it is accurate lol. I took most of the following clips from a highlight video because it was quick, but he's also a decent finisher through contact and uses his length well, it's just that stuff doesn't show up on highlights.  &gt; He lacks the frame/physicality to create for himself in the interior.   He's 7 feet tall (6'11.75"" according to himself) with a long wingspan. He's not Giannis thick but he's very large and he moves like a wing not a big.   &gt;  Doesn't really have a post game.  https://streamable.com/rr9k17  https://streamable.com/uvd0gm  https://streamable.com/xtybbh  https://streamable.com/akjhji  https://streamable.com/lyc9hv  &gt; Magic don't really have that elite PG creator to generate easy lob points  We just drafted Jalen Suggs, and we still have Markelle, Cole and RJ. But sure, let's say none of them are capable of collapsing defences and throwing lobs.  &gt; Then his handle isn't really developed yet, so he can't attack from the perimeter even on a closeout  https://streamable.com/qf1aol  https://streamable.com/7ztc4l  https://streamable.com/kddhid  https://streamable.com/kq58ww  https://streamable.com/8y6z1h  https://streamable.com/bq6ufk  https://streamable.com/ruhsfs  https://streamable.com/vcotna  https://streamable.com/r4nk6h  https://streamable.com/k687gr  https://streamable.com/j4jbi5  https://streamable.com/uu1g48  &gt; Then his jump shot is developing, but still inconsistent, so even a two dribble pull up mid range game is something he probably won't be super successful   https://streamable.com/er3ch6  https://streamable.com/cdqdkn  https://streamable.com/fgeh4o  https://streamable.com/e6qlm6  https://streamable.com/8jh51a  https://streamable.com/95gq7j  https://streamable.com/bq6ufk  https://streamable.com/3rw6q8    &gt; Which leaves the three point shooting, which while promising (34% in the season before his injury) isn't something the Magic are going to look to go to super frequently.  Can't argue with the percentage but sure looks confident on trail 3s  https://streamable.com/jqazud  Walk up 3s  https://streamable.com/f5pfng  &gt; So what you're left with in terms of optimal offensive usage is transition and lob plays/finding him open in the interior  You didn't argue against this, but I want to highlight how well he moves in transition for a 7 footer. How many guys this size move like this, in the entire NBA?  https://streamable.com/gaxwqi  https://streamable.com/zcaqtn  https://streamable.com/oo66kr  https://streamable.com/dnlkyi  &gt; all the time he's missed and why he missed it  He sprained his knee, and then tore his ACL. While his injury history is concerning, it's not like he tore his Achilles or has had multiple ACL and MCL tears. He's only 23, plenty of players comeback from ACL tears 100%.  &gt; He has improved year to year in his offense, but I just don't think after seasons of 5, 10, and 12 ppg on 38, 43, then 47% FGs  He's never had the usage or minutes to showcase his offensive game. He was firmly the 5th option in all three years of his career. Part of that was due to having guys in front of him who could handle the ball, part of it is the fact we haven't had a semi decent point guard 2/3 years (Markelle in the 3rd year) and part of it is because he lacks confidence. Before he got hurt and in the Bubble he really turned around his mentality and was aggressive like we hadn't really seen before.  The skill level and the opportunity is there, the main obstacle is mentality. Maybe he has a slow start this year coming off injury, but I think it's ridiculous to say he has no chance of averaging 20 on good efficiency at some point. How many 7 footers can dribble, pull up off the dribble, move like a wing. *No-one can contest his shot*, the sky is the limit for him."
"The team with 3 Hall of Famers on it.  Markelle Fultz, Mo Bamba and Jalen Suggs."
"Raptors fans will downvote this to oblivion, but I think the ideal return for Philly is FVV and OG.  I thought that trade would've made a lot of sense if the Raptors drafted Jalen Suggs though."

Oh of course. But the goal with Scottie should be to become like a Simmons. Ball handling responsibilities and lockdown defense. If that’s Toronto’s plan and they just took him over Jalen Suggs why do you want to bring someone in who’s gonna take that role and never let Scottie have it? It’s more of an offensive concern than a defensive concern.
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
"Zan the man. Never fails. I think Jalen Suggs is a great bet at +650. He might be their best player. If we see a Malcolm Brogdon type winner, I could see it being Duarte or Bones Hyland."
Jalen Suggs.  Scottie Barnes will be better than him.
"If the Kings offer Mitchell, then they’d probably have the better offer, but I’m not sure they want to offer Mitchell. They’ve been raving about him all summer.   I think the Cavs backed off of shopping Sexton after the draft as well. When those rumors came out, there was still speculation that either Jalen Green could drop to number 3 or the Cavs could draft Suggs. Now that the Cavs drafted Mobley, I don’t think that they want to trade for Simmons. A lineup including Simmons, Mobley, and Allen would never work.   If the 76ers do want Sexton, then a 3 team trade with the Wolves and Cavs might be the best bet. The Wolves can get Simmons. The Cavs can get Timberwolves picks and maybe Tyrese Maxey. The 76ers could get Sexton, McDaniels, Beasley, and Rubio."
Surely Masai Ujiri is too clever to pass on Jalen Suggs.

Jalen Suggs uncle is Terrell Suggs who played Linebacker for many years in the NFL.
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun

Why would you pick Jalen Suggs?  He was ranked 11th coming out of high school and was drafted 5th.  His phenomenal season at Gonzaga and the tourney run boosted his stock.  If you're arguing for G-League wouldn't you want to pick anyone who didn't have a breakout season in college?  Going to Gonzaga was almost certainly the best choice he made.  https://247sports.com/player/jalen-suggs-45572569/
"Jalen Green just went #2, made his money, and was STILL talked about more than Suggs, who won a Natty and had major, major moments.     Suggs actually dropped. The G League is a fine option for those who want to be exposed to better talent, higher speeds, and have NBA training."

Jalen Suggs will be better than anyone in this thunder lineup from Day 1 lol.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills...
"He’s right, ridiculous that people are even comparing him to Jalen Suggs."
"Brogdon, Dipo, Warren, Sabonis, Turner with McConnell, Sumner, Holiday, McDermott, Bitazde off the bench should be a solid 4 seed and a hard 2nd round out. Instead we're here. Maybe we'll get Jalen Suggs..."
Lol Jalen suggs over mobley?
"I think the major fall off is after Suggs tbh, he is a solid #4 prospect then there's a drop off.   Kuminga isn't that different from Barnes, Keon Johnson or even Jalen Johnson. They're all athletic wings who can't shoot and don't have a clear path to becoming high-level creators, Kuminga is just the youngest of that group."
Whoever takes Jalen Suggs top 5 is getting fired. Respectfully.
"that’s like asking why Jalen Suggs is mocked ahead of Jalen Johnson. Because he’s the better prospect, but things don’t always turn out as predicted"

Now there a decent chance the dubs are gonna get Jalen Suggs though lol
"Cade/Jalen Green would be PERFECT but they're most likely gone if we don't get a top 3 pick. Mobley/Allen is an awkward fit, I personally think Kuminga still needs a couple years of development given his shooting %, and Suggs would be nice, but there's no way lineups with Garland/Sexton/Suggs at the 1-3 are anything but terrible defensively. Suggs is probably the guy I'd want if not for the first two guys I just mentioned, he'd basically get all the backup PG minutes when either of Sexland sits."
Suggs isn’t even the best jalen in the draft
Nah but my buddy banged Halliburton’s sister who played tennis at Texas Tech with Jalen Suggs’ niece.
"I have to go with both on this one. If they get another #1 pick in the draft and pick Jalen Suggs (hometown hero), hopefully this team will pop off next season"
"2 games into the season (we started 0-2), i was already on the Jalen Suggs tank train lol  Wasn't on Cade cuz we dont win draft lotteries without the NBA helping us (Ewing) lol."
"If we end up with the Minny pick, then we can rectify the mistake pretty easily with a Jalen green, kuminga, or Suggs type player."
"I really do hope this becomes a viable option for high school players, but it definitely isn't good for brand or fame right now. I mix up whoever played for the Ignite this year, but I sure as hell know who Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and Jalen Suggs are."
Jalen Suggs only goes at 2 if the team has a decent big. Like I doubt the wolves or rockets take Mobley.
Hes also 1 month younger then Jalen Suggs btw.
"I agree with you that this year Minnesota's  had some really shit luck that's no one can be blamed for but I think he was asking about the 6 years that Kats been in the league and if I remember there was some unforeseeable injuries and bad luck. But at some point you have to ask is it the players or the coaching or maybe the front office. Sometimes it is systemic and is all of the above and it's just a poorly run franchise.  If I'm a timberwolves fan I'm praying to the lottery god's to give them ping pong balls in the top three because this is a pretty good draft and I think there's a real chance of getting Cade Cunningham, Evan mobley, Jalen suggs, or Jalen Green. And I really do think that any one of those guys on that Timberwolves roster would be a pretty good team. And if it's not a top three pick it's going to Golden State"
Pistons would not take Mobley at 2. Would bet big money on them taking Jalen Green or Suggs at two. They still have a guard problem (SG especially) and aren't as worried about taking a C with Plumlee and Stew locked up.
"I don't get why this is so hard for some fans. Jalen Suggs has a moment that will get replayed forever, gained lots of fans, created a personal brand. Anybody remember any highlights from the G League Ignite team? I don't even think they got on regular tv at all."
"Lots of flawed arguments being thrown around in this thread by OP  1. Comparing the draft placements of Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs is dumb for two reasons. First, the draft hasn't happened and claiming that one player is going to for sure go before the other is just wrong, no matter how you feel about the two prospects. Second, coming out of high school they weren't on the same tier as prospects. From the 247 Composite, Jalen Green was a 0.9998 rated prospect and Suggs was a 0.9968 rated prospect. That may not seem like that big a difference but Green is tied for the 6th highest rated recruit from 2016 to 2020 whereas Suggs wasn't even top 10 in his own class  2. There's no proven track record of either of those leagues producing lottery picks, I think Lamelo's the only one ever. This point should require no further explanation.  3. ""Im not sure why these athletes keep going to college when the G-League and NBL are here."" Because it wasn't all that obvious what the G-League Ignite team would even be and the NBL is thousands of miles away from where most of these prospects live?"
"I wouldn't be too upset if I were a Wolves fan. I mean, they might get Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs after this season. Idk who they move to make the roster work but Cunningham/Suggs with Anthony Edwards, KAT, D'Lo and Beasley is a solid crop of talent and decent assets to assemble a squad.   If this don't work out though, yeah, I'd be fucking pissed."

20% concentrated power of will  5% stars  50% busts  And 100% reason to draft Jalen Suggs
I think that gives us Jalen Suggs in the draft this year too
Looked a lot like the injury Jalen Suggs had for Gonzaga against West Virginia as well. Looked like an Achilles and he came back out after 15 minutes. Not that I’m expecting Donovan back this game but it could be ok
[If only there was a way to confirm this](https://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/news/five-star-jalen-suggs-makes-return-from-football)
Jalen suggs in red would look good tbh
"1. We desperately need a go-to scorer/franchise player type, preferably someone who can play 2/3. It's almost impossible to trade for someone like that as a rebuilding team, so hopefully we can draft Cade/Green/Suggs (in that order).  2. We need a backup forward, ideally one that can shoot and defend. We have the Bulls pick which is looking like it will be somewhere between 5-10. I like Moses Moody here, but wouldn't be too upset with Keon Johnson, Jalen Johnson, James Bouknight or Scottie Barnes (also in that order). A lot of those guys are more 2/3s but we suck so BPA is more important anyways.  I doubt we will make any major signings, but I could see us trade away TRoss at draft time possibly to move up."
What? That doesn't answer my question. Do you think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs right now? Do you think Alen Smailagic is better than Evan Mobley right now? Paul Reed better than Jalen Johnson? Kyle Guy over Davion Mitchell?
I mean this isn't even close to true. You think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham right now? Or Saben Lee is better than Jalen Suggs?
"If we get a Top 4 pick, I'd be ecstatic with any of the top 5 players in this draft (Cade/Mobley/Suggs/Green/Kuminga).  If we end up more in the 6-10 range, I like Scottie Barnes, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody or even Jalen Johnson.  I like Kai Jones and Usman Garuba as projects, but I'd only take them if we're trading down into the 11-20 range."
"Anyone from Minny can tell you that basketball is far more popular up there than people like to believe. Jalen Suggs, Chet, Tyus and Tre Jones are all guys who grew up and played basketball in Minnesota. Our commentators always say that Minnesota has the capability to become a basketball city it’s just that the Wolves haven’t exactly given them much to cheer for these past 20 or so years lol."
"Giddey is the only rook who I've seen way overpraised. Not that he's been garbage, but even his hot start in October he was putting up 11/6/6 on shit efficiency in 30 minutes a game on a losing team. And you'd still see his statline with 1k on the frontpage. Maybe a little too much Sengun buzz but he's been pretty solid.  Cade, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs are struggling on brutal teams and if anything we should be talking more about how well Mobley and Barnes are playing."
Scottie Barnes 🤝 Jalen Suggs  Shitty thumb injuries in their rookie season
"Unfortunately, Griffin is having an atrocious season.  The people in the league who are having a season like his are Bazley, Killian Hayes, Avery Bradley, Jalen Suggs, Porter Jr., and Jalen Green.  I mean, Theis lost his job with the Rockets who don't seem to be trying to win much and he's probably been slightly better than Griffin.  Despite winning, the Nets might have even been better without Griffin's minutes."
Damn embiid really had to hurt Jalen suggs to secure the W
"It is not shit at all, the only other pointguards worst than Russ in the league are:  - Kemba (no more a starting pg) - Jalen Green - Jalen  Suggs - Cade  - Graham - Monte Morris - Reggie Jackson - Aaron Holiday  That's it. You could argue about Dennis Scrotum also been worst than Russ, but at least he seems more adaptable. And also Lowry is playing bad for now. Anyway if Russ isn't in the worst 10 PG is for sure below average (aka been worst 15).   And that's a fact, if you are dumb I cannot do anything about that."
Just a reminder Jalen Suggs is a bust and Dalano Banton is better
its bizarre how much real estate jalen suggs has in some of your heads
I did not expect Ayo (a 2nd round pick) to contribute meaningful minutes in our rotation. I expected more from Jalen Suggs on the Magic.
Jalen Suggs but it was kind of expected since Orlando kinda ruin almost every young guy they get
"Raptors drafting Scottie Barnes instead of Jalen Suggs. The media and a lot of fans were questioning the Raptors choice and it looks like they picked the right player. Scottie has cooled down a bit with Siakam and others coming back, but his stats are a bit better than Suggs so far, averaging 14.8/8.4/3.3. Suggs is averaging 12.1/3.4/3.6."
"I claimed the warriors should’ve traded up to take Scottie Barnes, and that he should’ve been taken 4th by the raptors over Jalen Suggs. I got absolutely flamed for it due to him being “offensively inept”, but look where we are now haha"
"Trae Young's impact would not go down due to the new officiating roles.  Brandon Ingram won't be a winning player without Zion.   Evan Mobley will be the best looking rookie (defense gives him the edge over Barnes)  Golden State will look like a championship team.  Now, ask for my pre-season thoughts on Kevin Porter Jr. and Jalen Suggs if you want some wrong thoughts."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
Hopefully Jalen Suggs and Chet Holmgren make a splash in the NBA.
"Minnesota is so starved for any sort of sporting success that we’ll cheer for just about anything. But also HS Basketball is huge in Minnesota, Gary Trent Jr, Paige Bueckers, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren, Tyus and Tre Jones, even Amir Coffey and JP Macura. MN HS hoops is just exciting to watch."

"Agreed. Even though Cade, Jalen, and Suggs have shot like shit so far they've still showed a ton of flashes and promising signs."
I think Jalen Suggs will be at least as good as George Hill and definitely not better than Chauncey Billups.
"Seen this a couple times, just realized that jalen green, jalen suggs, and scottie barnes are there in the background watching haha"
"His TS% was subpar in two out of his three college seasons and didn't get good until he was older than the rest of his competition, he should not be expected to be an efficient offensive player in the NBA.  But a ton of rookies basically do nada to start their careers.  Of course, most don't amount to that much, but it is hardly unusual for a rookie to have bad efficiency.  Among other lotto picks, Suggs, Kuminga, Ziaire Williams, Moody, Jalen Green all have bad TS% as well and Primo hasn't even gotten playing time."
Jonathan Isaac  Cole Anthony   Franz Wagner  Wendell Carter Jr  Jalen Suggs  Markelle Fultz  Mo Bamba  Chuma Okeke

Jalen Suggs will soon be considered the best player in the 2021 draft. He will lead the Magic to the postseason in a few years and eventually be one of the best PGs in the league

"[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA\_2022\_advanced.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_advanced.html)  Jalen Suggs, -8.4..."
Jalen Suggs saying bad MF on live tv was the play of the game
Cowards took forever to put this up.  Suggs was the MVP.  Best defensive player in the draft named Jalen Suggs.  Also when will the Knicks learn that they can't beat Magicians. Abra Kadabra motherfuckers
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
"Whoever said that was an idiot. It was pretty clear to tell that Harden had an elite ability to draw fouls, and most NBA players who come in and contribute positively on day 1 end up being very good players. It's not comparable to the Jalen Suggs or Cade situation, someone like them is playing significantly worse than Harden did his rookie year."
How’s the biggest bust of all time relevant to Jalen Suggs
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23. Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"I checked - in terms of talent potential most definitely. I went back to the 80s and couldn't find another team even close to that prospect level - I mean they had all 5 top 5 players from the draft playing in it and they never came close to that before.  They did have Steph, PatBev, DeAndre Jordan, and Beasley in 2007. And Seth, Klay, and Hayward in 2009. But if Mobley, Haliburton, and Barnes continue their trajectory and even 1 of Cade, Jalen Green, or Suggs turn into a superstar then this is definitely goat U19 squad by future talent."

So ... was Jalen Suggs just not NBA ready yet?
Jalen Suggs
"&gt; and his statistics.  Jalen Suggs is dead last in FG%, BPM, DBPM, VORP...what statistics are you referencing that show he should be higher on the list?  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_advanced.html"
"I remember getting 2k22, opening a myteam pack, seeing jalen suggs, and thinking ""well he can sugg my nuts"" and then next pack is miami Lebron. A worthy sugging"
"I think it’s weird that two Jalen Suggs posts have been posted in the past 3 hours, both talking about the same thing."
"Just to add some more stuff:   [CBS Draft Coverage Reports Jalen Suggs did not ""blow away"" the Raptors with his interview and workout](https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/ouckzx/cbs_draft_coverage_reports_jalen_suggs_did_not/)  [Kevin O'Connor just confirmed that OKC would've taken Barnes at 4 if they traded up. Assuming Magic weren't trading up from 5 to 4 (because why would you), Raptors had to stay at 4 to take Barnes, If he was your guy, this was your only chance to get him.](https://twitter.com/raptorsrapture/status/1421120801030524935?s=21)  [Wolstat: Brian Windhorst said on his podcast word was Suggs had a bad workout with the Raptors. A source with no affiliation with Raptors told me they’d heard the same. ](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ousm6b/wolstat_brian_windhorst_said_on_his_podcast_word/)  So a few different sources indicating a bad workout. Not sure if it was as bad as this person on r/torontoraptors indicated but the bad workout thing has some merit to it."
"Jalen ""Jordan Poole"" Suggs  He'll be fine."
"Vecenie didn't even have him top 10 pre-college, we're not talking about pre-college, we're talking about during the college season  &gt; Even during the college season that was the idea  Not really, a lot of people bumped him up to #2 during the college season and then dropped him again to #4 after it ended. Some even had him flirting with #1  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10000840-2021-nba-draft-rumors-gm-would-consider-jalen-suggs-for-no-1-overall-pick  You act like it was so much more clear when it wasn't. Wasserman had him as #2 on his BB last April. That's just hindsight to say he was a clear 4 all year  Green/Mobley didn't slip but most had Suggs in the same tier as them"
"Damn, Jalen kinda Suggs huh"
"I personally had Barnes in the next tier down with Moody, Jalen Johnson, Springer, Keon, Sengun, and Wagner.  I thought he was clearly one of the best and most versatile defenders in the draft and had clear elite athleticism, but his lack of a J in college and not having the latitude to be a point forward in the NBA opened up a ton of massive question marks for me.  His multidimensionality in the NBA has been the most surprising thing for me, and I did not think he'd be as good of a scorer as he has been.  Though I'm always curious on how much the summer development played in that considering the Raps have one of the best development teams in the NBA. Like, if they drafted Suggs instead would we be talking this way about Suggs while Barnes struggles on the Magic because playing under the Raps org seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy?"
"&gt;just enjoy your rookie and leave us alone  Well you said that to me, and I have openly stated multiple times that I don’t think Raptors fans should care about Jalen Suggs.   Just pointed out that all these Boston fans saying “lol Toronto fans” did the same shit a few years ago. Happens almost every year, especially when there’s trades at the top of the draft."
I can't see the magic stunting jalen suggs growth like that
Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
Jalen has the ability to lead the league in scoring at some point. Cade has shown some great flashes even though it’s been rocky so far. Suggs… I dunno.
Its early but I truly believe Mobley and Scottie are gonna be the two generational players of this draft. Jalen Green will be nasty too but Cade and Suggs won't be much more than fringe/low level all star guys.. this might be the best class in the past 5 years
Have been watching a lot of Magic games this season - Mo Bamba is looking real nice and so does Franz Wagner. It will be only a matter of time before Jalen Suggs gets it together and the Magic will look really dangerous. I admire Mosley prioritizing letting the young players have as much playing time as possible over the vets.
Jalen Suggs?
"He sounds like Jalen Suggs. Really good at the line, but his FG's just aren't dropping yet."
That is one player he can't be wrong on apparently.  Bamba has easily been the worse member of our starting 5 and that's with Jalen Suggs shooting like 30 percent from the field.
"Well I traded Tatum who was destroying my FG% for AD. My complete team is LeBron, AD, Ja, Kyrie, Rob Williams, Jalen Suggs, Pat Mills, Joe Harris, Nerlens Noel, Mobley, and DeAndre Hunter"
"Jalen Suggs is shooting poorly, but the defensive analytics love him so far. Both will be fine."
Jalen Suggs is Reggie Jackson with a fade.
If I had to pick one Jalen Suggs. Had a horrible start to his career in shooting and he doesn't have Cade's (albeit overrated) size to fall back on.
Jalen Green not Suggs lol
That was Jalen Suggs sister. His family was at the game.
Also does anybody have more rim outs than Jalen Suggs. Every jumper he takes looks like it's going in then it rims out.  Also shout out to coach Mosely.  He finally shortened the rotation and played the starters more.  Our starting 5 is legit for the most part.
Minnesota's own Jalen Suggs boutta go off now.
"KPJ gives him a run for his money  12/5/4 on 40/36/61 shooting splits and leading the league in turnovers.  A:TO under 1  I know PER isn't the end all be all of stats and is biased towards certain players and playstyles but KPJ has a whopping 8.5 PER.   among shooting guards thats like the third worst mark in the league.  PER hates inefficient shooters and turnovers more than anything.   only jalen suggs and trey murphy have worse PER at shooting guard, two rookies  if you asked me which porter jr. I'd want on my team I'd take MPJ over KPJ without even thinking twice"
"Jonathan Isaac, Cole Anthony, Jalen Suggs, Chuma Okeke, Wendell Carter Jr"
"Jalen ""unanimous 4th pick"" Suggs last night: 10/5/6 and 2 turnovers on 3-13 and 0-4 from three  Better than Dalano Banton??????"
"Suggs has been one of the best guard defenders in the league by most metrics, and overall positive despite how poorly he's been shooting to start his career.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Jalen%20Suggs&amp;season=2022"
"I meant more in terms of pre draft the consensus for the top 4 were Suggs, Mobley, Cade, and Jalen Green. Scottie Barnes then came into the picture in the last month or so but even then most pre-draft had the 4 I mentioned be drafted 1-4."
"The most important thing is watching him, his tendencies, and the little things he is able to do. If those are all good, and his shot eventually falls into what it has been his whole career, he'll be fine. Same with Jalen Suggs."

That Jalen Suggs block on OG... A chunk of my soul left my body. Nice play rook...*kicks cat
"I’m fully on the “compete and build good winning habits and see what happens” rather than the “lets not try to win for 3 years and hope and pray we get a high pick” Magic have solid pieces, I really like Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony"
Markelle Fultz   Cole Anthony   RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke  Jonathan Isaac  Wendell Carter Jr   Mo Bamba  is a solid core plus a top 5 pick hopefully added
"Genuinely curious, is Jalen Suggs a candidate for ROY?"
"Suggs was great this game, he had to force alot of late shot clock shots also since, when the play is falling they just throw it to Jalen so he FG% should be higher but this draft is so far legendary every team looks satisfied with their picks or at least happy. Clearly some might want somebody else but they are ok with what they got and thats for most teams, even players late in the draft are showing up and being positives for their teams. I feel years later this will be one we would still be talking about and telling our kids."
"Well, jalen Suggs was supposed  to go 4th, but u know how it went"
https://www.google.com/amp/s/ahnfiredigital.com/nba/raptors/report-jalen-suggs-had-a-bad-workout-with-toronto-raptors/amp/
"Scottie Barnes -13 and Jalen Suggs +7. Sorry Raps fans, but this debate is settled."
"Jalen Suggs is a demon in the clutch, that kid is special man. Wagner hooping too, my fuckin heart is still pumping. These Scottie games are starting to feel normal which is crazy. Back to .500 lets go!"
"Raptors fans better not say a fucking WORD about Gary Trent Jr, Cole Anthony or Jalen Suggs after this game lmao."
"Turns out Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs are both good basketball players, who knew?"
"Great showing from both Suggs and Scottie, there will be no shitting on Jalen this game *Raptors Fans*"
"""jalen suggs is better than scottie"""
Post the Jalen Suggs buckets too
JALEN FUCKING SUGGS
Anyone want to call dibs on making the “Scottie Barnes/Jalen Suggs tonight” posts?
"How do you preview the Raptors vs Magic game without talking about Scotties Barnes vs Jalen Suggs? This will get people talking for sure.  I'm just teasing btw, thanks for the post.    &gt; The Clippers have won their last 7 against Portland  I had no idea. Sometimes you just don't matchup well I guess."
"He literaly just turned 20 2 months ago. He’s younger then Jalen Suggs and Evan Mobley. No, it is not"
"This draft is supposed to be so so so much better than 2020 draft but is it? Seems like most the prospects have many of the same warts. Jalen Suggs better then Anthony Edwards? Maybe but hes got to shoot better on the three.   It all comes down to effort from the newbies. Michael Jordan knew he had to have more muscle and be more physical so he worked his butt off and became the best basketball player ever.  Attitude, do these guys have it and how can a scout measure it?   I like Anthony Edwards and he has star potential and a physical presence."
"&gt;	trying to remember the name  Johnson? Springer? Suggs? Green? Shit Masai, which jalen/jaden did we want?"
"Mainly would be about that draft pick.  Jalen Suggs, Kuminga, one of those guys."
Sucks for Suggs  Lowly for Mobley Failin for Jalen Fade for Cade
Travesty that jalen suggs' shot vs UCLA wasnt in a full stadium of fans
Mobley and Suggs are also both overrated  Jalen green is better than both of them
"1. Washington - Cade Cunningham, PG, OKlahoma St.   2. Magic - Jalen Green, G, G League  3. Raptors - Jalen Suggs, G, Gonzaga  4. Sacramento - Evan Mobley, C, USC  5.

If they can hop into the top 2 during the lottery to get Jalen Suggs I’ll trade them both Lavine and Vucevic for the pick and either Klay or Wiggins/Looney as the contract fillers.
John Wall and Jalen Suggs gonna be a duo
jalen suggs type shit
Thats called the Jalen Suggs shot now
Clearly we need to tank hard enough to get Jalen Suggs to hit those clutch shots.    Oh baby.
"2008, non NBA is now Jalen Suggs"
And Jalen Suggs’ shot was in honor of Adam Morrison
"Who cares, did you see that jalen Suggs shot tho"
This loss is in honor of Jalen Suggs
"2nd, behind Jalen Suggs."
"&gt;If you ask me Jalen Suggs has some serious potential to be a generational PG, I think he can be a better version of Chris Paul with extra height and athleticism.    0/10 troll"
I’m way more high on Jalen Green than on Suggs
"For sure. I hope we can tank hard enough to get him. He would be perfect next to Patrick Williams.  Alternatively, I'd float a Lavine + Vucevic for Jalen Suggs pick + Bad Contract package to teams on draft night, especially if a team like the Warriors moves up in the lottery."
Jalen Suggs is Culver 2.0
Jalen Suggs is an overglorified Josh Hart
Jalen Suggs is projected to be a high draft pick for an NBA franchise as a part of the 2021 NBA draft
Sucks to lose like that but man Jalen Suggs is the real deal
Sorry guys I was too busy watching future Magic guard Jalen Suggs hit the game winner.  Still better than the Warriors.
Jalen Suggs: Future Orlando Magic
Magic could use Jalen Suggs
jalen suggs wtf!
don’t care did you just see that Jalen Suggs shot
"We will end up winning too much, but if we got Cade and Jalen Green/Suggs this sub would break lol"
He won’t be on the team  It will be someone like Bazemore or if we are lucky Jalen Green/Suggs splitting that time with Klay early on
Never heard of Jalen Suggs.
This morning a Utah sports talk show said Jalen Suggs would be the best player to ever come out of Gonzaga. I lost my shit driving 80 miles an hour
"Jalen Suggs will be the best player out of this draft.  His athleticism combined with his IQ and defensive ability will make him an instant impact player.  We will not need to wait for him to develop.  He's 6'4, is faster and more athletic than a lot of NBA guards.  His IQ is going to set him apart though.  Jalen green is a great prospect too but I think Suggs' game will have more of an overall impact to winning.  I could see Jalen Green averaging 20 on a bad team for 5 years."
"Anthony Davis and jalen Suggs aren’t even close to comparable prospects, stop this."
"Better prospect would be Jalen Green. But I think it would really come down to who was picking at 2 or 3. A team like Minnesota might like the idea of Suggs more as they already have their superstar, and these two aren't far enough apart to justify the best pick available. A team like Detroit or Houston should probably take a gamble on Green."
"I’d take Suggs anyday, I don’t think that Jalen Green has “the It factor”"
"I'm considering framing Jalen Suggs for a crime so he falls in the draft, but revealing it was me all along right before the Knicks pick"
Jalen Suggs hopefully
"Pistons with Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Saben Lee, Killian Hayes, and one of Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Evan Mobley is a budding dynasty"

"I know I’m going to miss Steph when he’s gone, but for me personally I would rather have another year of mediocrity and then a bother decade of success. It’s because Jalen Suggs has the potential to be another Steph, him and Wiseman could become Koby and Shaq in the next three years. I don’t know about you, but to me that sounds really cool and exciting"
Jalen Suggs
"Yes, but I’m more wondering who in your opinion, in an ideal world falls to them. I’m not saying Jalen Suggs will fall to them, but I’m an ideal world for me he falls to them"
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."
"I mean Gonzaga has 3 players on the tankathon big board this year. Jalen Suggs (2), Corey kispert (8), and Joel ayayi (31). They’ll probably make NBA rosters. And I’d be willing to bet money on at least one other player currently on that team going in the first round either next year or the year after."
"team was 6-2 and had one the best record in the league with Fultz. Yes thats not many games but it looked very promising. We dont even have JI who is a premier defender in the league. We HAVE to flip Gordon and Evan together for something substantial.   We are actually in a great spot to get a top 3 pick which is either Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Evan Mobley. All 4 I think are gonna be good. Cades 99% going 1st so hypothetically lets say we get Suggs or Green to fill that SG spot our team looks like this  1. Fultz 2. Green/Suggs OR a guy that can be packaged with Gordon and Fournier. Oladipo again? 3. Okeke (Can put your top 3 pick here too if you move those guys for a SG..Either way the SG and SF could be interchangeable) 4. Isaac 5. Vooch  Bench: Cole, Bamba, Ross, Birch, Bacon  Thats a top 5 seed in the East"
"We have moved in that direction and are going to again in the draft. Our guards will be Fultz, Cole. Jalen Green / Jalen Suggs, and Ross. Thats a really solid backcourt"
"Suggs too. Along with the guys you mentioned are seen as ""can't miss"" guys. Kuminga has lost a little shine recently, he struggled shooting in the bubble, but he will probably put up a strong showing in pre-draft combine/workouts. I'd be surprised if any of the guys in the Scottie Barnes, Moses Moody, Jalen Johnson tier jumped him."
"Suggs is in play top 5 two, and there are a couple more really good prospects in Jalen Johnson and Scottie Barnes, so things don't hit a sharp drop off until after the top 7 (in my opinion, obviously)."
"Cade, Suggs, Jalen Green, Kuminga, Mobley all look like studs. Those top 5 really shine.  I'm pretty high on a lot of other players in this draft too like the duo from Tennessee, Kispert (great shot and athleticism), Wagner (6'8 220 SG w/ a great shot), and Barnes (6'9 225 SF but raw)"
"With these new lotto odds I feel like you might as well try to win and hope to jump into the top 4 .    According to 538, you guys are projected to end up with the 7th worst record with the roster as-is,  that gives you a 32% chance at getting a top 4 pick.  I.e. Cade, Jalen green, Suggs, Kuminga or Evan Mobley   The incentive to bottom out isn't there anymore , you just need a little lottery luck"

"Keep your head up. NCAA tournament starts Thursday, watch Cunningham, Jalen Suggs and Evan Mobley. If shit goes according to plan one of those guys will be putting on a Rockets hat in June"
"I just wanna know whether T'Wolves are gonna keep a Top 3 pick or the Warriors about to get even more stacked next year with Klay back and one of Jalen Green, Jonathan Kuminga, or Jalen Suggs joining them."
KPJ + Wood + Top 5 pick this year is a pretty great young group. Tate and KMJ are pretty nice too. Suggs or Cade would be great on this team.    Off topic but does KPJ look exactly like Jalen Green to anyone else?
"As a USC fan, I'm not particularly thrilled with Mobley's NBA prospects, especially as a top 3 pick. He's a great defender but offensively he floats in and out of games too much, and has very few counter moves. I see him closer to a Clint Capela type of player than a Giannis type. He'll be a good role player but I don't see him as some kind of franchise altering guy. I'd rather have Wiseman tbh. If we get the pick this year I want Kuminga or Jalen Suggs"
"Cant wait for Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Jalen Johnson to all enter the league next season."
"We need to get rid of guys that just make our team slightly better. Vooch is a guy that makes your team A LOT better. I understand he might have the most value but there are different avenues to get a franchise guy without giving up one.  So with Gordon, Evan, and  Bamba, I'd be perfectly fine going out and getting picks or trying to get a guy like Lavine. Magic are just missing one franchise player to compliment the rest of the team and we need to acquire that through a big trade or picks.  Hypothetically if we could get a guy like Lavine with those 3 (and probably a future 1st/2nd) its even better if you can get Lavine with those guys AND tank for a top 3. Now hypothetically your starters are:  Fultz  Lavine  Cade/Jalen Green / Jalen Suggs (top 3 pick)  Johnathan Isaac  Vooch  With Okeke, Cole Anthony, Bacon, Birch, Ross and whoever else on the bench. Thats a very sneaky good squad"
"And also hoping for the 4th pick to fall to them from Minnesota.      Jalen Green, Jonathan Kuminga, or Jalen Suggs come to the Bay."
Jalen Suggs!!!!! I love this kid so much
Jalen Suggs
"Kris Humphries was the only top 20 prospect from Minnesota for a looong time.  But since 2014, we've got:  2014 - Tyus Jones  2018 - Tre Jones  2019 - Matthew Hurt (turns out he sucks though)  2020 - Jalen Suggs  2021 - Chet Holmgren  2023 - Tasion Chatman  Then throw in some others who didn't quite crack the top 20 - Gary Trent Jr, Amir Coffey and Daniel Oturu (both on the Clippers), Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) and Tyrell Terry all in that same time frame .    MN hoops is up and coming"
"If you just dropped that guy into this years draft he’d probably go after Jalen Green lol   Jalen Green is younger, a better shooter, and played against pros. Same size, also a crazy athlete.   Jordan wasn’t the best NCAA player ever, unless his impact was just missed by metrics that weren’t available back then. He wouldn’t go above Cade or Green, would probably be in the convo with Suggs and Kuminga"
"A nickname he has had since HS and also a group of kids in that consisted of him, Jalen Suggs, James Wiseman, Zion Harmon, RJ Hampton, Vernon Carey, etc"
"If they get no 4 then fuck, the wolves truly are cursed. They would get one of Suggs, kuminga, Mobley, Jalen green. All fantastic prospects"
"Yes, im all for Minnesota stuff .  Sucks we are garbage but the overall MN basketball scene is up and coming.  Tyus Jones, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen suggs , Chet holmgren , Taison Chatman (top 20 in the class of 2023) all come from the twin cities.   Its nice to see since Kris Humphries was the last ""big thing"" to come from MN before Tyus, and he graduated high school in 2003"
Man if we draft Jalen Suggs and Ziaire Williams we're set for the post Curry/Klay/Draymond era
Hey Haley! I wanted to know your comp for Jalen Suggs?
Ngl I like Jalen Suggs game more than Cade’s
"If it's the 4th that's a massive dub for warriors, one of Jalen Suggs, Jonathan Kaminga and Evan Mobley will be left and they are all great"
We'll use minny pick to draft minny's own talent Jalen Suggs babyyyyy
Nah we want Jalen Suggs
"Warriors getting 1 of the following then:  Jalen Green, Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Suggs, Zaire Williams.   Unless the basketball Gods save the league from a Steph-Klay-Wiggins-Draymond-Wiseman with Green off the bench.  And let the T'Wolves select Cade or Mobley."
Recruiting services have him leaning Gonzaga and his HS teammate Jalen Suggs is doing a one-and-done year there and killing it. He’s probably ending up there.

"Cade and Mobley are off the table so choices are at this rate could be Suggs, Kuminga, Jalen Green etc. If the Wolves get the top pick this year and they suck the ff season, we have the chance to get ourselves Holmgren/Bates"
"I agree. But giving up a very lightly protected pick when you're not actually competing for anything meaningful for a player who, frankly, isn't that positive of a player...that's almost always a bad decision.   He had one season of kinda-sorta giving a little bit of effort on defense in '18-'19, but then immediately regressed back to being an atrocious defender in Golden State (a trend that has continued in Minnesota).   Moving off a guy who isn't working out is fine. If you're going to attach a pick to that guy, you better be damn sure it's not a franchise-altering player. And right now, it looks like there's a damn good chance you're giving up Jalen Suggs."
"Still flabbergasting how a 5-consecutive finals team can get back-to-back Top 5 draft picks.  And the 2021 Draft is deep as hell. Cade, Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Zaire, Scottie, etc."
Jalen Green is the better play but not by much. I'd take both of them over Suggs though.

"Spurs best suited to trade LMA to a contender and go all-in on the youth and rebuild movement. Get another lottery piece to go along with White-Dejounte-Lonnie-Devin-Keldon. Maybe a Jalen Green if lucky, Jalen Suggs, Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, or Zaire Williams.  Mavs need to get healthy and stay healthy, but they may still be missing a piece or two.  Rockets - very impressive post-Harden era and they haven't fully gelled yet. Wall-Dipo-Gordon-Woods-Tucker-Cousins-House-Nwaba is a solid rotation."
"A young core of KPJ, Jalen Green/Suggs and Mobley would be phenomenal"
Raptors don’t need a PG since they will be getting Jalen Suggs
"if lowry stays, suggs can play backup  if he goes, fuck it start jalen for development lmao"
"Nah this draft real deep   They could get Suggs, Jalen Johnson, Kuminga, all very high upside   Idk shit about Scottie Barnes who they are projected tho lol"
"Knicks were projected #1 to get Zion but we feel to #3 and more than thrilled with RJ Barrett.  Now Kuminga who's likely at #5 isn't really a consolation here but who knows?  Maybe Cavs psych themselves out of 3 because it'll be between guards Jalen Green and Suggs, and trade down to round out their roster.  Who knows?"
Yeah I think this will be his likely landing spot. I hate that Love contract but getting Jalen Suggs is well worth it.  Does Love have anything left in the tank?
hes gonna take time and mentor Jalen Green or Suggs
Jalen Suggs and Nick Nurse is the perfect marriage.
 hope  the raps get jalen green or suggs those boys are box office
"Raptors driving Kyle Lowry to the airport ASAP, Jalen Suggs/Van YEET backcourt"
Jalen Suggs here we come!
If Jalen Suggs slips to 4 to Raptors...wow
Jalen Suggs is a pg tho and they have fvv already
Need me some Jalen Suggs
"If I’m Jalen Suggs, I’m getting arrested ASAP so I could drop in the draft in hopes Cleveland doesn’t draft me. They’ll turn that kid into George Hill 2.0."
Jalen Suggs
I’m guessing it’ll be 1. Cade 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Evan Mobley 4. Jalen Green. Maybe flip the Jalens
"I am so fucking happy. We're getting one of Suggs, Jalen or Mobley. Maybe we move up by a trade or something but that was epic."
Raptors gonna pick Jalen Suggs if Mobley/Cade/Green off the board?
Cavs in a weird spot with Jalen Green or Suggs the most likely picks with 2 small guards already on the team
Jalen Suggs and KPJ is a crazy backcourt.
LET'S GO JALEN SUGGS
Jalen Suggs
guys at the very least we got jalen suggs. at the very most we get cade. win win
top 5 draft picks according to nbadraft.net:      1	 *Houston	Cade Cunningham	6-8	220	PG/SG	Oklahoma State	Fr.     2	 *Detroit	Evan Mobley	7-0	215	PF/C	USC	Fr.     3	 Orlando	Jalen Green	6-6	180	SG	G-League	Fr.     4	 *Oklahoma Cty	Jalen Suggs	6-4	205	PG	Gonzaga	Fr.     5	 Cleveland	Jonathan Kuminga	6-6
Depends what team but I think jalen green or jalen Suggs
Bring my St Paul boy Jalen Suggs home
"that fucking shot by Jalen Suggs, oh my god it's still so good"
No Jalen Suggs though?
ppl really thought suggs should go 1 over cade at one point lmao he’s not even the best jalen in this class
"I mean shai is already all star caliber and hes 22. You basically assume that cade will be their best player eventually. Then you get to choose one of jalen green, kuminga, mobley, suggs. On top of any potential trio with shai, cade, and one of the four. They have 2-3 first round picks in every draft from now till 2026, which they can eventually package for whoever they want if their trio pans out. I'd say they are in a far better position than the sixers if they get 1 and 5 tonight."
So OKC (college) and Cade Cunningham Timberwolves (hometown) and Jalen Suggs Timberwolves are selling Timberwolves have a young upcoming roster I think Timberwolves get the second or third pick is the rigged  Warriors/Kings get Jalen Green

In no way would I be in favor of trading the rights to Jalen Green or Jalen Suggs for Ben Simmons.
"what i’ve been seeing is cade is almost always 1, jalen is somewhere 2-4, mobley is 2 or 3, and suggs is 3 or 4"
I’d love to see Jalen Suggs go to Minnesota and team up with Anthony Edwards! Potentially the most athletic backcourt in the league
"Tankathon Sim, top 20 mock  * 1: Orlando (+2) - Cade Cunningham  * 2: OKC (+2) - Evan Mobley  * 3: Cleveland (+2) - Jalen Green  * 4: GSW (via MIN) (+2) - Jalen Suggs  * 5: OKC (via HOU) (-4) - Jon Kuminga  * 6: Detroit (-4) - Scottie Barnes  * 7: Toronto - Keon Johnson  * 8: Orlando (via CHI) - Davion Mitchell  * 9: Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  * 10: New Orleans - Moses Moody  * 11: Charlotte - Franz Wagner  * 12: San Antonio - Alperen Sengun  * 13: Indiana - Corey Kispert  * 14: GSW - Jared Butler  * 15: Washington - Josh Giddey  * 16: OKC (via BOS) - James Bouknight  * 17: Memphis - Kai Jones  * 18: Houston (via MIA) - Ziaire Williams  * 19: New York - Jaden Springer  * 20: Atlanta - Ayo Dosunmu"
"[Most recent mock](https://fanspo.com/nba/s/celtics/mock-drafts/Pp9gtIeVLW_mo8/suggs-2). I definitely let Jalen Johnson slide too far- I’ve read about possible character issues and I don’t love his game, but his ceiling’s probably too high for him to escape the lottery undrafted."
"Wolves.  Now if the Wolves get the #3 pick, Rubio + Beasley + Jalen Suggs is something I think the Wolves consider for Simmons + pick 28"
"Right now I’m curious if the Magic will be the team that helps the Knicks move up, and if there’s the potential for any player trades if y’all end up with Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs.  Outside of that there are times where I legit forget that Miami isn’t the only team in Florida."
Haha yea the Amount of Js has been a meme on the wolves sub. If we get Jalen Suggs/Green it would be hilarious.
Whoever’s left of Mobley/Green/Suggs in that order at 4  16 if Giddey is there I’d take him for sure. I also like Garuba or if Jalen Johnson settles into this range  18 whoever’s left of Garuba/Jalen/Giddy if they’re available
He's a streaky shooter.  Here's my quick big board  1. Cade  2. Green  3. Suggs  4. Mobley  5. Kuminga  6. Keon Johnson  7. Scottie Barnes  8. Josh Giddey  9. Jalen Johnson  10. Alpern Sengun
"I think he's a good prospect, but a tad overrated. His ceiling is a tad bit higher than Wiseman imo.  If I was the warriors, I would take Cade, Jalen Green, and Jalen Suggs over Mobley."
"Detroit quietly had a very good draft. If they can somehow get Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, or even Cade Cunningham in this draft, they’re set up for a bright future!"
I think they do that trade. They get a legit shot at Jalen Suggs who I think contributes Day 1 plus bench help in Beasley. You bring Rubio off the bench. They have a strong starting lineup where they can start a rookie.The return is the #3 pick lol
1. Jalen Green 2. Jalen Suggs 3. Cade Cunningham 4. Alperen Sengun  5. Sharife Cooper 6. James Bouknight 7. Corey Kispert 8. Evan Mobley 9. Keon Johnson 10. Cameron Thomas  Not my top 10 big board. Just going based off how previous drafts have shaken up.

At this point it seems either Scottie Barnes and Jalen Suggs. There is a bunch of information flying around team executives right now that Suggs' workout with the Raptors did not go very well.

Hey Jake! There were reports saying that the Raptors were likely selected Jalen Suggs. Any truth to this?
[iamnotsandoz] League sources view Jalen Suggs as “essential lock” to Toronto at No. 4.
Star: Jalen Suggs   Bust: Scottie Barnes   Steal: Ayo Dosunmu
I see the top-8 playing out as:  1. Cade 2. Jalen 3. Evan 4. Suggs 5. Barnes 6. Bouknight 7. Kuminga 8. Moody

"Jalen Suggs, welcome to Detroit"
"lmao philly will blow their chances of ever getting rid of ben with these dumbass offers      you'd have to be an idiot to trade SexLand + Mobley for Ben Simmons or the Raptors one which was OG, FVV, and Jalen Suggs for Ben Simmons"
[Woj] Raptors have been reported glancing in Jalen Suggs general direction
This is Jalen Green not Jalen Suggs lol
[Woj] Raptors have a heat seeking missile pointed at Jalen Suggs
Anyone not named Jalen Suggs
JESUS FORGIVES YOU  ... With the fourth pick Toronto is proud to select Jalen Suggs of Gonzaga.
Yea if 76ers said Jalen Suggs for Simmons straight up that trade still gets rejected
Jalen Suggs will be in the Barclays Center so don't worry about it. if a section of the roof falls on his head or something then they'll most likely put the draft on hold to sort out the situation. after that they'll probably pick someone else. but that's just my take on the situation. what did you think would happen
When all and said done Ben will be stick sulking around as more Philly fans turn on him and the boos grow louder on him after each home game. These stupid offers they are coming up with will only scare off any suitors for Ben.      Like if I'm Toronto I'd reject it even it was just Jalen Suggs for Ben Simmons straight up
"&gt; Cam basically does everything Bouknight does but worse lol.  Cam has the Same efficiency, Better FT rate, better at getting to the FT line, lower turnover rate, better PNR efficiency, higher % of shots on the pullup, better effeciency  The only thing Bouknight has on him is 3p% which is within 2% on small sample size.  &gt;Bouknight is just better and more advanced in terms of dribbling  I can see an argument that you think Bouk is going to be scale better as a scorer, but one thing you literally cant argue is that Cam Thomas has a superior handle.  &gt;while Bouknight arguably the best guard in the draft at that save JG.  I don't see it, nevermind being better than Jalen Suggs"
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can’t take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that’s better than all those all stars lol"
"Alright. Let’s list a 12-man roster for each team.  Team USA starters: Curry, Kawhi, Bron, KD, AD Team USA Bench: Harden, Thompson, George, Butler, Holiday, Draymond, Lopez/Turner/Allen if we really need a big body.  Team Europe Starters: Doncic, Bogdanovic, Bogdanovic, Antetokounmpo, Gobert Team Europe Bench: Jokic, Gallinari, Porzingis, Sabonis, Vucevic, Capela, Valanciunas  Now, for team USA:  - Team USA has All NBA talent written amongst all of them. Their offense is unstoppable — everyone can iso, everyone can move off the ball, open looks everywhere, and have great ball movers.   - Also, everyone can shoot. Everyone also has IQ, on both ends. Their defense can be weak at times (when no AD can anchor the defense, but Dray at the 5 or Lopez/Turner/Allen can work okay just not great) but their guard/wing defense is also unstoppable. Kawhi/Bron IQ off the charts, and these are just from the starters.   - Everyone is good/borderline elite at on ball or off ball defense. Not a single one of these guys can be hunted on the mismatch (aside from the obvious point guard being hunted for the big man, but we have Holiday who could play for Curry if he gets hunted a lot). They can’t hunt anyone on iso’s. They can switch everyone on defense. Literally there’s nothing that this team can’t do.   On the other hand, we have Team Europe.   - Your starters have elite offense, Luka-Giannis PNR would be unstoppable (but it would kind of not work because Gobert clogs up the paint).   - Giannis is also a non-shooter, and team USA can deploy the Giannis wall to stop him. And even if he makes the right read and makes the right pass, team USA’s defensive IQ + defensive personnel is enough to either close out or rotate on the open man.  - Gobert can’t run the PNR with Luka (he can only run it with Conley) but even if he can run it he can only finish lobs, so if they deny him the lob his other option would only be to pass, since he doesn’t have a post game.   - That bench lineup is also sus, they lack a ballhandling guard (could use maybe Dragic here, but if you have at least 2 of Luka/Jokic/Giannis on the floor then playmaking wouldn’t be a real issue) OR a defensive wing (OG Anunoby could be good here).  - You also have bucket getters in both the Bogies but they’re only average on defense (including Luka as well).   - Gobert’s defense can be schemed against (see Clippers vs Jazz series) and if they replace him with someone like Jokic or Vucevic their defense will very much take a hit, the USA squad will feast on it.   - Capela is also a paint clogger, and everyone else is at most average on defense (and this is me being generous lol).   - Also, you got Porzingis, who’s a spot up shooter who can’t really bang anyone on the low post despite being a 7 ft giant lol.   (Btw, this is the best European players of 2020-2021. If you wanna replace anyone here, you could replace them with the likes of Evan Fournier, Dennis Schroder, OG Anunoby, Goran Dragic, Maxi Kleber, Jusuf Nurkic, Enes Kanter, Lauri Markkanen.)   So, after doing a bit of research, I must say that the USA team has no glaring holes in them (assuming that AD plays at the 5, otherwise their biggest hole would be center, and even then I’d say that Lopez/Turner or even Allen are serviceable enough that they can, at the very least, apply pressure and slow down anyone under the rim but not outright stop them completely). Team Europe tho, their bench is really average defensively but everyone is pretty good offensively. No one is really elite here (except for Jokic, Luka, and Giannis; although 2 of these are average at defense so they’re only elite offensively). Not to mention that there are more potential superstars in the upcoming future, this isn’t to mention Zion, Morant, Mitchell, Young, Booker, Edwards, Mobley, Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Chet Holmgren. Heck, we could even throw someone like Mikal Bridges or Trey Murphy III, who could be very very good defensively (and offensively we only need them to knock their 3s down). Europe has maybe at most a few, and even then they’re not guaranteed to be superstars (only Luka was the most recent one).  So, as of now, and in the future, Team USA &gt; Team Europe."

"lol the trade didn't include Siakam, you don't need filler to make that trade because Shai is still on a rookie deal. You trade Shai to get Jalen Suggs at #4 and build around developing Suggs for the next 2-3 years while cashing in on all the other picks to get a new young core in OKC. Shai is in no man's land, he has to get max extended this summer and OKC probably doesn't want to shell out max money when basically two to three years are going to be wasted. Shai might even ask out after the first year of his max because he wants to be on a team that isn't tanking still. This is the best time to trade Shai and #4 in this years draft might be one of the best picks OKC could get. You might be overrating Shai's value just slightly, he's very good, he isn't good enough that Detroit would give up the #1 pick for him"
Jalen Suggs gonna be the top star from the '21 draft class.

"Yeah, I guess there's 2 ways of interpreting this:  1. Mobley/Suggs really don't want to play for Tilman 2. Mobley/Suggs have intel that the Rockets have made up their minds on Jalen Green and it's a waste of time to work out for them  I'm not sold on #1. The team picking next is the fucking Cavs, lol.   So I'm guessing it's more of #2."
Jalen Green is a baller    Def better than Suggs will ever be
Jalen Suggs should come to Portland
Really like most of those - Jalen Suggs and Chauncey is one I hadn’t heard but makes sense.   Don’t see Bouknight as McCollum though - he’s a better athlete and not as good of a shooter.
"I'm guessing that American Football Quarterbacks and fit baseball players would be about as good as the average NBA player because of throwing accuracy and strength, but the NBA players who used to be Quarterbacks or baseball players would probably be best of all.  In light of that, I would say Donovan Mitchell (elite baseball fielder), Pat Connaughton (elite baseball pitcher), and Jalen Suggs (elite high school quarterback) would be the best.  Jokic can definitely throw and catch from his water polo days, but he's too lumbering.  And gotta include LeBron because of the unusual combination of agility with his size, and we already know he can catch anything."
I'd rather have Jalen Suggs over Ben Simmons so keep the 4th
"Kyle Lowry (S&amp;T), OG Anunoby and the 4th pick (Jalen Suggs) ought to get this done."
"there def is a chance.   houston is likely taking jalen green  if cavs trade sexton, they can either roll with suggs/garland/allen, or draft mobley and have to move allen down the line. theres a chance they might prefer suggs in that scenario"
"Cade:  15 Points, 6 Rebounds, 6 Assists 43/35/76 shooting splits  Jalen Green:  24 Points, 5 Rebounds, 4 Assists 46/38/82 shooting splits  Mobley:  10 Points, 8 Rebounds, 1 Block 56/20/68 shooting splits  Suggs:  20 Points, 4 Rebounds, 6 Assists 40/30/78 shooting splits"
"Yeah we have the 4th pick incoming, if it's Jalen Suggs or somehow Green falls to us, having Schroeder is literally worse than nothing. He'll be eating into minutes we could be spending developing our potentially go-to guy. Only reason we maybe want Schroeder is if we draft Mobley, which looks like probably isn't going to happen.  I would rather top out at a 5-6th seed with valuable playoff experience for the 4th pick and GTJ/Boucher than sign Schroeder on a 2 year deal."
"I'd also take Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, and Evan Mobley over Gobert"
"Wiseman, Wiggins, and their 2 FRPs would be very worth it tbh. Wiggins will be off contract soon (and will most likely be able to be signed for much lower than max).  We'd have a young talented squad with Wiggins, Gary Trent Jr, Wiseman, OG, Jalen Suggs (raptors 4th pick)"
Jalen Suggs: Jrue Holiday  Kumimga: Jaylen Brown  But others look alright.
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"

Jalen Suggs will max out as a backup guard
Jalen Suggs will be the best player in the draft.
"- Bouknight will bust  - Sengun will bust unless he’s drafted by the Spurs  - Jared Butler is making an all-rookie team &amp; regarded as the steal of the draft   - Evan Mobley has a disappointing rookie year   - Kai Jones will bust, next Jalen Smith  - Bones Hyland will shoot logo threes   - Cade becomes a top 15 player in the NBA in 4 years   - Jalen Suggs is the second best player in the draft behind Cade  - OKC trades with Cleveland for #3"
Where does john wall fit with Jalen Suggs going to Houston?
"Best player in the draft is Jalen Suggs.  Don't overthink it Pistons.   Cade is a 6'8 pg, but he really doesn't seem like a superstar. He actually reminds me of a Jalen Rose type player."
Jalen Suggs?  More like Jalen Sucks  Green and Mobley will be the top 2 players in the draft
"I definitely don’t view everyone as can’t miss.   I think the top 4 all have huge potential, but realistically they all have faults to their game. Cunningham is lacking elite athleticism (although I think he is the safest pick), Green can score but he is still missing other parts of his game to be a more complete player, Mobley is a bit of a project where he needs to improve in multiple facets of the game, Suggs is a Jack of all trades master of none point guard with great athleticism but mediocre shooting.   Realistically I think they all will be good, but I could see someone like Mobley being a bust, or Green not being as impactful in the NBA.  I just think Suggs is closer to Jalen Green than he is to Kuminga where there are way more question marks, even if Suggs is basically the consensus 4th pick."
"Personally, I think eventually Fred either leaves or is traded within the next 2 or 3 seasons based on whether he accepts his option or not. That leaves room for a Jalen Suggs/ whomever we might move up for to take over the reigns as they come into their own. At that point, Pascal will be an experienced, more refined 30 year old who should still have plenty in the tank, OG’s gonna be 27, Gary Trent is 25, it’s a good timeline"
"Cade cunningham was 8 when the decision happened, born 8/25/01. Jalen Green was 8 when the decision happened, born 2/9/02. Jalen Suggs turned 9 a month before the decision happened, born 6/3/01. That’s just the top three prospects, I can keep going if you’d like?"
One Jalen Suggs please
I prefer the situation now and possibly walking out of next week with Jalen Suggs than being a first round exit with Demar Derozan.
Jalen Suggs
"If detroit drops their pick or doesn’t draft cunningham then their GM is a masochist.  Also, fuck. I don’t want Mobley to drop to 4. please not mobley. suggs. i eant jalen suggs. we need pg to replace lowry and sign a big with the money thwt gets freed up."
