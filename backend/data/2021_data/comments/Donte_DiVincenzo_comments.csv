"That seems like a crazy good defensive lineup.   Jrue Holiday, top-tier guard defender  Donte DiVincenzo, apparently a decent perimeter defender  Kris Middleton, great wing defender  Giannis Antetokounmpo, reigning DPOY  Brook Lopez, elite paint protector  How does anyone ever score on them? Hopefully I'll see tonight, lol."

"Buying- De'Andre Hunter, has been great for the hawks 17/5/2 on 52/36/87 splits. love watching him play.  Selling- Donte Divincenzo, had a good start but has slowed down quite a bit. 9/4/2 on 42/30/83 starting to get salty about the Bogdan trade not working.  Hold- Tyrell Terry. my favorite prospect going into the draft. Hasn't really gotten any playing time since he's behind luka, Brunson and burke."
Would you take Brook Lopez (friendly contract) and Donte Divincenzo (next white guy leaper) and Bucks legend DJ Wilson?
"which is really useful tbf, but only if you look at it properly under that context  like we know Robert Covington isn‚Äôt a top 10 player in the league, but when he (or like, Donte Divincenzo last year) pops up at the top of those kind of stats, it‚Äôs good indicator that they‚Äôre succeeding really well at their role"
"I feel dumb - is there a reason why certain players don't show up on the position-specific lists? Haven't checked any other players but I noticed that Donte DiVincenzo and Khris Middleton are in the top 30 overall, but not listed on any of the lists by position.  Edit: Lowry, Lillard, Conley, etc. missing from the PG list."
"&gt; FG% says a lot about your shot selection.  I honestly disagree. FG% weighs all field goal attempts equally even though 3s are worth more than 2s. So even if you are shooting 3s at a great percentage, your overall FG% goes down because FG% just combines all shots together.   &gt;There are no players that only take 3s  Well yes of course, but it still is a problem to use FG% when it doesn't account for the extra point that you get for making a 3 pointer. Just to give a few examples Steph Curry, Tim Hardaway Jr., Mike Conley, and Donte DiVincenzo (all players with pretty differing playstyles btw) have a below league average FG% (46%), but an above average eFG% (53.2%).  I recommend that you please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/awL65UyXmA8) so you can understand what i mean"
"That's not an assumption. Donte Divincenzo is better at basketball than Della Donne. They play in different leagues, against different competition -- she is better than he is relative to the competition they face, but none of these smoothbrains downvoting me honestly think she is better at basketball if they were in a gym alone."
"But the ones you think of all the time are in the 40s.  That's a pretty big gulf.  Jason Richardson, Zach LaVine, Spud Webb - 46 inches  Jordan, Wilt - 46/48 inches (conflicting reports for Jordan)  Oladipo, Donte DiVincenzo - 42 inches  Muggsy Bogues, Pat Connaughton - 44 inches"
"&gt;He makes no money..impossible to trade for anyone significant.  That's not quite true.  I'm not saying that this is a sensible trade, but just for example, he could be traded for 2 years of Donte DiVincenzo straight up.  Or Matisse Thybulle and 3 years of his contract.  His salary would fit with trading for Alex Len, if the Lakers decided they do need an actual backup center.  There aren't many players making sub $3M, but there are a few interesting ones -- Caruso included."
"Imagine being someone like Donte Divincenzo. You've been the most athletic person on every court or field or track you've ever stepped onto since you were five years old. Sports have just always come naturally to you, and as you reach a certain age you start to realize how important that is. Your dad brags about you, all the boys want to be your friend, girls start flashing you smiles.  By your senior year of high school you're a huge deal in the community. You're a highly recruited basketball prospect who's probably going D1. You've banged all the cheerleaders and even some of the female teachers. Your ego has grown huge, but why would anyone expect anything different? You're totally the man.  Some great high school athletes get to college and become small fish once the pond gets bigger, but not you. You play for a basketball powerhouse, you light it up in the tournament, and you put up 30 points to win the National Championship with millions of people watching. Now you're a celebrity. Now NBA teams are calling. And soon, after a few months of being on cloud nine and being the absolute biggest of big men on campus, you get drafted into the NBA. Every kid's dream, and you made it. You've achieved every goal you ever set for yourself. You're unstoppable. You're the baddest man on the planet. You know in your heart that you're about to dominate the league and become the next Michael Jordan.  Then you show up to your first day of practice and you see this: https://imgur.com/a/OJj4qdJ"
"Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo, Josh Hart, Eric Paschall."
"Seemed to be a desperate move to win now because in that moment Giannis hadn't signed that big extension. So trading DiVincenzo for Bogdanovic, who has more experience getting bigger minutes off the bench seemed reasonable. I thought that the Bucks would lose the trade if they traded Donte, though."
"I'm not drawing conclusions, this was my thoughts before the season even started. Donte already better defensively, the only thing he lacks over Bogdanovic is three point shooting, but Donte is on a way cheaper deal for the next two years and has a lot of potential imo. Also the defense in the starting five with Holiday/DiVincenzo/Middleton/Giannis/Lopez is more enticing to me I guess lol"
"Honestly I would be sick if we traded Donte Divincenzo, he‚Äôs 5 years younger and is a better defender and is currently averaging 12 on 55% from three."

Is donte divincenzo gonna hafta smack a bitch?
Donte Divincenzo has been great so far this year.  His shot is falling and he's a good defender.  If he keeps it up the Bogdanovic deal not going through could be a blessing in disguise.
donte divincenzo ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint bogdan bogdanovic this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time

"I say this with all due respect, but fuck Donte Divincenzo"
Donte DiVincenzo with one of the best charges I‚Äôve ever seen
All that to silence Donte Divincenzo
Their team is different. Donte DiVincenzo starts. They picked up Jrue but lost Hill and Bledsoe and Brown.
"Was trying to figure out who DD was and was like ""that cannot be Donte Divincenzo....""  Designated Driver for anyone stupid like me"
Donte Divincenzo outscored Middleton by 1 point in each of the two games against the Raptors.
Donte Divincenzo
"Underrated:  * Royce O‚ÄôNeal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It‚Äôs like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
Why does my guy look like a melanated Donte Divincenzo.
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They‚Äôll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn‚Äôt fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they‚Äôve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won‚Äôt be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"He's so underutilized sometimes it's maddening, the dude is ultra efficient, their best passer and their best tough shot maker but there are games in which he takes less shots than Donte DiVincenzo"

"Players having great tournament runs rarely actually lead said players to being the number overall pick. In fact, most scouts/execs don't really consider tournament play really that highly.

"Weird that Lowry is on the trading block given how much he means to the org and fans.  While Bosh, TMac, Carter, Kawhi or others may have had a higher peak nobody contributed more to the Raptors winning games over their careers.  Then you see these piss-ant reported trade packages headlined by Will Barton or Tyrese Maxey or Donte DiVincenzo and maybe it makes me wonder how little it's worth to Toronto to keep Lowry around in the middle of a playoff hunt."
"Well you have to factor in the whole season. And Russ' lack of efficiency.  Also, advanced stats are harmed by colinearity - ie, if a bad player plays all their minutes next to great players on a great team there will be an effect on their advanced stats. And vice versa for a good player surrounded by terrible ones.  For example, Donte Divincenzo was rated at around a top 5 player in the league in RPM at one point last year due to playing next to Giannis so much. He was a great role player, but if he was on the TWolves he wouldn't have ranked so highly.  This year, Mychal Mulder is 18th in the league in RPM (Warriors). Obviously not a top 20 player though lol. Interestingly, Russ is actually 14th in RPM right now. But the same principle applies for other stats."

Somebody please get Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo some help! With a third star I think they could really make some noise in the playoffs
Donte Divincenzo is the best red headed rebounding guard from Delaware of all time. Makes you think..

2x NCAA champion Donte DiVincenzo
Donte DiVincenzo could be a brand new type of player.
"Hey, Nets fans !  Donte diVincenzo has more offensive rebounds than your entire team."
Donte DiVincenzo got more Offensive Rebounds than the entire Brooklyn Nets
"Thats cool and all, but hes not Donte Divincenzo"
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
"Donte Divincenzo 5 points, 0/3 for 3, -18."
did donte divincenzo die?
Donte DiVincenzo
"That‚Äôs an interesting one. Because Trae Young for example is a 25/10 player on solid efficiency. His offensive impact is massive, like those numbers indicate. However, in general he probably wouldn‚Äôt be as valuable as a player because of his defense. But nothing about his stats would originally indicate that.  So, I will look at players who have great defensive stats but aren‚Äôt as valuable as those stats would indicate:  Myles Turner is a great blocker but he is not a DPOY caliber type defender even though he gets a ton of blocks.  Donte DiVincenzo gets a good amount of steals but he isn‚Äôt really a great defender.  It‚Äôs a lot harder to be considered much worse than stats indicate on the offensive end. If you are just looking at points? Then sure, but even a basic stat like FG%, 3P% and the attempts for each all will indicate ""chuckers"""
"Donte DiVincenzo, but you also could have just looked it up on google or gone to the subreddit r/TheBigRagu"
"There's been injuries to role players as well, they just don't get nearly as much attention. But Danny Green, KCP, De'Andre Hunter, Donte DiVincenzo, Alex Caruso, Will Barton, Serge Ibaka, etc all have missed time with injuries in these playoffs."
"SMH, the disrespect to Donte DiVincenzo!"
"The disrespect to Donte ""The Big Ragu"" DiVincenzo."
"Donte Divincenzo: ""Am I a joke to you?!"""
Donte Divincenzo is underrated injury for the bucks. Great connecting player and energy guy and shooter
"Yep. If anything has ruined these playoffs and the product on the floor it's the injuries to the stars. The injuries to guys like Danny Green and Donte DiVincenzo and KCP suck too, but what's ruining the playoffs is the way the stars are dropping like flies out there."
"First team all-hospital:  CP3, Kyrie, Kawhi, AD, Embiid  Second team all-hospital:  Conley, Murray, Harden, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams  Honorable mentions: Kemba, Cam Reddish, Donte Divincenzo, Jeff Green, Jayson Tatum for like half of game 2"
"If Donte DiVincenzo is the make or break point of a team being a legitimate championship contender or not, were they ever really a championship contender? I understand that he‚Äôs an important role player, but it‚Äôs not like he was the key to carrying the team to a championship."
I know that it‚Äôs shit in the bucks season but Donte DiVincenzo did suffer a season ending injury.
you forgot Donte DiVincenzo
All Nba 10th team Donte Divincenzo
Donte DiVincenzo is out for the Bucks too. Not the same level of player as all those others but decent role player for them.
He blew up the Bogi sign and trade with the Bucks by claiming tampering. Bucks lost a draft pick and we didn't get Donte DiVincenzo because of it.
Donte DiVincenzo
"The Bucks lost one of their starters too, right before this series started - Donte Divincenzo.  He‚Äôs great on both ends of the court.  It sucks but it‚Äôs a team sport, and part of the game."
You can‚Äôt compare missing harden and kyrie to missing donte divincenzo

bucks need donte divincenzo
It's always so sad when injury takes out one of the biggest stars in a playoff series; Donte Divincenzo could have made such a difference here
"Its tricky because i bet that was the plan. Have Brook play and see how he does and as he starts getting exposed, sub him out for tucker in crucial minutes so the lineup would be:  Giannis-Tucker-Middleton-Holiday-DiVincenzo   but with Donte out we‚Äôre down to either Forbes or Connaughton and at that point you have to see whats better, Nets exposing the big guy on the perimeter but taking away two‚Äôs or have Forbes or Pat in and *maybe*reducing threes while giving up more in the paint.   Watching the games, you can see the paints guarded heavily at the beginning but as KD and Kyrie started torching it up, they get more and more attention leading to more 2s. I never liked Buds coaching style but I feel bad for him in this series. Imagine having to win to jeep your job but you‚Äôre playing against some of the best scorers doing 50/50/90 splits in the post season"
"I know he wouldn't be changing the series but Donte Divincenzo exists, was a starter and good shooter and defender this year and he's out with injury. so yea the Nets are more banged up but don't ignore Donte"
Yes because Donte DiVincenzo = Harden/Green/DJ/Dinwiddle lol
This man just say Donte DiVincenzo? Cmon bro.
Bucks would be killing them with Donte DiVincenzo
"Yes they will miss him, but if the bucks lose you don‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh well they didn‚Äôt have donte divincenzo‚Äù. Especially after the huge injuries we have had this season, he‚Äôs a good player but not game changing"
"&gt; Some other notable stars who *arent in the playoffs*... Donte DiVenczeno, Bruce Brown,  Their teams are literally about to play each other lol (DiVincenzo is injured now but was starting for the Bucks and Brown has been getting legit minutes for the Nets)"
"And Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson and Donte DiVincenzo all won a championship together at Villanova. What a loaded team."
Khris' middleton and donte divincenzo for Bradley beal
"As much as i like the nets, i have the bucks in a close 6 or 7. They match up pretty well with the nets.  Donte Divincenzo is a HUGE loss though"
he becomes Donte Divincenzo? what's that mean?
He knows once he leaves the Lakers he becomes Donte Divincenzo and people stop caring
"Donte DiVincenzo is out, which means that Bryn Forbes will likely spend significant time guarding one of Kyrie Irving or James Harden. Other than that, the Bucks are a great matchup, and it's a series I'm looking forward to, win or loss."

"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."

"My reaction would be ""who the duck is Donte DiVincenzo?"""
Oh and Philly offered the deal to Phoenix lol. Phoenix was about to pick Donte DiVincenzo but they got an offer they couldn‚Äôt resist
I think Ayton and Donte Divincenzo have room to improve. Morant can improve his scoring as well. I've given up hope on Lonzo having a breakout season.
"Dude, they have lost Donte DiVincenzo, all their main rotations guys have been pretty much healthy all the way (aside from Giannis missing two total games). DiVincenzo is a decent role player, but losing him isn't 10% of what it means to lose Kyrie or Anthony Davis."
"Jrue Holiday, Donte DiVincenzo, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez.   Jeff Teague, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis."
The Bucks have been missing a key starter for most of the playoffs. People really seem to overlook the Divincenzo injury and only point to the Giannis injury. The fact is losing Donte at the start of the playoffs was a massive set back for the Bucks. Thankfully they've been able to overcome losing an important starter and get this far.
"Tucker was inserted into the starting lineup when Vinny went down, so yes, Donte does replace PJ. Connaughton is more of a wing player, while Divincenzo is a combo guard that takes minutes away from Teague and Forbes, whilst also pushing PJ back onto the bench."
&gt;Connaughton is a much better rebounder.  Not at all. Donte is an exceptional rebounder for a guard as well as Pat is. DiVincenzo has averaged more rebounds/game than Pat for the last 2 years.
Divincenzo was technically a better shooter this season while being a much better defender. Donte started for a reason. Would‚Äôve helped a lot this series for his ability to guard Booker/Paul.
A healthy team that's missing it's starting shooting guard. (Donte DiVincenzo)
"OG is about as important of a player as Donte Divincenzo is NOW, in 2019 he was a non factor so shut the fuck up"
"Milwaukee just needs 1 really good to great roaster addition to be favourites again, since Jrue, Khash, Giannis are locked in.   Bucks welcome back starting SG Donte DiVincenzo. Depending on if PJ, Portis re-sign or get the big contracts they've earned from another team, Milwaukee will need to bring a vet or 2 in as well.  The rookies Nwora, Diakite, Merrill hopefully should come along as well."
Donte DiVincenzo says hi.
"I'm sorry, I'm probably just being whooshed. But the Bucks aren't good at drafting? They've drafted 2 first ballot hall of famers in the last 25 years. Also, aside from that, they drafted malcolm brogdon recently, who turned out to be a very good player. Also, as for just functional nba players, they drafted kevin porter jr., norman powell, and donte divincenzo since giannis got drafted. All three were drafted after the 16th pick of the draft. I would say they've done a great job drafting. That said, the trade makes complete sense and I really hope they win the championship."
Donte DiVincenzo has entered the chat
Donte DiVincenzo isn't even worth 1/12th of a win against a fully healthy Nets team.
And the Bucks are already missing Donte DiVincenzo.
It‚Äôs actually kind of amazing how Donte DiVincenzo ceased to exist in the minds of everyone the second he got injured.   But Saric is a bigger piece‚Ä¶
"Stuff happens. They're paying out two other max contracts to guys who will both be in their 30s starting next season, on top of Giannis' supermax. That doesn't leave much room to pay anyone else to come to Milwaukee. They might not even be able to pay Donte Divincenzo when he hits FA.   Giannis won't be able to carry this team if he's playing next to a declining Middleton and Holliday(if they suffer a drop-off in performance) with a bunch of second round picks or minimum contract veterans.  Thats a bit of a worst case scenario, but it's not entirely out of the question."
That Donte Divincenzo (skip Bayless) and Derrick White (r/Spurs) were better than Trae Young
The white Donte DiVincenzo we call him
"Dario sits by the bedside table  The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle  The Phoenix Suns have died in our arms last night. Bucks in Six.  a potential counter-point: Donte DiVincenzo has guilty feet and will never dance again  For game 5, once again, the Suns will try to build The Wall, but Giannis will be saying Hey You, Is There Aytonbody Out There?, but for Phoenix, Nobody's Home.  But Phoenix's guard #1 Devin ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù Booker might be saying...  He‚Äôs Back (The Man Behind The Mask)  For the Suns &amp; CP3's overuse... they gotta stop with the 10th ave freeze out on Cam Payne, because that boy is born to run  Which team will be hungry like the wolf for game 5, Bucks or Suns?"
My brain shorted out because there is a powerlifter dude named Vincent Dizenzo so my brain just went to that instead of Donte DiVincenzo
"My favourite cherry-picked statistic is that the shooting guard with the highest ORB% (% of offensive rebounds that happened while the player was on the floor, that were the result of the player) in the league is Donte DiVincenzo, and the shooting guard with the second highest ORB% in the league is Pat Connaughton."
Someone should make an update to the ‚ÄúSuns opponents who are missing stars‚Äù list and add Donte DiVincenzo on it.
"Oh sorry that the Bucks lost Donte DiVincenzo, he totally compares to losing James Harden and Kyrie Irving. Look I'm not discrediting the Suns and Bucks, they beat who was in front of them but their injuries just don't even compare to them not having to face a healthy Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard. Those are all arguably top 10 players in the NBA with Lebron, Durant, Harden, Davis, and Leonard usually in people's top 5. They got breaks and the chances of it happening again are slim to none so i don't expect either team back next year."
Featuring Donte divincenzo as oracle
"Mate, the Suns have a plethora of guards and wings and one fucking centre, DA. Saric is the closest they had to a second C.  And don't be a fkn idiot, if you have the following 5 Starters, Jrue Holliday, Chris Middleton, Donte Divincenzo, Giannis Antetokounpo, Brook Lopez. Very obviously one of those guys is the least important starter.   Any other Suns bench player is easily replaceable EXCEPT Saric. That makes him vital to the team. They are literally playing centreless without him.  The most replaceable Bucks starter is Donte. Who, as this thread points out, no one even notices he's missing."
"Suns wanted the 10th pick 76ers said no but when Zhaire Smith fell, then the 76ers reached out and asked to trade him. If 76ers didn't want Zhaire Smith the Suns GM hinted he would have drafted one of Mikals Teamates at the time (Donte DiVincenzo or Aaron Holiday)."
"I was thinking they need a better decision-maker+defender like Divencenzo coming off the bench. He has [already shown](https://wisportsheroics.com/making-the-case-donte-divincenzo-should-play-point-guard/) he can play the point guard position both this season and [last season](https://www.google.com/amp/s/behindthebuckpass.com/2020/04/22/milwaukee-bucks-donte-divincenzos-future-point-guard/amp/). Tbh, I really only know players like Divencenzo because of fantasy bball."
First round draft pick and starting PG Donte DiVincenzo says hello  Edit: and adds his name to list of players you never faced
"Losing DiVincenzo had a bigger impact than I thought. At first, it seemed like they had the other bench pieces to fill his minutes. At least they hadn‚Äôt lost one of their stars. But without Donte, they really miss his shot creation and off-the-dribble bounce."
"This is why we really miss donte divincenzo. He's lowkey a stud, and he was more important than most people think imo. Without him, we have *very* little depth"
The find a way to make Donte DiVincenzo get healthy in the next 48 hours adjustment obviously
Every team is injured.  DOnte Divincenzo.
The Donte DiVincenzo effect
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9. Jonathan Issac vs Jaren Jackson Jr 10. Jarrett Allen vs Mitchell Robinson 11. Monte Morris vs. Jalen Brunson 12. Derrick White vs Kevin Huerter or Donte DiVincenzo 13. Josh Hart or Kyle Kuzma vs Miles Bridges 14. Lauri Markannen vs Robert Williams 15. Thomas Bryant vs Wendell Carter Jr
"If it includes all First Round Picks, Donte Divincenzo (17th) is also included."
Best I can do is donte divincenzo
"The Bucks without Giannis are still a pretty good team.  They definitely are a bit of a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde type of team, though.  They'll definitely need to be firing on all cylinders to beat a healthy Suns team.  The injury to Donte DiVincenzo definitely hurt them.  All Forbes can do is wait in the corner and jack up threes.  At least Connaughton can drive to the basket and get rebounds.  Other than that, they really don't have a bench.    Wonder if Ayton will be able to shut down Lopez.  Ayton was able to play very good defense on Jokic and Lopez is similar in height and dimensions.  So I'd assume he'll be able to neutralize Lopez in the paint.  I'd be surprised if a Giannis-less Bucks got swept by Phoenix."
I want Mikal Bridges and Donte DiVincenzo to both win a title somehow.  I would prefer Bridges foe obvious reasons.
Who‚Äôs to say the Hawks couldn‚Äôt make the Finals with a healthy Giannis playing? He‚Äôs the first significant injury they‚Äôve benefited from unless you think Danny Green and Donte DiVincenzo are huge game changers. They were up still 10 points at home when Giannis went down. It‚Äôs not a lot but they were winning. They could‚Äôve evened the series 2-2 even with Giannis playing.
Donte Divincenzo
And it‚Äôs no coincidence that Phoenix and Milwaukee are leading their Conference Finals series.  They‚Äôre both great teams and just happen to also be the healthiest at the right time. The Suns aren‚Äôt missing anyone of consequence and the Bucks are only really missing Donte Divincenzo.
"I get that the Bucks and Suns have been the beneficiaries of some unfortunate injuries this postseason, but why does no one talk about how CP3 was injured during the LA series? Or the fact that the Bucks are without one of their best defenders/rebounders and all around hustle guys Donte Divincenzo? Or that Giannis has been playing through a calf injury this series? I know obviously the severity of some injuries are much worse, just seems like these teams are getting a lot of hate without the recognition that their teams have also had to battle through injuries."
"Except for the Heat everyone you have faced has been pretty damn injured. Nets had 2/3 stars either injured or playing on one leg, Hawks have Hunter, our second best player, and Reddish, one of our best wing defenders out and now Trae is injured.   And you wanna talk about missing DONTE DIVINCENZO. Has he even averaged 10 points??"
No Donte DiVincenzo too
You have Giannis and Jrue lol? Don‚Äôt think your defense is gonna get so much better with Donte Divincenzo playing lmao
"And Serge Ibaka, and Donte DiVincenzo"
They're comparing losing DONTE DIVINCENZO to Kyrie and Harden lol
... Donte DiVincenzo ins't injured?
Aren't y'all going around telling everyone Donte Divincenzo is the 2nd coming of Christ who died for our sins?

They lost a starter too earlier in the playoffs. Donte divincenzo. He played big minutes for them.
"Skip Bayless said Donte DiVincenzo had a higher NBA ceiling than Trae, Max Kellerman said Trae should go to the G-League for a year or two to develop.  Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3FYvGAGh9c"
They badly need Donte DiVincenzo
Donte DiVincenzo is out that's a massive blow to this bucks title hopes.
Donte divincenzo too
"Also Sexton, Shai, Gary Trent Jr, Shake Milton, Shamet and Donte Divincenzo"
Donte DiVincenzo would like a word with you.
Nets missing Kyrie Irving (their 3rd best player) and Dinwiddie while Bucks without Donte DiVincenzo and Jordan Nwora seems just like superteam vs last years 1 seeds with injuries to me. Nets still got 2 MVPs on the court.
Donte DiVincenzo
lol not comparing donte divincenzo to harden+kyrie
and then lost him.. injuries fucked the Nets up. Meanwhile Donte Divincenzo was the worst injury the Bucks have suffered
and then lost him.. injuries fucked the Nets up. Meanwhile Donte Divincenzo was the worst injury the Bucks have suffered
"Donte Divincenzo just sitting there with his injury leg sprawled out. Someone is going to bump into him, lol"
Donte Divincenzo?
It feels like people don't know Donte DiVincenzo exists.
Donte divincenzo is a starter and actually pretty important
"Donte Divincenzo fills this role for the Bucks. Although, he‚Äôs a SG, which is frankly even more odd"
"Not to me, unless, *unless* they win the finals against the Suns (who dont get any new injuries by that point)  I'm not about to pat bud on the back for beating the nets with a big 1.5, injured philly or atlanta, and then the kawhi-less clippers or the conley-less jazz (potentially mitchell-less too). That shit should be expected when your biggest injury is to donte divincenzo. It'll be great for bucks fans if they win the finals over any of those teams but frankly it won't change my view on Bud at all *unless* he actually makes some big adjustment or whatever to impact the series, not just 'giannis and middleton shoot well, get W'"
"Ok but you see the difference between Donte Divincenzo and Jaylen Brown, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jamal Murray, and Donovan Mitchell right?"

"The Bucks offense is not nearly as good as it was in the regular season due to the loss of Donte DiVincenzo. I know the guy who is 4th on the team in PPG doesn't seem like that huge of a loss, but he really is considering who is replacing him and how bad they are on offense. PJ Tucker is a massive negative on offense, Brook is a big negative on offense, they basically have 4 positive offensive players, the Big 3 and Forbes, who can only play limited minutes due to being a massive defensive liability. Connaughton is the only other guy who can be considered average at best.   The Nets holding down this Bucks offense to a low ORating isn't nearly as impressive as it sounds given the context of who the Bucks are playing."
"I still think Donte Divincenzo can become that ‚Äúevery team wants him‚Äù kind of player. Hustle, defense, shooting. It just seems every time he starts to gather momentum he gets hurt"
"Donte Divincenzo. Athletic, energetic, handsome, and showed flashes of being a really good player (check out the Pelicans/Bucks game this year). His biggest issue is consistency."
I don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs true. OG in 2019 is a better defender than Donte. He‚Äôs good for sure but he doesn‚Äôt have the size to be as versatile as OG. Anunoby can defend guards as good as Divincenzo (probably better) while also having the size to defend 3‚Äôs and 4‚Äôs effectively
"Donte DiVincenzo  Kyrie Irving and/or James Harden  Yeah, super important. Completely changes the situation üôÑ"
I think Bucks got better although I have bias. Lost Tucker but added Grayson Allen and George Hill as well as Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye. Bench could be better. Add back a healthy Donte Divincenzo and I‚Äôm pretty happy.
Giannis  Khris  Jrue  Brook Lopez   Donte Divincenzo  Bobby Portis  Pat Connaughton  And idk Grayson Allen
"The Nets faced a Celtics team without Jaylen Brown, and were on track to beating a Bucks team without Donte Divincenzo"
"Donte DiVincenzo is from Newark, Delaware"
Donte DiVincenzo
"Well I mean he was a rookie against the best playoff defense and they were missing Goran dragic most of that series, so I think his role became overbearing or just too much to handle. And if we‚Äôre going off most recent performances I‚Äôm not sure where that leaves the debate at personally. I think I would take Herro despite some of his struggles last year over a Divincenzo coming off a season ending injury, but it is close. I definitely see the value in Donte and why one would say he‚Äôs better, I‚Äôm just not quite there yet, but like you said it‚Äôs early."
Donte Divincenzo
"Donte DiVincenzo is better than Tyler Herro. Absolutely every advanced metric confirms there's  a sizable gap in impact in Donte's favour, but I feel like people overvalue the difference of individual points per game."
donte divincenzo
"I'm not calling him a fraud - I'm saying Donte DiVincenzo is a more impactful player. This disagreement is a product of your undervaluing of Donte more than my undervaluing of Herro. For either of the last two years, every advanced metric has Donte being significantly more impactful than Herro. WS/48, Offensive and defensive ratings, VORP, BPM, RAPTOR, - literally all of them show a significant difference between the players, even offensively. The argument for Herro that doesn't over-rely on three series a year ago in the Bubble, is a case of matching Donte's efficiency on three more shots. It's a pretty negligible difference. Then we talk about defense. Donte's 2019-20 season he was;  * 91st percentile in Loose ball recovery rate * 93rd percentile in Steals per 75 possessions: 2.7 (he was 9th in the league in steals per 36) * 90th percentile in Deflections per 75 possessions * 94th percentile in passing lane defense  I've seen Donte **block an Anthony Davis dunk**. If you really value those 3 extra shots on the same efficiency, then you really better hope that they work through the lower offensive rating and substantially worse defense."
I'll fight that Donte DiVincenzo is better than Tyler Herro - OP should've put Donte up there so he can go last instead.

Donte Divincenzo Bobby Portis Grayson Allen  These 3 are gonna be top 3 for Most improved players. No Bias whatsoever.
I‚Äôm his biggest fan but Donte divincenzo. There‚Äôs room in his game to be a 15/6/4 person on roughly his same efficiency but it‚Äôs only going to happen if he takes 12 shots a game. Which is 3 more shots than he currently averages on the bucks. He could be a very good 3rd option on a 7-10 seed.   Now that‚Äôs on an individual level clearly he has the ability to be the 5th starter on a title team despite not playing most of the playoffs due to unity.
"Hey donte divincenzo was in the starting lineup before he got hurt, but yeah drafting hasn't been great."
"Donte DiVincenzo, Derrick White and DeAndre Hunter would all look really really good if they could stay healthy and had larger roles."
Portis is better than DiVincenzo. Being a starter doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs top 5 on the team. Compared to virtually other teams injuries in the playoffs losing Donte was the least significant.

"If Donte DiVincenzo was playing, he would have shut down Kyrie and that would leave Jrue on a hobbled Harden, rendering him completely useless. That how hypotheticals work right?"
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I‚Äôm not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we‚Äôll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, ‚ÄúThat is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],‚Äù I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I‚Äôm not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: ‚ÄúHe is not a good runner; he‚Äôs an amazing runner. And then he‚Äôs an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn‚Äôt really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he‚Äôs a great kid, he‚Äôs smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He‚Äôs a treasure, really. He‚Äôs going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.‚Äù Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I‚Äôm positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand his shot looks as good as any player‚Äôs in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don‚Äôt fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I‚Äôll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: ‚ÄúHe is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He‚Äôs an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he‚Äôs a coach on the floor. He‚Äôs such a smart player.‚Äù Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, ‚ÄúIf we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?‚Äù Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He‚Äôs a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker‚Äìtype player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him ‚Äúthe best defensive player I have ever coached.‚Äù Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
By scrabble value:  Jrue Holiday: 25  Khris Middleton: 25  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 28  Donte DiVincenzo: 31
No because he then said Bogut doesn‚Äôt count and that Donte DiVincenzo doesn‚Äôt count. Then he said Giannis doesn‚Äôt count for the ECF and the Bucks got ‚Äúbailed out‚Äù even though all these guys missed the rest of those respective series.   He‚Äôs just moving the goal posts and basically saying injuries to your opponent count as an asterisk but then ignoring the injuries that affect teams he doesn‚Äôt like.
"bucks had donte divincenzo out  nets had kyrie for a couple games and then One-Leg Harden for another couple, missed jeff green for 3 games, missed dinwiddie  but sure, 'both teams were injured'"
tbf in practicality not getting the return for him which iirc was a damn solid package (don't remember everyone in it but i know it included Donte DiVincenzo who would've been real good to have) might as well have been one

"We had no Donte Divincenzo... Nets had Kyrie Harden and Kd at different points in 7 games and couldn't beat Giannis, Google Eyes and PJ Tucker   One could also say Bucks in 4 if Middleton and Holiday didn't have a bad few games on the offensive end."
Suns were basically healthy right?  Also the Bucks were missing a very key starter in Donte Divincenzo and Giannis himself hurt his knee  If Giannis isn‚Äôt a leader due to injuries then Kawhi and Bron aren‚Äôt either due to the injuries to the Warriors when they won their rings
"All they were missing to my knowledge was Donte DiVincenzo. We were missing DeAndre Hunter and Can Reddish coming into the series and had multiple guys like Trae and Bogdanovic playing through injuries. No way we get swept, we would beat them if we had our two best wings available the whole series."
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Mamadi Diakite  Donte Divincenzo  Sandro Mamukrlashvili  And Georgios Kalaitzakis  üòÇ
"in what world are they useless? Donte DiVincenzo was the starting shooting guard for the championship Bucks for the entire season, NAW is probably about to start for the Pels and has been playing well, and Poku was intentionally taken as a low floor/high upside flyer.  D.J. Wilson isn't great but so what? You're not proving anything."
"Why even try then? Pelicans pick 17th in the 1st round this year. The last 4 guys picked 17th are:  Aleksej Pokusevski, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Donte DiVincenzo, D.J. Wilson  Most of those guys are worthless, and none of them move the needle much. So let's sell the 17th pick for no assets in return, too."
"2009 - Brandon Jennings led a terrible roster to the 6th seed in his rookie year and nearly upset the Hawks (losing in 7). He then got hurt. Despite that he still lead them to the the playoffs 2 out of his 4 seasons and then got traded for Khris Middleton. At #10 this was a good pick.   2009 - Jodie Meeks. A ten year NBA career for a 41st pick is incredible. The average NBA career lasts 4.5 seasons. The average length for a 41st pick would be like 1 year. This was a great pick.   2010 - Larry Saunders at 15 in 2010 was another great pick. In 2012 he was a Gobert-esque rim protector, essentially a walking double double with 3 blocks per game.    2011- Jimmer Fredette. The Kings made this pick. The Bucks had no intention of keeping Jimmer and traded back for the 19th pick, which they used to take eventual borderline All Star Tobias Harris. An incredible pick.    2012 - John Henson at 14. Wasn't awful considering who was drafted after him. Pretty much everyone passed on Draymond who went 35.   2013 - Giannis. One of the best draft picks in NBA history.   2014 - Jabari Parker was considered a sure-fire star and was voted by his draft class as being the most likely to win ROY and to have the best career. Sports Illustrated had him on the cover calling him the ""best High School player since Lebron James'. No one was mad at this pick. He was averaging 20ppg in his 3rd season but had shocking luck with injuries.   2014 - Johnny O'Bryant. 5 years from a 36th pick isn't terrible.   2015 - Rashad Vaughn at 17 wasn't a disaster considering who was left on the board.   2016 - Thon Maker at 10. This is the first one I feel they properly messed up because Sabonis went 11. However they made up for it with their next pick.   2016 - Malcolm Brogdon at 36 is an incredible pick. Rookie of the year, 50-40-90 club, borderline All Star.    2018 - Donte DiVincenzo at 17 was a good pick. Find a new slant."
Donte DiVincenzo ... with his first name and his hair
"The Bucks we're able to win when their star went down. They also went pretty much all of the post season without a starter who helps a lot with defense and rebounding in Divincenzo. You have to be able to win games when guys go down. If Kevin Durant is the best player in the world why should he need so much additional help and be unable to win when his teammates go down? Same with Lebron when AD goes down. I know this will probably get downvoted by fans of these guys but long story short, the Bucks stepped up when Giannis went down and PJ tucker really stepped up when Donte went down. Personally I dont think its fair to the bucks to make excuses for these teams that need multiple heathly MVP caliber players in order to compete when the Bucks overcame injuries themselves on their way to the title."
"Donte DiVincenzo is not on the one-name level, sorry. Like the guy, but that's a nope."
Players like Seth Curry and Donte DiVincenzo would also carry 16 seeds to natties in March Madness
"i dont think ive seen any reasonable non troll say the bucks would have gotten crushed. The bucks are a fucking good team. The suns are a different story, and while they deserved their berth in the finals too, we cant really just ignore the fact that every team they faced this playoffs, including the bucks, had a major injury on their squad.  If bucks had donte divincenzo, its possible that bucks sweep or win in 5, never mind lebron, ad, murray, kawhi, and the plethora of smaller injuries like kcp, schroder, caruso, michael porter jr., pj dozier, serge ibaka, ivica zubac all playing a factor. Suns were the best west team this year because they beat everyone else in the battle of healthiness this year. But its magnitudes easier for most fans to accept bucks as champions because they have proven their quality of team over a longer period of time"
"well, bam's elite defensively on the interior too ‚Äî in fact, he's the only good consistent interior defender IN miami. which is why him getting pulled out to the perimeter in the Spoelstra Switch offense is so painful. put him on the opposing team's best 3-Level Scorer and let him hound them, but the dude keeps getting switched onto like Donte Divincenzo and then Khris can pop a midrange over Duncan Robinson"
"This just in, Donte Divincenzo being injured is the same as Kyrie and Harden being injured."
"coming from a nova fan, the world keeps doing my boy donte dirty. i was gonna buy some form of memorabilia to commemorate him winning the title like i did for lowry and it was nigh on impossible to find smth where he was included. easier to find a divincenzo nova championship jersey."
"There are 16 players listed on the shirt. Donte Divincenzo should have been #17. Axel Toupane, a Two Way player, was included to further add to the ridiculousness of excluding Donte."
This is Donte Divincenzo erasure.
"I seem to recall that the NBA leader in 3P% was made redundant by the Bucks stifling defense. Or you think Joe Harris just decided to shoot Nets out of  the series by himself?   Re: Divincenzo, go check defensive rating for the last 2 seasons. Donte was in top 10 amongst ALL players before his injury.   Bucks are 6-4 against Nets this season. Harden played 4 of those games,  Kyrie played 6, KD played all.   Seems like Nets need all their 3 superstars at the same time to beat Giannis. What a shame."
"It's cause you are ignoring the Bucks side where they lost their starter, Donte DiVincenzo, which led to more Jeff Teague and Bryn Forbes minutes than they should've gotten"
"Are you really gonna whine that the Suns had bad injury luck? *Really?* Putting aside what if Donte DiVincenzo was also healthy and what that would have meant for Milwaukee, I mean, look at everyone else the Suns played and all the injuries their opponents had. Odds are Phoenix doesn't even make it out of the first round if LeBron and AD were 100%."
Still missing one of our starters‚Ä¶ Donte Divincenzo
Marcus Smart on the Bucks would be a good fit for Donte DiVincenzo
&gt; even in the current series if you have Saric healthy maybe the Suns win.   Keep in mind the Bucks are missing a starter in Donte DiVincenzo.
Donte Divincenzo literally does not exist
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."
Donte Divincenzo
Can't forget about 10th Team All Defense Donte DiVincenzo
Donte Divincenzo. His game would be better if he had more room to make mistakes and play through them so when he has an inconsistent start he can continue to work through it but in his current role it‚Äôs like why should he keep working through mistakes when you have Giannis And Khris to give the ball to.

"I think Donte DiVincenzo is a really unique player for a SG, mostly down to how he plays defense and the fact that he had the highest ORB% (% of offensive rebounds on the court that were gathered by that player) out of any shooting guard in the league, like around Russell Westbrook's number. In one of the regular season games against Brooklyn he finished with 10/15/2 as a 6'4 guard, and had as many offensive rebounds as the entire Nets team combined."
"Damn lol, shades of Skip saying Donte DiVincenzo had a higher NBA ceiling than Trae."
"Starters   PG Jrue   SG Grayson Allen  SF Middleton  PF Giannis   C BroLo   6th Bobby Portis   7th Divincenzo   8th Pat Connaughton   9th George Hill   10th Semi/Rodney Hood/Nwora  Situational Thanasis   Benchwarmers Mamu, Giorgos K  My thinking on Allen over Donte is offensive consistency and availability at the start of the year."
"2018 is much deeper. Luka, Ayton, Trae, JJJ, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Shai, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Donte DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent, and Shake Milton. All of them are at the minimum rotation level guys. There‚Äôs a lot of starting caliber players in there too and the top of the draft has some true stars."
Donte DiVincenzo
Oh well. Nets also faced a team without Jaylen Brown and then Donte DiVincenzo
James Worthy  Donte DiVincenzo  Bill Walton
Gonna do Current only  PG - Steph Curry  SG - Donte Divincenzo  F - Mikal Bridges   F - Luka Doncic  C - Joel Embiid
"For the DiVincenzo example - I would argue he doesn't need to anticipate the move, and it appears the NBA agrees (for now, lol). Donte has established his position. If Curry wants to jump back in to him, the NBA is saying the defender shouldn't be ""required"" to move. That's his space. He should ""stand is ground"" as it were, in that case, BECAUSE it is a better outcome for his team. Moving out of Steph's way (be it forward or backward) is not what the NBA appears to be requiring of defenders.  Steph is sort of pinned between Portis and Donte here. Whether that was planned or not, it's ""good"" defense because he has no room to shoot.  I think it's interesting that it is a foul call, that does seem like two people, with more or less established position, colliding. Which happens. Although I suppose they are calling Steph for throwing that shoulder a bit."
"they have both Donte DiVincenzo and Pat Connaughton, it should be enough for them lol"
"Bobby Portis and Semi Ojeleye are back tonight and will be playing; think that just leaves Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo on the injury list."
"I can see that happening if they decide that him as a bench scorer doesn‚Äôt help their team as much as other things, and I think Chicago has a really good opportunity to fill out their roster more with potential trade pieces like Coby, DJJ‚Äôs contract and that Blazers pick.

Holiday &amp; Brook Lopez &amp; Donte DiVincenzo
"Wasn't this guy a bench player before the donte divincenzo injury, he's not even that important to the bucks."
"Yeah, it was very narrative driven. PJ definitely provided some spark to the team, and mentality obviously is necessary to overcome two 0-2 series deficits, particularly against a team like Brooklyn. But had Divincenzo played, the Bucks defense would've been stronger as a whole and I don't think that game 7 is quite as close. The Suns series probably goes 5 games with Donte as well. PJ was abysmal against Book/CP3 and would've been on the bench had Donte played."
"its a good luxury for the Bucks between Grayson Allen and Donte DiVincenzo, they can alternate between both depending on who's shooting/defending well"
I'm just here to talk about Jordan Nwora  Donte DiVincenzo might be in trouble

Donte Divincenzo in shambles
"Kevin Love, Brandon Ingram, Isaacs, Gary Harris, Donte DiVincenzo"
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
Yeah I mean the nets were missing 2 of their 3 best players and the bucks were missing Donte divincenzo so that does seem like a fair comparison
He'd be Donte DiVincenzo generally. And even white donte gets it a little bit.
"There are a few things to consider though.   1. The Bucks were playing without Donte DiVincenzo for the entire playoffs, while Harden did play game 5-7.  2. After defeating the Nets, the Bucks just aint the same team anymore. You can tell from the finals series they played against the Suns, this team now has championship mentality.  3. Giannis is entering his absolute prime, hes only getting better. In the meantime, Durant and Harden become 1 year older, they aint going to play at the same level as last year even when healthy.  4. The Irving issue is a serious distraction and will demoralize the Nets team. I expect Irving to sit out the entire season, and maybe even retire, but the damage in the lockerroom is done and cannot be fixed.   But anyway, the notion of 'healthy nets' only exist in video games. If you look at their rosters, you see that almost half of the team are players made of glass. You cant fix durability in the same way that you cant fix lemon cars, these injury-prone players will get hurt anyway. Even if Irving is able to play the season, I dont expect him to stay healthy after 2 rounds of playoffs. KD isnt especially durable either, we will see if the level of performance he had last season was maintainable at all."
"Injuries are part of the game, Bucks played without Donte DiVincenzo for the entire playoffs."
Donte divincenzo
"I mean Giannis alluded to it. This the team that let brogdan walk. And traded down multiple time in the draft to save money and let Pg walk after winning a chip.    Imagine brook, Giannis , Middleton ,brogdan,jrue ,Pg tucker, donte divincenzo and Michael porter jr in the same team. This is what the bucks would be if they had other owners."
"Bucks have been missing 2 key players all year in Brook and Donte. Even so, the trio of Giannis/Jrue/Khris is 9-0 and on the same pace as the Warriors and Suns are right now.    Once Lopez is back our defense elevates to a top-2/3 level and we‚Äôll have a bench led by Portis/Connaughton/Divincenzo. That‚Äôs an insanely deep roster even if Boogie contributes absolutely nothing"
"Also his analysis just shows he has no idea what the team looks like in reality. If we adjust for Donte‚Äôs injury last playoffs this is the roster difference:   Lost: Tucker   Gained: Grayson Allen, Donte Divincenzo, Demarcus Cousins, Semi   That‚Äôs the gist of the changes unless I‚Äôm missing anyone. Grayson is okay on defense but including offense is way better than Tucker as an overall package. Donte was injured but is a pretty good defender/playmaker/occasional scorer. Not to mention Connaughton is playing out of his mind this season.   We‚Äôre 9-0 with the trio of Giannis/Khris/Jrue playing this year, and Brook was there for one of those games when we blew out the #1 seed Nets.    It‚Äôs early. But the Bucks are arguably looking *better* than last year with the roster changes. We haven‚Äôt even seen Boogie (or Brook really), if he‚Äôs even slightly okay for 15 minutes/gm then that‚Äôs a huge bench boost"
That's 2 time NCAA Champion Donte DiVincenzo.
Donte Divincenzo and Bobby Portis

I think Donte Divincenzo has a higher NBA ceiling than Trae young.
Do you think De‚ÄôAndre Hunter was really that much more important to the Hawks than Donte Divincenzo would have been?
"I think most people who have paid the slightest bit of attention to the Kings since Vlade's firing like what Monte has done so far. He engineered a couple trades that would have us in a much better spot if the deal hadn't fallen through last minute (Donte Divincenzo and the Lakers package for Hield that went to Washington instead) There's just so many people that treat the Kings like an irrelevant franchise forever stuck with terrible management because, well, they have been for 15 years. Nobody will change their mind until the team actually starts producing and maybe they shouldn't."
"it's good because the bucks are only _temporarily_ a bad team while all the other starters are out.  and now only brolo and donte divincenzo are still out, and donte might not be a starter anymore which means their bench is going to be even better than it was."
"Why is bol bol a strawman for the Poku example? They both had hype less because of skills, but because they both have extremely unique body types. They're both oddities in a league filled with 7+ footers. Caruso is an example I see in this thread being brought up, but he was more memed because of his looks. Donte Divincenzo is basically the same type of player as caruso with a fraction of the love or notoriety on here.  Is someone like Sabonis, who is an all star, really ever brought up on here? Vucevic as well. I feel most guys are brought up an adequate amount for their skill level. Do white stars like Luka, Jokic, Herro etc. get a little more love? I can see that. ""Infatuated"" is pretty hyperbolic IMO."
Bucks hitting their stride as they have had most of their rotation back (Brook Lopez and Donte Divincenzo aside).
"The potential interesting thread here for neutrals/casuals is what happens when DiVincenzo gets back. Donte is the incumbent starter but Grayson has been balling his ass off and we couldn‚Äôt reasonably remove him from that starting spot, so Donte will probably be coming off the bench.   Given Grayson already signed a two year extension and Donte is heading to RFA in the off-season coupled with Pat Connaughton also playing really well since last year‚Äôs playoffs, we‚Äôve got some interesting decisions to make."

It's becoming less differing as Grayson Allen is balling out but Donte DiVincenzo isn't a starting caliber player and he won't get his starting spot back at any point in the season when he returns from injury. He's just way too inconsistent on offense as opposed to Grayson Allen.
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
"Grayson Allen might overtake Donte Divincenzo starting spot even when Donte comes back. He can really shoot the ball and can do way more on offense than Donte.   His game really reminds me of Eric Gordon, despite all the cliche of JJ Redick comp (white SG from Duke) that people throw at him coming into the league"
He looks like Donte DiVincenzo

"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
We're actually moving closer to a lineup with:  Pat Connaughton  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Georgios Kalaitzakis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili  And that doesn't even include Donte DiVincenzo. Has anyone seen this lineup play in its entirety? Have they gotten 4 out of 5 of these guys?
"Jrue - Ankle sprain  Donte DiVincenzo - recovering from surgery after being injured during the playoffs  Middleton - Illness, unlikely COVID related  Lopez - Back soreness  Outside of the starters Portis and Semi are on minutes restrictions/played alternate games due to (I think) hamstring sprains"
"Bobby Portis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Donte Divincenzo are all out on a SEGABABA."
tbf the Bucks were playing without perennial mvp candidate donte divincenzo
