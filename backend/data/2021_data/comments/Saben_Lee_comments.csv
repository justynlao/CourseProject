The same way Saben Lee dropped to the 38th pick in the draft
That would be Saben Lee!
Thus begins the NBA legend of [Saben Lee](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leesa01.html)
"Just looked it up, and it turns out that Saben Lee will be the runner up for MIP in 2024 for the Nets. Book it."

Cory Joseph  I know we’re tanking but he very much did cost us a win. That and he’s taking a lot of minutes when we got Saben Lee who’s just earned more minutes with how well he’s played
"This is a bit off the beaten path, but 2nd round pick Saben Lee has actually looked like he will carve out a long NBA career as a solid backup PG in the mold of Ish Smith.  His stats are nothing phenomenal, but he has a feel for the game and tenacity in getting into the paint/defending that is really impressive."
Cory Joseph and Saben Lee
"Eh, it’s not rude to say that about a team that basically nobody other than devoted fans keeps track of. Well, for one Saddiq Bey is easily one of the top-5 rookies in this year’s draft class and is arguably the second best three point shooter in it after Haliburton, so that’s something pretty much every Pistons fan is excited about. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty exciting to watch for us as well because of his defensive-minded and aggressive style of play, which is pretty much the definition of Pistons basketball, he also shown flashes of outside shooting which would make him a really nice building block moving forward, oh and he’s 19 years old so he’ll have plenty of time to develop here. Hayes doesn’t look like much just yet, but he’s also nineteen, is already a decent playmaker, has good size and plenty of potential. We also have a bunch of young players who have a good chance to help the team in long term, like Diallo, Saben Lee and Josh Jackson(who is a Detroit native and has been playing his heart out for us) and a bunch of cheap guys that we took a flyer on who try their best to prove their worth as NBA players(DSJ, Cook, Okafor, also Josh Jackson is in this category as well), never mind Grant proving himself as an All-Star candidate level of player. Also for the first time since 2003 we have a good chance of getting a high pick in the next draft which already looks quite promising. Obviously it’s not the same as having Sexland and Allen as far as young cores and concerned, but Garland and Sexton weren’t exactly spectacular their first year either, were they? So yeah, for the first time in forever Pistons have a clear direction and a definitive young group of players to build with and it’s quite nice to watch for the franchise that’s been suffering through mediocrity for the last 13 years. We’re in a rebuild right now, but I’d argue watching this team has been the most fun I’ve had as a Pistons fan since what feels like forever."
"Saddiq bey, Isaiah Stewart, and saben lee. Killians been injured but he’s shown flashes of being a great defender and excellent passer. Not to mention whoever we take in the upcoming draft."

"**Killian Hayes** - started off slow, has looked like he has a much better pulse on our offensive movement since returning two games ago but still isn't scoring much. Really wish his success hadn't been tied to everyone's opinion of Kevin O'Connor because he's an extremely talented rookie who's been fine for what he was advertised, but because he isn't running away with RotY he's already been labeled a bust by some  **Isaiah Stewart** - was a fan favorite from day 1 for his hustle, but now his skill is starting to shine through and it's really exciting. He has shot 42% from deep (on limited attempts) and is above 50% from 10-16ft. His defensive hustle is insane (I believe he's leading rookies in Blocks per game) and he's a great offensive rebounder. He'll be fun to watch for a long time.  **Saddiq Bey** - came in as an NBA ready shooter (as advertised) but has shown a bit more ability than even that. He's put together a few moves with his back to the basket, can create his own 3 in a way that looks suspiciously identical to Wayne Ellington, and has put the ball on the floor as well. If he becomes a playmaker as well as a shooter, he should be a future all star.  **Saben Lee** - Isn't a revelation or anything but he looks like he'll last in the league which is pretty cool for a 2nd rounder. You can tell he's not comfortable with his shot but his ability to get to the rim and get fouled (or make the extra pass) has allowed him to stay on the floor. He also came very close to posterizing Vucevic so that was fun.  .  All in all, a pretty solid but VERY productive draft for Weaver's first year as GM. The future is exciting in Detroit."
Bey and Beef Stew both look like they're gonna be solid NBA players for a long time. Bey especially has been so nice  Killian just came back from injury and played his 9th game. Looks timid out there still and struggles to score but the defense looks good and his passing looks like it could be elite (see: lob to Diallo tonight)  Second rounder Saben Lee is going to make a great bench PG  Overall I think Weaver hit a solid triple in his first ever draft as our GM and has potential to be an all timer if Killian pans out as advertised
Saben Lee
"He’s just been out with a hip injury since seven games into the season. He had a rough start but showed promise in passing and defense. Bey, Stewart, Saben Lee, and even other young pickups like Diallo and DSJ had been showing out so Hayes just isn’t getting much attention"
&gt;Saben Lee  you had me untill Saben. He's not a top 10 in the league yet. He'll be #1 one day tho.
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
"Pistons with Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Saben Lee, Killian Hayes, and one of Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Evan Mobley is a budding dynasty"

I’ll try for our team:  • Jerami Grant • Mason Plumlee • Saddiq Bey • Isaiah Stewart • Wayne Ellington • Dennis Smith Jr. • Saben Lee • Josh Jackson • Frank Jackson • Rodney Mcgruder
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."

Saben lee
Saben Lee szn
Saben lee has played pretty great for 2nd rounder
"The Pistons have one of the most pitiful rosters I have ever seen. Most of these guy’s shouldn’t even be seeing playing time. Plumlee, Ellington, and Wright are starting and they should be in the 10-15 range on the bench. Who the hell is Saben Lee? That franchise is a disgrace."
Saben Lee
"Seems like a win-win then. Our 3 uninjured rookies have all looked great. Bey has made the most noise, but we LOVE Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee has been really good now that he's in the rotation. He's going to have a good game tonight on NBATV against the Nets, and everyone's going to be like ""What's a Saben Lee, and why does he keep getting to the basket?!"""
And Saben Lee
I just wanna see Saben Lee ball out
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven’t seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I’m not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we’ve played a lot better than our record so I’m optimistic for the first time in a long time."
"Saben Lee should be higher on the Kia Rookie Ladder with his cool 11.0 assists per 100 over nearly the same amount of games as LaMelo.      Ball is an indisputably great passer playing PG, I don't see what that has to do with comparing shooting efficiency with a SG."

Can we talk about Saben Lee I think more people should talk about Saben Lee
Shit when was the last time four rookies were the top scorers for a team? Saben Lee was fourth tonight with 13.
What do you expect out of rookies?  That's actually a genuine question. I don't have any clue how anyone would answer that.  I don't expect out of Lamelo what I expect out of Wiseman what I expect out of Killian what I expect out of Poku what I expect out of Saben Lee what I expect out of Mason Jones.  I can't believe you've put any thought into that question whatsoever.

"[Pistons youth movement is genuinely exciting](https://twitter.com/RedAlternates/status/1387929113252405248?s=20):  - They have a bonafide interior threat big who covers a crazy amount of space on defense and is showing some 3pt shooting chopps in Stewart (19yo)  - They have a sharpshooting wing with great awareness and on ball D who is showing some ability to take the ball to the hoop and use his strength to finish in Bey (22yo)  - They have a stellar passing PG with incredible vision and great on-ball and help D in Killian (19yo)  - They have a raw project with Siakim-esque upside in Sekou (20yo)  - They have an athletic, sharpshooting bench sparkplug with HoF tier hair in Frank Jackson (22yo)  - And they have two athletic, multi-tool bench wings who play hard nosed defense in Josh Jackson (24yo) and Hamidou Diallo (22yo)  That's 6 players 22 or younger who could have lasting roles in Weaver's restoration (4 of whom are more or less locks) without counting Saben Lee or our 2021 pick. For context, before the moratorium lifted last fall, the only player on the team under 22yo was Sekou. Just an insane transformation in only 6 months."
Yeah it's annoying. So may people who have never watched a single Pistons' game try to act like their opinions are somehow correct. Like I guarantee 70% of this sub doesn't knkw Saben Lee is.
"Dwaynes really not going to give any minutes to saben lee? want in the fuck, corey joseph ain't in your future you old fool"
Why is saben lee not in the MVP conversation?
"Idk if anyone else experiences this but, in some simulations in 2k myleague, Saben Lee averages like 18+ppg 5+assist  off the bench and is top 5 in ROTY and 6MOTY. Never even heard of him until the sims and now this is the first time I've seen his name mentioned outside of 2k"
We had 3 in the top 10 a few months ago! Saben Lee joined this group
He won't last much longer with hungry young lions like Saben Lee and Gabriel Deck gunning for their time in the spotlight.
Saben Lee 💪
Saben Lee punching air rn
This year's Pistons rookie crop is super cool. Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart are my favorite rookies in *yearrrrrs*. Then there's Killian and Saben Lee to boot.
I mean this isn't even close to true. You think Nico Mannion is better than Cade Cunningham right now? Or Saben Lee is better than Jalen Suggs?
"My ideal starting 5 for this necessary tank game:  \-Jahlil Okafor  \-Corey Joseph  \-Saben Lee  \-Tyler Cook  \- Servydis Deividas  Just run them for the whole game, that should do it."
"He wasn't good with Detroit? How about Detroit wasn't good with him? Especially with the way the coach told him he has just as good as a shot there then New York. With that attitude no wonder the pistons are doing horrible. Coach needs to pick that team up. Easily was the best PG dare I say player for Detroit in his short time there especially when you look at the PG depth for Detroit and they just have Killian Hayes, Cory Joseph, saben lee and Frank jackson  . Rose has been putting up numbers all besides the Cavs season. But I will agree he's been playing phenomenal with the Knicks. But I'll end this on a note that if you haven't been following rose since the bulls traded him to New York originally then you've been vastly missing out on the Renaissance of a man coming back to form when all seemed to give up on him."
"There is absolutely no way I am taking RJ Hampton over Deni Avdija. Deni is the youngest player in the class and has been utilized in a really poor way by Brooks. Isaiah Stewart should also be above Hampton, he's been excellent this season.  Definitely would take Quickley over Okoro/Poku. He's shown way too much as a contributor on a playoff team already. Also probably a couple guys to take over Nwora including Jae'Sean Tate and Saben Lee"

*Four rookies.  Saben Lee was a fucking steal in the second round.
"OKC has the best player in Shai, Dort is really good, and obviously a ton of picks.  However, I believe the Pistons have the better overall prospects and potential/fit as a team. Bey and Stewart already proved as rookies that they are very valuable players in the modern NBA. Killian Hayes still has a ton of potential. Obviously Cade coming in is a great prospect. He could be a superstar very soon. Even Sekou is still an unknown at still 20 years old. Then you throw in Saben Lee who surprised as a 2nd round point guard, and 3 second round picks this year (37, 42, 52) which could be packaged along with a player to move back into the first, this Pistons have quite a collection of solid young players. Plus Jerami Grant is the best of both teams veterans, and fits perfectly with the young core.   So basically at this time I'd say the Pistons will be better sooner. Now this can obviously change if Cade busts, the Pistons rookies from last year don't really improve at all, the Thunder hit on a few draft picks, package them for a legit star, or outright win the lottery, Poku actually becomes a good/great player, or if there are injuries, etc."
"Delon Wright was traded at the deadline,  the likely starting lineup will be  Hayes Cunningham Bey Grant Stewart   with a mix off the bench of: mason plumlee, saben lee, josh/frank jackson, and a likely late first rounder as the pistons will probably try to trade back up with their 3 seconds"
"I think Weaver wouldn’t care too much for picks 23/24 and would rather pick up future picks. Our roster is already at 9 guaranteed spots, plus Cook who will definitely be guaranteed, and then bringing back Hamidou Diallo and Saben Lee, possibly Frank Jackson too. You’d be at 12 roster spots with picks 2, 23, 24, plus three second rounders, which obviously does not work."
yh unlikely for sekou but hayes looked good to end the year and dsj is probably gone i don't think he counts replace him with saben lee and even tho their team not that good they shouldn't sign derozan imo he just slows down their development
"There definitely was more than that. Stewart, Killian Hayes, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee, Hamidou Diallo, and Josh Jackson all showed reasons to be excited."
"Yeah I picked Bey up off the waiver wire. It was awesome. I had so many good waiver wire plays. Being in a deep league is way more fun because you have to watch the 12th man on the bench and injuries more.  Bey, Diallo, Kaminsky had a good run for me, Cam Payne, Bismack had a few decent games, Moses Brown, Kenrich Williams, Saben Lee"
"Dame to Detroit. Portland gets Plumlee, Jahlil Okafor, and Saben Lee. No take backs. /s"
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don’t have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn’t in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we’d be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it’d also depend on who else is taken. I don’t believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"What are you talking about? We have a center that just made all-rookie, and we only have 2 point guards: Killian Hayes and Saben Lee. Hardly guys you don’t draft Cade for. Fuck them picks I want the superstar prospect"
"Why would the Pistons do this, they lose 27 year old Jerami Grant for 32 year old Bledsoe, who is a much worse player.  Just to take a flyer on a #10 pick who will be a crapshoot instead of proven commodity like Grant?  And Bledsoe is not cracking the Pistons starting lineup with Cade/Killian and won't even be a top player off their bench with Plumlee, Frank Jackson, Hamadou Diallo all above him...not too mention they need to give time to Sekou and Saben Lee, etc.  This trade makes the Pistons much worse."
DSJ is probably gone I'd bet. Pistons will probably prioritize re-signing Diallo and hopefully sign Frank Jackson and Saben Lee to guaranteed deals as both were on 2-way contracts last season and played very well.
"I'm jealous of detroit now, bey a sharp shooter 3 guy, Killian hates, saben Lee, Stewart looks incredible, now Cade. Even doumbouya has potential. Might be missing someone else. How is there defense"
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
Debatably fourth saben lee played well
"Hell of a lot of players 23 and under:   Cade, Hayes, Bey, Stew, Diallo, Doumbouya, Saben Lee, DSJ."
"Not the best, but will be most entertaining team next season for sure.  Saben lee, Stewart, Bey, Hayes, cade, sekou, Pistons may have drafted themselves a serious contender"
"Pistons roster has 2 top ten rookies, another rookie in Killian who looks very promising and a very solid player in Jerami Grant. Not to mention other high potential guys who fly under the radar, Sekou, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee and Hami Diallo. Pistons are in a pretty good start 1 year into the new front office regime."
"Nah, he doesn't fit our timeline. Especially with how we are (or should be) prioritising developing Hayes and Saben Lee as our PGs of the future, having Kemba here would just suck away their time on the court and hinder their development. Other than Grant, there really shouldn't be any 'big name' vets on our team taking up starter minutes."
I can help you with Detroit   Casey is the HC  Bey Grant  Beef stew  Cojo  Plumdog  Hayes  Saben lee   Hope that helps if anyone asks
"It’s actually 4, Saben Lee looks like he could be a backup PG right now lol. He’s just been hurting for mins bc he’s behind CoJo/Hayes in the depth chart and we gave DSJ burn to see what we had in an expiring. Insane draft overall for us"
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"
Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
Saben Lee
I think Saben Lee could be like a more athletic Lou Williams. Maybe not a super star. But I think he could be a 6MOTY candidate for a long time
"Appreciate the work put into this. It’s a very well written and organized oc. And I agree JT’s next step would ideally be developing his playmaking.  I do struggle with what/how much to take from the stats given where certain other players are ranked. JT posts up twice a game so didn’t look into that one too much but the others all had some results that made me hesitant to put too much weight in them as a proxy for playmaking.  Luka’s tied with Dame for 20th highest assist% off drives (over 10 drives per game). Jaylen’s 24th. Love JB but his playmaking’s nowhere near theirs. Saben Lee, Kemba, Delon Wright, and Fultz rank 4th, 12th, 15th, and 17th and they all, plus Rozier, also outrank Doncic in pass% off drives (Harden’s 27th of 56th in that one, just above Siakam). Jokic isn’t top 10 in potential assists. Schroder’s ahead of Steph and .1 behind Jrue, closer than Jrue is to any of the 28 guys ahead of him. D’Lo’s assist% is better than the majority of guys with over 25 usg% including Giannis, Ja, Steph, DeMar and Shai.   Other metrics put JT in a better light but not sure how much to take from them either. These from Bball index were from the end of april so might’ve changed a bit but that’s most of the season still. Of nba starting forwards, he was 10th in pass creation volume, 6th in pass creation quality, 1st in scoring gravity, 9th in playmaker rating, 7th in passes made, and 14th in assists per game. On his team, he was 1st in pass frequency, 2nd in passes per game, 3rd in assists per game, 3rd in pass creation volume, and 2nd in playmaker rating.   Info and definitions for above stats at https://www.bball-index.com/glossary/"
"I feel like if that were the case, they would have actually let Cade touch the ball when Saben Lee or Hayes was on the court. Sitting him in the corner is infuriating."
"Our backcourt was a mess. Easily the worst backcourt in the league. Revolving door of players. Some Killian, some D Rose, some Delon Wright, some Cory Joseph, some Saben Lee, some Frank Jackson, some Josh Jackson, some Diallo, and even a little McGruder.     If I had to guess, I would say that Wright got the most starts at PG, and Josh Jackson got the most starts at SG. I could totally be wrong, but I watched literally every game, and I'm not sure without looking it up. So, I fault absolutely no one for not being up on all that mess.  Cade solidifies one of the positions, but we're still looking for someone to step up and claim the other guard spot. Beef Stew (or maybe Olynyk) will fill out the C position now that Plumlee was moved."
"&gt;and we won't have great shooting.  You can't judge regular season shooting off of Summer League (with guys like Sirvidys &amp; Cook who won't be on the roster) and guys like Saben Lee who are spending most of their team in the G-League.  The Pistons should have excellent shooting from Cade, Frank Jackson, Bey, Grant, Olynyk.   They should also have some average shooting options with Lyles &amp; Garza.  Hamidou Diallo remains a question, because if he can shoot that really rounds out the rotation with shooting at every position."
"Absolutely. Sekou is really disappointing so far. He's still so young but this is going to be his third year. He gets such great looks and still can't hit them.  Saben Lee is going to average like 10mpg though. If we do run 3 guard lineups, it'll be with Corey Joseph and we better let Cade run point in those situations."
he spent half the game as a post up shooter with saben Lee and Killian Hayes ball handling. why? I do not know
"Meh. A lot of these are just SL roster things. Beef Stew opens up his driving a lot more than Cook's screens do, and Saben Lee isn't going to be allowed to dominate the ball during the real season.  Cade looked really good tonight, particularly on defense."
Bruh hes running SABEN LEE as our main playmaker WITH CADE ON THE FLOOR
"we suck too, Dudes airballing everything, and Cook shiting in everything.  Yeah but definitely a shit coach, 3 guards lineup dont worked, failed v OKC failed today  But worst, with 3 guards, coach Make FUCKING SABEN LEE the playmaker, and Hayes Cade going off ball"
It's like Saben Lee was actively trying to deny him the ball. He wasn't doing anything intelligent with it.
Where does Saben Lee fit there? They shared the court for at least 5 minutes and he hardly looked for Cade
"Fuck that Saben Lee ball stopping shit, and that Killian Hayes secondary ball handler shit. Just give Cade the ball."
"Saben lee fearless. He tries this stuff on centers, usually gets rejected but still nice to see regardless"
Saben Lee fast as shit
That’s the 3rd time now Saben Lee has gone into a pick and roll with no intention of finding his center
"Nope Detroit has 7   Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Jerami Grant, Sekou Doumbouya, Saben Lee, and Isaiah Stewart."
Because not enough people will know [what you're talking about](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/delon-wright-hilariously-caught-saben-lee-in-4k/)...
It’s a bot. And saben Lee showed legit promise last year casual
Nobody Doesn't Like Saben Lee
Saben Motherfucking Lee
"Cade - 19  Killian - 20  Beef Stew - 20  Sekou - 20  Balsa - 21  Saben Lee - 22  Bey - 22  Garza - 22  Livers - 23  Frank Jackson and Hamidou Diallo are both 23, and likely to be re-signed as well. If we are counting two-way guys Chris Smith is 21."
I think you need some experience to help the younger guys out. I imagine both saben lee and cojo will play decent amount of minutes   I have seen a lot of pistons news being linked to guards which is interesting
Kind of surprised to see CoJo would be interested in returning back to the team that cut him. He was overpaid yeah but he's put up solid stats on solid efficiency for the past few years.  I'm also surprised that Detroit is interested in having him back - I know they're kind of high on Saben Lee.
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
"I mean he nailed his first draft like i said tf. Two NBA All-Rookie team members, Killian Hayes who looked good after his injury, and Saben Lee who played really well for a second round pick."
"Killian hayes had a weird season due to first no offseason then getting injured. But he def showed flashes of what he’s capable of, and some of his best games playing side by side with saben lee, another pg.   Passing is great already and will probably be his best skill always. His pick and roll passing is good and his defense is already solid as well. It’s great cause a pairing of him and Cade at guard will be so large. Also, he’s a good rebounder for a guard.   Where he needs most work is in scoring. If he can improve his shooting numbers it’ll benefit him a lot. Also, he’s not the best driver last season as he clearly favored his left hand. Also, in pick and roll he needs to be more aggressive in driving the ball. I think the coaches emphasized that and he improved a little bit towards the end last year, but there were still some times where he would go off a screen and drive and then back up from the paint looking to pass instead of just driving and scoring.   Overall, I’m excited to watch him cause he’s a fun player for sure. I think hell benefit playing with someone like Cade, which will also force him to improve his other skills in order to successfully play off ball with him. He’s stated multiple times last season he loved playing with another pg on the court so I’m excited to see him grow"
"Kenyon Martin Jr, Nico Mannion, Saben Lee, Xavier Tillman and Theo Maledon all got minutes last season"
"On one of the worst teams in the league you'd hope a second rounder could show you something, because they likely will get the chance to prove themselves. Saben Lee was our 2nd rounder last year and he got an opportunity and he impressed, now he's on a guaranteed contract. Sekou had the opportunity in Detroit and didn't impress enough."
Amp Lee pops of Saben
We were a Saben Lee of a win against Bulls.  NEVER again falling for French prospect hype or analyst hype  Weaver was high on Pat Will and Halliburton and messed up choosing Hayes
"Pistons. They have Jerami Grant (MIP runner up) and Cade (#1 pick) plus a nice core of second year guys: Saddiq B3y, beef stew, Hayes, and Saben Lee"

"Sadly not, no Saddiq or Killian either for Detroit. A lot of Saben Lee though!"
"He’s had two drafts, of the 8 guys he’s drafted only 1 player was of that mold (Saben Lee)"
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
I compared Saben Lee to Ja Morant lol
saben lee is not better you really do not watch LOL
the guy is a bad help defender lol. he’s ok on ball but he looks lost out there. It’s crazy because if you watched his film you could see he literally didn’t excel at a single basketball skill to a NBA level. Huge whiff of a pick. But this is the same FO that picked Sekou Doumbouya so i guess it’s expected. Saben Lee is better and should start over him.
"Don't want to be a debbie downer, but that's really not a good enough game by G League standards to warrant posting here lol. For comparison, Saben Lee in his first 3 games put up 42/8/8, 33/2/9, and 40/5/9 and he's barely NBA level at this point."
Killian already starts over him though. We want Saben Lee getting minutes over CoNo the geriatric turnover machine
"Saben Lee?  Frank?   Josh?   There are multiple people other than just Killian we would prefer over Cojo.   Also Killian is only benched because he's injured, not the guy we are asking to be given more minutes."
Saben Lee? No way he’s mini Westbrook
So is Saben Lee.  Doesn’t mean Killian isn’t complete trash
"Fast break into a contested Saben Lee turn around jumper. I like that Cade is trying to make the right play and involve teammates, but I would love if he just took over and finished it himself."
Casey won’t call up and play Saben Lee
"I think Saben Lee can have an Ish Smith kind of career as a solid back up, with clear limitations but who sticks around."
"1. Cade  2. Grant  3. Bey  4. Stewart  5. Killian  6. Dialo  7. Josh Jackson  8. Kelly Olynk  Saben Lee, could take Josh's spot. I'm undecided there"
Sorry. The Pistons are idiots. They have a potential all time great but they are wasting his prime by forcing him to stay in the G league. If they were smart they would build their roster around him and LET SABEN LEE COOK. If they aren't going to play him they should trade him so that man doesn't waste his prime on a team that isn't trying to win games.
Whatever you say Saben Lee
the guy is averaging 30/7/8 with 2 steals if i was Saben Lee i’d be advertising myself as well
Nice try Saben Lee
"Lmao fuck nooo we literally traded C Wood for the #16 pick, Stew   Y’all can have Saben Lee for a competent young point guard tho (or Hayes)"
For the Sixers getting Jerami Grant and Saben Lee or something would be a solid return because the value is only tanking from here
He's in the g league but for the pistons it has to be saben lee.
"The more I thought about it I think gap between Grant and Simmons is bigger than I was giving Ben credit for earlier. Grant turns 28 in March, his numbers are massively inflated and still aren’t too impressive, and he’s probably near his peak. His trade value is likely never going to be higher than it is right now, but he’s still nowhere near as good as Simmons. If the Pistons are serious about acquiring him, they will need to be open up to letting go of Bey because it’s doubtful Morey makes the trade without him.   But I was thinking about Hayes and Stewart when I wrote that. Hayes makes sense as we really need a facilitator, but he’s been awful so far so I doubt Morey wants him. Stewart doesn’t really make sense with Embiid and has been underwhelming this season. They have a lot of other young players like Saben Lee, both Jackson’s, Diallo, and some other guys that I have no idea who they are honestly. The ones I named are probably not good enough prospects but maybe somebody else is."
"Cade had a great game, and I'm happy to see Saben Lee again."
Yet you have Pistons fans wanting Casey fired because Saben Lee isn’t getting back-up minutes 12 games into the season
"Cory Joseph  Our teams ass in general but man he's done a 180  Last year we hated him cause he kept playing too good almost winning us games. This year he's been ass when Saben Lee, who's been averaging 30+ points in the gleague so far, could be coming off the bench getting more NBA minutes in"
Saben Lee&gt;
I'm pretty sure Lyles will slide up and play backup C with Hamidou Diallo or Saben Lee reentering the rotation.
I rather Saben Lee get the mins
Sam Hauser  Bol Bol  Saben Lee  Usman Garuba  Yves Pons  Paul Reed  Jalen Smith  Joe Wieskamp (should not be on a two-way)  Malachi Flynn
"Saben Lee dropped 42/8/8 in his first G League game, he has no business being there. Fuck Cory Joseph FREE SABEN LEE"
"Cory Joseph  Disliked him last year for playing too well off the bench frequently almost getting us wins when we wanted to lose.  Now i dislike him cause he hasnt been as good as he was last year and is eating up minutes i'd like to see Saben Lee get.  No hate though, seems like a good vet presence and liked by the squad. I just wanna see a sophomore develop at the nba level"
Saben Lee and Cojo are 2 totally different guys. Saben isn't really a point guard from what I've seen. He is a scoring guard. The second unit doesn't need a guy who can't facilitate or stretch the floor.
Saben Lee is a decent player
Saben Lee is sitting on the bench for no reason. I can't believe we play Corey Joseph over him. Lee is a good player. He scored over 20 3 or 4 times last year in limited minutes. He has a great first step a plenty of bounce. Free Saben Lee!
Saben Lee isn't bad though
"Saben Lee is probably far better rn than any player found on Kansas State, Northwestern, Arizona State, Wake Forest, Missouri, Creighton or approximately 300 other top collegiate division programs."
"Pistons need to call up Saben Lee, at least he is quick and can get a defense to rotate.  Pistons just look so slow on offense, nobody gets any separation.  I think they gotta try pushing tempo a bit too, cause their halfcourt offense isn't getting it done."
"Saddiq, Stewart, Cade, Hayes, Saben Lee."
"Someone needs to intervene and stop him from deploying these rotations. Even if Killian is complete shit, they would be better off running Saddiq as the primary ball handler and getting more minutes for Pickett or Saben Lee. There is literally nothing to gain from these games where Cory Joseph plays 20+ minutes."
He is better rn than Saben Lee and Hayes   Sad
"Because we have the worst point guard rotation an NBA team has fielded in years. Killian, Corey Joseph, Saben Lee"
"I think it was always a deep draft. A lot of guys have came in and helped their teams, even some late picks second rounders.   Pritchard has been great for the Celtics. Theo Maledon has looked very good. Xavier Tillman and Desmond Bane are effective rotation players and spot starters for a .500 team. Immanuel Quickley looks like he's gonna be a very good player. Isaiah Joe from Philly is still very raw but when they needed a shooter to insert into the lineup he played generally well.   And then I think there's quite a couple more second rounders who will become solid rotation players. Saben Lee has had some good flashes for Detroit, Paul Reed is tearing up the  G League for Philly.   All of those guys picked 20+, and then add on Wiseman, Patrick Williams, Lamelo, Halibuton with all-star potential and then Bey, Achiuwa, Maxey from non-lottery picks showing future starter ability. It's a good draft, and there's always going to be late bloomers as well"
"Absolutely not lol. The Pistons are a team that competes very hard. They are just so young and untalented. After grant and Wright, they are heavily relying on DSJ, Josh Jackson, Saben Lee, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart. 2 of those guys were busts and the other 3 are rookies. And that’s after losing Blake to a buy out and Rose to a trade. No coach is winning with a roster like that.   Compare that with their neighbors in the standings like the Magic, Timberwolves, Kings, Pelicans, Wizards, Rockets, etc who in my opinion who have much more talented rosters but are performing worse based on their expectations."
"At least this will be a loss to a worthy opponent. I can't believe we got tripled doubled by both Plumlee and DSJ, allowed 8 threes by Wayne Ellington, and let Rodney fucking McGruder and Saben Lee (whoever the fuck that is) each drop 20"
Saben Lee is looking like an absolute steal. Would be amazing if him and DSJ can become our PG rotation and Killian can take the 2 guard spot when he comes back
"Saben Lee has been extremely good since he has gotten minutes. Ellington has been a consistent sharpshooter, he’s been in a slump recently (25% in last 10 games) but he is still at over 40% on the year. MacGruder is just out of nowhere lol"
If you knew the Pistons roster they probably would've been your guess with Blake out. Saben Lee maybe but nobody else stuffs the box score like that.
Saben Lee doesn't play like a rookie second rounder.
Saben Lee about to go crazy 😜
"Overrated: Plumlee. Everyone thought Weaver was crazy for signing him but he has kept us be relatively competitive while tanking. And he got his first triple double!  Underrated: Saben Lee. Hes put up some good numbers lately but he still has a lot to show and has been very aggressive at the rim which is refreshing considering how Killian Hayes, who was supposed to be in Lee's spot at this time in the season, performed."
"i got to watch him play a lot at vandy and i can tell you this: of all the vandy players i have personally watched, no one can get to the rim as easily as saben lee. everything else was kind of a question mark which is why he went in the 2nd round but he has looked GOOD in detroit so far"
go back and watch Vanderbilt vs Alabama last year - Saben Lee vs Kira Lewis was one of the best PG duels in college bball
Imagine having to go against Saben Lee. Couldn't be me.

Maybe until Delon Wright or Hayes comes back. Saben Lee is on a two-way contract at the moment so he might be a good pick up now but not for the rest of the season.
I missed the game but I noticed my Pistons folks making a ruckus about Saben Lee. His box score looks agreeable.
I don't know who Saben Lee is but he's now the ROTY front runner no bias

Saben Lee. Pistons second round pick.
Magic ain’t ready for the PG rotation of DSJ/Saben Lee
"I just love how even the Detroit Pistons were like “Yeah, no” and immediately dropped Bradley after getting him and Saben Lee for the GOAT Cash Considerations. Considering we’re giving fucking DSJ a chance, it speaks volumes about how shit Bradley is lol"
Matching up against Rodney McGruder and Saben Lee all night will do that to ya.
"Hayes has been out indefinitely since early Jan with a labral tear. Without him and Rose our PGs are Delon Wright, Frank Jackson, &amp; 2nd round rookie Saben Lee. He'll get plenty of minutes."
"This is LeBron James, not Saben Lee. He's probably the 3rd most popular NBA guy next to MJ and Kobe and is in argument for most influential. One of the biggest argument against LBJ GOAT status was his lack of rings so if he gets 10 rings while having 50 PPG in this era, he's definitely a GOAT to probably a majority of fans.   being an NBA icon does not mean that they are the GOAT lol"
